But the softly spoken 77-year-old lights up when given the definition from Wikipedia: a literary, artistic and social movement that envisions and works towards actualising a sustainable future interconnected with nature and community.Solar refers not just to renewable energy but to an optimistic, anti-dystopian vision of the future. Punk is an allusion to its countercultural, do-it-yourself ethic.“That’s us!” says Smart, a retired mechanical engineer. “I never knew there was a word for it. I guess I’ve been a punk all along.”Smart is giving a tour of his 110-hectare (272 acres) eco community on Australia’s Gold Coast, right on the southern border between Queensland and New South Wales. This weekend, the residents will celebrate the 20th anniversary of its foundation, though no one is sure how many people live there today. The last census was taken in 2017 and Smart estimates about 500 people call the village home.View image in fullscreenA sign outside the cafe in Currumbin Ecovillage banning dogs because of the danger they present to native wildlife.In the 13 years since he and his wife, Susan, moved in, Smart says all kinds of people have made their home here at one time or another. There are retirees like themselves, young families, movie stuntmen, journalists, children from wealthy families, Buddhist monks, composers and the odd recluse looking for privacy.“This is the way people should be living,” says Smart. “You know, you can live in a suburb and you don’t know your neighbours. People drive into their homes, lock the garage door. Here everyone knows each other. Everyone helps keep an eye on the kids.”It takes all types to make a village, he says. Just about the only creatures not welcome in this one are cats and dogs. Currumbin Ecovillage was conceived as a wildlife sanctuary and corridor for native Australian animals. A cat or dog may be another member of the family but they are also hungry carnivores, lethal predators and territorial animals that havesignificant environmental and climate impacts. For a community built around meeting the needs of humans and nature, there was no room for feline and canine friends, even on a temporary visit. Smart says: “Dogs are nice and very loyal and everything. We do miss having a dog but that’s the price we’re prepared to pay.”View image in fullscreenA wallaby and her joey find some shade in Currumbin Ecovillage, which is also home to kangaroos and koalas as well as echidnas and platypuses.It is a rule the community has learned to be firm about – certified service animals excepted – especially among people visiting the cafe. There is no shortage of animal friends in the village, Smart says. It is built on the site of an old dairy farm – the milking shed is now a community centre and library – and a reforestation effort has brought back native wildlife. Mobs of wallabies and kangaroos wander the village at will. Frogs, snakes and birds also make it their home along with bandicoots, koalas, echidnas and platypuses. Some residents keep pigs, goats and chickens.The village has imposed other constraints to help achieve a sustainable life. At first, new homes had to meet certain demands about orientation, design and the proportion of recycled materials. Each had to supply its own power and water with solar panels and rainwater tanks. The newest buildings do not always meet these standards because the original developer went bust in the 2008 financial crisis and its successors have had a different approach. However, the commitment to sustainable living is still strongly encouraged.As an “intentional community”, Currumbin Ecovillage is a contemporary spin on an old idea. Rob Doolan, a town planner for 45 years, has worked with more than 120 such communities over his career. The idea for planned and collectively managed communities began with hippy communes that formed after the 1973 Aquarius festival in Nimbin, over the border in New South Wales. Some of those who came for the party stayed and found that pooling their limited resources together allowed them to buy large tracts of land by shared title.Often these properties were struggling dairy farms where the rainforest had been cleared to leave a mostly barren landscape. The catch was that sharing title was illegal, which made getting a loan difficult. The sheer number trying this approach eventually led to legal, regulatory and financial change, paving the way for Currumbin and similar communities such as Jindibah, outside Byron Bay in New South Wales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They have a management structure, a shared financial structure. Of course, there is the old joke that the biggest problem with intentional communities is they also involve dealing with other people.”View image in fullscreenThe noticeboard in the community centre lays down the rules for communicating with other residents.When it comes to decision making, personality clashes and relationship problems can come into play, but Smart says this is true of any human endeavour. Working together, Currumbin villagers replaced their A$2m (£1m) wastewater treatment plant, which allows for the re-use of water for non-consumption and ensures the village remains self-reliant. Down the track they may take on other projects including a solar farm and community batteries.Everyone in Currumbin pitches in. Smart helps teach woodworking skills and runs three community garden spaces where all the produce goes to OzHarvest, a charity that helps unhoused people and others in need.Every Friday, people head down to the cafe for happy hour, and when a new baby is born – there was a home birth a fortnight ago – the residents rally round to make the family’s meals for two weeks. These are the things that, Smart says, make it worth living here: “It’s not about the structures, it’s about the people.”Explore more on these topicsEthical and green livingThe alternativesConservationWildlifeCommunitiesDogsSolar powerRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Put not your trust in Nigel. For in him there is no salvation.It’s not easy beingRichard Tice. A man who has spent much of his recent life in Nigel Farage’s shadow. Pushed around. Made to feel worthless. Losing what self-respect he may have had by the day.Before the last election campaign began, Dicky had been the leader of Reform. A party that had been going nowhere very much under his charisma-free control. Dicky would speak and no one would listen. Then Nige decided to rise from the dead. To elbow Dicky aside. No consultation. No apology. Dicky was told to consider himself lucky he had been demoted to the near meaningless title of deputy leader.All of which Dicky duly did. He sucked it up. Because that was always the nature of their relationship. Nigel first, Dicky nowhere. It’s almost painful to watch them together sometimes. The desperation in Tice’s eyes. His gratitude when Farage stops ignoring him and deigns to condescend to him instead.Dicky has learned to feed on scraps. You can see his desire to ride the Nige wave. To pick up whatever crumbs might come his way. He longs to be Farage’s shadow chancellor designate. Dreams of living next door to him in Downing Street. But Nigel can’t even give him that. Can’t offer him the satisfaction of knowing he figures in his plans.For months Nige has been playing Dicky off against his other Reform wannabe, Zia Yusuf. Leaving each one to guess who is most in favour. A fight to the death. It would be very on brand for Farage to eventually decide to disappoint both of them by giving the job to the latest ex-Tory derelict to defect, the half-witted Jonathan Gullis. Leaving Tice to gently sob himself to sleep on his regular trips to Dubai to see his girlfriend. At times like this, sharia law can be a great comfort.Yet the worse Nige treats Dicky, the more needy Dicky becomes. And on the Today programme on Thursday we reached a new nadir. The point where he would say anything – ANYTHING – to defend his leader. All the while knowing that if the roles were reversed, Farage wouldn’t hesitate to drop him at a moment’s notice. Safe to say, this was 10 minutes of life that Tice would not be saving for his showreel.The interview began benignly enough with Emma Barnett quizzing him for Reform’s response to the government’s decision to cancel four mayoral elections until 2028. Dicky was unimpressed. And fair enough. Labour’s argument that it wasn’t technically a cancellation as these were inaugural elections always looked like semantic spin. And taking another two years to agree the financial package and the necessary statutory instruments sounded like an administration on cruise control.This was all a plot to stop Reform. A denial of democracy. Given that all the other local elections were going ahead as planned in 2026, this sounded like a conspiracy theory too far. Mistaking incompetence for something deliberate. “It’s only dictatorships that cancel elections,” Tice suggested.Barnett’s ears picked up at the word dictator. Funny he should mention that. But didn’t Farage have a relationship with Hitler, she said. In a manner of speaking. While at school hadn’t 20 or more other pupils heard him make jokes about the gas chambers? That Hitler was right and putting black students in detention for the hell of it was just laughs?“It’s all absolute made-up twaddle,” said Tice. Everyone waslying through their teeth just to discredit Farage. Nige was a much-wronged Messiah. He would never have said anything like that. Even though he had previously admitted he might indeed inadvertently have said things that may have been offensive. But they had all come under a separate category of non-racist racism. AKA top bantz. He had never intentionally been racist. Which opened up a whole new world of unintentional racism.Emma couldn’t quite believe her ears. Dicky had never been at Dulwich College with Nigel. Had never met Nigel till much later in life. And yet somehow he knew for certain that Farage had never made any antisemitic remarks and that all of the 20 or so fellow former pupils hadn’t just made a mistake but had deliberately gone out of their way to tell lies to damage Reform.“Let me be clear. You are saying they lied?” Barnett asked. Always best to double-check these things. Just so there would be no mistake.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“Yes,” said Dicky. “It’s made-up twaddle.”So there we had it. Dicky going over the top. Beyond the call of duty. Ready to lay down his life for a friend. Some might call him foolhardy. Calling people you’ve never met a liar on something like this could attract the interest of libel lawyers. Tice’s small fortune could be about to become a little smaller.It was an act of friendship that wasn’t reciprocated by Farage later in the day. Mainly because Nige does not regard Tice as a friend. More a useful idiot. Expendable. At a hastily called press conference to double down on claims the cancelled elections were all a plot against Reform, Nige was asked if Dicky had been right to call his Dulwich accusers a liar. Something he noticeably declined to do. No point in him also getting dragged into a libel court. Dicky was on his own.Instead Faragewent into a long tirade against the BBC. Emma Barnett was disgraceful. Despicable. The BBC itself was guilty of double standards. Just look at some of the shows it had done in the 1970s. The Black and White Minstrel Show. It Ain’t Half Hot Mum. Till Death Us Do Part. Riddled with racism. So why wasn’t the Beeb apologising for its own output?It sounded very much as if Farage was a believer that two wrongs make a right. Almost an admission he too had been in the wrong. That if the BBC could broadcast all this as light entertainment then it was surely fine for him to have made a few Hitler gags to Jewish people. He ended his rant by producing a letter he claimed to have received from another former pupil. “Nigel was one hell of a funny guy. He never said anything nasty to anyone. We all luv Nigel.”The questions briefly turned to Tory defections. Was there anyone Reform wouldn’t take? Definitely, said Nigel. We will only take people we value. How does that explain Jonathan Gullis? He’s never been of use to anyone. We ended with a journalist asking if Nige was planning to sue Barnett. Nige equivocated. These things could get expensive. Still, if nothing else it had been a good day for the lawyers.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe politics sketchRichard TiceReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Does it really show how we think about romance?Sarah SloatThu 4 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 16.28 ESTShareWhat would you say if your partner told you they saw a bird today? Would you mumble noncommittally, or ask a follow-up question?You might be surprised to know that thousands of people onTikTokandInstagramwould judge you if you chose the former.According to the “bird theory”, aresurgent talking pointon social media, showing curiosity about such a minor event proves you’re genuinely interested in your partner. This, in turn, means you have a good relationship.Is it really that deep? Or does it reveal something more fundamental about how we think about romance right now? Here are the dos and don’ts of bird theory – and the science-backed reasons this trend hits such a nerve.What is the bird theory?In 2022, the researcher and psychologist Julie Gottmanexplainedthe concept of a “bid for connection” in the New York Times. She explained it is best defined as an attempt to receive attention, affirmation or affection from a partner.Is love addiction real – and what does it look like?Read moreShe gave an example: “Wow, look at that beautiful bird out the window!” This simple exclamation is an invitation for a partner to notice something with you.Bids can be verbal or nonverbal, small or big, negative or positive. It could be letting out anexasperated sigh, or making a direct ask for a date night. Regardless of the bid itself, “turning towards” or acknowledging it is key, according to Gottman.Gottman and her husband, John, developed a theory about relationships based on bids for connection aftertracking newlywedsfor six years, starting in 1986. The Gottmans’researchfound that couples who stayed together responded to bids about 86% of the time. The couples who divorced responded with an average of 33%.Today, John Gottman says this research is the basis for “the bird test”, although it’s unclear when social media first grabbed onto the concept. One popular Redditpostfrom four years ago seems to reference the study, writing: “If a wife says ‘look at that beautiful bird’ and the husband blows it off, that’s a strong indication they’ll divorce.”Why did the bird theory go viral?Couples therapists have talked about bids for connection long before they trended online, says Landis Bejar, a licensed psychotherapist and owner ofAisleTalk, a private practice focused on relationships. She says the term is now mentioned by patients in part because it “puts into words a very well-known but less-spoken-about phenomenon”.Byproviding language for what some people are feeling, trends like the bird theory can validate experiences, says Bejar. They can also serve as a springboard for a broader discussion with your therapist, friends or (ideally) your partner.Efforts like bids are ultimately attempts to establish a sense of shared reality, explains Paul Eastwick, a University of California, Davis professor who studies relationships. Happy relationships tend to comprise people who share a worldview and feel like part of a team, he says.Can the bird theory help couples?Relationship satisfaction increases when people are attuned to the big thingsandsmall day-to-day moments, says Bejar. This is especially true in longer relationships, where big moments, such as saying “I love you” or moving in together, become rarer.“The idea is that we want our partners to help us capitalize on good feelings,” says Joanne Davila, a distinguished professor of psychology at Stony Brook University. Studies show that when people do this in romantic relationships, and their partner responds withenthusiasm, they aremore likelyto have a healthy relationship.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How successfully we understand and can communicate these needs influences our romantic success. Davila’sresearchsuggests that three skills in particular – self-awareness, communicating needs and managing feelings – can lead to greater security and satisfaction in relationships.“We all need to know that our partner is interested in us,” says Davila. We can seek out this information in adaptive or maladaptive ways. The bird test, she explains, is on the benign end of this spectrum: it’s a way of getting some information about whether your partner is paying attention to your interests, but it’s not a substitute for really assessing if there’s a problem in the relationship.Happy couples do not have to respond to 100% of all bids, but the partners who are the best match for us are the ones who care about and respond to what we’re looking for emotionally, says Davila.How to use the bird theoryDiscuss the theory itself:If it’s random for you to bring up a bird, your partner may respond withconfusion. That doesn’t mean they’ve “failed”, says Bejar. A better approach, she explains, is to use the bird theory as a starting point for the conversation. Instead of just mentioning that you’ve spotted a finch or an eagle without context, you can explain to your partner why the concept resonated with you. But ultimately, you shouldn’t diagnose your relationship based on one moment, says Eastwick.Down on dating? Here are five couples who fell in love this yearRead moreLearn more about your partner’s bids for attention:“People have different ways of showing how they care,” says Davila. “It’s important for us to get to know our partners’ styles.” Something that may seem unimportant to you – like saying yes to a walk, or trying food your partner prepared – could be a bid you’re missing.It’s worth noting that “bids aren’t an intervention that you implement and insert into your relationship”, says Bejar. They happen all the time, though some may be more obvious than others. What’s critical is paying attention to the unique ways your partner makes these bids and how you engage with them, and build an atmosphere where people can be direct about their feelings and needs, she explains.Be realistic:Interpret reactions in context, says Davila. If your bid for attention is ignored during the season finale of a show or when your partner is stressed with work, it says less about your relationship and more about the general nature of attention.Social mediatrends can prompt interesting conversations, but can also be misused as tried-and-true ways to assess romance.“You need to be a critical thinker,” says Davila. “Social media can be a learning opportunity, but not everything we see on social media needs to apply to us.”This article was amended on 4 December 2025 to correct the spelling of Landis Bejar’s name.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyRelationshipsTikTokSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why are Maha elite raving about them?Touted as a cure for everything from wrinkles to autism, the treatment has been hyped by Robert F Kennedy Jr and various celebrities. Experts say it needs to be regulatedWarning: this article contains distressing contentSarah DiGregorioThu 4 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 14.44 ESTShareIt was the kind of cold, damp morning that makes it hard to get out of bed, much less get a child out the door. The sun had not even risen when five-year-old Thomas Cooper and his mother, Annie Cooper, arrived for an appointment on 31 January at the Oxford Center in Troy, a northern suburb of Detroit, Michigan.Thomas was an exuberant child with a button nose and pinchable cheeks – a little kid who loved running fast, playing Minecraft and watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, according to a GoFundMe set up by his family. He had just received money in a special red envelope for lunar new year, and he planned to spend it later that day with his little brother. But first, he was going to receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleep apnea.That morning, Thomas got into a tubular metal and clear plastic chamber, which was sealed, pressurized and filled with 100% oxygen. Then, according to anexpert who viewed video of the incident, Thomas squirmed enough to pull the sheet off the mattress, causing a spark of static electricity. In the oxygen-rich environment, that spark became a flash fire that incinerated Thomas within seconds. Annie, desperately trying to open the tank, got badly burned on her arms and chest. When firefighters arrivedjust before 8am, all they could do was put out the flames.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) – breathing concentrated oxygen in a highly pressurized enclosure – is prescribed by doctors for a handful of conditions such as severe burns, non-healing wounds or radiation injury. When it is provided by trained and licensed physicians and nurses in medical facilities using equipment that meets FDA regulations and is properly maintained, it is safe and effective.View image in fullscreenA hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) chamber tank in a hospital clinic.Photograph: Edward Olive/AlamyBut hyperbaric physicians and experts told the Guardian that HBOT is increasingly being made available in wellness businesses, provided by people without medical degrees or sufficient training, including chiropractors, physical therapists and alternative medicine practitioners. Without evidence, these businesses often promote HBOT as a cure-all for everything from Alzheimer’s to ADHD to wrinkles. The website for the Oxford Center, where Thomas received HBOT, marketed it for 108 conditions including sleep apnea and ADHD – many more than the13 approvedby the FDA.“It’s absolute anarchy and chaos,” said John S Peters, a healthcare executive and the executive director of the professional organization Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS), which runs the US hyperbaric oxygen facilityaccreditation program. (The American Medical Associationrecommendsthat all states require HBOT facilities be UHMS accredited, though none currently do.)Experts including Peters say that fires like the one that killed Thomas are rare. UHMS estimates that seven people have died since 2009 due to fire, suffocation or other adverse events in HBOT chambers. But they expect to see a further rise in deaths, as well as injuries, as HBOT spreads across med spas, wellness centers, private homes and other non-medical settings;you could think of it almost as if massage parlors were giving out antidepressants that also might explode. Peters believes unsafe HBOT chambers may now number in the tens of thousands in the US. Meanwhile, Maha influencers are glomming on to HBOT. And so are celebrities:Justin Bieberput chambers around his home and recording studio for his anxiety.Mayim BialikandLeBron Jamesswear by it.The risk is death. It’s a total failureJohn S PetersThe Michigan attorney general alleges that on the day Thomas died, the Oxford Center did not have a physician or safety coordinator on the premises, and the HBOT technician was not properly trained. The chamber had not received maintenance checks and was probably too old to be safely used, the attorney general claims, and Thomas himself allegedly did not receive a safety check before getting into the chamber. Nor was he fitted with a grounding strap, a device that would have probably prevented the fire.“In the Michigan incident there was no physician oversight when they oriented the parents. There was no mention of risks and benefits and consent … the risk is death,” Peters said. “It’s a total failure.”The Oxford Center owner and CEO, Dr Tamela Peterson (her doctorate is in education), as well as the center’s safety manager and management assistanthave been chargedwith second-degree murder, while the operator of the chamber was charged with involuntary manslaughter. All four havepleaded not guilty. The Oxford branch where Thomas died is permanently closed, and the trial judge is allowing Peterson to sell the company’s second location.The Cooper family has filed a civil suit for $100m in damagesagainst Peterson and the other employees who were charged, as well as the Oxford Center and the manufacturer of the chamber, Sechrist Industries. The Oxford Center and Peterson denied the family’s allegations of gross negligence, breach of warranty and failure to warn of risk of injury in an answer to the suit. In ahearingon 1 December, the safety director for Sechrist Industries testified that using a grounding strap, which the Oxford Center allegedly neglected to do, is required by the chamber’s operating manual.Sechrist Industries and the Oxford Center could not be reached for comment. Peterson’s lawyer declined to comment, citing the ongoing criminal case.“That shouldn’teverhappen,” said Dr Thomas Masters, undersea and hyperbaric medicine medical director at Hennepin county medical center in Minneapolis, of the fire. “And as these things [non-medical providers of HBOT] proliferate around the country, I worry that it’ll be something that happens more and more often.”Then, in July, it happened again: Walter Foxcroft, a physical therapist, was killed in a fire in his own chamber.Enter the chamberSay you have just had a mastectomy and it isn’t healing because of poor blood flow. Or perhaps you have diabetes and you have developed an ulcer on your foot that has not responded to other treatments. You might end up with a prescription from your doctor for hyperbaric oxygen therapy.When your first appointment with an HBOTphysicianrolls around, you are instructed to arrive without any skincare products on, because those can be flammable. In the office the physician goes over the benefits and risks of HBOT, answers your questions and gets your informed consent for the treatment. A registered nurse – also with extensive training or boardcertification– takes your vital signs and monitors you closely throughout your appointment.You remove your clothes and put on a special gown or scrubs designed to minimize static electricity. The outfit probably does not have pockets because you can’t bring electronics inside the chamber; that would be a fire risk. The nurse or chamber technician – whois also certified – does a safety check for hearing aids, a watch or anything else that could pose a fire risk.The chamber looks like an adult-sized incubator, or a submarine, or Sleeping Beauty’s glass-domed bed. A TV might be set up just outside so that you can watch a show with all the phone-free time you’re about to have.After you are helped into the chamber and fitted with a grounding device to prevent static electricity, the tech – who has completed a safety checklist on the chamber that day – seals you in and begins pumping in pure oxygen. As the pressure increases to an equivalent of being 45ft, or about 3.5 storeys, underwater, your ears might pop and you may feel a bit woozy or claustrophobic. But the real action is happening in your lungs and bloodstream: 100% oxygen, more concentrated than the 21% oxygen in the air we breathe, diffuses from your lungs into your blood, where it is carried not only by your red blood cells but also, due to the intense pressure, your plasma.Packed with oxygen, this blood travels all through your body, encouraging the growth of fresh new capillaries and improving circulation and oxygenation of tissues, which is key for wound healing, infection control and the growth of healthy tissue. One or two hours pass before the chamber is depressurized and you can head home until your next appointment.Now imagine instead that you have been struggling with anxiety and have had difficulty getting an appointment with a therapist, or you have lower back pain that will not go away. You drive by a shiny new medical spa that offers HBOT and promises it can treat your problem for $200 an hour. Bonus: it will also apparently make your skin look great. Plus, you’ve heard about it on a wellness podcast, and you know the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, recommends it. Joe Rogan loves it too,claimingit’s “phenomenal foreverything”.View image in fullscreenRobert F Kennedy Jr speaks at a campaign rally at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 1 November 2024.Photograph: Kamil Krzaczyński/AFP/Getty ImagesDr Caesar A Anderson is the medical director at University of California San Diego’s hyperbaric medicine and wound healing center. In his work, he sees the therapy doing tremendous good, especially in helping people with diabetes avoid amputations. But he often has to educate people who show up in his office convinced that HBOT is a miracle cure for anything – including, say, cancer.Anderson said this is often because people have come across online misinformation from influencers who promise that HBOT is practically the elixir of life. “When these patients show up to us, I think half the battle is understanding that your role as a physician is to do no harm and to always be a true patient advocate,” Anderson said. That means explaining what HBOT can, and cannot, do – therefore protecting people from unnecessary treatment while helping them find the care they do need.Sold as a panaceaSage Workinger-Brecka was ready to go to dinner. But her husband, Gary Brecka – a self-described biohacker, host of the Ultimate Human podcast and co-chair of the Maha Action Committee – was taking too long with his HBOT. According to avideoposted by the couple in May, she walked into a large room in their home and panned the camera to a black hyperbaric chamber with Gary inside, peering out at her while on a video call. Annoyed, she told him: “You’re gonna have to do emergency,” referring to a rapid decompression button for emergencies. “Out you go.”Dr Owen J O’Neill, the medical director at Westchester Hyperbaric Medicine and Wound Care and president of UHMS, emailed a to-the-point assessment of the video: “Chamber questionable, training questionable, cell phone in chamber against fire safety, definitely not accredited.”This was a month afterBreckamet up with Kennedy at a UFCfightand invited him over to do nutritional IVs and bro out over his HBOT setup – “a complete gamechanger for human performance, longevity, and recovery”, he called it.The previous fall, Kennedy hadclaimedHBOT was being “suppressed” by the FDA. Dr Mehmet Oz, the former TV host andcurrent headof the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, promotedhyperbaric oxygenas long ago as 2009 as a “simple way to extend your lifespan”. (Oprah.com reported: “Dr Oz comes out of the chamber feeling more alert and jazzed up.”) The alternative medicine entrepreneur andKennedy’s close friendDr Mark HymansaidHBOT “support[s] a longer, more vibrant life”, and hepromoted iton the podcast of Donald Trump’s nominee for surgeon general, Dr Casey Means.It’s a spa mentality that is not necessarily geared towards the Hippocratic oathDr Caesar A AndersonIt is easy to see why people imagine oxygen as a panacea. We need it to live, so intuitively, more must be better. But hyperbaric chambers are complex medical devices, and there are many ways that HBOT can go wrong in untrained hands. Notably absent from Maha-world testimonials is information about safety risks, FDA regulations or how to find a medical provider.Anderson said that Thomas Cooper’s death is one tragic indication of the danger involved in wellness businesses and non-physicians pushing HBOT for just about anything. He pointed to a comment that the Oxford Center CEO, Peterson, reportedlymadein private messages about promoting HBOT for erectile dysfunction: “Whatever gets bodies in those chambers, lol.”“Just disgusting,” Anderson said. “It’s a spa mentality that is not necessarily geared towards the Hippocratic oath, right? It’s a money maker.”“We are administering a drug just like any other,” Masters said. “It’s not a holistic wellness thing.”View image in fullscreenFour hyperbaric chambers at high-end wellness club Remedy Place in Boston, Massachusetts.Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty ImagesSome experimental uses for HBOT, such astreating veteranswithtraumatic brain injuryor people withlong Covid, are being studied with the oversight of physicians. But many unregulated centers promise results that are unproven at best and invented at worst.Hyperbaric physicians say that families trying to get help for their children are especially vulnerable to medical misinformation, sometimes putting kids in harm’s way.On an evening in June 2011, in a family home in North Carolina, 19-year-old Jarred Sparks got into a soft-sided chamber, helped by his brother who turned on the oxygen and left the room. According to the family’s subsequent lawsuit against the chamber manufacturer, Sparks had autism, and his family had gone to Dr Jerry Kartzinel, a pediatrician who wrote abookwith the actor Jenny McCarthy spreading themyththat autism is caused by vaccination. Kartzinel allegedly told the family that doing HBOT would alleviate Sparks’s autism symptoms, so the family bought the chamber from OxyHealth.Soft-sided chambers are like body bags that can be inflated with pressurized, concentrated oxygen; the FDA warns they pose a risk of fire and suffocation when used this way.Later that night, Sparks’s mother found the bag partially collapsed around her son. According to an investigation, a valve had disconnected, cutting off air flow, and Sparks had suffocated. In September 2015, a judgedismissedthe lawsuit against OxyHealth partly because the family did not use the bag according to the manufacturer’s instructions.‘Laughable, if it weren’t so dangerous’: your responses to RFK Jr’s autism stanceRead more“There’s basically no evidence to support hyperbaric oxygen therapy as autism therapy,” said Dr Andy Shih, the chief science officer at Autism Speaks. And yet, misinformation about the therapy has been a problem for 20 years. For instance, businesses advertising HBOT for autism often show children happily relaxing in chambers with iPads – “a total fire hazard”, as one expert described it. “People keep marketing it. It really preys on the fears and the hopes of parents and caregivers,” Shih said.Walter Foxcroft, a physical therapist who ran Havasu Health and Hyperbarics, was a beloved fixture of Lake Havasu in Arizona, where hedressed upas the wildcat mascot for games at University of Arizona, his alma mater. His center, which was not UHMS-accredited,billedHBOT as a treatment for autism, as well as dementia and ageing.According to a police report, just before 11pm on 9 July, Foxcroft’s wife went to find him at his work after he did not come home for dinner. She discovered him burnt to death in his chamber and called 911. Foxcroft had apparently been alone, and several electronics were found with him inside the chamber. The death was ruled accidental.A spark away from catastropheHBOT is not a new technology. In 1861, thefirst hyperbaric chamberin the US was built in New York and eventually deployed to treat decompression sickness in workers excavating the Hudson River tunnels – a disorder it is still used to treat today.In 1963, first lady Jackie Kennedy gave birth prematurely to a baby boy, Patrick. Because his lungs were not fully developed, he went into respiratory distress. Physicians, desperate to save the president’s baby, put Patrick into a hyperbaric chamber despite no evidence it would work, where he died 39 hours after his birth.View image in fullscreenA patient in an oxygen chamber at Monsell hospital in Manchester, England, in 1967.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesThese days, HBOT is becoming a wellness status symbol. Kendall Jenneranswers emails and watches Netflixfrom inside her own pricey chamber. Longevity and biohacking entrepreneur Bryan Johnsonsingsits praises – “This machine made me younger. (Insane results)” – to his nearly 2 million YouTube subscribers.Endorsements like these have given HBOT an aspirational veneer as savvy self-care, like a facial or a cold plunge but more exclusive. That gloss can obscure some important facts, namely that HBOT is supposed to be available only by prescription and that not all HBOT is the same: many wellness businesses provide “mild hyperbaric oxygen therapy”, meaning the pressure is lower than effective, evidence-based treatment.At Remedy Place, a “social wellness club” with locations in New York City, West Hollywood and Boston, you can indulge inone-hour HBOT for $190, which comes with the non-specific promise of “enhancing the performance of every internal system and accelerating your success”. Akshie Shah visited a Remedy Place in Manhattan for HBOT in November 2023. According to an ongoing lawsuit, she alleges that she woke up alone in the pitch black of a sealed chamber: her session time had elapsed and the machine had shut off, but no one had come to get her out. She said she struggled to breathe – if the air supply was indeed off, carbon dioxide would have been slowly filling the chamber – and that no one answered the call button. She started to panic, banging on the sides before someone let her out. Herlawsuitalleges Remedy Place offered two free HBOT sessions by way of apology.It just takes a little stress fracture in the side of the chamber that can explode itDr Sandra WainwrightShah’s lawyer, Richard W Grohmann, told the Guardian that the industry was “crying out to be regulated”. Lawyers for Remedy Place denied the allegations, arguing in ananswer to the complaintthat Shah knew the risks and that any damages were the fault of parties Remedy Place was not responsible for. Remedy Place declined to comment to the Guardian.Unscrupulous marketing from med spas and wellness businesses alarms Dr Sandra Wainwright, medical director of hyperbaric medicine at Yale New Haven Health’s Greenwich hospital. “‘Come to the spa. We’ll do cold plunge and infrared therapy and sauna, and then we’ll do some hyperbaric treatment. You’re going to feel amazing.’ And I’msurethat theydofeel amazing after all of that, andmaybethere’s some benefit,” Wainwright said.“But it just takes a little stress fracture in the side of the chamber that can explode it, or mishandling of oxygen or using the equipment not as recommended by the manufacturer, and that can be a catastrophic accident.”Koby Grover, an EMT and former firefighter, has first-hand insight into how HBOT is provided in non-medical settings. He said he saw enough problems when he worked as an HBOT technician at Portland Chiropractic Neurology in Portland, Maine, that he feared for clients’ safety.He was particularly worried about the soft-sided chambers used at the clinic: they often vacillated between very high and very low pressures, and patients reported feeling dizzy and nauseous. He said they were not properly maintained, causing dust buildup in the relief valves, and that because several of the compressors were not designed for use with those chambers, the oxygen tubing would fall out. Once, when a soft-sided chamber’s zipper broke, he claims the owner of the clinic had it repaired by a local seamstress, putting that chamber at high risk of rupture.Grover, who is not a certified HBOT technician, said his training consisted of an orientation on the machines and an introductory course on HBOT over Zoom. In a text message, he described other concerns: he was responsible for monitoring not only the oxygen generation room and the purity of the oxygen, but also up to 10 chambers with people inside at once. “If the oxygen depleted in tank one without me swapping it, the patient would no longer have breathing air [through their mask]. Which was a concern to me given I had to be everywhere at once,” he said. (Sometimes chambers are pressurized with regular air and the concentrated oxygen is delivered via mask.)He said the tiny oxygen generation room was also a potential hazard: “The combination of oxygen, heat and electrical components in such a tight space created a significant fire and explosion risk.”Grover quit in April, after about three months on the job. He said he brought these concerns to management, to no avail.Portland Chiropractic Neurology said in a statement: “The safety and comfort of our patients is our top priority. That’s why we have always followed all recommended safety protocols in connection with our hyperbaric program.” It added that it was expanding to be Maine’s first hyperbaric center “built and operated to hospital standard”.Fighting for regulationTom Workman, a 75-year-old retired air force colonel, aerospace physiologist and certified hyperbaric technician, has amassed a mountain of evidence about unsafe HBOT, including a video of a soft-sided chamber explosion in India. The footage is disturbing in its sudden violence as the bag bursts and the occupant slowly emerges from the wreckage, dazed and unsteady. Workman said the man suffered gastrointestinal trauma. He calls soft-sided chambers “ziplocks”.Workman was UHMS’s director of quality assurance and regulatory affairs, and he developed the organization’s accreditation program back in 2001. He is spending his retirement documenting facilities providing unsafe HBOT – he has a list of nearly 300 locations that concern him, in every state except Rhode Island – and sending his concerns to the FDA.“It’s a cancer,” he said. “I can’t put it any stronger.”Laws regulating med spas, health clubs and wellness businesses vary by state, but generally they are not overseen with the same thoroughness as healthcare – even when they purport to provide it, as with HBOT. Workman said the FDA should take an active oversight role with HBOT because it regulates medical devices (the chambers) and drugs (the concentrated, medical-grade oxygen). But it has not done much besides sending astrongly worded letterreminding HBOT providers of safety codes and issuingpublic safety warnings.View image in fullscreenA hyperbaric chamber at Northwestern hospital in Lake Forest, Illinois, in June 2023.Photograph: Jamie Kelter Davis/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesWorkman said that FDA resources seem to be allocated to more high-profile problems, like kids vaping. Now that Kennedy, who has contended that HBOT istooregulated, is in charge, a crackdown seems even less likely,just as HBOT’s popularity explodes. While individual lawsuits can hold certain facilities accountable when incidents happen, they do not provide broad protection for consumers. According toStateline, lawmakers in Thomas Cooper’s home state of Michigan want to mandate that facilities providing HBOT be UHMS accredited.The FDA responded to a request for comment by pointing the Guardian toits August letterto HBOT providers and added that it decides when to conduct safety inspections based on multiple factors, includingreportingfrom facilities and device manufacturers of adverse events.Experts say anyone prescribed HBOT should choose acenter accreditedby UHMS to be assured of their safety. When in doubt, O’Neill, the hyperbaric physician from Westchester and UHMS president, has this advice:“When you go to a hyperbaric facility to be treated, the first question you want to ask is: ‘Are you being evaluated by a medical doctor? Is the medical doctor going to be onsite while you’re treated? Is there an appointed safety coordinator that’s going to be onsite while you’re treated? Have the technologists who are running your treatment been appropriately trained and certified? Is the chamber hard shell?’“If none of those things are there,” he said, “run.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsHealthRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationHealth & wellbeingUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet the volunteer group’s plans have been thrown into disarray by the news that they will not have access to cars and vans on New Year’s Day.The group had relied on Zipcar, the car-sharing company that offered customers the ability to access its fleet of vehicles from the street using an app. The company caused shock across London on Monday when it said it wouldshut down UK operations from 1 January.It will mean many of the volunteers will be unable to collect food fromthe Felix Project, a charity that gathers surplus foodfrom supermarkets, cafes and restaurants. Obvious alternatives are further away, more expensive, or do not offer the same flexible hours.“It’s going to be affected massively,” said Vimal Pandya, the community kitchen’s founder. “Personally me and my team, we are worried about the logistical challenge we will face. A lot of people like our group are going to struggle.”View image in fullscreenVimal Pandya (far left) said Rotherhithe Community Kitchen was worried about the ‘logistical challenge’ caused by Zipcar’s exit.Photograph: Vimal Pandya/Rotherhithe Community KitchenThecommunity kitchen’s drivers are among more than half a million people in London registered as car club members in 2020, and who could be left without convenient access to cars and vans, without the hassle and cost of ownership. The vast majority of those people were likely to be members of Zipcar, which had a near-monopoly position in the city.The planned closure, subject to consultation with Zipcar’s 71 UK employees, is a big blow to hopes that car sharing in urban areas could reduce the need for private vehicle ownership. Yet some experts also suggested that Zipcar’s departure (the company still operates in the US and Canada) need not spell the end of the road for the idea in Britain.Car sharing isprized by many urbanists and environmentalistsas a way of reducing the ills associated with vehicle ownership. Most cars sit as two-tonne dead weights on the side of the road for 95% of the time, using up space. They also require large carbon emissions to produce, and people who do not own cars tend to walk, cycle and take public transport more. That benefits cities – reducing congestion and pollution – and improves people’s health further because they build more exercise into their daily routines.Zipcar was founded in 2000 by two American entrepreneurs before being bought by US car rental group Avis Budget in 2013 for $491m (£371m). Zipcar’s revenues of £47m in UK barely registered compared with Avis Budget’s overall annual revenue of $12bn, and so a loss that grew to £11.7m in 2024 gave the parent company little incentive to continue.Avis Budget has said the closure of Zipcar’s UK operations is part of a “broader transformation across our international business, where we are taking deliberate steps to streamline operations, improve returns”.Zipcar’s most recent accounts, for 2024, said revenues had fallen as drivers had been taking fewer and shorter trips. “These changes reflect the ongoing impact of the cost-of-living crisis, which continues to suppress demand for discretionary spending,” it said.Last year, Zipcar closed its operations in Oxford, Cambridge and Bristol to focus on London.View image in fullscreenA Zipcar sits in its bay on a street in London. Parking is a central issue for the car-sharing market.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesHowever, several experts noted that London has specific problems that made it much harder for the company and its rivals to succeed.Some councils were very supportive but across 33 boroughs car-club operators face a patchwork of varying processes and prices that made it harder to operate. Zipcar’s closure will also coincide with theelectric cars becoming liable for London’s congestion charge, adding unavoidable costs for any vehicles enter the charge zone.As often seems the case in local politics, parking is a central issue. Residents in the wealthiest London borough, Kensington and Chelsea, pay as little as £63 for a year’s electric car parking. The same vehicle in a floating car club (accessible via app, without a fixed parking space) would pay £1,110 annually. For a petrol or diesel model it is £2,217.Co Wheels has found success in towns and cities outside London, ranging from Glasgow, Bristol and Oxford all the way to the Orkney islands. Yet the cost and complexity of the capital have so far limited its efforts there.“We should literally be charged one-twentieth of a resident’s permit,” said Robert Schopen, the head of partnerships at Co Wheels. “We’re taking cars off the street. We’re putting less polluting cars in their place.”Elly Baker, the chair of the London assembly transport committee, said there needed to be central leadership across all of the capital’s boroughs on car clubs, allowing a single process and unified price guidelines for parking permits.A spokesperson for London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said car clubs could play an “important role” in reducing private car ownership.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Germany introduced national car-sharing legislation in 2017, giving a nationwide framework for parking, subsidies and exemptions. Now, the country has 5.4 shared cars per 10,000 people, while France has 2.1 and Belgium has 6.3, according to the vehicle-sharing software company Invers. The UK lags behind at 0.7 (and Zipcar accounted for more than half of that).View image in fullscreenGreenMobility presents Denmark’s first self-driving electric car share in Copenhagen last month.Photograph: Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images“What we see is that car sharing around the world, especially in Europe, is growing,” said Bharath Devanathan, the chief business officer at Invers.Devanathan said authorities should start to treat car sharing as a form of public transport, and integrate it with train and bus stations. He added that one unnamed client was already seriously considering entering the London market even before Zipcar’s exit, and despite the challenges: “There will be a group of operators that will fill this gap.”Speaking about the closure of Zipcar’s UK operation, Devanathan said: “It’s very unusual that it’s happened at this scale and the biggest player, but this is definitely not the end.”The company’s competitors can roughly be divided into two camps: fleet operators, which own or lease and maintain their own cars; and peer-to-peer services, that allow users to rent out their own vehicles to others via app unlocking or by providing lockboxes for keys – a kind of Airbnb for cars.Examples of the fleet model across Europe include: Denmark’s GreenMobility, France’s Free2Move, which is owned by Peugeot and Fiat owner Stellantis; Germany’s Miles Mobility; Belgium’s Poppy; and Renault’s Mobilize in Madrid. Peer-to-peer players include Britain’s Hiyacar and the US’s Getaround.One company already weighing up the UK gap left by Zipcar is Turo, a US-headquartered peer-to-peer platform. Rory Brimmer, the managing director of Turo UK, said his company had a “big opportunity” to win more users in London and would look at increasing marketing efforts. UK car owners earn an average of £400 a month from renting their vehicle, he said, enough to fully cover the cost of ownership of some cars.“There is a void there that is going to need to be filled, because London still needs to move,” Brimmer said.Yet it could take some time for other players to build momentum. In the meantime, more people will feel forced to buy cars, and others across London will be left without access.View image in fullscreenVimal Pandya and another volunteer use a car owned by a volunteer to deliver food in south London.Photograph: Vimal Pandya/Rotherhithe Community KitchenFor Rotherhithe Community Kitchen, the next month will be a scramble to find a way to get food out.

He had been a regular face on British television in the 1970s.Photograph: ShutterstockThe former Dulwich college pupils said they had been motivated to speak now by the response of Farage and others in his party to an investigation by the Guardian based on multiple accounts of racism.Reform’s deputy leader,Richard Tice, said on Thursday that all of those who had made the claims were liars.These included Peter Ettedgui, 61, an Emmy- and Bafta-winning director, who recalled Farage repeatedly growling“Hitler was right”or “Gas them” at him when they were at school.However, Nick Hearn, a banker who described himself as “a conservative with a small C”, told the Guardian he had regularly seen Ettedgui being abused by the now Reform leader, and he called on Farage to “come clean”.Far from being “banter”, as Farage has previously described some of his remarks, Hearn called it “personal [and] vindictive”. Hearn is the eighth pupil to offer corroboration of Ettedgui’s claims.He said: “[Farage] was consistent and he was persistent. Peter and I used to have lunch together in the sort of cloisters, a thoroughfare between the main buildings. There were people going backwards and forwards all the time, and I witnessed on multiple occasions sort of little snide comments and personal, vindictive, racist comments.“He had a reputation in school for being a racist. I think he should come clean about his inappropriate behaviour as a young man and apologise.“People will make up their own opinion, of course, but I just think that it wasn’t idle kids’ banter. It was targeted and highly racist.”Mark Bridges, who was in Farage’s year, said he also remembered Farage as “a racist bully”. He said: “I remember Peter Ettedgui, and I remember him being tormented” and targeted by Farage.The Guardian has previously reported on the claims of Andy Field, an NHS doctor, who said he recalled Farage burning a school roll in a year in which there were more Patels than Smiths.Richard Flowers came forward to say he also recalled Farage’s response to the number of boys named Patel being higher than Smiths.He said: “I remember him coming up to us holding the yearbook, which was like a pamphlet, and holding it open and sort of stabbing his finger at the name, saying ‘look, look, look, the most common name in this school has always been Smith. And now it’s Patel. It’s Patel,’ sort of thing, and sort of stabbing his finger at it.”The Guardian has obtained a copy of the school roll for 1980, which shows that there were 12 Smiths and 13 Patels.A further former pupil of Asian background added his voice, claiming Farage was an open racist and would say “Enoch Powell was right” to him as a form of what he described as “racial intimidation”.He recalled an assembly held soon before Farage left Dulwich college. “I remember a full upper school assembly in which the headmaster was reading from a list of names of boys whose parents had failed to return some forms,” he said.“When the name Patel was read out, Farage shouted out aggressively to draw attention to himself. His intervention was loud and disruptive. The headmaster paused and looked up. This happened again and only with the name Patel. We were sitting in the same row and I saw him do this.” He said this happened when Farage was 18.The former pupil said Farage would shout out to draw attention to the name as foreign or not English, and that he appeared “obsessed with Patels”.View image in fullscreenA list of Dulwich college pupils in 1980.A further former pupil, who was in Farage’s year, claimed that while in the final year when Farage was aged 17 or 18 he remembered Farage would make gas hissing noises at a Jewish boy, who was not Ettedgui.He said: “He would make these gas hissing noises. He had this fascination with Hitler and the whole kind of Third Reich thing. And he had this fascination with basically gassing Jews. And he, as I say, whenever this lad went in to the class, he would make these hissing noises.”When the Guardian first contacted Reform about allegations made by then a dozen school contemporaries, Farage’s lawyer said: “The suggestion that Mr Farage ever engaged in, condoned, or led racist or antisemitic behaviour is categorically denied.”He later admitted he may have said things in “banter” at school that could be viewed differently today but denied saying anything racist or antisemitic “directly” at an individual.On Thursday, Farage denied saying anything racist “with malice” but appeared to lose his temper as questions were asked about the allegations.Tice had earlier beenquestioned by the BBC’s Emma Barnett, who pressed the politician on Farage’s “relationship with Hitler”.Farage said he would no longer speak to the BBC, calling it “despicable” and “beyond belief”.Describing Barnett as one of the BBC’s “lower-grade presenters”, he criticised the way she asked the question and then attacked the BBC for showing programmes in the 1970s and 1980s that would be viewed as racist today.Citing television shows including Are You Being Served? and It Ain’t Half Hot Mum, Farage accused the BBC of “double standards and hypocrisy”. He said: “I want an apology from the BBC for virtually everything you did throughout the 1970s and 80s.”He went on to read out a letter he said he had received from a former schoolmate at Dulwich college, which said that while Farage had been “offensive” he did not recall him as racist.Farage read: “I was a Jewish pupil at Dulwich college at the same time and I remember him very well. While there was plenty of macho tongue-in-cheek schoolboy banter, it was humour, and yes, sometimes it was offensive … but never with malice. I never heard him racially abuse anyone.“If he had, he would have been reported and punished. He wasn’t. The news stories are without evidence, except for belatedly, politically dubious recollections from nearly half a century ago. Back in the 1970s the culture was very different … especially at Dulwich. Lots of boys said things they’d regret today or just laugh at. Whilst Nigel stood out, he was neither aggressive nor a racist.”Pressed on whether the allegations about racist comments were events that really happened but his classmates had experienced them in a different way, Farage said: “Recollections may vary.”Speaking in Glasgow, Keir ​S​tarmer said Farage was a “a toxic, divisive disgrace” after the Reform leader said in a campaign video that Glasgow was experiencing a “cultural smashing” as nearly one in three pupils in the city spoke English as a second language.​T​he prime minister, who was making an appearance ​alongside the Scottish Labour leader​, Anas Sarwar, said: “All he wants to do is tear communities apart. In Glasgow, the diversity, the compassion, is celebrated. It’s part of, not just of Glasgow, but Scotland. I am proud that that is part of what Scotland is.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

This is about enforcing the rules of the EBU and being inclusive,” it said. The German broadcaster SWR confirmed it would participate.The Spanish national broadcaster, along with seven other countries, had formally requested a secret ballot at a summit of broadcasters in Geneva on Thursday.“The EBU presidency has denied RTVE’s request for a specific vote on Israel’s participation. This decision increases RTVE’s distrust of the festival’s organisation and confirms the political pressure surrounding it,” it said in a statement.View image in fullscreenDelegates leave the headquarters of the European Broadcasting Union after the first day of a two-day general assembly on Thursday.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesSpain’s culture minister, Ernest Urtasun, backed the boycott. He said: “You can’t whitewash Israel given the genocide in Gaza. Culture should be on the side of peace and justice. I’m proud of an RTVE that puts human rights before any economic interest.”In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, the Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said it would also withdraw from next year’s contest. “After weighing all perspectives, Avrotros concludes that, under the current circumstances, participation cannot be reconciled with the public values that are fundamental to our organisation.”The Slovenian national broadcaster, RTVSLO – the first to threaten a boycott this summer – said participation “would conflict with its values of peace, equality and respect”.At the meeting on Thursday, EBU members discussed new rules designed to stop governments and third parties from promoting songs to influence voters.Some countries had raised concerns over undue promotion methods after Israel topped the public vote at the contest in May, finishing second overall after the jury votes were taken into consideration.The proposed rule changes were seen as an olive branch to broadcasters critical of Israel, but appear to have been deemed insufficient to most of the nations who had signalled their willingness to boycott the event.Sixty-five per cent of delegates voted in favour of the changes to the song contest and no further discussion on participation of Israel, while 23% voted against and 10% abstained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

ORF, the Austrian host broadcaster, had also said it wanted Israel to compete.SWR said before the meeting that Israel was entitled to compete in the contest. It said the contest, for decades, was “a competition organised by EBU broadcasters, not by governments” and “the Israeli broadcaster Kan meets all the requirements associated with participation” for 2026.Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Israel, which has won the contest four times since its debut in 1973, has competed for the past two years despite disputes over its participation.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropeIsraelTelevisionSpainIrelandSlovenianewsShareReuse this content"

In a parallel policy strand, ministers will work with the NHS to prevent mothers with newborn babies being discharged back to B&B hostels or other similarly unsuitable housing.Another new element will mean that rules are changed to make it easier for working parents receiving universal credit to get help to pay upfront childcare costs.In the budget Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, announced an end to the near decade-old Conservative policy of barring universal credit or tax credit payments for third or subsequent children, which campaigners said had pushed more than 300,000 more children into poverty.This week, at prime minister’s questions, Starmer announcedanother policy: adopting the recommendations by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) intended to help inform parents about baby formula products that are cheaper than the best-known brands.Other recent poverty-related policies includean expansionof free school meals in England, funding for more breakfast clubs and a project to set up a wave of new Sure Start-type family hubs.According to a Downing Street statement about the strategy, the combined measures will lift 550,000 children out of poverty by 2030, which it described as the biggest-ever such reduction in a single parliament since comparable records began.Poverty charities reacted positively to the plan, which was originally intended for spring but was delayed as Starmer and Reeves wrestled with the fiscal and political repercussions of removing the two-child limit.The government “has put its money where its mouth is on the manifesto commitment to reducing child poverty”, said Katie Schmuecker of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, saying that the removal of the two-child limit was “the single most effective policy decision” ministers could have made in tackling child poverty.Lynn Perry, the chief executive of Barnardo’s, said she welcomed the plan, adding: “Whist this is a landmark moment, we must also remember that even with these important changes, close to four million children are still set to be living in poverty in 2029. We must work together as a society to change this.”Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said the changes were invaluable but “only the first step”, adding: “There is much to do and we must now build on this momentum to achieve more tangible change for children.”The end of the two-child limit had been long demanded by many Labour MPs, with Starmer facing increasing pressure from his ministers to act on a policy the prime minister was also known to dislike, but was aware carried political risks in removing.Too many families were still “struggling without the basics – a secure home, warm meals, and the support they need to make ends meet”, Starmer said in a statement.The prime minister went on: “I will not stand by and watch that happen, because the cost of doing nothing is too high for children, for families, and for Britain.“This is a moral mission for me. It’s about fairness, opportunity, and unlocking potential. Our strategy isn’t just about reversing the failures of the past, it sets a new course for national renewal, with children’s life chances at its heart.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenPovertyHousingBenefitsSocial exclusionChildcareKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve got her back now.”He said her ashes remained at the home he and his wife, Caroline, share in aWiltshirevillage. “We’ll be able to lay her to rest now this is over. We felt we couldn’t do anything while all this was going on. It’s been hanging over us for seven years.”Sturgess, 44, died after spraying novichok, stored in a fake perfume bottle, over herself at the home of her boyfriend,Charlie Rowley, in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on 30 June 2018.Rowley is believed to have found the bottle in a bin after it was discarded by the Russian agents who had targeted the former Russian spySergei Skripalthree months before by placing novichok on the door handle of his home in Salisbury, seven miles from Amesbury.The chair ofthe inquiry, Lord Hughes, concluded Putin must have authorised the attack on Skripal and he was “morally responsible” for Sturgess’s death. He called the attack a “public demonstration of Russian state power for both international and domestic impact”.Hughes made limited criticism of the way the security services protected Skripal, who was living openly under his own name in a suburban cul-de-sac.But Stan Sturgess said there was no evidence that lessons had been learned. “The times we’re living in now mean changes need to be made. The world’s gone crazy. Someone like Skripal might come to the UK again. Would things be done differently?” he said.View image in fullscreenDawn’s parents, Caroline and Stan Sturgess. Stan said he was still angry that Wiltshire police initially falsely characterised their daughter as a drug user.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianHe said he was still angry that Wiltshire police initially falsely characterised Sturgess as a drug user. The force has apologised for its mistake.He said: “That was very hurtful. The biggest thing we have got is that it wasn’t Dawn’s fault.” He also said he felt public health officials should have warned people not to pick up objects that did not belong to them after the attack on Skripal.Dawn Sturgess’s family condemn security ‘failure’ that led to novichok poisoningsRead moreBut he did not feel hatred towards Putin or to anyone else involved and said Rowley was a victim. “I don’t feel hatred to anyone,” he said.After publication of the report in London on Thursday, the UK government announced new sanctions against Russia and summonsed the Russian ambassador to answer for what it called “Russia’s ongoing campaign of hostile activity against the UK”.Keir Starmersaid: “The Salisbury poisonings shocked the nation and today’s findings are a grave reminder of the Kremlin’s disregard for innocent lives.”Hughes saidAlexander Petrov, Ruslan Boshirov and Sergey Fedotovwere members of an operational team within the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency responsible for foreign intelligence gathering.He said: “Deploying a highly toxic nerve agent in a busy city was an astonishingly reckless act. The risk that others beyond the intended target might be killed or injured was entirely foreseeable.”He said the bottle containing the novichok that Sturgess sprayed on herself was probably the same one the Russian agents had used to apply poison to the door handle of Skripal’s house.View image in fullscreenA counterfeit bottle of perfume recovered from Charlie Rowley’s home. It is believed it contained the same nerve agent used to poison ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury by Russian agents.Photograph: ReutersHe said: “They recklessly discarded this bottle somewhere public or semi-public before leaving Salisbury. They can have had no regard for the hazard thus created, of the death of, or serious injury to, an unaccountable number of innocent people.”Rowley has said he found the bottle in a bin shortly before he gave it to Sturgess, but Hughes said it was likely he had come upon the bottle “within a few days” of it being abandoned on 4 March.Hughes concluded there had been failings in Skripal’s management as an exchanged prisoner. “In particular, sufficient, regular written assessments were not conducted,” he said.He also said he did not consider that the attack on Skripal could have been averted by additional security measures. “The only such measures which could have avoided the attack would have been such as to hide him completely with a new identity.”Hughes said extra training for emergency services on recognising symptoms from nerve agent exposure should have been more widely circulated after the Salisbury attack. He criticised Wiltshire police for wrongly characterising Sturgess as a drug user after she was poisoned.Rowley said he believed his health continued to be compromised by the poisoning. He said: “I’m still struggling with my eyesight. I have blurry and double vision. I also have some memory issues. You have to live with it. I think the novichok affected me.” He paid tribute to Sturgess. “She was a lovely woman.”Explore more on these topicsNovichok poisoningsWiltshireSergei SkripalEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Secrid wallet can hold up to six cards, has a satisfying mechanism that pops cards out when needed, and its lightweight aluminium shell protects against breaks or bends when he sits on it.View image in fullscreenGerber mullet multi tool keyring£9.99 at GerberThis multi-tool keyring is the ultimate trinket for the tinkerer in your life. Shorter than a standard Chubb key and featuring 11 functions – from wire stripper to bottle opener – it’s a pocket-size piece that, at less than £10, would make a great stocking filler.View image in fullscreenMontbellthermo mug£15 at MontbellReusable cups are all well and good, but most are handle-free, making it hard to emulate that cuppa moment on the move. Montbell’s handled insulated mug has kept my teas and coffees piping hot, with a sip-through lid that has enabled me to swig on the go when pounding the pavements to get my daughter to nap.For more, read our guide to thebest travel mugsSelf careView image in fullscreenKiehl’s moisturiser£21 at Kiehl’s£18.85 at AmazonA well-rounded face moisturiser is a must for any man, whether they’ve got a solid skincare routine or have never been near a cosmetics counter. This Kiehl’s facial fuel is the one I reach for because it has a non-oily finish and is fast-absorbing – perfect for those, like me, who want to spend seconds rather than minutes at the mirror.View image in fullscreenAesop hand cream£21.70 at the Grooming Clinic£27 at Space NKThe colder months are tough on your skin. Aesop’s cedar-smelling hand balm is a firm Filter favourite, and it comes in a more affordable tube than the£80 500ml bottle, too.View image in fullscreenSalt of the Earth natural deodorant£4.47 at Holland and Barrett£4.86 at AmazonA roll-on deodorant may sound more like a passive-aggressive hint than a loving gift, but this stick – made from 100% natural ingredients and essential oils – is refillable, so it’s the perfect gift for a Dad who’s keen on discovering natural alternatives.View image in fullscreenWash bag£28 at Holloways of LudlowThis wash bag from Scandi design stalwart Hay is a good size and in bold, contrasting colours, which will stand out when he’s rummaging in a suitcase for it.

These ones from Loop will block up to 27dB, muffling even the loudest snorers, and unlike the wax or foam plugs I’ve traditionally turned to, they actually stay put all night (and don’t turn into a melted mess hidden deep in your bedsheets).Home and gardenView image in fullscreenDonkey gardening gloves£15.95 at AmazonBrambles and nettles beware, these multipurpose gardening gloves are made of strong stuff (a vegan faux leather on the palm and elasticated, breathable fabric on the backs), but retain the dexterity required for fiddly outdoor jobs such as pruning and deadheading. I’ve found them to be a great all-rounder for DIY projects in and out of the house, and phone-friendly finger and thumb pads mean I haven’t had to remove them to snap away at progress or check assembly PDFs on my phone.View image in fullscreenBosch cordless screwdriver£25 at Halfords£25 at AmazonEven – or especially – if your dad isn’t a DIY whiz, an electric screwdriver is a handy addition to any toolbox. This compact, rechargeable option from Bosch comes with 10 interchangeable heads and will shave time off flat-pack assembly and other small jobs around the home. It also has a built-in light ring that can illuminate hard-to-see screw heads.View image in fullscreenGeese, Getting Killed on vinylFrom £24.99 at Rough Trade£27.99 at HMVThe Brooklyn-based quartet Geese is one of the most exciting groups to come out of New York since the Strokes.

It’s also possible to havehis favourite tipple turned into a candlefor an extra £10, although you have to send your own empty bottle.For more, read our guide to thebest scented candlesView image in fullscreenNiwaki golden spade£42 at John Lewis£42 at AmazonNo outdoor assignment is too much for the Niwaki sukoppu – a strong, sharp and lightweight tool sourced from Japan that is at home digging, cutting and shifting soil. Made from steel, it doesn’t flex under pressure.View image in fullscreenIndoor/outdoor clogs£15.99 at B&Q£15.99 at AmazonFor dads who are in and out of the garden, it’s hard to beat the humble clog – easier to put on than a pair of lace-up trainers and less cumbersome than wellies. These from Town & Country won’t break the bank, but I’ve found them to be comfortable, waterproof against early morning dew and the odd shower, and non-slip.View image in fullscreenVinyl mug warmer£15 at Mustard£18.79 at AmazonHouse full of mugs of half-drunk hot drinks that have gone cold?

The infuser can also be removed if using teabags, and the whole thing is dishwasher safe.View image in fullscreenDishoom cookbook and ingredients set£55 at Sous ChefA cookbook can often be hampered by its ingredient list – particularly if it involves exotic extracts or specialist spices. Fortunately, Sous Chef has an ingenious solution, pairing popular recipes with all those hard-to-find flourishes, unlocking the dishes that can’t be made with the contents of your local corner shop. This set has cranked up my curry game, and the addition of urid beans and ginger paste has had the smells of Dishoom’s signature black dal wafting from the kitchen.View image in fullscreenHand-thrown stoneware mug£32 at EtsyThe Village Pottery’s stoneware ceramics are hand-thrown on the outskirts of Bristol, and its mugs have been a staple of my morning ritual for years. While there are five different glazes to pick from and the option to add a short personalised stamp, whichever you choose, the artisanal production process means it will be one of a kind. They’re also dishwasher safe and have survived the odd knock from me, and still look as fresh after thousands of brews as they did on their first.View image in fullscreenWhite Mausu peanut rāyu£6.95 at Ocado£7.84 at AmazonThis crispy chilli oil is so versatile, and its balance of heat, sweet, salt and crunch has been the perfect accompaniment on everything from scrambled eggs to stir-fries.

It comes with a penny for good luck, too, ensuring relationships are kept intact thisChristmas.View image in fullscreenTortilla press£29.50 at Masa TortillasThis Mexican-made stainless steel (15cm) tortilla press is great if he loves taco night.

Although rum has a reputation for being strong or best mixed, the aged, dark variety can be as deep in flavour and pleasant on the palate as a single malt. This double-aged rum from Dominican-based distillery Brugal 1888 is made for sipping, and has a subtle, smoky profile for those who are fans of the peaty stuff.View image in fullscreenLicor 43 liquor, 70cl£16.92 at Asda£16.92 at AmazonIf you’ve bought the espresso machine from further up this list (or are buying for a coffee connoisseur), they might also enjoy this vanilla-infused Spanish liquor.

Blending the stories of modern-day adventurers with the latest scientific research, it looks at the benefits of trying things out of the ordinary(although reading it has laid the foundations for attempts at even more ridiculous fitness challenges and the early onset of my mid-life crisis).FashionView image in fullscreenPaul Smith socks£17.60 at Yards Store£23 at Paul SmithWhile your budget may not stretch to one of his suits, a pair of Paul Smith socks in block stripes should be within reach.

I know James Buckley from The Inbetweeners very well. His character is an example of a comedic bully. But as a lifelong fan of The Simpsons, I’m going to have to say my favourite is Nelson Muntz.View image in fullscreenTom Felton  in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway at The Lyric Theatre.Photograph: CJ Rivera/Invision/APWhat’s the biggest fish you’ve ever caught?TopTrampA 37lb 4oz common carp caught on the St Lawrence river in New York state 15 years ago. Chris, my older brother, got me into fishing, while he was my chaperone on Harry Potter. My mum chaperoned me for the first film, and my grandfather for the second. He looked so much like a wizard that [director] Chris Columbus cast him at the teachers’ table next to Dumbledore. Then my brother was commandeered. He was one of the worst chaperones in history – all he seemed to do was sleep the entire day – but that’s probably because we’d been up all night, fishing. Some days we’d leave set at 6pm, drive two hours back to Surrey where we lived, go straight to a lake, cast our rods, set up a tent, sleep – barely – for a few hours, wake at 6am, pack up, and head straight back to Hogwarts. It was a great introduction to a lifelong passion of being outdoors, fishing and walking the dogs.What are the advantages of being a blond?snazpizaz2I’ll tell you there are disadvantages to dyeing your hair every nine days; the fact I still have hair at all is remarkable. Thankfully, I wear a wig for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, but it does immediately put you into a Malfoy mood if your hair is platinum blonde. I do agree with Barbie: blonds have more fun.View image in fullscreenRowan Atkinson from Mr Bean in 1997.Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto/AllstarIf you could join the cast of any TV series, past or present, which would you like to appear in?writeronthestormI love the idea of Mr Bean, because he’s so universally respected and understood because there’s no language. I can only imagine how brief the scripts must have looked. I’m introducing some of my American colleagues to the joys of English sitcoms. I mentioned Only Fools and Horses and someone said: “What’s that?” I said: “Hold on,” pulled up the clip of Del Boy and Trigger at the bar and watched it three or four times in a row.I just watched thetrailer for Fackham Halland it looks wonderfully silly. I laughed out loud at some of the gags – in particular, the one where you absentmindedly fire a poorly aimed hunting rifle.

Chadwick was such a professional and definitely cut from a different cloth. He reminded me of Andy Serkis, who was a real gentleman when we were doing Rise of the Planet of the Apes, but who would turn into a whole different beast the moment they said “Action”, and drag me across the floor as Caesar the ape. The ferocity with which Chadwick threw me into a car!

I’ve gone down this rabbit hole. But I’m not an author and I am aware it was written perfectly, the films were adapted perfectly, and the stage show is brilliant. I’m a fan, but I’m not a megafan to the point where I’ve written my own fan fiction. There’s a lot of fan fiction on Dramione – that’s where Draco and Hermione get together.

The giant matchstick figure denotes movement and energy, risk and possibility. As Shapiro himself has said, it is supposed to “reconfigure depending on how you look at it”.It has the perfect home at the Kennedy Center, the vast cultural hub for ballet and opera, stage productions and concerts. And it resonates on a new level now as the venue prepares to host Friday’sWorld Cupdraw, at which the competing nations at next summer’s extravaganza in the United States, Canada and Mexico will discover their group opponents and knockout round pathways. Because from one angle it is plain that Blue is executing a raking pass. From another, it is a spectacular side-on volley. Squint a little and it is Ciao, the Italia 90 mascot.Quick GuideWenger backs France as 'super-favourite' for 2026 World CupShowArsène Wenger has described France as the “super-favourite” for next summer’s World Cup based on their enviable attacking options and major tournament knowhow.The former Arsenal manager, who is now Fifa’s chief of global football development, cannot see beyond his native France, who won the World Cup in 2018 and were the runners-up in 2022.The France manager, Didier Deschamps, can call upon an array of talent for his front line including Kylian Mbappé, Ousmane Dembélé, Hugo Ekitiké, Marcus Thuram, Désiré Doué, Bradley Barcola and Michael Olise.Wenger was asked to assess England’s chances and he essentially called them nearly men, though he accepted they too had the quality to win. However, it was not long before he found himself talking up France.“England will be one of the favourites,” Wenger said. “They are always nearly there to win it – semi-finals, quarter-final, final. They have to make the next step. They have the quality to do it.“I believe in Europe, trying to be as objective as possible, that France is the super-favourite just for one reason – it is the country which has more world-class strikers than any other country in the world. By having four knockout stages [in the expanded 48-team tournament] … to have such a bench with such good quality will make a difference.“There is one thing that is important in life is that when you know you can do it … when you have done something, it gives you something extra, the belief that you can do it. France has been in the last two finals so we know they can be there and they have the quality of the players.”David HytnerPhotograph: Michael Regan/FIFAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Kennedy was a champion of the arts and he was determined to have a national centre for them in the capital city, pushing hard to fund it. Two months after his assassination in 1963, it was decided by Congress that it should be named after him.Washington DC is steeped in grandeur and self-assurance. It honours the most revered American presidents in style. You do not have to walk far from the White House to marvel at the monument to George Washington; when it was completed in 1884, it was the tallest structure in the world. Or to find memorials to Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, to Theodore and Franklin D Roosevelt.View image in fullscreenUS president Donald Trump puts himself centre stage at the Club World Cup final, as bemused Chelsea players look on.Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty ImagesAs the gaze of the world prepares to fall on the Kennedy Center, to remember JFK, to feel a rush of excitement, it is his most recent successor in the Oval Office who has his elbows out, making a familiar dash for centre stage. It was confirmed on Tuesday thatDonald Trumpwould attend the draw and confirmation is the appropriate word. There was never the scintilla of doubt about the president clearing a window in his schedule; Trump is not a man to miss an opportunity.Nobody at Chelsea will forget Trump’s appearance on the podium for their Club World Cup trophy lift in New Jersey last summer and it even led to a question for the USA manager, Mauricio Pochettino. Would he allow Trump to get in on the celebrations in the unlikely event of a US World Cup win?“For sure, I will give him the trophy and he can lift it … no problem for me,” Pochettino said. “Maybe he’s not a soccer person, and he was a little bit in a situation [at the Club World Cup] where he didn’t know what to do, but it was funny. That is America.”Fifa had originally planned to stage the draw in Las Vegas – as it did for the 1994 World Cup, when the US were the lone hosts. As an aside, Bill Clinton, the president at the time, did not attend. But Trump pushed for Washington, even though it is not among the 16 host cities.Trump has made another move. One of the musical acts on Friday will be the Village People and they will play their disco classic YMCA – which Trump has used as an anthem for his Make America Great Again rallies. The group performed at Trump’s inauguration event for his second presidency.Revealed: Myanmar junta ‘crony’ given key role behind Fifa peace prizeRead moreThenthere is the Fifa peace prize, the brainchild of the organisation’s president, Gianni Infantino, who is a devoted member of the court of Trump. When the latter, to use the football parlance, was “robbed of” the Nobel peace prize by María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan politician, Infantino did what every good friend of a world leader ought to do – he created an alternative prize. There are a growing number of cynics who suggest that Trump is poised to collect it.If and when that happens, it would not change a simple truth: the draw is not about Trump. It is about firing the starting gun on the most important tournament in football, the pinnacle. It is about the hopes and dreams of every participant in every team; every fan. They range from those connected to the Big Four nations, as Spain, Argentina, France and England (in that order of seeding) have come to be known. They will be placed in different quadrants to ensure they do not meet before the semi-finals, assuming they win their groups and progress.Quick GuideWorld Cup 2026 draw: pots and playoffsShowPot 1:Canada (world ranking 27), Mexico (15), USA (14); Spain (1), Argentina (2), France (3), England (4), Brazil (5), Portugal (6), Netherlands (7), Belgium (8), Germany (9).Pot 2:Croatia (10), Morocco (11), Colombia (13), Uruguay (16), Switzerland (17), Japan (18), Senegal (19), Iran (20), South Korea (22), Ecuador (23), Austria (24), Australia (26).Pot 3:Norway (29), Panama (30), Egypt (34), Algeria (35), Scotland (36), Paraguay (39), Tunisia (40), Côte d’Ivoire (42), Uzbekistan (50), Qatar (51), Saudi Arabia (60), South Africa (61).Pot 4:Jordan (66), Cape Verde (68), Ghana (72), Curaçao (82), Haiti (84), New Zealand (86); four European playoff teams, two intercontinental playoff teams.European playoffs:Path AWales (32) v Bosnia (71), Italy (12) v Northern Ireland (69)Path BUkraine (28) v Sweden (43), Poland (31) v Albania (63)Path CSlovakia (45) v Kosovo (80), Turkey (25) v Romania (47)Path DCzechia (44) v Rep of Ire (59), Denmark (21) v N Macedonia (65)Intercontinental playoffs:DR Congo (56) v New Caledonia (149) or Jamaica (70)Iraq (58) v Bolivia (76) or Suriname (123).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.And they get to the New Four. Uzbekistan, Jordan, Cape Verde and Curaçao (in that order of seeding) will play at their first World Cup. The number of debutants will swell if any of Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Suriname and New Caledonia emerge from the playoffs next March. The ties will account for the final six places in the expanded 48-team tournament.It can sound corny when players and managers talk about fulfilling childhood dreams at the World Cup. But the emotion during qualification has been real. The scenes, for example, when Scotland secured their first spot at a finals since France 98 with theepic Hampden Park victoryover Denmark will live for ever. And how about when Cape Verde got there with the home win over Eswatini? Africa had five places for Qatar 22. They now have a guaranteed nine. It will be 10 if the Democratic Republic of the Congo win their playoff final against New Caledonia or Jamaica.View image in fullscreenThe official balls for the World Cup draw are seen on stage at the Kennedy Center.Photograph: Michael Regan/Fifa/Getty ImagesFifa has assigned every group game to a stadium but will wait until Saturday before it says which teams play in each game. It will also reveal the kick-off times in what will have the feel of a follow-up ceremony, beginning at 5pm GMT (noon EST). After Friday’s draw, which also starts at 5pm GMT, teams will at least have either/or answers for where they play and will know their general region. It will mark the start of an arms race for training bases, long-researched options suddenly whittled down.In Washington on Thursday, it was hard to see any evidence that the draw was about to take place. Or to find many locals aware of it. But it will be supersized because that is how things are over here – and not just the security for Trump.Heidi Klum and Kevin Hart will host the show. Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger will perform. Rio Ferdinand and Samantha Johnson are the draw hosts. Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Shaquille O’Neal and Aaron Judge – legends of the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB – are the draw assistants. Brady and Gretzky were in Trump’s VIP suite at the Club World Cup final.It will be easy for supporters of a certain age to cast their minds back to USA 94. The Roberto Baggio penalty miss. The Diana Ross penalty miss. The Republic of Ireland storming to the last 16. USA reaching the last 16. No England.

It was certainly more than most survivors of deepfake image-based abuse could expect.They had met as students and bonded over their shared love of music. In the years since graduation, he’d also become her support system, the friend she reached for each time she learned that her images and personal details had been posted online without her consent. Jodie’s pictures, along with her real name and correct bio, were used on many platforms for fake dating profiles, then adverts for sex work, then posted on to Reddit and other online forums with invitations to deepfake them into pornography. The results ended up on porn sites. All this continued for almost two years, until Jodie finally worked out who was doing it — her best friend – identified more of his victims, compiled 60 pages of evidence, and presented it to police. She had to try two police stations, having been told at the first that no crime had been committed. Ultimately he admitted to 15 charges of “sending messages that were grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing nature” and received a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for two years.At that time, there were no laws against deepfake intimate image abuse, although experts had beenraising the alarm since 2016. “I felt really lucky to get a conviction, something that will affect the rest of his life,” says Jodie. Her main focus in the months that followed had to be her recovery. “I was in a dark place,” she says. “I’m not ashamed to say I was suicidal. I couldn’t sleep, and when I did, I had nightmares.” More than two years passed before she felt ready to campaign for change, starting by telling her story on BBC Radio 4’s File on 4 in April 2024. “The more I learned, the more I understood and that brought rage,” says Jodie, who works in financial services. “I gradually realised the significance of there being no law which held him accountable for the deepfake abuse – and I wanted change.”Within little more than a year, she had it. The Data (Use and Access) Act, which received royal assent in June, has made the creation of a deepfake intimate image without consent a criminal offence and also criminalised requesting others to create the deepfake image – as her best friend had when he posted images of Jodie on forums. Both now carry a custodial sentence of up to six months, as well as an unlimited fine. It’s a huge victory won fast in a space where progress has been mind-bendingly slow. However, this isn’t the story of a new government determined to tackle an ever-evolving crime. It was fought for and pushed through by a small group of victims and experts who formed a WhatsApp group called Heroes.Jodie joined the group last year, shortly after the File on 4 programme aired. She had been invited to the House of Lords to meet Charlotte Owen,Boris Johnson’s controversial appointment, who had taken her seat the previous summer. Lady Owen was theyoungest life peer in historywhen she arrived in the Lords, aged 30, and she was intent on tackling deepfake intimate image abuse. “It was rapidly proliferating, and such a huge threat,” says Owen. “Loads of women my age were very concerned about it, but it wasn’t getting the spotlight.”The Lords were blown away by these brilliant women. Lots of the peers referenced them in their subsequent speechesOwen organised a core group of experts and campaigners, which included Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University;the Revenge Porn Helpline;Not Your Porn;MyImageMyChoice; the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW); and survivors such as Jodie. They formed a tight team in the WhatsApp group Owen set up, aiming to criminalise the creation and requesting of deepfake intimate image abuse. They were braced for a long fight. “In those initial conversations, I was under the impression that it was going to take years,” says Jodie, “so I’ve been kind of gobsmacked by how quickly it happened.”It isn’t surprising that expectations were low. Since 2015 and thefirst lawto address so-called “revenge porn”, legal protections have been patchy and piecemeal, always months or years behind the latest development in intimate image abuse.View image in fullscreenClare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University, and member of the Heroes WhatsApp group.Photograph: Courtesy of Clare McGlynn“There has been such a resistance to taking any action in parliament, a complete lack of urgency and absence of interest,” says McGlynn. “Even back in 2015, when they passed the first law against sharing private sexual materials, myself and others were saying that it ought to include altered images because we were already seeing women who had been Photoshopped. The government response was that altered images weren’t sufficiently harmful to be included.”The protections that were afforded in that early legislation were full of holes. One glaring example was that it made the sharing of intimate images without consent a crime only if it could be proved that this had been done with “intent to cause distress”. Doing it for a laugh, to impress friends, or for sexual gratification wasn’t a crime at all. (After a decade of campaigning, this should finally be rectified in thecrime and policing bill, but it still hasn’t quite happened yet.)By 2019, cases of intimate image abuse reported to police hadmore than doubled, and cyberflashing and deepfakes had emerged, so the Law Commission was asked to examine whether new laws were required. It took three years – the final report, theIntimate Image Abusereport, was not published until July 2022. “In these years between, we were writing to MPs about what was happening to women and girls and what needed to be done, but the response was always, ‘We just need to wait for the final report’,” says McGlynn. “Five lines added to a piece of legislation could have made a massive difference to millions of women’s lives, but any changes we put forward were rejected.” The report did conclude that the sharing of deepfake abuse should be criminalised – as a result, the Online Safety Act 2023 has made it an offence to share deepfake intimate images without consent. However, criminalising thecreationof deepfakes was not recommended. (It acknowledged that “this may be disappointing to those who have been victims of such behaviour”.)18:40My Blonde GF:  a disturbing story of deepfake pornographyThe “Heroes” group set out to change this, and McGlynn at last had some reason to feel hope. They finally had someone on the inside. “Charlotte was right in the middle of the legislative process, and that was essential,” she says. Elena Michael, co-founder ofNot Your Porn, which supports victims of intimate image abuse and campaigns for change, agrees. “For a decade, the victims and experts working in the field have been kept in separate rooms to the people making the laws, and the laws we’ve had just haven’t worked,” she says. “When the government doesn’t listen to survivors, they’re not just devaluing their experience, they’re also discarding their expertise. These women have had to fight for years. There’s nothing they don’t know about what change is needed.View image in fullscreenElena Michael, co-founder of Not Your Porn.Photograph: Courtesy of Elena Michael“When Charlotte called me up to meet me, I was really excited,” she continues. “From the beginning, she was always about listening and meeting as many victims as she could. She wanted to hear stories and understand every single facet.”The campaign kicked off in February last year, with Owen’s question in the chamber on deepfake porn and why its harms were not deemed serious enough to criminalise. “It’s a good way of seeing if people care about the issue,” says Owen, “and in the House of Lords, people were shocked. There was so much support.”The following month, her speech for International Women’s Day again focused on deepfakes. In May, she was drawn from the private members’ bill ballot and set about creating a bill that was essentially written by the women she had gathered together. It criminalised the making of sexually explicit deepfakes and the requesting of them. It was consent-based – if the deepfake was made without consent, it was a crime; the intentions behind it made no difference. It included forced deletion – anyone convicted of creating a deepfake image would be forced to delete it. This was crucial, given one victim’s experience when, after a conviction for intimate image abuse, police returned devices to her perpetrator with the images still on them. “Every single line represented a woman’s real experience,” says Owen.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Owen in the House of Lords chamber in November 2023.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty ImagesAll those women, including Jodie, were invited to the Lords for briefings and attended all the subsequent debates. “That was the most poignant part,” says Owen. “The Lords were blown away by these brilliant women. When they sat in the gallery, lots of the peers referenced them in their subsequent speeches.” There was strong cross-party support but by its second reading the government indicated it would not support it, as it wanted to address the issue itself. “We were gutted,” says Owen. “But I don’t really take no for an answer.”Instead, Owen took the contents of the bill and tabled them as amendments to the data bill that was already before the Lords. (“It was the perfect opening,” she says.) The government response was initially an insistence on writing its own amendment instead, but its first attempt did not make the offence consent-based, instead linking the offence to specific intentions. After a lot of argument, including a dossier from McGlynn, itU-turned.“By now, everything was moving so fast. We were messaging and meeting and updating pretty much all the time,” says Jodie. Every element they were asking for was met with resistance, so required more presentations, new evidence, legal argument, extra briefings.Being with these women who were all so passionate, and who just got it – they have healed me. It’s as simple as thatWhile the government agreed to criminalise the creation of deepfakes, it initially objected to criminalising the requesting of them. Early drafts also applied a statutory time limit to the offence, which meant it could only be prosecuted within six months of being committed. (Many victims don’t discover the images online until outside that time frame.) Iman Mazhari – an abuse survivor and volunteer with Not Your Porn – spotted this at the 11th hour. Her perpetrator had escaped a harassment charge (but was convicted of others) because it “timed out”, so she is, she says, “obsessed with statutory time limits”. Mazhari emailed McGlynn, who drafted a clause that Owen added to the amendment with days to spare.View image in fullscreenIman Mazhari.Photograph: Courtesy of Iman MazhariAnother point of conflict with the government was whether or not the crime should carry a possible prison sentence – the government first opposed this, but Owen believed it was essential as a deterrent. (In her speech, she pointed out that you can go to prison for fly-tipping. Why was the violation of someone’s consent less important?) “Every single word, every line, we were arguing over,” says Owen.When the bill passed in June, Jodie was watching from the balcony with other survivors of deepfake abuse and McGlynn. “Charlotte left the chamber and sat up there with us,” she says. “It was a gorgeous evening. It felt like we were in a film, and at the end of it, we had a glass of champagne and toasted all the women who had worked for this.“On the way home, on the tube by myself, the enormity of it really hit me and I just sobbed. We’d fought so hard and achieved so much. Being with these women who were all so passionate, and who just got it – they have healed me. It’s as simple as that.”It’s not the end, of course. The new law still needs to be fully implemented and as yet there is no date on this. “There’s so much more to do,” says McGlynn. There will also certainly be future forms of AI abuse not covered by this legislation. “If I had my way, I’d introduce a general legal provision that would cover all forms of intimate violation and intimate intrusion so we don’t need to start a new campaign every single time the technology moves on and the abuse changes,” say McGlynn. “We also need better processes to get material removed swiftly and easily, and hold non-compliant platforms to account.“Still, this is significant progress,” she adds. “We’re now able to say, ‘Creating this stuff without consent is wrong.’ It’s unlawful and it’s wrong. The message is clear and that’s great.”*Not her real nameIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

His greatest ruse? A tax-dodging snail empireJim WatersonThu 4 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareIt is a drizzly October afternoon and I am sitting in a rural Lancashire pub drinking pints of Moretti with London’s leading snail farmer and a convicted member of the Naples mafia. We’re discussing the best way to stop a mollusc orgy.The farmer, a 79-year-old former shoe salesman called Terry Ball who has made and lost multiple fortunes, has been cheerfully telling me in great detail for several hours about how he was inspired by former Conservative minister Michael Gove to use snails to cheat local councils out of tens of millions of pounds in taxes.His method is simple. First, he sets up shell companies that breed snails in empty office blocks. Then he claims that the office block is legally, against all indications to the contrary, a farm, and therefore exempt from paying taxes. “They’re sexy things,” chuckles Ball in a broad Blackburn accent, describing the speed with which two snails can incestuously multiply into dozens of specimens if they’re left alone in a box for a few weeks. Snails love group sex and cannibalism, he warns.As the conversation drifts away from snail breeding he describes personal connections to a very prominent member of the House of Commons, his years hiding Italian mafia killers while they were on the run, and the potential market for snail salami. Almost everything he tells me seems improbable, yet everything I could later verify checks out. I’ve got little reason to doubt the rest.We’re drinking with “Joseph”, a snail farm employee. An hour earlier I’d seen him using a cleaver to chop up lettuce to feed thousands of the animals. They’re then shipped out to premises across the country, including four big snail farms they’re currently running in London. Taking out his phone, Ball shows off pictures of another man, “my mafia boss friend”, posing with the legendary Napoli footballer Diego Maradona in the 1980s.Joseph, who speaks with an unusual Italian-Lancastrian accent, turns out to be a man called Giuseppe from Naples. In a very matter-of-fact manner, Giuseppe explains how he previously spent four years inside prison because a former friend, a convicted mafia murderer, turned into an informant and helped the Italian authorities convict his former criminal colleagues. Ball says he has employed Giuseppe to look after his tax-dodging snails as a thank you. Giuseppe once warned him not to travel to Italy, at a time when the snail magnate might have been prosecuted due to the confessions of the same informant.Three hours earlier I knew none of this. I’d turned up unannounced at Ball’s snail farm HQ with a faint hope that I might catch a glimpse of the man behind one of the most brazen tax dodges I’d ever encountered.Standing by the concrete snail statues that guard the security gate outside the snail farm, I’d expected to be told to piss off. Instead, I was met by Giuseppe, who phoned his boss. Seemingly intrigued by a journalist who had travelled 250 miles from London to stand in the rain without an appointment, I was told to come back an hour later for the first ever interview with Ball, a man whose photo had never even appeared online until now.Over the ensuing hours, Ball makes confession after confession about his attempts to outwit the taxman with increasingly elaborate plans, his decades-long links to the Naples underworld, and how at this very moment there are buildings across London where he is deploying his unique snail-breeding method in a bid to cheat exasperated local councils out of millions of pounds. “I’m turning 80 next month and I haven’t got jack shit in my name. What are they going to do?” Ball tells me with a chuckle, when asked if he’s worried about prosecution. “You can’t take nothing off nothing. They’ve stopped torturing people.”View image in fullscreenTerry Ball at L’Escargotiere HQ in Ribchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianBall is proudly committed to spending his remaining years on this earth finding innovative ways to get revenge on the “bastard” authorities who he feels screwed him over in the past: “I just do it for devilment. I do it just to get away with it.”None of this, it is fair to say, is normal. But almost nothing about this story is.Right now, if you take the tube to Edgware Road and walk a few minutes down Old Marylebone Road you’ll find Winchester House, a 1970s office block that is awaiting redevelopment. If you head up to the sixth floor and put your ear to the door, you just might hear the low-level hum of snails in boxes munching lettuce and breeding.All of the snails inside the office block are living inside sacks branded with L’Escargotiere, the name of Ball’s snail farm. For Ball, these molluscs’ sole purpose in life is reproducing in order to enable tax avoidance.View image in fullscreenOne of the offices holding snails in Winchester House.Photograph: Westminster councilThe tenants of the various floors of the office block have names like Snai1 Primary Products (2023) Ltd. All of them are companies registered by Terry Ball for £35 a go. He is the sole director of each of them but tells me he has no intention of filing accounts for them and no plan to pay any taxes. They don’t take any income or hold any assets. They’re just shell companies created to sign the legal paperwork. Every so often a local council successfully has one liquidated for unpaid debts, so Ball just phoenixes it – abandoning the old company (and with it, its debts) and starting a new one. Westminster is now seeking to recover more than £286,000 from Ball’s companies, which it says are running multiple tax-avoiding snail farms in Winchester House.Ball’s desk is covered in stacks of brown envelopes addressed to his various shell companies. I spot some featuring the logos of HMRC and Companies House, while others come from Westminster and Barnet councils. At one point the businessman proudly holds up a stack of paperwork relating to the Old Marylebone Road property to highlight how Westminster council appears to have accidentally approved some of the farms.Most people understand the concept of council tax, which is paid by people living in houses and flats to their local authority. Business rates are the commercial equivalent, paid by the occupant of an office, shop, or other non-residential property. Under a rule change introduced by Gordon Brown in 2008, if a commercial building has no tenant then the landlord has to pay the property tax in full.This means a landlord with an empty office or shop in a major city can quickly find themselves paying hundreds of thousands of pounds a year in business rates, despite having no income. One solution is for the landlord to let the office out to a legitimate tenant on the cheap. Another is for them to find someone who will accept a small fee in return for signing a lease and taking on legal responsibility for paying the taxes.This could be an overseas student willing to claim they are running a gift shop who can amass a large tax bill before fleeing the country. Or it could be someone running a business that has a complete exemption from paying business rates, such as an agricultural enterprise. This category, Ball clocked while reading tax guidance at two o’clock one morning in the 2010s, includes fish farms.View image in fullscreenSnails cross copies of legislation that Ball says provides the legal grounds to enable his tax avoidance scheme.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianThe problem is that running a fish farm in a central London office block is very complicated. Breeding salmon is tricky as you’ve got nowhere to release them. You could breed crustaceans such as lobsters, but they need lots of love and attention to ensure they meet food hygiene laws.But in the small print of the HMRC guidance, Ball noticed that there was a further clarification regarding the law. In the late 1980s, a government minister told parliament that the legal definition of a fish farm includes a site breeding “molluscs of any description”, a rule designed to cover oysters. The minister confirmed that, as land-based snails are also molluscs, any business breeding snails for human food consumption is legally a fish farm – and potentially exempt from business rates.L’Escargotiere HQ is located on the edge of the tiny picturesque village of Ribchester, an ancient settlement in the Ribble Valley between Preston and Blackburn. “It’s a very middle-class village,” says one resident. “It’s like something out of a Joanna Trollope novel.”Inside a recently built corrugated metal shed is a giant freezer containing 6,000 snails in suspended animation, awaiting their deployment to another office block. The snail farm’s website says they will sell you 1kg of the animals for a mere £14, but it doesn’t look like there’s much direct-to-consumer trade. A caravan sits outside, alongside a bonfire, plus a number of holiday chalets being marketed for up to £200,000. The snail farm, partly approved on the basis it would be an educational tourist attraction, is the subject of a planning dispute with the local council.View image in fullscreenBall in his office.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianBall’s daughter invites me into the building and sits me down in his office. True to tax-avoiding form, the office has been subdivided into different units that are all supposedly run by different companies controlled by Ball. One door has a sign saying the company specialises in “the development of snail extract mucus, skin creams, and beauty products”. The whole block has cables dangling from the ceiling. Behind the big wooden desk is Ball’s large leather chair. The scene reminds me of the lawyer Saul Goodman’s office in Breaking Bad.Ball walks in with a glint in his eye and begins talking. He barely stops for an hour while he tells me his life story. He is a man driven by a commitment to ruining the lives of tax collectors by exploiting loopholes. Whether the loopholes actually work is another matter.In his telling, Ball was born into poverty in postwar Blackburn, sharing a bed with his siblings while his father, Tommy, ran a market stall selling cut-price shoes in the mill town. What started as a small enterprise became a chain of shops across the north-west of England that, as the BBC reported after Tommy’s death in 2008, “revolutionised the footwear business”. It was built around a discount model based on buying factory seconds, products rejected for minor blemishes. His shops attracted coach trips from across the north of England.Terry left school at 14 and followed his father into the shoe business, eventually going into direct competition with him following a family feud. In the early 1970s, Terry began to travel to Italy to pick up discount shoes. He was, he claims as he holds up a dusty old leather shoe that sits on a shelf in his snail farm office, the only man to secure seconds from the late Giorgio Armani’s factories.The problem, he claims, was getting the shoes back to the UK. Prior to the European Union he would lose shoes to corrupt officials at every border along the route. Then he encountered the Neapolitan mafia, who controlled the local port. Rather than drive a lorry across Europe, he discovered he could simply pay the local customs agent in Naples and have them shipped straight to the UK. Thus began a decades-long relationship with the Camorra, the dominant mafia organisation in Naples.“I did them favours, they did me favours,” said Ball.Terry Ball says that at various points he has been a multimillionaire. He owned big houses and property across the north-west of England. He experimented with different businesses, at one point distributing a beer called “Shag” and employing PR Max Clifford to concoct a successful media campaign to get it banned from Australia.It was in the late 2000s, Ball explains, that he was radicalised on business rates, when a friend of his decided to liquidate a long-running family business. They wanted to do good by all their employees and pay their taxes, but were left during the financial crisis with an empty building they couldn’t sell that was running up tax debts to the local council. Michael Gove, Ball says, was the one man who had warned of this impact of Gordon Brown’s decision to impose business rates on empty buildings. “Why should you pay tax if there’s no income?” he asks. Ball waves around an annotated copy of a parliamentary speech by Gove, then a shadow planning minister, that he keeps on his desk.View image in fullscreenConcrete snails guard the entrance of Ball’s snail farm in Ribchester.Photograph: Jim Waterson/LondoncentricAround this time Ball and his family were taken to court multiple times for attempting to evade taxes by repeatedly phoenixing companies and shuffling assets around different businesses. He was left defending himself and lost badly. Ball was declared bankrupt and banned from being a company director for nine years until 2016. This set him on a path to depriving the taxman through innovative methods: “I said you got £600,000 off me. I’m going to get £20m off you.”In 2018 he began opening snail farm businesses in empty commercial premises on behalf of landlords, who paid his company 20% of the empty unit tax they were saving. This followed years of trials on how to keep them alive for extended periods of time. The snails, of which he bredHelix aspersa muller– the common garden snail – needed to stay alive for weeks at a time to meet the legal definition of a farm, but this was tricky. “The mortality rate is very high,” he says. “If you put more than two in a box you get cannibalism and you get snail orgies.”Fresh food in the boxes went rotten, attracting flies and maggots. After three years of experimenting he says his breakthrough came with a trip to a local branch of Pets at Home, where he found hamster food that worked better. He worked out how to fatten up the snails, stick them into a freezer to hibernate, then drop them on to a site where they could breed and eat through their existing body fat for an extended period without the need for a human visit.“I’m the ideas man,” Ball said, insisting he charges a modest fee to landlords for his attempts to reduce their tax bills. “We’re not robbers. We cover our costs. It’s the principle I don’t like.”At first Ball sold his tax avoidance services under the brand name Crusader and told landlords he could cut the costs of empty property business rates by 93%. His PR was done by a man closely linked to Blackburn Rovers who signed up former Scotland football captain Colin Hendryto promote the company.Business boomed. His daughter helped run it. Councils began raiding the snail farm premises and challenging the agricultural exemptions, leaving the landlords on the hook. A snail farm in Liverpool was raided. Earlier this year, Westminster council told the Sunday Times about one of the farms, a story Ball shared with friends on WhatsApp. In one notable 2021court case in Leeds, a judge ruled conclusively that Ball’s snail farm was tax avoidance. Ball blames the very public Leeds setback on a landlord failing to abide by the strict guidance he sets out for his clients. (For his scheme to work, Ball says, it is essential that buildings are used solely as snail farms, and not for other purposes at any point.) In addition, some of his tax-avoiding landlords failed to pay his fees, a lack of respect which annoyed him.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianBall says he is now looking to diversify into a new “pop-up charity shop” business rates avoidance plan, exploiting a loophole in Charity Commission rules designed for tiny charities. A landlord will give him the keys to an office block and he will set up a “charity shop” and arrange for a small number of people to buy giant bags of mixed goods for a single day. The landlord will claim a substantial business rates discount on the basis it’s the premises for an unregistered charity. To enable this new tax dodge, he’s filled every corner of his snail farm with hundreds of thousands of pounds of cheap Chinese goods and toys. Ball insists I leave with a plastic crossbow for my child.With Ball having happily confessed to enabling wide-scale tax avoidance through the medium of snails, the interview comes to an end. I’m shown the heliciculture centre a final time. Then things get substantially stranger. Ball begins talking with Giuseppe, fresh from chopping up snail food, about a former mutual acquaintance called Gennaro Panzuto.Panzuto, the two men say while loading YouTube videos on their phones, is now building a career as an actor and influencer known as Genny Earthquake, who featured in a 2024 Ross Kempdocumentary about the Italian mafia in Britain. But in his previous life Panzuto was a key member of the Camorra criminal organisation and was jailed in Italy for murder, mafia association, extortion, drug trafficking, arms trafficking and money laundering.The two men laugh at Panzuto’s new existence as a TikTok influencer and anti-mafia campaigner. “I hid him for years,” Ball tells me, unprompted, pointing at the video of the convicted mafia killer.Pardon?“I HID HIM FOR YEARS,” Ball repeats, again pointing at the video. “Do you want a pint?”A few years ago, the BBC’s home affairs correspondentDominic Casciani interviewedan apparently repentant Panzuto inside a maximum security prison in Italy. The former “mafia kingpin” and senior member of the Piccirillo clan sat down and described his long life of crime on the streets of Naples and the murders he had committed.Back in 2006, Panzuto realised the Italian authorities were on to him. He urgently needed to flee the country. According to the BBC’s account, one of Panzuto’s closest associates in Naples “had made deep connections to an organised crime gang in north-west England” involved in the sale of shoes. The gang was headed by a businessman “who appeared to be an entirely upstanding member of his community”.Panzuto got in touch with the mysterious businessman, who offered him an escape and a new identity. When Panzuto arrived at Liverpool John Lennon airport, the businessman supposedly sent a Rolls-Royce to take him straight to a Lancashire pub for a pint of ale.Panzuto told the BBC he was sometimes baffled by the indiscreet actions of the businessman, who paid to house him in a Lancashire caravan park and occasionally asked for debt enforcement activities in return.While Italian crime was bloody and messy, Panzuto found that British crime was mundane and profitable. He was astonished to be shown how easy it was to commit tax evasion in the UK, concluding Britain had far less enforcement of financial regulation than his native Italy. Unlike the Camorra, his story went, his British host didn’t need to sell drugs, or extort money from local businesses. Instead, the British businessman simply shifted goods around from company to company, while dodging the taxes that other traders had to legitimately cough up.The BBC did not name the businessman for legal reasons. But as we sit in the pub, Ball cheerily outs himself as the person in the story who paid to hide Gennaro Panzuto from the authorities. “I’ve known Gennaro’s family for a long time,” he says. “[Hiding him] cost me thousands.”Sipping a pint of Guinness, Ball insists Panzuto overstated various aspects of the tale in the interview. The businessman disputes one detail of the BBC article in particular – he didn’t pick up Panzuto from the airport and he had absolutely not been driving a Rolls-Royce during that period. He’d sold it and had a Bentley by then. “What really happens and what gets in the papers is different,” says Ball. “They make it more flowery. I don’t blame them. That’s their job.”This interview appears to be Ball’s opportunity to finally put his story on the record. Yes, Ball confirms, he did, for many years, offer Camorra gangsters an undercover getaway in rural Lancashire. His lawyer would fix them up with jobs in local restaurants, where they were loved for their willingness to work for free. By way of proof, Ball, who says he’s never sent an email in his life, sits in the pub looking up historic news reports on his phone about our drinking buddy (and his snail farm employee) Giuseppe’s past arrests for drug trafficking and involvement in the Panzuto case.View image in fullscreenBall stands in a refrigerator with boxes of snails ready for dispatch.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianBall insists he was never formally in business with the mafia but they did each other favours. When two factions of the same Naples crime family were at war in the mid-2000s, they asked Ball to mediate. He refused – so they had a summit at the local Lancashire caravan park instead. He says Panzuto’s uncles later personally apologised to Ball that their family member had “blabbed” to the authorities and given evidence. It clearly hurts Ball that he is no longer able to visit Naples. He’d once gone to watch Napoli, the local football club, where his mafia friends arranged for the club’s ultras to chant his name as a visiting dignitary.Giuseppe, who said he served a lengthy jail term off the back of Panzuto’s evidence, recreates the chant in the pub: “TER-REE BALL! TER-REE BALL! TER-REE BALL!”At the end of the BBC piece there is one final twist to Ball’s crime links. Anti-mafia prosecutor Michele Del Prete is quoted as saying he gave the UK authorities all the information he had about Panzuto’s British businessman host. “I remember the British told us that [the businessman] was definitely involved in scams – they’d known about this character,” the prosecutor told the broadcaster back in 2021. “But his links with the Neapolitan Camorra – that was news to them. We don’t know what they did with the information.”The BBC said that Lancashire police did at one point open an investigation but that no one knew what happened to it.In early October, a few days after my visit to Lancashire, enforcement officers from Westminster council accessed Winchester House, the office building on Old Marylebone Road, on the hunt for snails. What they found, according to photos shared with London Centric, was another of Ball’s operations.Humphrey’s world: how the Samuel Smith beer baron built Britain’s strangest pub chainRead moreAdam Hug, the leader of Westminster city council, told me he has repeatedly raised the “ludicrous notion of snail farms” claiming business rates exemptions with central government, but nothing happens. “Rather than unscrupulous traders dropping on one avoidance scheme after another, it would be good to see a general clause on business rates avoidance and evasion which stops these kinds of activities in their tracks. As a local authority with limited resources, we enforce wherever we can. We will be on the trail of the snail racketeers or anyone else who thinks they can cheat the taxpayer.”The property’s landlord, a company based in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands, is controlled by Iraqi businessman Namir El-Akabi, who made a fortune from contracts with western governments in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of his home nation. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment.In late November, Westminster council took one of Ball’s companies to the high court for unpaid taxes. The company was wound up in a hearing that lasted a couple of minutes. Ball didn’t bother to oppose it as he had no intention of paying the tax demand.As Ball drove me back from the pub to Preston railway station in his Jaguar with personalised plates, he discussed what he wants to leave behind to his grandchildren, while simultaneously insisting he has no money in his name.As we passed through local villages, Ball pointed out the various bits of land he’d bought and sold over the years. He also detailed his connections with high-ranking politicians, prominent businessmen, and showed messages he exchanged with a general in the Cambodian army.I kept wondering why he was pushing on with his snail tax avoidance business, even though he was preparing to enter his ninth decade. Ball told me that fighting with the likes of Westminster council over tax helps stave off the boredom of old age: “All my friends who have retired, you can’t have a conversation with them, they’re just waiting to die. I’ve had a laugh. Every day, no matter what happens, I’ve had a laugh.”This article originally appeared inLondon Centric, a new investigative news outlet reporting on the people and money that make London.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere."

We all need better evidenceWes StreetingThe surge in mental ill health is hugely distressing. That’s why I’ve commissioned a review to find out what’s driving itThu 4 Dec 2025 12.34 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 12.39 ESTShareEarlier this year, I appeared on the BBC and was asked a question by Laura Kuenssberg that I hadn’t anticipated: did I believe there’s a problem withmental health overdiagnosis?I gave a simple answer, that yes, I did think there was overdiagnosis, that too many people were being written off, and too many people weren’t getting the support they needed.I was then deluged with messages and emails of both enthusiastic agreement and visceral disagreement – including from mental health clinicians on both sides of the argument. One angry patient messaged to say: “Far from overdiagnosis, I can’t even get an appointment to get a diagnosis.” The worst thing was that I agreed with them, but I had failed to capture the complexity of this problem.The truth is there has been a massive growth in mental health and behavioural issues and there isn’t a consensus within the mental health clinical community on what is driving it. There was an almost 50% increase inmental health problemsamong adults between 1993 and 2023. Mental health referrals for children and young peopleincreased by about 50%in just two years during the pandemic. And13 times morepeople are waiting for an autism assessment today compared with 2019.Whether this is because people are more open about their mental health, there is growing awareness of these conditions, these are consequences of the pandemic or there have been other drivers, we have got to get to the bottom of the causes of this.Because services are not keeping up.As the Darzi investigation uncovered, around 109,000 young people and children were waiting more than a year for their first appointment with a mental health specialist. This is despite an increase in spending on mental health services bymore than 50% since 2019.I know from the personal experience of some of my nearest and dearest the pain this is causing. One has attempted to take their own life after struggling to get any mental health support. A family member has suffered fromthe shortages of medicationfor attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, seriously affecting his mental health. At the same time, I have seen the transformational impact an early autism diagnosis can have for the support and education a child receives.It was following my own episode with foot-in-mouth syndrome on live television that I decided this issue was too important to be left unresolved and required a proper evidence base. That’s why my department has asked the esteemed Prof Peter Fonagy, along with Sir Simon Wessely and Prof Gillian Baird, tolead a reviewinto the prevalence and support for mental health conditions, autism and ADHD. The review brings together some of the most respected researchers, clinicians and voluntary organisations in the country, alongside people with lived experience.I’ve asked them to weigh the data, examine the quality of evidence, diagnose the problem and offer recommendations on how theNHScan meet the needs of all.I’m delighted that this review is backed by Mind, the MentalHealthFoundation, the National Autistic Society, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner for England. All can see the current system is failing, and are motivated by the need to fix it. As Dr Sarah Hughes, Mind’s chief executive, said: “This is a huge opportunity to really understand what is driving increasing levels of mental illness, especially among our young people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the name was trademarked. And my legal ordeal beganYasmin KhanThe granting of patents and trademarks to foods and words from the global south is part of a long colonial grab. It’s time to realise we share what we cook, and what we call itThu 4 Dec 2025 05.39 ESTFirst published on Thu 4 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTShareVegetables, in my experience, rarely cause controversy. Yet last month I found myself in the middle of a legal storm over who gets to own the wordsabzi– the Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Persian, Dari and Pashto word for cooked veg or fresh greens. It was a story as absurd as it was stressful, a chain of delis threatened me with legal action over the title of a book I had spent years creating. But what began as a personal legal headache soon morphed into something bigger, a story about how power and privilege still dominate conversations about cultural ownership in the UK.When the email first landed in my inbox, I assumed it must be a wind-up. My editor at Bloomsbury had forwarded a solicitor’s letter addressed to me personally, care of my publishers. As I read it, my stomach dropped. A deli owner from Cornwall accused me of infringing her intellectual property over my cookbookSabzi: Fresh Vegetarian Recipes for Every Day. Why? Because in 2022, she had trademarked the word sabzi to use for her business and any future products, including a cookbook she hoped to write one day.My jaw clenched as I pored over pages of legal documentation, written in the punitive and aggressive tone of a firm gearing up for a fight. I was accused of “misrepresentation” (copying the deli’s brand), damaging its business and affecting its future growth, and they demanded detailed commercial reports about my work, including sales revenue, stock numbers and distribution contracts – information so intrusive that it felt like an audit. Buried in the legal jargon was a line that shook me. They reserved the right to seek the “destruction” of all items relating to their infringement claim. Reading the threat of my book being pulped was nothing short of devastating. It was also utterly enraging.Because sabzi isn’t some cute exotic brand name, it’s part of the daily lexicon of more than a billion people across cultures and borders. In south Asia, it simply means cooked vegetables. Shout it loudly in any household and someone will instinctively start chopping. For Iranians, sabzi refers to fresh herbs and greens and is part of the national psyche. Iran’s national dish is ghormeh sabzi, a fragrant herb-laden stew, and sabzi is the scent of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, where we eat herbed rice and grow fresh greens as a symbol of rebirth and renewal. As someone of both Pakistani and Iranian heritage, when I first had the idea of writing a vegetarian cookbook back in 2017, I knew that I wanted to call it sabzi to honour the two food cultures I grew up with.View image in fullscreenA man buying sprouting greens in Tehran as Iranians prepare for the Persian New Year, or Nowruz, earlier this year.Photograph: SASAN/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty ImagesBut back to the deli’s threats. My publishers sought legal advice – which was clear: the claims were overreaching and we should fight them. Book titles can’t actually be trademarked and common cultural words should be exempt from intellectual property law (can you imagine if someone tried to trademark common food words like curry, pasta or tapas?) The evidence of alleged business harm was weak, amounting to a few emails from customers who seemingly couldn’t differentiate between the deli owner and my name on the cover of the book. The legal team responded robustly, and I stepped away imagining we’d hear more in a few weeks. Then everything exploded.As someone who has written extensively about infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss, I found the framing jarringOne morning, I opened Instagram to find I was subject of a pile-on accusing me of copying the deli by calling my cookbook Sabzi. I noticed an unusual pattern in the people sending me aggressive messages: they were all women, all white, and all from Cornwall. I traced the comments back to the deli’s page and saw the owner had posted publicly about the legal action, naming me and framing it as a David-v-Goliath battle. This puzzled me, as business chains generally do rather better financially than food writers. Her statement also described herself as a “mother of two”, a detail that was later repeated in press coverage as though maternity itself conferred some kind of moral authority. As someone who has written extensively about infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss, I found the framing jarring. There are many places in the world where motherhood shapes your vulnerability – Sudan, say, or Gaza. But a privately educated deli owner, related by marriage to the former prime minister Clement Attlee, taking legal action against a writer over the title of a book that just means “vegetables” is not one of those situations.View image in fullscreenThe cover of Yasmin’s Khan’s book, which was accused of misrepresentationThe deli owner was working with a PR company to amplify her case so it wasn’t long before local and national journalists started getting in touch. I was dumbfounded as to why the case was being escalated in public, outside legal channels, but it was clear that she was determined to heighten the dispute. She reported my book for trademark infringement on Amazon and overnight it disappeared from the world’s biggest bookseller. Say what you like about Amazon (and I often do), but most books are bought there, particularly in the run-up to Christmas, so it’s an important platform for authors.My editor explained that under Amazon’s policies, only the complainant can revoke an infringement claim, which meant we could be waiting months – possibly until after court proceedings – for my book to reappear online. It was around that time that I stopped being able to sleep. The stress wasn’t abstract any more, it was a direct threat to my livelihood.It was then – in a twist that still feels ridiculous to write – thata letter arrived from the Duchy of Cornwall, one of the monarchy’s oldest feudal estates, on behalf of the deli owner as her landlord. The letter argued in support of the deli’s right to trademark the word sabzi, a plot twist so colonial that I had to check whether the East India Company had been revived. I didn’t have “correspondence with Prince William’s estate about vegetables” on my 2025 bingo card and wondered what would come next. A note from King Charles demanding a Tupperware of leftovers?When a private estate providing income to the crown becomes involved in a legal dispute over the ownership of an Asian word for veg, the legacy of the entitlement at the heart of British colonialism is laid bare. And really, for me, it felt as if colonial entitlement were at the heart of this case. Throughout the saga, some argued that because the deli owner had some Iranian heritage (her father is from Iran and her mother is British), the dispute wasn’t about cultural appropriation. But people of colour know that heritage alone doesn’t guarantee solidarity. British politics offers its own examples of this – Priti Patel, whose family fled persecution in Uganda, and Suella Braverman, whose parents were economic migrants to the UK, have used some of the most inflammatory rhetoric against refugees and migrants in recent memory. You can share a heritage and still uphold the power dynamics of privilege.Because my lawyers advised silence, I couldn’t comment publicly. My friends, however, made up for it. Desi WhatsApp during a scandal is its own news channel: one half outrage, one half jokes about your ancestors rising from the grave. Their fury was laced with a weariness, though. When words born in our grandmothers’ kitchens become entangled in legal battles backed by establishment power, something has gone seriously wrong.This case is part of a much bigger pattern. For decades, companies in the global north, backed by western intellectual property laws, have attempted to control or commercialise food terms and ingredients from the global south. In the UK, the restaurant chain Pho sparked widespread outrage when it issued cease-and-desist letters to other Vietnamese restaurants for using the word “pho” in their names andlater withdrew its trademark after public pressure.A similarbacklash ensuedafter the celebrity chef David Chang’s Momufuku empireattempted to trademark “chili crunch”, a spicy condiment popular in east Asian homes, or when the US company RiceTectried to patent “basmati”, the name of a rice grown in, and deeply entwined, with the heritage of India and Pakistan.Farmers in the global south have long argued that these cases and attempts represent a new form of colonial extractionFarmers and activists in the global south have also fought numerous biopiracy cases, not over words, but over seeds and plants. The examples raise the same questions about who gets to own and profit from traditional food culture. Monsanto’s patent relating to theuse of Nap Hal wheat for chapati flourwas later revoked; the Dutch company Health and Performance Food Internationalsecured patents over teff, Ethiopia’s 4,000-year-old staple grain (though these were later ruled invalid); and South Africa defeatedattempts to trademark rooibos tea– yielding its manufacturers geographic rights over the term, in the same way that champagne, Darjeeling tea and Colombian coffee are protected descriptions.Farmers in the global south have long argued that these cases and attempts represent a new form of colonial extraction, carried out not by armies but by intellectual property and patent lawyers. For those of us in diasporas, these ingredients and words carry a different but equally emotional weight. They are bridges to our families, our histories and our identities.If my friends embraced me privately during this ordeal, the food world embraced me openly. As the news of the dispute spread, some of the UK’s most respected food writers rallied, withRukmini Iyer, Rachel Roddy, Catherine Phipps,Olia Hercules, Debora Robertson andNigella Lawson(among many more) posting clear-eyed arguments about why food culture belongs to everyone. It was incredibly moving to see others speak the words I could not and I’m for ever indebted to those who, through no ask from me, leapt to my defence. I suspect this happened because the food world is, by nature, collaborative. We blurb each other’s books and publicise the work of our peers. Food, after all, is a conduit to sharing. But also, I think it’s because we know that there is plenty of room for people working on similar themes to thrive. Just look at how many air-fryer cookbooks exist.As public pressure grew, the tone behind the scenes began to shift. I was informed that the deli would drop the case and withdraw the trademark, a quiet admission that it should never have been sought or granted. To my relief the book was reinstated with online retailers and although there has been no apology or statement reflecting on lessons, it’s still a win for all of us who do not want our cultures to be commodified.I hope the case leads to reflection in the UK trademark office and that training is introduced so that examiners develop greater cultural literacy. There also need to be safeguards against privatising common words and clearer routes of appeal.Foodis something we share, not something we own, and it should stay in the hands of all those who keep it alive.Sabzi: Fresh Vegetarian Recipes for Everyday by Yasmin Khan is published by Bloomsbury (£26).

Here is the truth of the matterJonathan SwarbrickFrom income to home ownership and public services, everybody is disgruntled – but for different reasonsThu 4 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 11.53 ESTShareThe British economy has endured a series of setbacks in recent years: austerity, Brexit, the global pandemic, soaring energy prices and an increasingly fractured and uncertain world. The early optimism that accompanied Labour’s election victory faded quickly, witha recent pollranking Rachel Reeves as the worst chancellor in modern history.But is this fair? Is the economy really in as bad a shape as people feel?WagesA good place to start is with recent trends in inflation and wage growth. If prices rise faster than wages, we feel the pinch as the cost of living rises.Price inflationshot upin the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, sharply eroding the spending power of our salaries.Wage inflation has nowcaught up with price inflation, with strong income growth for all but the very poorest. On paper, that should have eased the cost of living pressures for most people. So why does our everyday experience tell us something different?When we measure headline inflation, we average across all the different types of goods people buy. This is problematic since price inflation hits different items in different ways, and many frequent purchases are still relatively expensive.Even though our wageshave grownfaster than the prices ofelectronicsandclothing, average incomes have not kept pace with the cost of essentials such asfoodandhousing. And even if things balance out overall, we might tend to anchor our sense of the cost of living on a few frequent purchases – a takeaway coffee, or the price of eggs.And this uneven inflation matters. Poorer households tend to spend more of their income on precisely those goods with prices that have risen the most: rent, energy and food. They are then hit twice over: exposed to the sharpest inflation and facing the weakest income growth.AssetsAs well as income, we also judge how well we are doing in relation to the assets we own and our personal wealth. Take the housing market. The house-price-to-income ratio hasmore than doubledsince the 1990s, and most people cannot afford the kind of home their parents bought at the same stage of life. And for a growing number, buying at all is out of reach. We actually havemore real disposable incomethan previous generations thanks to strong income growth and low inflation in the early 2000s – but housing has become far more fraught.Years of (necessary) expansionary monetary policies have boosted the value of financial assets, such as property, and widened wealth inequality. Years of easy money flowed into property as well as equities, and this liquidity, combined with a housing stock that has not kept pace, has driven prices ever higher and worsened the affordability squeeze. While, for most, owning a home is an aspiration; for international investors it isjust another financial asset.Public servicesAn underresourced NHS and strained public services are further sources of deep dissatisfaction. Waiting timeshave been risingacross a host of services, from A&E and ambulances to scheduled treatments. The UK has fewer practising doctors per 1,000 people thanmost EU countries, and fewer dentists thanall but one(for which there is available data). Similar comparisons can be made across a whole range of measures.Two big factors stretching public services are a lack of investment and anageing population. Pension systems were built on assumptions of fast growth and shorter lives. In a world of lower economic growth in which people are living longer and demanding more healthcare, that model no longer works.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The poorest are unambiguously worse off, withlower real incomesthan 20 years ago. And while those on low to middle incomes have seen their wages grow, they areless likely to own their own homeor have larger mortgages. Both these groups are more likely to rely on public services than those on higher incomes, and so are experiencing a tangible fall in living standards.There is a growing sense of discontent among middle- to high-income householdswho contribute an unusually large share of the UK’s tax take. The average worker pays relatively little by international standards, but taxes risemore steeplywith income in the UK than almost anywhere else.So what can the government do? If it wants to get serious about public service improvement and the investment needed to fuel growth potential, then it will probably need even higher taxes.The recent welfare increases will be welcomed by some and rankle with others, but survey evidence suggests many wouldsupport higher taxesif they went towards much-needed spending on the NHS and other public services.Reducing wealth inequality would increase the purchasing power of all but the richest, and most would like to see them contribute more. But wealth is notoriously difficult to tax, and financial capital is very mobile in a global economy. Capital we also need for business investment – vital for growth and missing for years.If the government succeeds in navigating these issues, then we will benefit from a more dynamic economy, rising home ownership and improved public services. If not, the public will give others a go in charge, and those that promise simple solutions are likely to make things worse.Jonathan Swarbrick is a lecturer in economics at the University of St Andrews Business SchoolExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionRachel ReevesLabourInflationcommentShareReuse this content"

But spending time with its activists, I’ve seen signs of a refreshing challenge to stale mainstream politicsThu 4 Dec 2025 06.56 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 09.35 ESTShareIt’s not every day that Jeremy Corbyn and some of his closest comrades are described as “the right” in a political argument. But I first heard them given that potentially lethal label – for socialists, at least – shortly after arriving at Your Party’sacrimonious founding conferencein Liverpool last Sunday.The young man who used the words did not seem to be one of the hardbitten leftwing fanatics who had taken over the party,according to most of the press. He was attending his first political conference and enjoying it immensely. Which faction did he think was ahead, I asked, in the weekend’s maze of votes and debates? “Not the Corbynists,” he said with a grin. “But us – the left!”Ever since itschaotic launch in July, Your Party has been seen by many voters and journalists – when they have noticed it at all – as a step-by-step demonstration of the futility of leftwing politics. Through ideological disagreements, disorganisation and delays, domineering personalities and disputes over leadership structure, management of funds and membership data, Your Party has seemingly squandered the opportunity offered by Labour’s rightward shift and record unpopularity. Instead, Zack Polanski’s radicalised Green party has become the preferred vehicle for many leftwing voters, thinkers and activists. Meanwhile, Your Party has been marked, by both enemies and disillusioned potential supporters, for either a quick or lingering death. From this perspective, the Liverpool conference’s onstage rows,open factional divisionsand competing purists of the left simply further confirmed the party’s fate.Yet could it be premature and simplistic to see theYour Partysaga this way? One lesson of British and wider western politics over the past decade, still insufficiently learned by mainstream parties and commentators, is that rebellions should not be written off, even when they seem to be failing or contained. In discontented times, with conventional politics widely disliked and increasingly discredited, revolts against it can subside and then flare up again, or leave remnants that fuel more insurrections. From Scottish nationalism to Euroscepticism and Corbynism, rebellions have survived setbacks to reappear in new, sometimes stronger forms. Your Party’s messy existence might be a beginning rather than an ending.Over the past year, as I’ve spent time in the milieu that eventually produced the party, I’ve met a striking number of activists who don’t fit the media’s usual leftwing categories. Often quite young but politically experienced, strongly committed to the left but not sectarian, keen on building coalitions rather than maintaining ideological purity, and not particularly reverent towards Corbyn or Your Party’s other leading personality, the MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana, these activists have found the party’s splits and tantrums infuriating.“This whole process has been led from the top by two politicians who have incredibly machiavellian, pushy advisers … engaged in bitter trench warfare,” one of these activists told me, as the conference was getting under way with a disastrous flurry of delegate barrings, ejections and boycotts – most damagingly,by Sultana herself. “Everyone I know who was keen is now totally dejected. We were very close to getting everyone on the grassroots left inside the tent.”Yet on the final day of the conference, he was suddenly much cheerier: “The programme we wanted has won all its votes. Zarah has basically signed up to it.” The party would be led by an elected committee of ordinary members – not by a single leader, as Corbyn and “the right” had wanted – and members would be allowed to be in other political parties as well. “The members have taken control,” Sultana declared to a crowd of journalists, before finally deigning to enter the conference hall.The speech she then made there was intoxicatingly fierce: attacking “the parasites” who own privatised utilities, and the mainstream politicians and corporate interests who would “lead us into fascism to protect their wealth and power”. Your Party, she vowed, would be “a party that belongs not to nameless, faceless, unelected bureaucrats” – a swipe at Corbyn’s advisers – “but to you”. Inadvertently, the speech made the tension between her rare gifts as a communicator – and therefore her tendency to dominate political situations –and her advocacy of Your Party as a collective endeavour very clear. Next year, the party promises to “commence a review into different options for future leadership models”.Before and after she spoke, there were debates about the structure, workings and purpose of the party. The audiences were larger than most of those at this year’s Tory conference, and livelier than at Labour’s. A diverse succession of delegates made combative speeches, ignored the chair’s orders to keep to time limits, and were almost constantly applauded or heckled. The lack of deference towards rules and hierarchies felt startling – and refreshing: a throwback to the unruly Labour conferences of the 1970s, or a prototype for a participatory politics to come.Shortly before the conference, aYouGov poll showedthat 12% of Britons “would consider” voting for Your Party. While down by a third since the party’s launch, the figure was still surprisingly high given the turmoil, and the fact that no party scored more than 29%. Our politics remains in a fragmented and volatile state, not least because Labour, Reform and the Tories share some of Your Party’s problems: divisive leading figures, widely disbelieved approaches to reviving the country, and hostility from most voters.The Greens and Liberal Democrats currently have fewer negative associations. But the Lib Dems’ opportunistic, ambiguous politics is unlikely to lure many of Your Party’s consistently socialist supporters. Meanwhile the Greens, despite Polanski’s canny leftwing populism and appealingly direct manner, can’t match Your Party’s connections to working class, trade union and anti-racist politics. The Greens’ leftward shift is also heavily dependent on Polanski, who has limited powers as leader, and, assuming he wants to carry on, will have to stand for re-election in 2027.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To maximise its chances, the party appears to be moving towards an agreement with the Greens not to stand in each other’s target seats.Was this politics of survival, small gains, and participation as an end in itself, what people were expecting when they started talking about a new leftwing party in packed rooms a year ago? My sense is yes.

He deserves to stay in AmericaFrancine ProseIn a more reasonable, more compassionate country, we would thank Ali Faqirzada for how much he has done on behalf of his people and our ownThu 4 Dec 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 11.13 ESTShareOn 14 October, Ali Faqirzada – an Afghan refugee, a resident of New Paltz, New York, and a computer science student at Bard College – arrived for an interview at a federal immigration office on Long Island. He was applying for political asylum, a designation for which he was – and remains – a perfect candidate.In his native country, Faqirzada had assisted the American government and Nato with projects designed to improve the lives of Afghan women and help them get an education. But after the US withdrawal fromAfghanistanin 2021, the ministry where he, his mother and sister had worked was bombed by the Taliban, and one of its employees was murdered.Understandably concerned that they would be tortured and killed like so many Afghans targeted by the Taliban for their cooperation with humanitarian agencies, the Faqirzadas made their way to Mexico, and from there to the US, where they immediately applied for refugee status. Six family members have already been granted asylum after having successfully made the case that repatriation to their Taliban-controlled homeland would probably mean a death sentence.When Ali Faqirzada went for his 14 October interview, it seemed probable that his petition would also be approved. According to Malia Dumont, a military veteran formerly deployed in Afghanistan and now chief of staff and vice-president for strategy and policy at Bard, Ali is a brilliant, generous, community-minded student who has worked in New York state as a hospital security guard, a position of great trust and responsibility.In a more reasonable, more compassionate country, the immigration official would have walked around the table, shaken Faqirzada’s hand, and thanked him for how much he has done on behalf of his people and our own. In a more recognizably American country, the interviewer would have congratulated Ali on how obviously he is thriving in his adopted land and on the good chance that he will go on to make valuable contributions to our society.But that is not what happened. That is not how the story went in Donald Trump and Stephen Miller’s America. Immediately following his interview, during which he convinced the authorities that his claim of “credible fear” was justified, Faqirzada was arrested by ICE agents and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, a for-profit prison operated by the GEO Group. He has been there ever since, in a cell with 12 other men, where his access to books, water, and halal food has been severely restricted. According to visitors, he has devoted his energies to maintaining the morale and the welfare of his fellow inmates.The merits of Ali’s case and the sheer absurdity of the suggestion that the genial, well-liked college student could pose any sort of terrorist threat has prompted an outpouring of popular support.Among his advocates are Leon Botstein, president of Bard College and himself a refugee from the Nazis, who has stated that wisest course in such situations is to be as vocal – to make as much noise – as possible. Others who have spoken out on Faqirzada’s behalf include the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, Congressman Pat Ryan, a Democrat of New York, the communities of New Paltz and Stone Ridge, New York, and the Episcopal bishop Matthew Heyd, who led a vigil in November outside Delaney Hall.Their efforts to free Faqirzada have been complicated by a 29 November government ruling that has paused the final approval of all asylum applications. It’s the newest and most drastic addition to a series of recent measures – including the temporary cessation of the US Refugee Admissions Program on 20 January – that have made the process of asylum-seeking steadily more challenging. In addition, there is now a pause on new immigration from Afghanistan and on the issuing of green cards to Afghans already residing in the United States. Decisions on the granting of asylum are made by the Department of Homeland Security and not the judiciary, thus making it easier for the Trump administration to drastically curtail the flow of refugees.The sweeping new changes targeting Afghans were enacted in the aftermath of the tragic Washington DC shooting of two national guard soldiers, one fatally, by an Afghan national who had worked with the CIA and whose application for asylum had been thoroughly vetted and approved.Common sense – a trait that the Republican party has claimed as an essential aspect of their political agenda – suggests that a genial, kind-hearted, highly motivated computer science student and hospital security guard should not be held accountable for someone else’s crime. Nor should the entire Afghan community, many members of which have fled great danger at home, be punished for the actions of one man and made to worry about whatever safety and stability they have managed to find in our country. There is great confusion, uncertainty and a dispiriting lack of clarity about what precisely these new measures mean and how to proceed from here.Many questions remain about Ali Faqirzada’s detention. How long will he continue to be held prisoner at Delaney Hall? How will the new rulings affect his chances of being granted the protections he clearly deserves? But perhaps the most important questions are the ones that we have been asking ourselves since January 2025 and that we will likely ask ourselves for years to come. How did we let this happen – and what can we do about it now?Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionAfghanistanUS foreign policyUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

His brutal approach to judging them will have to change, tooThu 4 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 11.48 ESTShareThere is a moment in the trailer for Simon Cowell’s new Netflix show,The Next Act, that is almost touching in its adherence to the way things once were. Cowell, who we see on a variety of beige sofas primly clutching his knees, talks about how to curate a new boyband, 20 years after the launch of his first TV talent show. “There is a huge risk here,” he says, heavy with drama. “If this goes wrong, it will be: ‘Simon Cowell has lost it.’” In fact, as anyone who has an eye on dwindling audience figures for his existing shows knows, for the vast majority of 18- to 24-year-olds – or even for younger millennials – the more likely response will be, “Simon who?”Which doesn’t mean that a new generation of viewers can’t be lured in by Cowell’s expertise. The question of whether 66-year-old Cowell can tweak a dusty and decades-old model has less to do with current music trends – just as well, since pop music has moved from TV to TikTok, which Cowell says he hates – than the music executive’s extremely well-tested ability to make good TV and bend his persona to align with the times. In the rollout of publicity for the new show, Cowell has made a good fist of expressing regret at how rude he used to be to contestants,apologisingin the New York Times, after some cajoling, for “being a dick”, and putting his eye-rolling, grimacing performance as a judge down to the tedium of audition days rather than what most of us understood it to be: the extraction of lolz out of confused individuals who had the misfortune to appear on his shows.Anyway, we’ve heard it all before; Cowell has been making these sorts of noises after being prodded by journalists for a good 15 years now. He made them to me in 2011 whenI visited himat his rental house in the Hollywood Hills, a place of white marble and empty surfaces, and where he spoke about his life from the standpoint of a passive observer. It was, it appeared to me at the time, as if Cowell regarded his personality itself as running on free-market principles over which he had no particular influence – competing elements in which, inevitably, sometimes the baser ones prospered. Whatever the outcome, it came with a shrug and a “What can you do?”It is a babyish dodge common to those who, having done very well, feel under no pressure to explain themselves. Still, I’ve always had a soft spot for Cowell, who combines American drive and ambition with a properly and compellingly odd duck personality that can really only be British. “I’m very odd,” he said at the time. “I am.” The pointy shoes, the funny wardrobe, the awkward physicality; all of which, in the context of LA conformity, still seem to me to be vaguely endearing. You only had to look at the empty mansion to imagine the challenges of that particular interior life. (Cowell has been open about his depression and insomnia.) If he’s a difficult person to work with – and I imagine he is – when Cowell talks about his receptiveness to anyone in his company, from the doorman up, to come to him with a good idea, I believe him.The new show will present an older, softer version of Cowell, whether because that’s who he is these days or because the market requires it, who knows – but it’s a fact communicated in the show by the inclusion of Lauren Silverman, Cowell’s longtime girlfriend and glancing shots of their 11-year-old son, Eric. And while he will, presumably, hold back on all his old judging antics, I’m more curious about the contestants. Namely: what the gen Z, or even gen Alpha boys auditioning for Cowell understand their roles in the new show to be.In their heyday, Cowell’s reality shows were an early precursor to the now common idea of mining your life for content, and I remember very clearly him telling me what a problem it became once contestants realised they’d have a better chance of being picked for X Factor or America’s Got Talent if they had a strong backstory. “I once had a guy,” Cowell said, “who came rushing out on stage and literally shouted, ‘I’ve got cancer!’ Like it was great news. He was so happy that he had a sad story.”The difference these days is that even if the young men competing on Simon Cowell: the Next Act make similar calculations, their social media accounts alone ensure they will have a greater ownership stake in their own stories than their counterparts of the mid-2000s. (Cowell hates phones and claims not to read anything online – augurs well!)

Misogyny is an ever-evolving idiom, and men and women alike have found particularly of-the-moment ways to operate within the genre. Think ofthe appsthat take images of women and remove their clothes, or the AI bots that men and boys can use to generatepornographyor depictions ofgraphic violenceagainst women and girls for the crime of going to the same school as they do or running for office. Think of the influencers of the so-called “womanosphere” who tell their female audiences that women who seek out friendship or equality with men are morons or cows, all through the gleam of a TikTok filter. Sexism may be the world’s oldest prejudice and its first unjust hierarchy, but it is continually innovating, adapting to new technologies and the most recent rhetorical needs of male supremacy.But some of the forms of misogyny that have been bubbling up in American political discourse lately can seem a bit retro. I don’t just mean thetradwives, who dress alternately like June Cleaver or like Ma Ingalls from Little House on the Prairie – evoking bygone eras, or at least the ways those eras are depicted on television. And I don’t just mean the pro-natalists, either, who donweird bonnetsand proposenational breeding medalsfor prolific mothers. Since last month’s massive election victories for Democrats, some on the right have looked to revive a form of sexism that has been out of fashion for more than one hundred years: the idea that women should not have a right to vote.More and more, influential voices in the Maga movement and the far-right Republican party are calling to strip women of the franchise. It’s not that this is strictly a new development. Opposition to women’s voting rights has long been a fringe, but persistent, feature of the American right. It’s been a favorite hobby horse of extremist preachers; it trended among Trump supporters on social mediain thelead-up to the2016election, when polls showed that Trump would win if only men voted. (As it happened, he won anyway.) In the century that followed the passage of the 19th amendment – which barred the United States or any state from restricting the vote on the basis of sex, and enfranchised hundreds of thousands of women when it was ratified in 1920 – opposition to women’s right to vote has simmered at the extreme edges of political opinion.It was kept alive in large part in ultra-conservative Christian communities, which tend to cast women as something between children and property. Claiming women to be intellectually and morally unfit for citizenship, these sects declared that women should withdraw from the public sphere, including from political participation, and submit to the rule of their husbands.Joel Webbon, a pastor and YouTube personality, has been at the forefront of this brand of misogynist Christian reaction. (Webbon claims not to be a misogynist but is rather a self-identified “sexist”; what he imagines the difference to be is not entirely clear.) In 2022, just before the nation’s first post-Dobbs midterm elections,he tweeted: “The 19th Amendment was a bad idea.” He is broadly opposed to women’s participation in the political realm,saying in an interviewlast year that “God has not designed women for warfare, and that’s part of what politics is – it’s really all that politics is, it’s war without the blood”. (That war is not politics would be news, I think, to those who have waged it, women among them.)Dale Partridge, also a pastor, justified his own opposition to women’s suffrage using a term of art that has become popular on the fringe right: “I think we should repeal the 19th Amendment because I love America and American women,”he said, “and want to protect our nation from theirsuicidal empathy.”(Emphasis mine.) Here, women are cast as supposedly naturally, inherently more empathetic than men are – and this, in turn, is undesirable, indeedsuicidal. It is something of a back-handed compliment.Like the racist “great replacement” theory and other strains of white nationalism, the opposition to women’s suffrage has entered the mainstream as the Republican party has radicalized. In August, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, who has been accused of sexual assault,reposted a videoin which pastors explain their opposition to women’s right to vote, with the caption “All of Christ for All of Life” – aChristian nationalist slogan. (Hegseth, who denied the allegation,reached a settlementwith the alleged victim.)But in recent decades, a more secular brand of anti-suffrage feeling has also challenged women’s voting rights, this one emerging from the strains of the right invested in biological determinism – a set of commitments ranging from evolutionary psychology to eugenics. This worldview tends to cast women as inferior not due to divine mandate, but due to nature, which, it is claimed, has made them either too stupid or too irresponsible for the vote.Helen Andrews, a rightwing magazine editor whose recent pieceThe Great Feminizationsuggests women’s presence in public life may pose “a threat to civilization”, claims women have “evolved” toward several various and seemingly contradictory habits – too empathetic and consensus-based, on the one hand, and too gossipy, conniving and passive-aggressive, on the other. The logical conclusion to Andrews’s argument is that women should be immediately excluded from political life and from all major institutions; perhaps lacking the courage of her convictions, she does not argue women should be deprived of citizenship, instead proposing a shift of public life towards further male dominance – claiming, for instance, that “the rule of law will not survive the legal profession becoming majority female”. In describing women as an obstacle to conservative priorities, she echoes Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist, rightwing mega-donor and longtime mentor to JD Vance, whowrote in 2009that his ideal libertarian world had been rendered politically unfeasible by “the extension of the franchise to women”. (Helater seemed to contradict this, sayinghe did not “think any class should be disenfranchised”.)These two assertions – that women are ordained by God to be men’s inferiors, or that they have been designed by nature to be men’s inferiors – use pseudoscience, lies and heresy to conceal their plain sexist bigotry behind a thin veneer of patronizing condescension. They claim, implausibly – with the sneering tone of a cartoon villain baring his rotting teeth at a child hero – to be looking to strip women of their rights, freedoms and dignity for their own good.But they are now joined by a third strain of anti-suffrage sentiment: that of undisguised misogynist contempt. A growing number of rightwing influencers simply state that they feel that women should not vote because they hate women, and want women to be subjected to male domination. Andrew Tate, the men’s rights influencer andalleged human trafficker, posted in September to his X account: “Stop letting women vote, stop giving women position as judges, stop giving women political appointments … WOMEN: giving you political and social power is how we ended up here.”The opponents of women’s suffrage have, for now, no way of enacting their ambition: there is no path to repealing the 19th amendment. But they are part of a growing movement to blame women’s advancement – and their increased access, participation and visibility in education, the workforce, politics and public life – for a slew of social problems, from political polarization to economic stagnation to a vague sense of spiritual anomie. As Jessica Winter recently pointed out inthe New Yorker, in a piece on the centrist pundits who have declared a crisis of men, this sentiment – that women’s citizenship and status should be lower, and that recognizing it has hurt the country – is peddled by thinkers and writers far more respectable than the likes of Webbon or Tate. “The [New York] Times pundit Ezra Klein has lately suggested that Democrats consider running anti-abortion candidates in red states, even though more than three-quarters of Gen Z women support abortion rights,” Winter writes. “Rights, like jobs, can be gender-coded, and these rights are valued accordingly.”This range of sexisms that have attained mainstream credibility in politics and the press rest on one assumption: that women’s citizenship is partial and conditional compared with men’s, that we have less of a claim on rights, dignity and public participation than our brothers do. That this assumption is even held is an insult to women’s dignity; that it is now so blithely accepted is a sign of how far women’s status has already sunk.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionUS voting rightsGenderFeminismcommentShareReuse this content"

Ministers as well as regulators need to be tough and proactiveThu 4 Dec 2025 13.36 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 14.10 ESTShareAwareness of the harm caused by online pornography is rising. Last month, the government bowed to pressure from campaigners and pledged to make depictions of strangulation illegal. Research showing that a majority of children have viewed this kind of material is extremely disturbing, all the more so given evidence thatviewing “choking”makes people – mostly men – more likely to do it in real life. This week, the Guardian examined the distressing effects ofdeepfake pornography in schools, and interviewed the women behind thesuccessful campaignto criminalise the nonconsensual creation of deepfake intimate images.Ofcom’s announcement that it hasissued a £1m fineto a Belize-based pornography company, AVS Group, thus seems timely. Oliver Griffiths, the regulator’s director of online safety, referred on BBC radio to a “tide turning” as enforcement powers in the Online Safety Act take effect. The age-verification checks on AVS’s websites, introduced to protect children, are judged not to be effective enough. If the company does not pay up, Mr Griffiths said that he would move to block the site.One thing everyone connected with online regulation agrees on is that technology is moving at an incredible rate. The danger is that societies, and the systems we use to manage risks, can’t keep up. While it is good to see Ofcom taking action, it is alarming that 90 other companies – 83 of which run pornography sites – are also being investigated, with further fines said to be imminent. Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, warned last month that the regulator wasin danger of losing public trustif it did not up the pace of implementation of the Online Safety Act and get on top of emerging threats.Regulation and enforcement in the online space is complicated. When Ofcom issued a £20,000 fine to the controversial forum 4chan, the companies behind it and another forum, Kiwi Farms,filed a legal case. They want a US court to rule that the UK’s online safety laws and codes of conduct do not apply to them.Such challenges make Ofcom’s task harder. But it must not be cowed. Campaigners such as Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life after viewing harmful material, are right to highlight the moral imperative to make the internet safer for children. They want a new “duty of candour” for public officials to apply to tech companies too, and for the regulator to bemore proactiveand less passive.This is all made even more urgent by emerging concerns about agentic AI, or chatbots, which stand accused ofacting as “suicide coaches”in several US lawsuits. If Ms Kendall believes that there aregaps in current online safety laws, as she said on Wednesday, she must close them. Beeban Kidron, the crossbench peer and online safety campaigner, has laid amendments to the government’s crime and policing bill that would achieve this. Ministers should not drag their heels, as happened with deepfake images.Online safety is not the only area in which Ofcom is accused of damaging inaction. It has also appeared reluctant to tackle racism and misinformation aboutclimate policyon GB News. Regulatory oversight of news and other media have always been important. But in our age of pocket computers, shape-shifting tech and political polarisation, questions about Ofcom’s performance – particularly in relation to children – have arguably never been more pressing.Explore more on these topicsPornographyOpinionInternet safetyChildrenOnline abuseOfcomLiz KendallBeeban KidroneditorialsShareReuse this content"

A committee of MPs has the chance to end the secrecy over their financesThu 4 Dec 2025 13.37 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 14.10 ESTShareEveryone in Britain has views about the royal family. In many cases, lots of views. Britain’s parliament, however, never lets the subject pass its lips. By long tradition, the House of Commons prohibits itself from any mention, let alone any discussion, of the monarchy or the royal family. Thisself-imposed gag– in which a centuries-old constitutional monarchy is unable to discuss constitutional monarchy – is infantilising and indefensible.The gag may, however, be loosening. This week, the Commons public accounts committee announcedan inquiryinto the crown estate. ​T​he probe is a direct response to news that the disgraced former Prince Andrew (now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor) and his brother Prince Edward have been paying “peppercorn rents” for very extensive properties owned by the estate. It is an extremely unusual move in the modern era.The crown estate is a public body, established by statute in 1961. It is independent of both monarch and government. It is also a highly successful and profitable property company worth an estimated £15.5bn. Since David Cameron abolished the civil list system in 2011, the crown gets a generous and protected “sovereign grant” from the estate’s profits each year. As the estate gets a cut of all offshore wind development, among other things, the sovereign grant has provideda royal windfallthat ​might have gone to the Treasury. The grant is due for review in 2026. It should be part of the newinquiry.Royal finances are an entirely legitimate subject for full parliamentary accountability, and the kind of scrutiny advocated in the Guardian’sCost of the crownseries. As the Treasury accepted last weekin a letterto the committee chair, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the estate commissioners have “a statutory duty to maintain and enhance the value of the estate and the returns obtained from it”. In other words, as Sir Geoffrey had earlierinformedthe Treasury, the estate must provide “value for money”.The committee is therefore doing its job by inquiring whether this is happening. Its findings are likely to generate great public interest, and rightly so. Value for money is a yardstick that inescapably unlocks the wider debate that parliament ought to routinely be holding about the appropriate workings of the monarchy. The inquiry is doubtless unwelcome for Buckingham Palace. But the announcement this week – a week in whichDavid Dimblebyalso began a strikingly sceptical BBC One series entitled What’s the Monarchy For? – may be a sign that times are changing for the crown.That is partly because ofchanging attitudes. More specifically, it is also because the inquiry should lift a stone on the as yet unpublicised terms under which “grace and favour” residences were, and are, allocated. In addition, it should reveal the terms and responsibilities for ensuring their upkeep. This ​may mean further unwelcome stories for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and for the palace.The committee should not flinch from this task out of misplaced deference. Value for money is a proper and powerful tool of public accountability, whether applied to the NHS or to the monarchy. As the former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Bakerhas argued, the thoroughness of the inquiry will be judged in part by whether it can clarify the number of royal grace-and-favour residences and their costs. According to Mr Baker, in 1993, the last year for which he was able to discover a figure for such residences, there were 272. By contrast, the number of “working” royals stands at 11.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Politicians have routinely failed basic leadership principles on even the most profound issues. The US government has taken this to appalling levels, and much of the UK opposition tries to do so too.Brown and John Vidal’s work – now taken forward by Fiona Harvey, Damian Carrington, Phoebe Weston, Damien Gayle and others at the Guardian – highlights the reality gap between the best of science and the worst of political leadership.Yet it doesn’t have to be this way – in my own 40 years in science, policy and communications, I see the tide turning. The Nordic council at Cop30 shows how young leaders like those in Iceland’s government, including its climate minister, Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, are stepping up with an honest appraisal of global and national responsibility, future security risks and respect for facts.After last week’s national emergency briefing (Scientists warn of severe climate-related risks to UK economy and security, 27 November), let’s hope that UK parliamentarians finally get the messages ofChris Packham,Lt Gen Richard Nugee,Prof Tim Lenton,Prof Kevin Andersonand others: billions of lives, millions of species and societal stability are at risk. Brown and other indefatigable journalists will not pass into oblivion. Thank you for keeping the torch high on our environment and civilisation. Literally everything we know and love is at stake.Prof Phoebe BarnardProfessor of planetary and societal futures, University of WashingtonAs attorneys in New York who have worked with public officials and civil society groups concerned about the environmental, health, safety and security risks of nuclear power, we applaud Paul Brown’s call for more critical interrogation of the technology. Most people understand the incentives and career pressures that lead for-profit companies to cut corners, make foolish errors and engage in malfeasance. Yet many imagine that government leaders and agency staff would not succumb to such pressures where nuclear safety is a concern. Our personal experience has disabused us of that belief.In the US, the situation is now truly beyondbelief. TheAdvance Act of 2024changed the mission of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from protection of public health and safety to include the incompatible mission of promoting nuclear power.The risk extends way beyond the subject of safety and far beyond borders. Nuclear energy is a consequential contributor to climate change, and subsidies for the so-called “renaissance” sabotage the transition to renewables, leaving countries locked in to polluting fossil and nuclear. The push to build fleets of small reactors to cool AI datacentres is particularly unsound. Renewable options such as solar-plus-batteries and geothermal cooling can quickly come online at a fraction of the cost and without creating unmanageable risk.No industry and no government is immune from corruption and human folly. But the potential consequences of those ills as they interact within the international military-industrial-nuclear complex are grave indeed and demand far more serious attention from intrepid journalists. Thank you, Paul Brown. May others at the Guardian give heed to his entreaty.Michel LeeScarsdale, USSusan ShapiroNanuet, USPaul Brown’s heartfelt final reflections are far deeper than a mere progress report of his career. Those of us who have followed his revelations over the years, in parallel with our own efforts to steer policymaking towards political and scientific solutions urgently needed, are indebted to him for his objective approach, not least on the shortcomings of nuclear. So thank you, Paul, for your final warning. After the disappointments ofCop30, let your words of wisdom ring out as a call for action as we face up to the steps needed to determine the future of humanity.Joan WalleyChair, environmental audit select committee, 2010-15Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromCharlie HislopThu 4 Dec 2025 11.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 12.45 ESTSharePaul Sagar writes eloquently about his experience of the wheelchair service as a well-educated adult, with some access to funds (‘I wish I could say I kept my cool’: my maddening experience with the NHS wheelchair service, 2 December). My 38-year-old daughter was born with a similar level of spinal injury. A wheelchair that is used all day, every day disintegrates after about five years, so she has had to reapply for one seven times. Imagine trying to attend school while negotiating to obtain this essential equipment.Statistics that support a high level of satisfaction with the wheelchair service do not reflect the experiences of younger disabled people who cannot walk or stand.Disabilityincreases with age, and the typical wheelchair user is an elderly person, often a part-time user who can walk indoors. This may account for the satisfaction with the wheelchair service by older users, who are less dependent on a wheelchair than younger users.Chris BurgessStockport, Greater ManchesterI was taken with Paul Sagar’s sorry ordeal with the NHS’s wheelchair services and his belief that it made no sense for it to be privatised. He wanted his particular needs to be met by an accountable public service. It was disappointing then to read that he thinks it makes sense for other services, such as cleaning, to be privatised.The internet is littered with reports about the failures of hospital cleaning contracts and private contractors over the past 40 years. Perhaps he should have considered the old and vulnerable people whose lives were affected by dirty hospitals and superbugs before rushing to such a judgment. Those people probably would also have wanted their needs – including for many simply the need to stay alive – met by an accountable public service.Charlie HislopNetley Abbey, HampshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Here’s why we should stop using it, 1 December). The foundation of her argument appears to be in the last paragraph, in which she notes that occasionally the term is unfairly applied to men who know what they are talking about.No one is arguing that there are not many men who do indeed know what they are talking about. That is not sufficient justification to attempt to essentially gaslight women generally into believing that the phenomenon does not exist.Indeed, after Rachel Reeves used it,The Conversation publishedan excellent research-based article by two professors at Queen Mary University of London, who documented why mansplaining is a genuine phenomenon and why Reeves was right to use the term. As Louise Ashley and Elena Doldor state: “Men and women can be both perpetrators andtargets of mansplaining. However, the term has particular force because it reflects deeper cultural patterns in which authority is still coded as male and, more specifically, white and middle or upper class.”My own research shows that implicit bias in the way we judge other people’s authority or expertise is so common that it can be demonstrated with even very small sample sizes. “Mansplaining” reflects a real phenomenon, and the term will remain relevant so long as humans in general continue to see authority as the domain of men.Dr Amanda Nimon PetersProfessor of leadership, Hult International Business SchoolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Imagine trying to explain to someone who hasn’t followed the story why this was not just warm, uplifting and cathartic, but quietly epic, a moment caught for ever in its own square of space and light.A man who already had 39 hundreds in this starchy formal dance of a sporthas now scored his 40th. But follow the story, the craft, the jags in the road, the pieces this thing takes out of you along the way. And at the end of it you have one of those great self-contained sporting moments, the sense of emotional connection through all the surrounding hoopla, the way Test cricket in particular can make you feel you know someone intimately just by watching them move and work and fail and come back.There will, of course, be plenty of banter-war stuff to be resolved on all sides now. Is Joe Root finally great? Is heAustraliangreat? Do we have enough? Numbers. Symmetry. Completion. Men in sheds stroking their beards and sighing. At times cricket really does feel like nothing more than lists, pencil stubs, a fussicky ticking of boxes.But there is something more about wanting Root to be great in Australia. It’s not about one-upmanship, or the chance to gloat, to countermand David Warner’s latest thought-blurt. Any Australian who knows about cricket already knows Root is a great cricketer. But you want them to see it too, and to feel it, in the way you want people to love a band you love, or a book or a place.Joe Root being great in Australia. Win or lose, this ennobles everyone’s Ashes. Although, having said that, and if there’s still any slight chance, we do still want to see Matthew Hayden naked.View image in fullscreenJoe Root did his homework, played sensibly and reached his 40th Test hundred.Photograph: Nigel Owen/Action Plus/ShutterstockRoot’s hundred felt significant in other ways, not least as something solid in the series for this team, a handhold in the glacier, even a basic freeing up. Are England going to win at the Gabba? Don’t know. But Joe Root got a hundred. DidHarry Brookplay if not the worst shot of all time, then perhaps the worst shot yet? Yes. He did. Brook was once again tediously conventional in his attempts at being wild and free, not so much punk rock, more the cricket equivalent of David Cameron listening to The Smiths. But Joe Root did also score a hundred.Nathan Lyon in ‘filthy’ mood after Test omission as Crawley hails ‘phenomenal’ RootRead moreAnd not just a hundred in Australia, but a brilliant one in genuinely tough conditions, and an innings that might just have saved his team in this series. There were moments of escalation and gear change. After three hours of furious focus Root could be seen whirling himself inside out to produce an outrageous reverse swat over what was now deep fine leg, moving his score to 128 off 194 balls with all the carefree elan of a man hurling a television set out of a 19th floor hotel window, and teeing up the 50 partnership for the last wicket with Jofra Archer as the day started to melt a little and ooze England’s way.Although, naturally, it had to start with the wings already falling off, the drinks trolley floating past his ear, and England’s greatest modern player coming out at two wickets down for five runs. Root was dropped early in the slips by Steve Smith. From there he was into his most ferrety mode, counterattacking with such gentle grace you hardly noticed as he glided into the twenties alongside Zak Crawley, driving stiff legged at everything in his arc, like a guardsman playing croquet.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook was dismissed when he thick edged a ball from Mitchell Starc to Steve Smith.Photograph: Nigel Owen/Action Plus/ShutterstockBy mid-afternoon England were 175 for three and poised at the jumping off point. Two versions of elite Yorkshire-dom at the crease. Vice-captain and ex-captain. Numbers one and two in the world. And so the question was asked again. Can they be ruthless here? The answer to which was, of course, no.At one end Root was simply being himself, easy, lithe, watchful, killing you softly, working out in real time how to play these angles and this set of lines. At the other one Brook was batting like a man who desperately needs the bathroom, batting like Lord Farquharson swishing at the dandelions with his walking stick.Australia had pretty much handed Brook a cue card. This is a plan. Would you like to be part of it? Oh, you would?All the while a darkness was coming, shadows creeping across the ground, Brisbane turning a lovely soft green, and the pink ball genius, Mitchell Starc, revving up for the key spell of the day.Do you run towards this danger? Yep. You do. No sighters, no feet. Just throw the hands at it first up. Trust talent, trust vibes.The ball to Brook was full, the edge thick. There is no world where this was a good choice, no cool-guy dynamic where it makes sense. Australia had pretty much handed Brook a cue card. This is a plan. Would you like to be part of it? Oh, you would?It was at least novel in its abjectness. We have seen England bat in Australia like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, stiff and brittle with no heart. We’ve seen them bat like the Lion, without a spleen. Now Brook gave us the scarecrow, batting without a brain. We are the stuffed men. We are the hollow men. We are an attitude, a set of slogans.Sublime Starc is last man standing after Australia’s mystifying call to leave out Lyon | Geoff LemonRead moreAnd so one half of this England team continued to collapse in stages, while at the other end Root batted not just for his life, but for everyone else’s too. There is at times something exhilarating about watching this, the lack of care, the let-the-world-burn energy. But it is also increasingly tedious in the refusal to learn, develop, find new things. Chances are being wasted here. We could have been anything that we wanted to be, with all the talent we had. But we decided, a fact we take pride in. We became the best at being bad.Root provided his own quiet rebuke, a triumph for doing your homework, working at your flaws, a hundred off 181 balls, 35 off his last 19 as the day demanded it. England are still in this series because he did the thing, scaled his own final peak, offered a lesson in what talent ultimately means.Are they going to bowl Australia out now, turn things around? Are they going to learn, to become more Bazball with brains, which is, in the end, not really Bazball at all? Not sure. But Joe Root did score a hundred.Explore more on these topicsJoe RootAshes 2025-26Harry BrookThe AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

He believes the public are behind him and the team and his mood was bullish before the draw.“Everyone knows that we cannot promise that we win it but they want to see a team, a team spirit, a team that gives everything and fights for each other,” Tuchel said. “If the players bring that then I think anything is possible. We will be brave enough to dream about it, we will be brave enough to try it.Noise around Donald Trump an unwanted distraction to World Cup draw of dreamsRead more“I feel the change in expectation and a change in the feedback I get from fans and people who I meet because they like what they saw. Am I more confident now? Yes. Because we have got better. We have to arrive and try to make a special thing happen but we cannot guarantee it.”Tuchel said in interviews with the BBC and ITV that the draw would feel “surreal”. He was “curious and excited” and, channelling the “bring it on” spirit he has pushed with the players, he made it clear that there was no opponent he wanted to avoid.“Absolutely not,” Tuchel said. “I am very superstitious about this. I learnt this in academy football in Germany and played 40 indoor tournaments and when you thought you had an easier group or wished for one, the opponent had the match of his day and beat you. We just want to know who we face and get the thing going.”View image in fullscreenMark Bullingham (right) with Thomas Tuchel. Bullingham said: ‘We’re really excited about where we are. You can feel the brilliant energy in the camp.’Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty ImagesTuchel was asked about the prospect ofEnglandbeing drawn in the same group as Scotland. “If it happens, it happens and we make the most of it,” he replied. “It will be a nice story. I have no wishes on opponents. I think if you wish for something and think you are superior, it’s close to arrogance and you don’t want to be arrogant. We want to respect everyone.”The German talked about how he was ready to accept difficulties in terms of the heat and humidity that will await at many of the venues in the US, Canada and Mexico; the travel, too, even the potential for delays to matches because of thunderstorms. “It is more about the mindset than having a solution,” he said.One solution to the extreme temperatures would be to keep the substitutes back in the dressing-room – something Tuchel did not rule out. “If this is what helps us later in the match when they come on … OK, we consider that as a possibility,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it was not long before he found himself talking up France.“England will be one of the favourites,” Wenger said. “They are always nearly there to win it – semi-finals, quarter-final, final. They have to make the next step. They have the quality to do it.“I believe in Europe, trying to be as objective as possible, that France is the super-favourite just for one reason – it is the country which has more world-class strikers than any other country in the world. By having four knockout stages [in the expanded 48-team tournament] … to have such a bench with such good quality will make a difference.“There is one thing that is important in life is that when you know you can do it … when you have done something, it gives you something extra, the belief that you can do it. France has been in the last two finals so we know they can be there and they have the quality of the players.”David HytnerPhotograph: Michael Regan/FIFAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Nobody likes it as I want the players to be out here and feel the energy and give the energy from the bench. But I saw teams doing this and players doing this at the ClubWorld Cup[in the US last summer]. Hopefully we can avoid it. It is always better if they can be with us.”Tuchel has been credited with bringing a “brilliant energy” to the job by the Football Association’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham; with generating encouraging levels of buy-in from the players. The manager’s first two camps last season were largely underwhelming but the team have since impressed with their performance levels.“We’re really excited about where we are,” Bullingham said. “Thomas has come in and really hit the ground running brilliantly. You can feel the brilliant energy in the camp and see that the players are really responding well to him. We’re looking forward to the tournament.”Bullingham said that the FA’s logistics team would spring into action as soon the draw is finished to secure the best possible training base. They have earmarked Kansas City as a preferred location due to it being situated in the middle of the US but much will depend on where England’s ties are played. The provisional plan is for a pre-tournament training camp in Fort Lauderdale where the team could work and also play warm-up matches at Inter Miami’s stadium. The club are co-owned by the former England captain, David Beckham.“We’ve got a really clear plan and we’ve mapped out every eventuality depending on where we get drawn,” Bullingham said. “We’ve got a plan, as every leading country will have, to acclimatise and to give ourselves the best chance. We’ve got a brilliant team that’s put together some brilliant base camps.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, questions about their solidity remain because West Ham had rarely threatened until their hosts switched off and were punished.The Irving corner came when Leny Yoro, on as a substitute after being dropped, missed a clearing header. Then Bowen was left unmarked by Bruno Fernandes. As Bowen said: “Not many people pick me up in the air. I’m 5ft 9in or something like that, so not the tallest.”They were two material errors that can augur sourly for United and which left Ruben Amorim upset. “Angry and frustrated, that’s it,” said the Portuguese. “We are really inconsistent but if you look at the goal [conceded], we have a long ball, we have everything under control, [so] we need to do better.“The game was in control. We knew it, [so] let’s defend far from the box. We knew set pieces would be a problem with the difference in height in the team but we could do it. We could maintain the ball after the first goal and again we lost two points.”Amorim was pressed if he had given the players a dressing-room rollicking. “In that regard I am almost always consistent [calm]. I had one [such incident] after Brighton last year [a 3-1 loss]. I will talk to them tomorrow [Friday],” he said.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim insisted he had stayed calm with his players despite another disappointing home display.Photograph: Peter Powell/EPATen points and nine places separated the teams at the start. West Ham, in 18th with 11 points after 13 games, were bidding to become only the ninth side to survive with that tally (or lower) at this juncture. United’s 21 points had Amorim’s men only two behind fifth place that may be sufficient for a Champions League berth, which, despite the manager downplaying the notion, is a target.Jab and counter-jab was the pattern in early exchanges that featured Amad Diallo and Fernandes both going down in the Hammers area and having penalty shouts rejected by the referee Andrew Kitchen.Amorim’s surprise selection was in central defence where Ayden Heaven, 19, was in for Yoro and a concerning start featured a seventh-minute yellow card and him being turned twice by the 33-year-old Callum Wilson.Better for United was Diallo’s dart down the right. The wingback’s cross was kneed goalwards by Joshua Zirkzee, Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line, Matheus Cunha’s overhead stab was repelled before Fernandes sprayed a scissor-kick wide.While Amorim’s other changes were Cunha for Mason Mount and Mazraoui for Matthijs de Ligt, Lucas Paquetá’s silly sending-off against Liverpool meant Tomas Soucek was drafted in by Nuno Espírito Santo. If he had taken a fall when Diallo clipped him near the break, Kitchen might have awarded a spot-kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then West Ham broke, Bowen’s dribble eluded Fernandes and Heaven, and the captain left fly but the ball, deflecting off Luke Shaw, was gathered by Senne Lammens.Yoro replaced Heaven for the second half, Amorim accepting that the teen’s selection might backfire. Then came a move of high quality. Mazraoui zoomed forward and fed Zirkzee, whose backheel put Bryan Mbeumo in. He was thwarted but it demonstrated the value of quick ball movement. Zirkzee showed the same on halfway when a sweeping pass right had United motoring forward, claiming a free-kick and then a corner.View image in fullscreenDiogo Dalot celebrates with teammates Matheus Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee after putting Manchester United in front in the second half.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesWest Ham, living off scraps, broke and Magassa fired wide of Lammens, only for United to nose ahead via Dalot. Diallo turned the ball back to Casemiro, he blazed towards goal, the ball pinged off Mateus Fernandes and came to the Portuguese, whose finish was expert.United were on top and sought to stay there. Mbeumo thundered down the right, while Cunha made inroads down the left. Could Amorim’s unit remain in the ascendancy and finish the job, as they often find so difficult?But for a brave Casemiro block, Freddie Potts might have pulled West Ham back level with a fierce shot.

The organisers’ headquarters were in Dublin and between 2006 and 2012 either Munster or Leinster lifted the trophy five times in seven seasons. Everyone else was forced to scrabble around for the last few Tayto crisps in the bag.And now? The tournament, officially known these days as the InvestecChampions Cup, has tilted so far towards France you can practically smell the garlic. Admittedly its HQ is now in Switzerland for tax reasons but, financially and on the field, the balance of power lies squarely withles grands chefsof the Top 14. Since 2021, there have been five successive French winners and on three occasions in that time, the Challenge Cup has also disappeared across the Channel.The Breakdown | Thirty years of Champions Cup has given us the beastly, beautiful and bizarreRead moreWith next May’s final scheduled for Bilbao in the Basque Country, barely 75 miles across the French border, this year’s question is obvious: can anyone stop the seemingly inevitable? Even before a ball is kicked – or an eye is gouged – it feels like something special will be needed to prevent another Gallic procession.Because not only are five of the Top 14’s current top six revving up on the grid but many of their so-called rivals are short of form. Even Leinster sit only sixth in the URC table while Saracens, Sale Sharks, Harlequins and Gloucester are all in the bottom half of the Prem. Scarlets are stone cold last in the URC while the Sharks and the Bulls cannot endlessly flog all their high-class Springboks.Which, realistically, leaves four or five non-French sides in with a puncher’s chance of featuring in the last eight, let alone in the semi-final and final. The DHL Stormers from South Africa are top of the URC while Leinster, Munster, Bath and Saracens just about possess enough squad depth to compete as well.View image in fullscreenExeter Chiefs were the last non-French side to lift the trophy, beating Racing 92 in 2020.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEven then much rests on their ability to thrive away from home in some seriously tough back yards. Take Bath, for example. The English champions simply must beat Munster at home on Saturday night, probably with a bonus point, to give themselves some insurance before their visits to Toulon and Castres either side of Christmas. Lose in Toulon, in particular, and their hopes of topping Pool 2 will be sunk to the Mediterranean sea bed.The opening rounds matter because the format of the competition remains weighted in favour of those who start fast. Earn yourself a top-four seeding and, as Bordeaux and Northampton showed last season, it makes the ride much more manageable. Top two and, if you keep winning, you have the luxury of home country advantage until the semi-finals.So anyone planning to stop the Bordeauxs and Toulouses of this world from booking into Bilbao need to start motoring early. Which means the Stormers cannot afford to slip up on the opening weekend in Bayonne, while the Saints, last year’s finalists, have scant margin for error away to Pau and at home to the Bulls respectively in their first two games.Pau, along with Toulon, will be instructive to watch given they have already beaten Toulouse at home and Bordeaux away in the Top 14 this season. Joe Simmonds – a European champion with Exeter five years ago – has rebooted his career in the south-west of France and his side play a sweeping brand of rugby that can be hard to contain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unless, of course, the Bulls turn up at Franklin’s Gardens with a below-strength lineup – as has happened in the past – and again undermine the thesis that South African sides would add to the competition.This feels like a significant campaign for Bristol, too, as they hope to show they have the substance at this level to match their fast-moving style. They will be hosting Pau and Bordeaux and travelling to Llanelli and Pretoria and might just make the last 16 if they can keep enough of their key starters fit.Saracens? Durban and Glasgow will pose contrastingly awkward challenges while the bookmakers’ deserved tournament favourites, Toulouse, are also due to visit north London. Antoine Dupont against Owen Farrell, and Maro Itoje, Ben Earl and company against half the French pack? That Sunday fixture in round three in January could be the 80 minutes that shows how narrow – or wide – the gap now is between England’s biggest dogs and France’s wealthier aristocrats.Here is hoping there is a twist in the tale at some stage because, otherwise, a lot of familiar faces will be swigging podium champagne and a last eight comprising of Bordeaux, Leinster, Toulouse, Toulon, Stormers, Pau, Munster and Bath will be no real surprise. Leinster, remarkably, won their most recent gold star in Bilbao more than seven and a half years ago. Repeating the trick grows steadily harder.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both he and his teammate,Oscar Piastri, insisted they had not yet discussed the potential use of orders for the decisive grand prix.Norris goes into the 24th and final race of the season as favourite but still in a close, high-pressure fight withRed Bull’s Max Verstappenand Piastri, enjoying a 12-point lead on Verstappen and 16 on Piastri. Norris will take his first title if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri would need to win and have Norris finish sixth or lower.Win in Abu Dhabi and hope for chaos: how Oscar Piastri can still win the F1 world titleRead moreThe question of team orders and McLaren’s attempts to be scrupulously fair to both drivers by allowing them to race has been a major point of debate all season. However, when asked about the possibility of team orders being implemented for Piastri to cede to Norris should Verstappen otherwise be able to win, the British driver insisted he believed it would not be fair to ask his teammate to do so.“No, not been discussed,” he said. “Honestly, I would love it. But I don’t think I would ask it. It’s up to Oscar if he would allow it. I don’t think it’s necessarily down to me. It’s the same if it’s the other way around.“Would I be willing to or not? Personally, I think I would, just because I feel like I’m always like that and that’s just how I am. But it’s not really up to me and I’m not going to ask it. I don’t want to ask it because I don’t think it’s necessarily a fair question. If that’s how it ends and Max wins, then, well, that’s it. Congrats to him and I look forward to next year.”The team’s position has always been that they would let their driver’s race freely while both were still in the title fight. However, they have intervened in order to maintain pre-agreed arrangements. At Monza, McLaren hadPiastri cede a place to Norris, which the British driver lost through a slow pit stop.After the last round in Qatar the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, said the team would discuss relevant scenarios so all parties were clear going into the final round. There is no doubt McLaren want to secure their first world championship since 2008,when Lewis Hamilton won.The most likely scenario where Piastri might be required to give way to his teammate would be if Verstappen was leading with Piastri third and Norris fourth and the pair switching would ensure the British driver secured the title.With the three title protagonists lined up together in the press conference at the Yas Marina circuit on Thursday, sat beside the trophy one of them will win on Sunday night, Piastri added that he had yet to be apprised of the team’s expected position.View image in fullscreenThe three title protagonists Max Verstappen, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri alongside the trophy one of them will lift on Sunday.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images“It’s not something we’ve discussed,” he said. “Until I know what’s expected, I don’t really have an answer.”Aware of the importance of the weekend, McLaren cancelled Norris’s usual session of speaking to the British media, which takes place on the Thursday before every race, with the 26-year-old doubtless happy to not have to answer more questions about his title chances. However, in the official press conference he did address what it would mean to him to win it.“This has been my whole life, it’s everything I’ve worked towards my whole life, so it would mean the world to me, it would mean the world to everyone that’s supported and pushed me for the 16 years of my life,” he said. “It would mean everything. It would mean my life until now has been a success and I’ve accomplished that dream I had when I was a kid.”Mercedes’ George Russell, meanwhile, said it would be “unacceptable” to ask Piastri to move aside and sacrifice his own title ambitions even if that meant Verstappen won the title.“I don’t think it’s acceptable or reasonable to ask a driver who’s also in a shot of a championship in the very last race to move over for your teammate,” Russell said. “They both need to be given a shot and if they lose out because of it, you just need to say the other guy did a better job and that’s racing.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneLando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

Hislop said he had been diagnosed with “a fairly aggressive prostate cancer” about 18 months ago, which required surgery. Further tests showed the cancer had spread.“Roughly 18 months ago, I went for my annual physical and insisted on a PSA test, as I always do,” Hislop, 56, said in a video on Instagram. “This time around though my PSA was elevated. An MRI and biopsy quickly determined that I had a fairly aggressive prostate cancer.“A year ago, almost to the day, 6 December to be exact, I had a radical prostatectomy, and I thought that was it. But then, six months later, my PSA was again on the rise and another scan showed that my prostate cancer had spread to my pelvic bone. I started on medication pretty soon after, and just this morning completed seven and a half weeks of radiation therapy. The journey continues.”In a draft recommendation last week, the UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC), which advises the government, said prostate cancer screening should not be made routinely available for the vast majority of men in the UK. Hislop, who played for Trinidad and Tobago at the 2006 World Cup, has urged anyone concerned to get tested.“Doctors recommend that all men over the age of 50 get their PSA checked regularly,” he said. “If you’re of African descent, that age drops to 40. If you’re somewhere like the UK or somewhere else where PSA tests aren’t encouraged, you have got to insist.“Having a history of cancer in the family doesn’t matter. I had genetic testing done and it showed no traits in my family, yet this year would show that, without going into too much detail, even that didn’t exclude everybody in my immediate family.“The highest rate of prostate cancer mortality is in Caribbean men, so if you allow me to speak to my community, my people. Please, go get tested, know your PSA, track its history. Prostate cancer is survivable if caught early enough. There are treatments for it. Testing saves lives. It saved mine.”Explore more on these topicsFootballNewcastle UnitedCancernewsShareReuse this content"

The chair of Fifa’s referees committee, speaking at a media briefing in Washington, made clear he supported the advance of technology.Collina saidconversations were taking placeover whether VAR could adjudicate on second yellow cards. They will continue at the next meeting of the International Football Association Board, the law-making body, in Wales next March, meaning there would be time for the ruling to come into effect for the World Cup. Collina also said discussions were taking place over how bestto combat time-wasting, including when goalkeepers go to ground, seemingly feigning injury to allow managers to hold team meetings. He added that Fifa wanted to explore AI-based innovations to help match officials and improve the game, although he gave no details on this.Quick GuideWenger backs France as 'super-favourite' for 2026 World CupShowArsène Wenger has described France as the “super-favourite” for next summer’s World Cup based on their enviable attacking options and major tournament knowhow.The former Arsenal manager, who is now Fifa’s chief of global football development, cannot see beyond his native France, who won the World Cup in 2018 and were the runners-up in 2022.The France manager, Didier Deschamps, can call upon an array of talent for his front line including Kylian Mbappé, Ousmane Dembélé, Hugo Ekitiké, Marcus Thuram, Désiré Doué, Bradley Barcola and Michael Olise.Wenger was asked to assess England’s chances and he essentially called them nearly men, though he accepted they too had the quality to win. However, it was not long before he found himself talking up France.“England will be one of the favourites,” Wenger said. “They are always nearly there to win it – semi-finals, quarter-final, final. They have to make the next step. They have the quality to do it.“I believe in Europe, trying to be as objective as possible, that France is the super-favourite just for one reason – it is the country which has more world-class strikers than any other country in the world. By having four knockout stages [in the expanded 48-team tournament] … to have such a bench with such good quality will make a difference.“There is one thing that is important in life is that when you know you can do it … when you have done something, it gives you something extra, the belief that you can do it. France has been in the last two finals so we know they can be there and they have the quality of the players.”David HytnerPhotograph: Michael Regan/FIFAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Italian was most strident on VAR and the award of corners, saying he lived in fear of a wrongly awarded kick leading to a decisive goal in a big game. The technology could be used to assess whether the ball had fully crossed the line or which team had last touched it. The major factor in whether such a move could be viable was the potential delay to the game.“We are in a process of discussions,” Collina said. “We should all have the objective to make correct decisions on the field of play. It would be a pity if the result of a competition is decided not by what the players do on the field of play but by an honest mistake made by the decision-maker. This is what convinced us 13, 14 years ago to start thinking how to support referees [with technology]. So if we can get this, to me, it’s positive.Noise around Donald Trump an unwanted distraction to World Cup draw of dreamsRead more“The main criteria is no delay. With corners, there is a physiological delay because when a corner is given, normally you wait until the two centre-backs come up. It normally takes 10-15 seconds to get the attackers ready. In these 10-15 seconds, if the corner kick is wrongly given … everybody has the evidence that the start of play is wrong and to me it’s difficult to understand if they have the possibility to see that [the decision is wrong] … why we have to hide our heads under the sand and hope that nothing happens on the corner kick which is taken?“This is my opinion as I live matches in important competitions hoping the result is determined by what the players do on the field of play … If I can avoid to have this kind of circumstance I would be happy. But the main idea – no delay. Nobody wants to introduce any further delay.”Explore more on these topicsVideo assistant referees (VARs)World Cup 2026World CupLaws of footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Germany’s chancellor,Friedrich Merz, reportedly added that the Ukrainian leader needed to be “very careful”.“They are playing games with both you and us,” Merz was reported as telling him – a remark the magazine concluded was a reference toa diplomatic mission to Moscow this weekby President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.The magazine said other leaders also voiced their concerns, with Finland’s Alexander Stubb, who hasbonded with Trump over golf, reportedly warning “we must not leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys”.Even the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte – whoin public is very complimentary of Trump– reportedly said he agreed with Stubb “that we need to protect Volodymyr”.Der Spiegel said it spoke with “several” participants of the call, who confirmed it took place, and two of them reportedly said the remarks were “accurately reproduced”.A spokesperson for Zelenskyy declined to comment, as did Merz’s office, while the Élysée Palace contested the quotes attributed to Macron. Der Spiegel said Rutte’s office had declined to comment.The magazine produced a report in German andseparately published an English version, saying it contained original quotes from the summary note.Last month, Washingtonpresented a 28-point proposal to halt the war in Ukraine, drafted without input from Ukraine’s European allies and criticised as too close a reflection of Moscow’s maximalist demands.A flurry of diplomacy has followed, with US and Ukrainian negotiators holding talks in Geneva and Florida before Witkoff and Kushner headed to Moscow on Tuesday.The pair spent five hours in talks with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin andWitkoff is due to meet Ukraine’s national security council chief, Rustem Umerov, in Miamion Thursday.The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said in parliament on Thursday that an imposed peace would be “disastrous” not only for Kyiv but also Europe’s security.He called on European nations not to let up in their support forUkraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All appear to have benefited from Israeli support as part of astrategy of arming proxiesto degrade Hamas and control the population.The exact timing of Abu Shabab’s death is unknown but it appears to have been in the last 48 hours.The Popular Forces said in a statement that their leader died of a gunshot wound as he intervened in a family quarrel, and it dismissed as “misleading” reports thatHamaswas behind his killing.Sources in Gaza and reports on social media and in Israel earlier suggested that Abu Shabab, who was in his 30s and had been expelled by his own clan, died in a clash after refusing to release a hostage taken by his men from a powerful and heavily armed local family.Relatives of the hostage were said to have mounted an attack on the Popular Forces base, which led to casualties on both sides. Abu Shabab was reportedly badly injured and died of his wounds in Gaza.A spokesperson for Hamas, which had called Abu Shababa collaboratorand promised to hunt him down, denied any involvement in the killing.In June, Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel hadarmed anti-Hamas clans and factionsin Gaza. There has been no official comment from his government on Abu Shabab’s death.Israel’s policy has drawn criticism from some experts who have said such groups can provide no real alternative to Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007.Dr Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli military intelligence officer and expert on Hamas at the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University, said: “The writing was on the wall. Whether he was killed by Hamas or in some clan infighting, it was obvious that it would end this way.”Several other anti-Hamas groups have emerged in areas of Gaza held by Israel. The Palestinian political analyst Dr Reham Owda said Abu Shabab’s death would fuel doubts among them about their ability to challenge Hamas.Hossam al-Astal, the leader of another newly formed militia operating in the area of Khan Younis,said in Septemberthat he and Abu Shabab offered “an alternative force to Hamas”. Astal’s whereabouts is unknown.Abu Shabab’s hundred or so fighterscontinued to operatefrom areas of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces after a US-backed ceasefire between Hamas and Israel was agreed in October.View image in fullscreenA screenshot taken from a video released on 18 November 2025 is said to show Abu Shabab and his deputy, Ghassan al-Duhaini, with armed men in Rafah.Photograph: Yasser Abu Shabab/Popular Forces/ReutersOn 18 November, Abu Shabab’s group posted a video showing dozens of fighters receiving orders from his deputy to launch a security sweep to “clear Rafah of terror”, an apparent reference to Hamas fighters believed to be trapped in tunnels there. A week later, the Popular Forces claimed to have captured Hamas members.Israel’s internal and military intelligence services turned to individuals such as Abu Shabab when it became clear that their efforts to build an anti-Hamas coalition of community leaders and family elders would not succeed in the face of fierce Hamas repression of any threat among Palestinians in Gaza.Convincing evidence Israel backed aid convoy looters in Gaza, historian saysRead moreMany of those recruited into the new factions had been engaged in systematic looting of aid convoys, leading to allegations that Israel was allowing some theft of humanitarian assistance to bolster its new allies.In June, Abu Shabab – a member of the Tarabin Bedouin tribe –told the Guardianhis activities were “humanitarian”, adding that he did not work “directly” with the Israeli military.The Israeli strategy of backing militia factions such as the Popular Forces was one consequence of Netanyahu’s refusal to allow the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial control over parts of the Israel-occupied West Bank, to administer Gaza in any way. Abu Shabab’s Popular Forces coordinated closely with Israeli forces around controversial aid distribution sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an opaque US- and Israel-backed private organisation that hasnow been shut down.Donald Trump’s 20-pointGaza planforesees Hamas disarming and the territory run by a transitional authority supported by a multinational stabilisation force. But progress has been slow, with Hamas so far refusing to disarm and no sign of agreement on the formation of the international force.The war in Gaza was triggered by a Hamas raid into Israel in 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to the abduction of 250. The ensuing Israeli offensive and strikes since the ceasefire have killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and left the territory in ruins.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineHamasIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He pleaded guilty on Wednesday to 26 offences including sexual assaults against girls aged two to four who were in his care, some carried out as children slept and some of which were filmed.Parents have said they are “sickened” and through their lawyer have told of concerns they had about Chan which they said were not taken seriously. They have blamed Bright Horizons for failings before Chan’s arrest.Alison Millar, a solicitor acting for some of the 700 parents whose children attended the nursery while Chan worked there, said the allegations included children coming home with injuries, including bite marks, cuts and scratches.The children also allegedly told their parents Chan was encouraging the boys in his class, aged between two and four, to fight one another. Millar also said Chan behaved inappropriately by shouting at the toddlers in his class.Bright Horizons said: “If this conduct occurred, it is unacceptable – we do not encourage or condone violence in any form. Likewise, if staff were informed of concerns and did not manage them appropriately this is not acceptable and not in line with what we require from our nursery teams.“At the moment our information on this matter is limited. Relevant individuals who managed the nursery during the course of Chan’s employment are no longer employed by us and it has not been possible to question them about this.“However, the child safeguarding practice review … will look into whether and how Chan’s offending could have been detected earlier. We hope it will provide answers to impacted families, to us as the provider and the wider industry.”Details have also emerged of Bright Horizons employing another worker who had a sexual interest in children.In 2017Alison Whateley, a manager at the Bushy Tails nursery in Teddington, London, was arrested. She was recorded saying she was a paedophile and expressing an interest in abusing children,and pleaded guilty in 2019.Asked whether changes were made to staff vetting and recruitment after Whateley’s arrest, Bright Horizons said: “Our safer recruitment procedures, which we review regularly, are compliant. Both Alison Whateley and Vincent Chan passed the required checks.”The nursery added: “We take safer recruitment and ongoing employment extremely seriously. We have been in operation for over 40 years and employed tens of thousands of staff who and dedicated to promoting the safety and wellbeing of the children entrusted to our care.“Vincent Chan’s offending should not have happened. We are committed to fully supporting the ongoing review as we did the police investigation, so that learnings can be taken.”In the House of Commons, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said there would be a full review of the case. She said greater use of CCTV in nurseries would be considered and a rapid review of the case had recommended a full child safeguarding practice review was needed.Phillipson condemned Chan’s “vile and abhorrent crimes” and added: “My promise to [the families] through these darkest of days, my promise to members [of parliament] here today, my promise to families across the country, is not only that justice will be served, but that we will strengthen the ways in which we keep children safe.”Chan will be sentenced on 23 January. The branch of the nursery where the abuse took place has been closed.Explore more on these topicsChild protectionLondonCrimeChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

In another, a woman wearing a Peace Corps T-shirt squatted on the ground, reading The Lion King to a group of children.View image in fullscreenAI-generated image using the tool with the prompt ‘volunteer helps children in Africa’.Illustration: GoogleThe prompt “heroic volunteer saves African children” yielded multiple images of a man wearing a vest with the logo of the Red Cross.Arsenii Alenichev, a researcher at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp studying the production of global health images, said he noticed these images, and the logos, when experimenting with Nano Banana Pro earlier this month.“The first thing that I noticed was the old suspects: the white saviour bias, the linkage of dark skin tone with poverty and everything.

South East Water has told residents the water from their taps is unsuitable for drinking, giving to pets, brushing teeth, washing children , or bathing in with an open wound.The notice is in place for at least 10 days because of what the company describes as “water quality issues”.Schools, restaurants, pubs and hotels across the town have been forced to shut all week because of a lack of clean running water. GP surgeries have also struggled to obtain water supplies.An investigation into the cause of the contamination has been launched by the DrinkingWaterInspectorate (DWI) relating to Pembury treatment works.Last year, thewatchdog warned: “There is or has been a significant risk of supplying water from Pembury water treatment works (and associated assets as applicable) that could constitute a potential danger to human health or could be unwholesome.” It called for urgent upgrades to the facilities, including water tanks and sludge lagoons, to avoid contamination into the tap water supply from pesticides,E coli,EnterococciandClostridiumbacteria.The water company could face legal and enforcement proceedings if it is found to have been negligent in its upkeep of the treatment centre.South East Water has been on the brink of financial collapse, a fate threatening multiple other water companies. Earlier this year ithad to ask fora £200m cash injection from its investors after being put on a watchlist by the regulator Ofwatover its financial health.A DWI spokesperson said: “The inspectorate is aware of an ongoing incident in the Tunbridge Wells area. The company is taking steps to return supplies to normal. The inspectorate is investigating the event to understand the cause and to make sure the company puts measures in place to protect consumers and prevent recurrence. As this is a live investigation, and the inspectorate has powers to bring forward enforcement action or legal proceedings should there be sufficient evidence, we are not able to comment further at this stage.”Other water companies face similar issues with their ageing infrastructure. Campaigners have accused companies of “sweating assets” and giving money in dividends to shareholders rather than investing in treatment centres, sewers and reservoirs.Thames Water’sCoppermills treatment workshas been identified as a critical “single point of failure” that could cause a water outage for more than 500,000 people if it fails.And last summer,dozens of people were made sickafter the parasitecryptosporidiumwas found in the water supply in Brixham, Devon. More than 140 people were confirmed to have had the diarrhoea-type disease, which also causes stomach pains and vomiting, typically lasting for about two weeks. Four people were taken to hospital at the time.David Hinton, the chief executive of South East Water, who has faced calls for his resignation over the situation in Tunbridge Wells, was called into a meeting with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on Wednesday.The water minister, Emma Hardy, said: “I have spoken to [Hinton] this morning and made clear that the continued disruption to water supplies is unacceptable. The DWI will undertake a full investigation into what caused this incident and why it’s taken so long to restore supply to customers.”Neil Hudson, head of water quality at South East Water, said people should not drink the water. He told the BBC: “Any sort of normal, healthy individual will probably see no impacts whatsoever [if water is accidentally ingested]. If anyone drinks the water and starts to feel unwell, our advice would be to speak to your GP.”He declined to give a date for when clean water would once again run from taps: “We don’t want to give false hope that it’s going to be over in a short period of time,” he said.South East Water has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsWaterWater industryPollutionKentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

At 88, the famed Canadian undersea explorer, has many decades to draw on. There was the time he and a Russian explorer and deep-water pilot, Anatoly Sagalevich, were snagged by a telephone wire strung from the pilot house of the Titanic, trapping the pair two and a half miles below the surface.Another might be the moment he and his team stared in disbelief through a porthole window at the Edmund Fitzgerald, the 222-metre (729ft) ship that vanished 50 years agointo the depths of Lake Superior, so quickly that none of the crew could issue a call for help. MacInnis and his team were the first humans to lay eyes on the wreck.It could also be the time he led an expedition in the Canadian high Arctic, battling unforgiving ice to locate a lost British vessel crushed by those same elements.Or, when diving in waters off the Florida Keys “humming with history”, he passed a pod of lobsters clustered in a reef that was composed entirely of 16th-century silver bars from a Spanish galleon.But for MacInnis, a doctor, diver and writer, the place to start is simple: the shipwrecks themselves, moments when worlds were torn apart by the raw power of the ocean. The ships have helped him better understand the natural world and, increasingly, himself.View image in fullscreenMacInnis diving in Lake Huron, off Tobermory,Canada, in 1969. Photograph: Don Dutton/Toronto Star/Getty Images“In the final arc of your life, you start thinking of shipwrecks differently and they become a metaphor for understanding the forces of the world,” he says from his Toronto home. “Because, above all, they help us grapple with one of the toughest things that we have to do as humans: to reckon with the reality that we’re mortal.“Death is coming for us, but it gives life an unexpected beauty and a deep sense of urgency,” MacInnis adds.I saw what was possible. But I also saw injury and death. In the final arc of my life, I want to take what I’ve learned and shareNearly all of the space on the planet where life can existis found in the oceans– and yet it remains the least explored part of Earth. Still, those who spend their lives enveloped by the timelessness of the oceans experience a power that has coaxed explorers to risk their lives for a chance to unspool the smallest of its mysteries.Among those on the leading edge of discovery, few have encountered as many giants as MacInnis, whose career dovetailed with a golden age of undersea exploration.“I worked alongside pioneers and I saw what was possible,” he says of an era that, alongside friendships with Jacques Cousteau, Robert Ballard and Buzz Aldrin, included a secretive US navy project to see if humans could live deep underwater.“But I also saw the unforgiving nature of the ocean. I saw injury and death. In the final arc of my life, I want to take what I’ve learned from it and share. It will always be the greatest of all teachers.”MacInnis, described in a 1971 issue of Popular Mechanics as a “a rip-roaring, life-loving young Canadian”, has long been one of the ocean’s most eager students. He was the first to dive at the north pole and the team he led was both the first to build a polar dive station –the Sub-Igloo– and the first to film narwhal, bowhead and beluga whales underwater.He took Canada’s former prime minister Pierre Trudeau diving in the Arctic. He alsoaccompanied King Charles, who was then aged 26, under the ice.View image in fullscreenMacInnis, left, in the Sub-Igloo, with Don King, whose company made the polar dive station’s plastic domes.

Photographs: Dmitry Kostyukov/AFP/Getty; PAMacInnis was involved with the French and American team thatlocated the final resting place of the Titanic in 1985. Later, he was part of a Canadian-Russian expedition to film a documentary about the wreck. During the final dive, he and the submersible pilot Sagalevich were momentarily trapped atop the ship.He remains convinced that those years of collaboration between nations, in the pursuit of science, were a “tiny step” in the collapse of the cold war and the coming breakdown of the Berlin Wall.“Here we were, working on science together in the ocean with two cold war enemies. And I think that reflects what shipwrecks have taught me: in moments of crisis, we need each other. We’re in this together; none of us is as good as all of us.”For me, wrecks have always been about the people who survived – or those that didn’tIn 1980, five years before the Titanic was discovered, he led a Canadian expedition to locate HMS Breadalbane – one of the ships dispatched in 1853 to help in the search forHMS ErebusandHMS Terror, lost on Sir John Franklin’s doomed expedition tochart the Northwest Passage.The discovery of HMS Breadalbane made it the northernmost wreck ever found. MacInnis later sought out the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, a wreck preserved by the cold, clear waters of Lake Superior on the borders of Canada and the US, as well asin song by the Canadian folk-music heroand friend, Gordon Lightfoot.“Does anyone know where the love of God goes,” wrote Lightfoot. “When the waves turn the minutes to hours?”The question posed by Lightfoot in what MacInnis called “the song for all shipwrecks” captures the intense focus of the explorer, whose passion in recent years has drifted away from the science and technology behind the wrecks, and more towards the human psychology of them.“When the world is ripped out from you, when it’s shredded before your eyes, how do you react? For me, wrecks have always been about the people who survived – or those that didn’t. Because in our own lives, we can at times find ourselves scrambling to get to shore,” he says. “I like to say that after years in the ocean, I’m an alpha coward with a PhD in fear.”View image in fullscreenThe freighter Edmund Fitzgerald, pictured in 1959, was lost in a storm on Lake Superior in 1975. Photograph: APBraiding together ideas of fear, chaos and decision-making has given MacInnis an outlet for his energy. His most recent book is about leadership and he has grown increasingly fixated on the relationship between wrecks, survival and the global polycrisis – a termcribbed from a good friend– that captures the challenges of geopolitical chaos and climate crisis.“I am old and when you think about the ships, the subs and the planes I used, my carbon footprint is enormous. This is why I’m on fire right now, to do what I can to help.”MacInnis recently suffered a heart attack and a minor stroke – and with it an uncomfortable glimpse of his own mortality. “My soft pink body, with its 2,000 moving parts and 100,000 biochemical reactions, is slowly falling apart. I don’t have the sharpness I used to.“I’m frantically trying to put together my own lifeboat with the help of some wonderful people. But I know the shore lies at an infinite distance from where I am. For the first time, really, I’m in my own shipwreck.”His home has numerous items from the deep sea, including a piece of foam from the submersible used – and signed – by James Cameronin his historic solo diveto reach the deepest place in the ocean.“To Dr Joe MacInnis,” it reads. “Legend, mentor, shipmate … friend.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top: MacInnis with the film-maker James Cameron; a rusty link from HMS Bounty’s anchor chain; and holding a signed piece of Cameron’s submersible. Photographs: Canadian Press/Alamy; Cole Burston/GuardianHe also has a rusty link from an anchor chain. Measuring nearly four inches long, it comes from the wreck of HMS Bounty – a story of maritime disaster that captivated him as a young explorer – and one that he now realises he misunderstood.In 1789, the acting lieutenant, Fletcher Christian, led a mutiny against thecaptain, Lt William Bligh. Put into an open launch with a few loyal crew, the captain navigated more than 3,600 nautical miles (6,600km) from Tonga to safety in Timor. The mutineers eventually sailed1,350 miles to remote Pitcairn Islandand settled there.‘A race against time’: how shipwrecks hold clues to humanity’s futureRead more“I thought of it as a story of mutiny. There were clear villains and heroes. And yet now, when I think about the crew and Christian, travelling so far on the open ocean, I see it as an incredible story of survival and leadership,” says MacInnis.“And so there’s a sense of hope that comes from shipwreck, from the lifeboats we find ourselves in. It’s not a wishy-washy hope; it’s hope in action, it’s doing the right thing.”MacInnis says a life spent alongside people looking to push the upper limits of human possibility has instilled within him a relentless optimism.“If enough of us can get together and put the planet ahead of ourselves, we’ve got a chance with this. We really do.”Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansOceansCanadaExplorationAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Using precious resources to feed the expanding military industrial complex, rather than addressing the existential threat of the climate crisis, demonstrates the global insecurity produced by the Pentagon.”Military spending has increased in large areas of the world in recent years after growing tensions between the US and China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The report warns this new arms race is halting attempts to tackle the climate crisis as countries scramble to secure critical minerals for the next generation of weapons.The study found that at least 38 minerals and metals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements that form the basis of the energy transition are being stockpiled by the Pentagon with potentially devastating effects on climate action.It found the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency plans to stockpile almost 7,500 metric tons of cobalt. The report calculates that could instead be used to produce 80.2 GWh of battery capacity – more than double existing energy storage capacity in the US and enough to produce approximately 100,000 electric buses.Lorah Steichen, the report’s author, said: “Every ton of cobalt or graphite stockpiled for the military could be used instead for electric buses, large-scale energy storage or other renewable technologies needed for the energy transition. These materials should accelerate decarbonisation, not fuel the insatiable war machine.”The US Department of Defense is the largest institutional emitter of planet-heating emissions in the world,responsible for about 80% of the US government’s emissionsand generating more pollution than entire individual countries.Pentagon officials have long been concerned the consequences of the climate crisis could hinder its activities, by flooding coastal bases or destabilising countries through the movement of people and extreme weather.But under the Trump administration, such considerations have been jettisoned. In March, the US defence secretary,Pete Hegseth, wrote on X: “The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap. We do training and warfighting.”The report outlines how that new direction is playing out. It shows how the Pentagon’s huge $1tn annual budget and its influence across the US state and economy allows it to “influence mineral supply chains … shape entire markets: absorbing risk, directing investments and creating demand signals that build strategic industrial capacity for military ends.”It found that the Pentagon had funded, or signalled interest in supporting, at least 20 mining initiatives in the US and Canada worth almost $1bn since 2023, including taking direct equity stakes in “critical mineral” companies – an unprecedented step in modern US industrial policy.The report states: “By capturing these materials to fuel the war machine, the Pentagon not only drains resources needed for urgent climate solutions but also perpetuates a destructive cycle of militarism that undermines global peace and sustainability while crowding out the civilian functions of the federal government.“This misplaced prioritisation threatens both the planet’s future and the possibility of a just, collaborative energy transition that benefits all people rather than narrow military interests.”The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisUS defence spendingDefence policyDonald TrumpArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Venture Global was among the “top donors” to Trump’s inauguration, donating $1m, according to theWall Street Journal.On his first day back in the White House, Trump issued an executive order rolling back regulations to favor fossil fuel production, including LNG export licences, while revoking existing climate and clean energy policies.Three days after Trump’s inauguration,Venture Globalissued an IPO – an initial public offering of shares, becoming a publicly traded company. The share prospectus highlighted theUnleashing America Energy executive order, and the following day,Sabel and Penderrang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.Despite the IPO being billed byReutersas a “blockbuster” event, the shares opened nearly 4% below the original asking price at just over $24 each, valuing the company at $58.2bn.While substantially belowthe $110bn Venture Global had hoped for, Sabel and Pender – who between them still owned more than 80% of the firm – pocketed a paper fortune of $24bn each, according toBloomberg.Senior executives’ share purchases since the IPO have been reported to the US Securities and Exchange Commissionand postedon its website.Since the company went public, there has been no significant additional share-buying by Sabel and Pender, aside from during one noteworthy week in March.On 6 March,Venture Globalannounced a $18bn expansion to its vast LNG export terminal in Plaquemines parish in Louisiana, situated on the Mississippi River just south of the New Orleans terminal.Among the high-profile guests to the event in Plaquemines parish were Chris Wright, Trump’s energy secretary, who has regulatory oversight of Venture Global’s operations, and Doug Burgum, secretary of the interior, who leads Trump’sNational Energy DominanceCouncil. Louisiana’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry, was also there.“I’m proud to be among you. I cannot overstate how important what you’re doing is and how aligned it is with the agenda of President Donald Trump,” said Wright. Burgum said Sabel and Pender were “amazing”, adding that there was “nothing more patriotic than an American worker that’s working to build energy dominance for this country”.On 10 March, Sabel and Pender went on a share-buying spree. The Venture Global share pricethat week was a relativelylow $9.37, falling after a disappointing fourth-quarter results.Every day for a week, the pair bought thousands or hundreds of thousands of shares. By the end of the week on 14 March, they had amassed just under 1.2m shares each, worth little under than $12m each.The only other share acquisitionsince the IPOwas 1,226 shares bought by Pender on 26 June.The following week on 19 March,Wright grantedan export license to another Venture Global LNG project, the Cameron Parish 2 (CP2) terminal, which Joe Biden had paused amid widespread protests from climate scientists, environmental groups and local fishers.CP2 has the capacity to produce28m tonnes of LNG a year, with the company now on track to be thelargest supplierof gas to Germany.“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are cutting the red tape around projects like CP2, unleashing our energy potential and ensuring the US can continue to meet growing energy demand for decades to come,” said Wright.“We are grateful for the Trump administration’s return to regular order and regulatory certainty that will allow us to further expand US LNG exports,” saidSabelon behalf of Venture Global.Individuals connected to Venture Global spent $860,000 on lobbying on Capitol Hill in 2024, and another $810,000 so far this year,according to Open Secrets,a non-profit campaign financial watchdog. The previous high was $70,000 in 2019.“Both the timing and amount invested raise serious red flags. It does require a subpoena and an investigation,” said Craig Holman, from Public Citizen, an expert on ethics, lobbying and campaign finance rules.All parties deny any wrongdoing.“Venture Global has regularly engaged with government officials on a bipartisan basis across four different presidential administrations. We strictly adhere to all laws, rules and regulations relating to our interactions with government officials, and support policymakers who recognize both the economic and environmental benefits of the US LNG industry,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.“Mr Sabel’s and Mr Pender’s acquisitions of shares fully complied with SEC rules and regulations and Venture Global’s Policy Concerning Trading in Company Securities. The timing of these acquisitions had no connection to any meeting or regulatory action. Any suggestion otherwise is false,” the spokesperson added.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt: “The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read. The president has never engaged, and will never engage, in conflicts of interest.”The Guardian’s requests for comment to Chris Wright at the department of energy, Doug Burgum at the interior department and the transition committee went unanswered.After Wright gave the green light to the export license, the company’s share price rose slightly over the next two days, before falling again.The company is currently valued at $19.6bn, with the share price at $7.90 on the New York stock exchange in mid-November – a 67% decrease since the IPO. Sabel and Pender continue to hold on to their collective 2.37m shares, currently worth almost $19m.The fall in stock prices comes despite recent long-term deals withGreeceandGermany,and the company’s close ties to the Trump administration.The global energy watchdog,the IEA, recently warned of oversupply, saying in its World Energy Outlook that “questions still linger about where all the new LNG will go”.Mike Wirth, the Chevron boss, said there was “more supply coming into the market than demand will be able to absorb. That probably results in lower spot prices.”Analystshave also warned that Venture Global’s business model is particularly exposed to market fluctuations because it signs fewer long-term contracts than some rivals.

Among other areas, it warns that the potential to achieve near elimination of cervical cancer could be threatened if HPV vaccination rates are not maintained.The report also highlights a decline in vaccine uptake among pregnant women and a drop in coverage of routine vaccinations in children, with the latter particularly pronounced in London and more deprived areas.“Some of the people who are keen to spread disinformation like to give the impression that the UK is becoming a vaccine-sceptical nation. Absolutely that is not true,” Whitty said, adding that much of the downward drift in childhood vaccinations was down to the practicality of getting hold of a vaccine.The report also reveals a rise in imported infections such as malaria over the past decade, something Whitty said highlighted the importance of maintaining the UK’s expertise in such areas. And it looks to the future, noting situations such as pandemics are “entirely predictable”, even if their timing is not.“We need to keep our capacity to prevent and respond to infections up between events rather than wring our hands and wish we had done so when they occur,” Whitty wrote.Explore more on these topicsHealthOlder peopleChris WhittyEnglandVaccines and immunisationHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The police faced intense criticism from the Lawrence family and their supporters in a case that came to symbolise police racism.The Lawrences did not find out about the secret monitoring until more than 15 years later. The Met has since apologised to the family for putting them under surveillance.Francis has now given details of the “sensitive” row to a different public inquiry. The spycops inquiry is examining the conduct of about 139 undercover officers who spied on tens of thousands of political activists between 1968 and at least 2010.This week, theinquiry has been hearing evidence from Francis, the only undercover officer sent to spy on political campaigns who has blown the whistle on its covert work and abusive behaviour. Thespycops inquiry was set up in 2014after Francis disclosed to the Guardian the covert surveillance of the Lawrence family and their supporters.In 1993, Francis had joined the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), the Met’s unit of undercover officers whoinfiltrated mainly leftwing and progressive groups.He testified that collecting information about the Lawrence campaign and black justice groups was the top priority of his four-year deployment in which he infiltrated anti-racist and leftwing groups.‘Spy cops’ scandal: what is it and why was public inquiry set up?Read moreHe has also said a head of the SDS gave him specific instructions to pick up any information that could be used to stop or undermine the Lawrences’ campaign. This allegation is denied by the police.Pressure by the Lawrence family forced the government in 1997 to set up a public inquiry to examine how the police had investigated Stephen’s murder by a racist gang.In a milestone report, the Macpherson inquiry concluded in 1999 that the Met’s investigation into the killing had been “marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership”.Francis said that while the Macpherson inquiry was being held he “adamantly” believed that it should be told about his surveillance of the Lawrence campaign and their supporters and being tasked with tarnishing it.“It was about doing the right thing, but it was also about looking out for myself. I did not want to be in a situation where the information was withheld and later came out, coming back on me,” he added. “I felt it was morally wrong to hide the fact of my deployment.”He said he had argued “quite forcefully with management about it”, but his managers opposed it. He added that one manager “ridiculed” his idea, and “said we would be fine, that no one knew about the SDS and no one would ever know about the SDS, and that I would be looked after … I never knew whether or not Macpherson was ever briefed.”He was told that if he continued to pursue it, “the consequences for me would be bad”.Macpherson’spublished report had no referenceto the surveillance of the Lawrences by undercover officers. Richard Stone, a member of the Macpherson inquiry, has said it was never told about the undercover operations.Francis told the spycops inquiry that towards the end of his deployment he felt “conflicted” about spying on black justice campaigns “given the police had been the ones beating up and killing members of their community. I felt bad being undercover on demonstrations amongst the black justice groups. It felt morally wrong spying on those groups on behalf of the police.”At one point, Francis said, after being asked to spy on demonstrations in support of two justice campaigns, “my response to this tasking was to tell [his managers] to go back and tell the police to ‘stop fucking killing black people’. I was very angry and think they were taken aback by the ferocity of my response to that tasking.”Explore more on these topicsUndercover police and policingSpycops scandalMetropolitan policePoliceLondonStephen LawrencenewsShareReuse this content"

Even in a snowstorm in the dark, people were driving by to see it, said Jim Toscano, co-owner of the Free Age film production company, where the statue now stands firmly bolted down near the sidewalk.RoboCop hit theaters in 1987, portraying a near-futureDetroitas crime-ridden and poorly protected by a beleaguered and outgunned police force, until actor Peter Weller appeared as a nearly invincible cyborg, apparently created by a nefarious corporation bent on privatizing policing.There was a time when Detroit pushed back on anything pointing to its past reputation as an unsafe city, and the movie, which developed a cult following, spawning two sequels and a reboot, didn’t help its image.But with violent crime trending down for years and homicide numbers now below mid-1960s levels there is less pushback and city officials offered no objections to the statue’s installation, Toscano said.“Detroit has come a long way. You put in a little nostalgia and that helps,” he said.Thestatue campaignappears to have started around 2010 when Detroit’s mayor, Dave Bing, was tagged in a tweet that noted Philadelphia’s statue of the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa and said RoboCop would be a “GREAT ambassador for Detroit”.Bing tweeted back, saying there were no such plans. But some Detroiters ran with the idea, crowdfunding it through a 2012Kickstartercampaign that raised more than $67,000 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide, and Detroit sculptor Giorgio Gikas finished the statue in 2017. Then, it got stuck, stored away from public view.The Michigan Science Center in Detroit ultimately nixed plans to host the sculpture in 2021, citing pressures from the coronavirus pandemic and the need to focus museum resources.Things remained in limbo until about three years ago when Toscano’s company bought a building in Eastern Market, an open-air produce market, shopping and entertainment district just northeast of downtown. Toscano says he thought they were “kidding” when he was contacted by the creator of the statue idea and Eastern Market officials. But he and his business partner gladly came on board: “It’s too unusual, too unique, too cool not to do,” Toscano said.Toscano, 48, says he has only viewed the first RoboCop movie.“It wasn’t a big film in our house,” he admitted. But if there is one iconic line uttered by RoboCop that fits this moment, Toscano said it would be: “Thank you for your cooperation.”On Thursday, James Campbell approached the statue and told three picture-takers: “I own this. Do you guys know that?” the Associated Press reported.Campbell said he donated $100 to the original Kickstarter campaign over a decade ago, which makes him a “0.038 percent owner of this statue”.“I’m here to see this big, beautiful, bronze piece of art,” he said. “What a piece of cinematic history to represent the city of Detroit,” he added.Campbell called the statue a symbol of hope: “He’s a cyborg crime fighter! In the movie, in the futuristic Detroit, he’s there to save the city,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDetroitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, it was ultimately the firm’s limited staff and missed deadlines that prompted the change, one person said.It is unclear whether McCrery chose to step aside voluntarily. However, one source noted that he and Trump parted on good terms.Trump has now selected Shalom Baranes as the project’s new architect, which the White House confirmed. Baranes, whose previous work includes significant federal projects such as the main Treasury building near the White House, received strong praise in a written statement from the White House spokesperson David Ingle.“As we begin to transition into the next stage of development on the White House Ballroom, the administration is excited to share that the highly talented Shalom Baranes has joined the team of experts to carry out President Trump’s vision on building what will be the greatest addition to the White House since the Oval Office – the White House Ballroom,” Ingle said.“Shalom is an accomplished architect whose work has shaped the architectural identity of our nation’s capital for decades and his experience will be a great asset to the completion of this project,” he added.According to the White House, McCrery will continue to remain a consultant on the project.In October, Trump received widespreadcriticismfollowingsatellite imagesthat showed a completely demolished East Wing to pave way for the ballroom, contradicting Trump’s earlier promise that the existing building would not be touched.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Microsoft’s European headquarters are located inIreland.Joe O’Brien, the executive director of ICCL, said: “Microsoft’s technology has put millions of Palestinians in danger. These are not abstract data-protection failures.”He said that the cloud services “enabled real-world violence” and it was “essential that the DPC move quickly and decisively” in view of the “threat to life posed by the issues at the heart of this complaint”.He added: “When EU infrastructure is used to enable surveillance and targeting, the Irish Data Protection Commission must step in – and it must use its full powers to hold Microsoft to account.”A cache of leaked documentsreviewed by the Guardian revealed that Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s spy agency, had opened talks as far back as 2021 to move vast amounts of top secret intelligence material to the US company’s cloud service.The documents showed how Microsoft’s storage facility had been used by Unit 8200 to store an expansive archive of everyday Palestinian communications, facilitating targeted airstrikes and other military operations.In response to the revelations Microsoft ordered an urgent external inquiry to review its relationship with Unit 8200. Its initial findingsled the company to cancel the unit’s accessto some of its cloud storage and AI services.ICCL claims that Microsoft facilitated critical components of Israel’s military surveillance “Al Minasseq” system.It says the alleged “removal” of the records of intercepted phone calls from EU servers to Israel obscured evidence of illegal processing before investigations could commence within the EU and claims that unlawful processing was a breach of the EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR) governing use of personal data.Equipped with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity and computing power, Unit 8200 had built an indiscriminate system allowing its intelligence officers to collect, play back and analyse the content of cellular calls of an entire population.A spokesperson for the DPC said: “I can confirm that the DPC has received a complaint and it is currently under assessment.”Microsoft has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftIsraelPalestineIrelandComputingEuropeCloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

The bill, which the senate would have to pass before it became law, is in line with the current procedures in high schools. Sex education is banned in primary schools.Opposition parties, which had called for sex education to be mandatory, protested outside parliament on Wednesday, arguing that the bill was regressive and undermined efforts to prevent sexual violence and femicide.Meloni’s ruling coalition believes sex education is a tool that promotes “gender ideology” and threatens traditional family values.The under-secretary for education, Rossano Sasso, said the bill was intended to prevent younger children from being taught theories that caused confusion while requiring parental consent for sex education to be taught to older children.“With this law, we are saying goodbye to gender ideology and the woke bubble,” hetold the lower house. “Political activists will no longer be allowed to engage in political propaganda in schools.” He argued that without such oversight, leftwing politicians would “bring drag queens and porn actors into schools” to talk to children about “sexual fluidity and surrogate motherhood”.Sasso concluded his speech by repeating the Italian fascist slogan: “God, country, and family”, adding that “the creed guides our political action”.Campaigners have long called for compulsory sex education in Italian schools, including the family of Giulia Cecchetin, a university student murdered in November 2023. Her former boyfriend Filippo Turetta confessed andwas jailed for lifelast year.Sara Ferrari, a politician with the centre-left Democratic party, said the bill put “obstacles in the way” of schools that wanted to implement a tool “for combating violence against women”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Obstacles have included heavy lobbying from anti-abortion groups, which associate the topic with promoting abortion, same-sex relationships and surrogacy, and the influence of the Catholic church.Two surveys this year, however, found that 90% of students and almost 80% of parents supported sex education programmes.The row comes a week after parliamentstalled a debateover a landmark law that would define sex without consent as rape.Explore more on these topicsItalyRelationships and sex educationGenderSchoolsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Prada’s chief executive, Andrea Guerra, had avoided questions about him on investor calls.“Prada’s leadership seemed unconvinced that he could jump from a behind-the-scenes role to a highly visible creative directorship, or that his taste was a match,” Business of Fashion reported.The designer and Prada have a history: Vitale left the group’s hit brand Miu Miu this year to take the helm at Versace in March, a switch Business of Fashion described as “an unwelcome hiccup”.Miu Miu is a rare success story in designer fashion. This year it overtook Loewe to become the hottest fashion brand in the world, according to the Lyst Index. In October the Prada group reported a 9% uplift in sales for the first nine months of year, driven by a 41% rise in sales at the cult brand.During the same period, the Prada label reported a 1.6% decline in sales. In the last three months of 2024, meanwhile, Versace reported a 15% drop in year-on-year sales, to $193m.Vitale’sshow for spring/summer 2026became a talking point in fashion – some appreciated the 80s-style shapes and club-worthy silhouettes, while others found the collection chaotic. The influential Instagram account @boringnotcom reacted to the newswith a postreading “I told you so”, after it had predicted in July that Vitale would go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Olivier Rousteing, who left Balmain after 14 years in October, has the glamorous aesthetic Versace is known for. Kim Jones, who departed from Fendi and Dior in October and January respectively, could also be a good fit. He worked on a collaboration between Versace and Fendi, known as Fendace, in 2022.Donatella Versacestepped down as the brand’s creative chiefin March after 27 years at the company – she had taken over after the high-profile murder of her brother in 1997 – and into a chief brand ambassador role. Vitale became the first creative director outside the Versace family. Donatella did not attend his show.For Prada, its purchase of Versace is seen as an attempt to become a luxury fashion powerhouse to rival the existing French luxury conglomerates: LVMH, which owns a bevy of luxury fashion brands including Celine, Fendi, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton; and Kering, which owns names such as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.Explore more on these topicsFashionVersacePradanewsShareReuse this content"

Instructing the model to focus on using facts and evidence yielded the largest persuasion gains, the study said. However, the models that used the most facts and evidence tended to be less accurate than others.“These results suggest that optimising persuasiveness may come at some cost to truthfulness, a dynamic that could have malign consequences for public discourse and the information ecosystem,” said the study.On average, the AI and human participant would exchange about seven messages each in an exchange lasting 10 minutes.It added that tweaking a model after its initial phase of development, in a practice known as post-training, was an important factor in making it more persuasive. The study made the models, which included freely available “open source” models such as Meta’s Llama 3 and Qwen by the Chinese company Alibaba, more convincing by combining them with “reward models” that recommended the most persuasive outputs.Researchers added that an AI system’s ability to churn out information could make it more manipulative than the most compelling human.“Insofar as information density is a key driver of persuasive success, this implies that AI could exceed the persuasiveness of even elite human persuaders, given their unique ability to generate large quantities of information almost instantaneously during conversation,” said the report.Feeding models personal information about the users they were interacting with did not have as big an impact as post-training or increasing information density, said the study.Kobi Hackenburg, an AISI research scientist and one of the report’s authors, said: “What we find is that prompting the models to just use more information was more effective than all of these psychologically more sophisticated persuasion techniques.”However, the study added that there were some obvious barriers to AIs manipulating people’s opinions, such as the amount of time a user may have to engage in a long conversation with a chatbot about politics. There are also theories suggesting there are hard psychological limits to human persuadability, researchers said.Hackenburg said it was important to consider whether a chatbot could have the same persuasive impact in the real world where there were “lots of competing demands for people’s attention and people aren’t maybe as incentivised to sit and engage in a 10-minute conversation with a chatbot or an AI system”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsComputingInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

He said the inquiry had the “full support” of Reeves and the “whole Treasury team”.The FCA said: “We have requested details of this work and that the outcome, including of the inquiry into any leak of market-sensitive or inside information relating to the budget, is shared with us so we can consider as appropriate.”This year’s budget was preceded by numerous stories about what was being considered, including the revelation in the Financial Times days beforehand that Reeves had abruptly dropped a plan to raise income tax rates.Allies of the chancellor said the U-turn had come about because of improved forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, but theOBR later clarifiedit had not updated its forecasts for two weeks.The confusion around Reeves’s decisions and the competing explanations as to why they were taken has led to accusations that Treasury officials deliberately misled reporters in an attempt to keep UK borrowing costs low.Stride said this week that Treasury’s “leaks and spin” had led to market speculation being “rife, and the gilt markets volatile”.He added in his letter to the FCA: “It seems increasingly clear that the chancellor has been giving an inaccurate picture of the economic and fiscal context and this appears to be driven by political considerations.”However, Rathi said in the letter that the core purpose of the regulator’s market abuse rules was to ensure a level playing field and confidence in markets. “Its purpose is not to make judgments on political discourse, even though that discourse may on occasion have an impact on markets,” he said.“How the government publicly communicates its position in advance of a fiscal event or similar is a matter for parliament through its accountability mechanisms.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, some younger users have been told their listening habits suggest they are well into retirement.Spotify has confected a wave of intrigue over what our musical preferences suggest about our vintage, with its “your listening age” feature causing delight and consternation.The gimmick is a new addition to the streaming service’s annual Wrapped feature, which uses the swaths of listening data it collects to deliver personalised insights into a user’s year in sound.Many users found they had jumped generations in their musical habits. Some gen Zers noted they had been given an age in the 70s, while parents presumed their children’s determination to listen to theKPop Demon Hunterssoundtrack on loop had dragged down their supposed listening maturity.The artist Grimes posted a listening age of 92, which she put down to her “love of the oldies”.View image in fullscreenListening to Linda Ronstadt was blamed by one user for pushing up his listening age to 72.Photograph: Ed Perlstein/Getty ImagesMark Morgan, 37, a principal ecologist, was admirably relaxed at being allocated a listening age of 72.

Spotify says it is based on a “reminiscence bump”, or a tendency to listen to music from one’s formative years. The feature examines a user’s listening history, compares it with others of a similar generation and then “playfully hypothesises” a listening age.The real aim, which has proved successful, is to find new ways of encouraging users to share their Spotify findings.“Spotify Wrapped is the most successful marketing tactic of the last 10 years,” said Troy Osinoff, a digital marketing entrepreneur. “[It is] built on one simple idea: people are obsessed with themselves.”Taylor Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify in the UK for the third year running, followed by Drake, Sabrina Carpenter and The Weeknd. The most streamed song was Alex Warren’s Ordinary.The annual Wrapped campaign has become a marketing boon for Spotify. However, a rival Unwrapped campaign aims to highlight the platform’shosting of AI-generated musicand willingness to run ads from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is tasked with finding, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants.ICE’s role in implementing Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda hasled to protests and arrests. Spotify has previously said the ICE ads were “part of a broad campaign the US government is running across television, streaming and online channels”. It has said the ads do not violate its policies but that users can give them a thumbs up or down to manage their preferences. It is not the only major platform to feature the ads.Explore more on these topicsMusicSpotifynewsShareReuse this content"

It is a ballad celebrating friendship and love from the epic film Sholay. Beside the stereo sits a bottle of Johnnie Walker and a red glass decanter. On the table are copies of the Punjabi newspaper Des Pardes, which translates as “home and abroad”.The scene, which depicts the childhood home of the Coventry-born curator and artist Hardish Virk, is one of several spaces in an immersive exhibition at the city’s Herbert Art Gallery & Museum. It traces four decades of the experiences of south Asians as they arrived and adapted to the social, political and cultural changes in modern Britain.“The original concept came from this idea of a living museum of south Asian stories,” says Virk, 54. “Somewhere our stories could be told through different generations and different decades.”View image in fullscreenThe Stories That Made Us exhibition takes visitors back to a recreation of Hardish Virk’s childhood home in Coventry.Photograph: Ayesha JonesA sign written by Virk for visitors entering the gallery reads: “My family story is part of a tapestry of stories that exist throughout Coventry and beyond – stories of migration, home, family, friendship, community and culture.”The exhibition, which contains photographs, music and oral histories from Virk and his family’s personal archive, begins in a space depicting border control at an airport, where footage is shown of south Asian communities arriving in the UK in the 1960s.Although this marks the beginning of the Virk family story in the UK, the curator was keen to highlight historic ties with south Asia, including the founding of the East India Company in 1600 and two centuries of British colonial rule.Visitors are taken on a journey through Virk’s childhood living room at his home on St George’s Road, Coventry. Pamphlets and books owned by Virk’s late father,Harbhajan Singh Virk, pay homage to his anti-racism as a member of the Indian Workers’ Association, the Indian Youth Association and the UK’s Communist party in the 1970s. Among the leaflets is one calling for protests after the racist murder of 20-year-old Satnam Singh Gill in Coventry in 1981.For Virk, the activism of south Asian communities during this period is particularly relevant in the Midlands aftera spate of religiously motivated incidents,including two rapes of Sikh women.“Recently we’ve had a lot of conversations around migration, hotels, flags. That’s heightened racist attacks,” he says. “That’s what I present in the passport control [space] that, actually, this is what people of my parents’ generation experienced – this hostile environment. That’s exactly the same hostile environment that we’re talking about today.”View image in fullscreenThe exhibition contains photographs, music and oral histories from Virk and his family’s archive.Photograph: Ayesha JonesAlthough Virk says his parents would be disappointed by what he describes as the “normalisation of racism” in recent years, he stresses that their struggles were not in vain. “They still set the foundation on which we are able to do this,” he says. “There was a time when I would never have been able to put this exhibition on.”The recreation of Virk’s teenage bedroom offers a glimpse into the lives of south Asians growing up in the UK in the 1980s – with posters of Michael Jackson and Madonna alongside a newspaper showcasing bhangra talent.“If you’re born in this country, you have this whole new identity, an identity which is very intersectional,” says Virk. “Friends, relationships, music, fashion, movies – all of that. I wanted to encapsulate that as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Virk said his mother’s poems regularly touched on domestic violence and abuse and it was important that the exhibition contained a dedicated space to reflect the stories of south Asian women.“Often the story around the south Asian mother or the woman tends to be – particularly of that era – in the kitchen, looking after the children, working in the shop with the husband,” says Virk. “But I’m also saying that those women had a really important role, not only within the family or the community, but also wider society. There were women like my mother who were going against the status quo.”The exhibition ends with a reflection space, which Virk describes as essential to process challenging memories that may arise from the stories on display. Visitors can also reflect by sharing their own stories.In a note left at the end of the exhibition, one wrote: “We had P*** graffitied on to our car. It happened when I was young and only now have I realised I’ve been carrying that around with me.”Another said the exhibition had “cathartically taken me on a joyous, emotional, beautiful journey”.“Never has a museum moved me so much,” it said. “The racism, the domestic violence, the 80s music, fashion, fun – the everything in our story.”Stories That Made Us: Roots, Resilience, Representation is at the HerbertArtGallery & Museum until 25 May 2026Explore more on these topicsArtMuseumsCoventryRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was the perfect match for Phoebe, a lightning rod for her kookiness and providing the solid family she’d never had. It wasn’t just the fact that he was played by Paul Rudd that managed to win over the viewers. His profile was nowhere near what it would later become, so the audience weren’t responding to star power in the same way they had, say, to Bruce Willis, Tom Selleck or Reese Witherspoon. Mike had to play the long game, put in the graft and win Phoebe’s trust, and won ours in the process.AJ, LondonEwan Roy – SuccessionIf it counts as late, with his arrival in episode five of the first season ofSuccession, my vote goes to Ewan Roy, elder brother of Logan, played impeccably by James Cromwell. An agitator to his ruthless younger brother, Ewan with his social and political conscience gave left-leaning viewers someone to root for.Ann, LondonAly – New GirlView image in fullscreenGreat expectations … Aly (Nasim Pedrad) and Winston (Lamorne Morris) in New Girl.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWinston was already a brilliant character, and adding in a love interest for him in season four was such a great decision. Aly was smart, funny and a perfect partner for Winston. On top of all that, she gelled so well with the extremely strong ensemble cast, it made you forget she wasn’t there from the beginning.Aimee, Ulverston, CumbriaThe Mother – How I Met Your MotherI loved the Mother in the final season of How I Met Your Mother. While many people detest the end of the show, her introduction was what really uplifted the final series. After eight series of buildup, nobody thought the show could deliver on their promise of this perfect partner for Ted. However, they over-delivered if anything, bringing in a character who all fans of the show fell in love with.Matt,LondonRiver Song – Doctor WhoAlex Kingston’s character transformedDoctor Who– the series and the Time Lord – as soon as she first uttered the words “Hello, sweetie”. Admittedly, she did later try to kill him, but there was a happy ending. Reader, she married him.Anil Patel, LondonKryten – Red DwarfView image in fullscreenExcellent one-liners … Kryten (Robert Llewellyn) in Red Dwarf.Photograph: Wenn Ltd/AlamyAfter first appearing as a one-off character in season two, Kryten was so great that the writers brought him back as a regular. As an android, Kryten could explain puzzling situations to the other crew members, but also go on away missions. And he was given some excellent lines, one of my favourites being when he meets his future self, now wearing a wig: “What is that you have on your head? I hope you have a quarantine licence for it.”Helen Taylor, Wokingham, BerkshireCastiel – SupernaturalCastiel didn’t arrive in the show until season four. He was the angel who raised the dead Dean Winchester from hell and back to life. Supernatural went on to have 15 seasons, and Castiel became a part of the team. For his actor, Misha Collins, to go from a guest to a primary character was an amazing transition – and it had everything to do with the actor and how he played the character. The first time we see him he’s a man wearing an open trenchcoat over a shirt and tie – with huge wings shadowed on the walls behind him. That image alone made Castiel something new and wonderful that fit right in. Collins won us over without even saying a word.Sarah Bewley, 72,Florida, USLalo Salamanca – Better Call SaulView image in fullscreenGave the show a rush … Lalo Salamanca (Tony Dalton) in Better Call Saul.Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures TelevisionFor me, Better Call Saul was petering out after the first three seasons without much of a way into the Breaking Bad story until Lalo Salamanca arrived. Tuco was involved previously as was Hector and Mike, but Lalo’s arrival gave BCS the rush it needed to persevere.Daniel Coogan, LondonJacqueline ‘Jack’ Sloane – NCISI liked Maria Bello who played Jacqueline “Jack” Sloane in NCIS in seasons 15-18 as a senior special agent and operational psychologist who specialised in profiling. They gave her a backstory as a prisoner of war in Afghanistan who was tortured, which allowed her to connect with people who had similar experiences.Allen Salyer,Michigan, USALane Pryce - Mad MenView image in fullscreenSuperbly nuanced … Jared Harris as Lane Pryce and Christina Hendricks as Joan Holloway in Mad Men.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyLane Pryce inMad Menwas an excellent addition to an already formidable cast. His own brand of 60s Englishness was a jolt in the arm for both the fictional company and the show and his story arc was expertly drawn right until its conclusion. Jared Harris was superbly nuanced, and his office brawl with Pete, sleeves up, Queensbury rules, will live on as one of TV’s most surprising, tame and funniest fight scenes. Just brilliant.Ben,Burgess HillFrank – It’s Always Sunny in PhiladelphiaIt’s hard to remember that series one didn’t have Danny DeVito in it. Getting such a sitcom legend in the show was a total coup – his bromance with room mate and possible son Charlie is heartwarming and disgusting in equal measure. He’s filthy rich (or just plain filthy), kinky and heartless. The show would be poorer without him.Anna,GlasgowLord Flashheart – BlackadderView image in fullscreenFlash by name, flash by nature! … Lord Flashheart (Rik Mayall) and Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) in Blackadder.Photograph: BBCLord Flashheart (Rik Mayall) in Blackadder II: “Flash by name, Flash by nature! Hooray!” OK, so it’s the first episode and not the end of the series, but there’s no denying Mayall upstages his legendary cast-mates when he literally arrives (and leaves) with a bang at the end of the episode, taking Blackadder’s fiance (Gabrielle Glaister) with him. Woof!Rob,LondonMeg – MotherlandMeg (Tanya Moodie), who arrives in season two of Motherland, disrupts the group at the school gates and doesn’t give a shit. I love her because she is funny and outrageous yet vulnerable like all of us. She would definitely be one of my besties.Nicola Borradaile,LondonRalph Cifaretto – The SopranosView image in fullscreenRattled everyone … Ralph (Joe Pantoliano), right, and Georgie (Frank Santorelli) in The Sopranos.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyArriving with a threadbare moral compass, Ralph was the most horrible, comical, yet fully realised character to arrive late. The impact of his actions affected the show long after his exit. He rattled everyone. But he was the greatest earner of Tony’s crew. Murdered his pregnant mistress. Organised the murder of his partner’s son. Charming, yet charmless. Evil with a smile and the calmest bully, yet distraught and vulnerable at his son’s death. A domineering devotee of toxic masculinity, yet secretly needed to be dominated sexually by big women. A truly unforgettable character who gave The Sopranos a cruel, comical oxygen for two long years.Ronnie, LondonSideshow Bob – The SimpsonsView image in fullscreenJust perfect … Sideshow Bob (voiced by Kelsey Grammer) in The Simpsons.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyI see your Frasier Crane and raise you Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons, another Kelsey Grammer character who first appeared in a non-speaking part in episode eight of season one. The Cape Feare episode is just perfect – the rakes, the witness protection team’s impossible task of convincing Homer that he has a new surname – but all his other appearances made for standout episodes.Stephen Lalley, Cumbernauld, ScotlandExplore more on these topicsTelevisionFriendsSuccessionDoctor WhoMad MenDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In what could be mistaken for a case of form following function, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 moves the exact same way. It’s so ostentatiously awkward that it constantly draws attention to its inept imitations of actions that other movies, even bad ones, intuitively understand – like making transitions between scenes or locations.Oh. What. Fun. review – Michelle Pfeiffer leads Amazon’s underbaked Christmas turkeyRead moreFor example, when faced with the need to isolate a mean science teacher (Wayne Knight) so that he can be vengefully murdered by one of the aforementioned animatronics, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 bafflingly cuts to him walking down a school hallway (during a science fair that has inexplicably run far into a Saturday evening), having a cellphone conversation about how he needs to visit his office to retrieve his keys. The keys themselves, the location of his office, and the unseen person on the other end of the phone have no meaning in the greater story, not even nominally. They’re just a jumble of elements that the film-makers grasp at, under the assumption that it will add up to something that looks and sounds like a movie should.That this grasping is performed with a daft serenity, rather than sweaty panic, can probably be owed to the firstFive Nights at Freddy’sbecoming a massive youth-culture hit in 2023. This is the kind of sequel that assumes everything went swimmingly with its predecessor. Based on a beloved and lore-heavy video game series, the earlier film followed Mike (Josh Hutcherson), his confusingly decades-younger sister Abby (Piper Rubio), and local police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) as they uncovered the secrets of an abandoned Chuck E Cheese-style restaurant and its haunted mascots. One of those secrets: that Vanessa’s father William Afton (Matthew Lillard) killed local children and then controlled their souls as they inhabited the various animatronic creatures with names (and animal personas) like Freddy Fazbear, Chica and Foxy.The sequel reveals more about Vanessa’s past, with a 1982-set prologue introducing a new animatronic character called Marionette, along with a new ghostly possessor to continue menacing our heroes. Abby actually misses the possessed creatures that befriended her in the first film, and who Mike has baselessly promised to recreate in some form. The Marionette takes advantage of Abby’s animatronic loyalty to lure her into another abandoned restaurant. Its extra features, like a water-tunnel ride, are hustled through without much thought; much of the story involves shuttling between several nondescript locations of indeterminate distance from each other. That shuttling includes the animatronics escaping their restaurant habitat and clanking around in the outside world, which provides more opportunities for returning director Emma Tammi to construct clever suspense sequences.In keeping with the first film, these opportunities are repeatedly and firmly declined. One thrill-ride of a scene, presumably designed to further imitate gameplay, has Mike sitting at a computer console, clicking at random through a security system, hoping to find the powerful wifi system that will shut down the animatronics remotely. The movie is set in 2002, so it must explain with trademark elegance that this wifi happens to be unusually powerful. Sure, that makes sense; why wouldn’t a long-shuttered kids’ restaurant be on the cutting edge of tech? Game creator Scott Cawthon, here the sole credited screenwriter, has thought of everything, and also made sense of nothing.This includes the movie’s bizarre attempts to synthesize some influences. Though the robot characters have an 80s aesthetic in an early-00s setting, some other details suggest a desire to nod at 90s classics like Jurassic Park (where Knight is also satisfyingly killed by themed creatures) and Scream (where Lillard also plays a serial killer). Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 even goes so far as to cast both Lillard (whose character died in the first movie) and Skeet Ulrich (who most famously played Lillard’s co-conspirator in Scream), then doesn’t bother to give them a single shared scene. The movie’s new revenge hook of Marionette targeting neglectful parents, meanwhile, seems vaguely inspired by, well … saying A Nightmare on Elm Street would give it too much credit. Let’s say it’s inspired by an AI-generated summary of A Nightmare on Elm Street that fails to mention how that movie has indelibly scary imagery and rich themes involving adults passing their traumas on to children.Those sorts of things don’t seem to interest Cawthon. By all evidence, he is singularly unqualified to write towards human experiences that aren’t marble-mouthed attempts at references. He’s protecting a franchise, of which Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 positions itself as an installment, rather than a real movie. As such, it doesn’t bother with a proper ending – though the beginning and middle it provides suggest that this may not matter. Its shrug of a quasi-cliffhanger may not matter to its young target audience, either. Some of them, though, along with anyone else not inherently besotted with game iconography and YouTuber cameos, may start to wonder what it would be like to watch a real horror movie – or just one made with the comforts of baseline hackwork. Like a lot of movies, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 has its own souvenir popcorn bucket. This may be the first one where the bucket is more entertaining than the feature.Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is out in cinemas on 5 DecemberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s dusty, there’s a saloon bar, there are horses, an ineffable sense of – I don’t know, let’s call it manifest destiny – about the place, and the only colour settlers have brought with them is sepia. But wait! What’s this? The owner of the local silver mine riding into town? And it’s a woman! In a western?Yessir, it is. Not only that but she is played byGillian Anderson(in full ice mode, despite the dust) and is clearly trouble. Not onlythat, but there is a second woman about to go toe-to-toe with her and do battle for the town’s soul over the eight episodes that comprise The Abandons, the latest venture from Sons of Anarchy’s Kurt Sutter. Its joint lead is Lena Headey as Fiona Nolan, a devout Irish Catholic woman who has gathered a misfit ragtag bunch of motley orphan crew outcasts about her and lives with this patchwork family in Jasper Hollow. Jasper Hollow, alas, is full of silver that Constance Van Ness (the local mine owner, played by Anderson) wishes to bring under her control to placate one of her investors.The Nolan homestead and cattle ranch, along with the settlements belonging to the three other hard-working, honest families in the Hollow, have been experiencing a run of bad luck ever since the Van Ness eye turned towards their land. After Constance’s latest visit to town, a group of masked men drive Fiona’s steers to the edge of a cliff and only the plucky orphans’ bravery prevents a bovine massacre.“Her tyranny’s getting worse!” says orphan Elias (Nick Robinson), because there are moments in the script where things are less A Fistful of Dollars than The Gilded Age Goes Back 50 Years and Takes a Hike West. But he’s right, and the sheriff, the dirty dog, won’t help. Thus begins the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, between right and might, between people bound by blood and people bound to each other by choice. Also, faith and godlessness, fidelity and treachery, legal justice and moral justice. It’s a very binary era.View image in fullscreenLeading the revolt … Lena Headey as Fiona Nolan in The Abandons.Photograph: NetflixBut westerns cannot live by struggles fuelled by abstract notions alone. We have to be more emotionally invested than that, so the dissolute but beloved son Willem Van Ness (Toby Hemingway) is pitchforked to death by Elias’s sister Dahlia (Diana Silvers) after he attempts to rape her. The Nolan clan hide the body but Constance sniffs out guilt like a mongoose in a bustle and redoubles her efforts to bring them down. Fiona redoubles hers to unite the four families of Jasper Hollow against the mongoose tyranny. In the end, a dead dog sways the vote and the fight is truly on.Added to the mix is outlaw Roache (Michiel Huisman), who bonds with Constance’s daughter over a mutual love of Schubert, and we all know wherethatcan lead. She and Elias have been making goo-goo eyes at each other, too, which is no mean feat in such a dusty environment. Timothy V Murphy joins as Father Duffy, Fiona’s childhood friend and lifelong support. Is this a genre in which it is wise to trust a priest? Is any? We shall see.Like most westerns, The Abandons drives you to distraction because it takes itself so very, very seriously. Perhaps when the US gets a bit older it will be able to laugh at itself a bit more, or at least let a bit more light and shade into the retellings of its origin story. But at the moment, the result is too often too heavy to take proper flight.Does the twist of having the warring protagonists be matriarchs instead of patriarchs help? A little. But the novelty wears off faster than it might when their concerns remain the same as ever: protecting the family legacy (whether it’s a found family or otherwise) and rallying hardscrabble folks against the privileged, apparently untouchable few.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it remains a thoughtful, essentially sound production – and the script improves in quality if not depth. Overall, The Abandons works, because myths by definition always work.

Ayshea – Farewell (1973)Roy Wood occasionally wrote for others – psych fans should check the Acid Gallery’s splendid 1969 single Dance Round the Maypole – and the single he made with girlfriend Ayshea Brough, an early 70s TV presenter, exemplifies his idiosyncratic pop skillsandhis kitchen-sink approach to arrangement: kettle drums! More oboe!View image in fullscreenRoy Wood with Ayshea Brough in 1973.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images19. Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne – Me and You (1989)At the end of the 80s – a decade where musical trends didn’t fit Wood’s approach at all – the Electric Light Orchestra’s architects briefly regrouped, recording two tracks that were never released. Me and You is the pick, offering a tantalising glimpse of what latter-day ELO might have sounded like had Wood never left.18. Wizzard – Indiana Rainbow (1976)The great lost Wizzard single (recorded for the rejected 1976 album Main Street) saw Wood grafting a charming big band-influenced song and arrangement on to a thunderous dancefloor-adjacent drumbeat. The music sounds surprisingly like the disco-swing hybrid of Dr Buzzard’s Original Savannah Band’s 1976 debut album, which might have accounted for its belated release.17. The Move – Brontosaurus (1970)By the release of Brontosaurus, Wood’s career was in flux:Jeff Lynnehad joined the Move with plans to start ELO; Wood had started wearing backcombed hair and make-up that prefigured his Wizzard look. The track itself is proto-metal but still packs a great pop melody.16. Wizzard – Meet Me at the Jailhouse (1973)Wood was always keen to point out how different Wizzard’s albums were from their hits. He wasn’t joking, as evidenced by Wizzard Brew’s teenybopper-baffling 13-minute centrepiece Meet Me at the Jailhouse, which shifts between heavy riffing and rhythmless free jazz improv, laced with bracingly angular guitar shredding.15. Roy Wood – Why Does Such a Pretty Girl Sing Those Sad Songs (1975)Wood’s second solo album, Mustard, is almost as great as its predecessor, Boulders, repeating its Wood-plays-writes-and-produces-everything approach, if not its commercial success. But chart success isn’t everything: Why Does Such a Pretty Girl Sing Those Sad Songs is the most luscious and beautiful of Wood’s Beach Boys homages.14. The Move – Hello Susie (1970)View image in fullscreenThe Move …(left to right)Ace Kefford, Trevor Burton, Carl Wayne, Bev Bevan and Roy WoodPhotograph: Sylvia Pitcher/RedfernsThe Move’s second album, Shazam, was a commercial disaster that precipitated vocalist Carl Wayne’s departure. But that was no reflection on its contents, as proven by the awesome Hello Susie – the sound of Wood applying his irrepressible pop smarts to music built for a new, hoarier, heavier, proggier era.13. Roy Wood – Songs of Praise (1973)Songs of Praise was written as a potential 1972 Eurovision entry for the New Seekers. At risk of sounding snobbish, it was far too good for that, a perfect example of Wood’s ability to pluck melodies that sounded instantly familiar – as if they’d been around for years – out of the ether.12. Wizzard – Rock ‘n’ Roll Winter (Loony’s Tune) (1974)View image in fullscreenRoy Wood, centre,in Wizzard.Photograph: Alan Messer/ShutterstockYou could view Rock ‘n’ Roll Winter as a more subtle sequel to the deathless I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday (it was supposed to be released in January while its predecessor was still in the charts): the tinsel is down, the festivities are over, the mood has turned to a kind of wistful optimism.11. The Move – Wild Tiger Woman (1968)An incredibly exciting single, Wild Tiger Woman’s failure on the charts might simply prove it was too far ahead of its time: its combination of rock’n’roll influence, a dense, wilfully artificial sound and fizzy overheated production make it sound less like a product of the late 60s than the glam era.10. ELO – Look at Me Now (1971)From the start, Lynne and Wood were pulling ELO in different directions – the former more Beatles-esque, the latter more obviously influenced by baroque classical music. It couldn’t last, but when their debut album worked – as on Wood’s drum-free, cello- and oboe-bedecked Look at Me Now – it makes you wish it had.9. Wizzard – I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday (1973)There’s something mildly aggrieving about this song’s annual success overshadowing the rest of Wood’s rich oeuvre. But, equally, writing something that becomes part of the fabric of national life is quite an achievement. Note the cash register that opens the track: a winning speck of cynicism in the tinselly facade.8. Wizzard – Angel Fingers (A Teen Ballad) (1973)Be My Baby opulently recast for the 70s, with lyrics that sum up the wannabe pop star’s raison d’etre – “If I could get a job with that cool rockin’ band / You’d notice me with that red guitar in my hand” – and ponder fandom’s transience: “Will Dion still be so important to you on your wedding day?”It’s hairmageddon! Is the leather-codpieced world of glam metal making a comeback?Read more7. Roy Wood – Dear Elaine (1973)Wood’s debut solo album Boulders might be his masterpiece. Given the speed at which pop was moving at the time, it seems bizarre its contents were recorded in 1969-70 – they fitted the climate of 1973 perfectly. But then timelessness doesn’t date: the baroque loveliness of Dear Elaine would hit home in any era.6. The Move – Fire Brigade (1968)A masterclass in a particularly relentless kind of pop songwriting, Fire Brigade offers two and a half minutes in which every last second is crammed with hooks and earworm melodies: Byrds-y jangle, incredible vocal harmonies, twanging Duane Eddy guitar licks. The whole thing sounds like happiness rendered into musical form.5. Wizzard – Ball Park Incident (1972)A fantastic song and a head-turning statement of intent, Wizzard’s first release supersized the 50s rock’n’roll influence that ran through glam: a vast, thunderous wall of sound – two drummers, umpteen brass and woodwind instruments, honky-tonk piano, distorted guitars – topped off with a raw-throated vocal. What a fabulous single.4. The Move – Blackberry Way (1968)By now, Wood’s inability to stay in one place musically seemed to be wearing on his bandmates: Blackberry Way’s pivot into parent-friendly baroque pop – albeit of downcast, faintly psychedelic bent – helped hasten guitarist Trevor Burton’s departure, while vocalist Carl Wayne refused to sing it. Its fantastic melody sent it to No 1 regardless.3. Roy Wood – Forever (1973)By the time Forever made the Top 10, Wood had appeared on Top of the Pops in four different guises – the Move, ELO, Wizzard, and now solo – in 18 months. The song is just gorgeous, a loving hybrid of the Beach Boys and Neil Sedaka: both were credited “for inspiration” on the label.2. The Move – I Can Hear the Grass Grow (1967)The toughest example of Move on psychedelic form, in which the snarling superiority of the acid initiate towards “the people all in line” is undercut by the sense that the LSD experience has proved all too much: “I need you to help.” One ofthegreat British psych singles, it still sounds awesomely powerful.1. Wizzard – See My Baby Jive (1973)“Roy Wood was a super-fan,” wrote Bob Stanley, approvingly, in his book Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop. “He wanted to be all of pop, all at the same time.” It’s a brilliant summation of an oeuvre so rich and eclectic that picking a No 1 is genuinely tough. See My Baby Jive is both a masterpiece and one of the maddest, strangest 70s chart toppers, a superb pop song with an utterly euphoric chorus, an act of chaotic, teeming sonic maximalism: five minutes long, packed with unexpected key changes, a French horn solo and an outro that refuses to end. A joy.Listen to Ranked on Spotify – or transfer the playlist toApple,Tidalor other servicesExplore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockJeff LynnefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gone are the days when David Bowie could seemingly arrive fully formed with Space Oddity and Hunky Dory, with most of the record-buying public unaware of his years of struggle in bands such as the Lower Third; or when Robert Zimmerman could become Bob Dylan and invent a backstory about running away with the circus as a teenager. Today’s artists are so intensely scrutinised once they get even a glimmer of success that there’s always the chance some internet sleuth will blow a performer’s cred by unearthing a terrible video of them caterwauling through Wonderwall in sixth form. Which makes Dove Ellis so thoroughly unusual, because so little is known about him.His debut album arrives with no biography and barely any information at all apart from the track listing and a few minor details. He doesn’t appear to have ever given an interview and in one song here scolds: “Keep their cameras off my face.” His publicist, whose job thus far seems solely to be sending out music, describes Ellis as a “an introverted character”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for BlizzardOne can piece together this: he’s 22 and from Galway but relocated to Manchester. The songs he posted on Bandcamp led to a bidding war, but he rejected the attentions of major labels to go with an independent. He recently opened forGeeseon their US tour dates but otherwise seems to have been playing pubs and small venues in London (including the buzzy Windmill) and Manchester for a couple of years now. As recently as October he was opening the student night at Sheffield’s Sidney & Matilda, where he apparently went down the usual storm. His next London show (at the ICA on 9 December) sold out within an hour, but if his self-produced debut arrives to burgeoning expectations it’s entirely because of the quality of the music.The few reviewers who have seen Ellis so far mostly compare him to Jeff Buckley or his father, Tim Buckley – fair comparisons given how Ellis’s remarkable vocals can settle into a dreamy falsetto so fragile he could be dancing on a pin, and then suddenly perform a handbrake turn into intensity, even anger. The way the arrangements (including saxophone and drums) dart around his voice in ornate little counter-melodies recalls fellow Irishman Van Morrison, and recent single To the Sandals noticeably nods to Joan Armatrading’s Love and Affection. Thom Yorke and Rufus Wainwright have also been mentioned, but none of these comparisons quite pin Ellis down, not least because he shifts shape so frequently.Dove Ellis: Pale Song – videoBeautiful opener Little Left Hope begins as fragile as Nick Drake, but erupts into something much more rousing, the words capturing the rocky road to making music: “Maybe we’ll start a band / With the stranger you have to like / Cos he knows how to play the drums.” Ellis’s lyrics frequently seem to flutter between hope and despair, before building to a purifying conclusion. In the magically warm Pale Song, the past is a trouble which, perhaps, can be shaken off: “The past is like a sign / A sign it never talks / A sign you think you’ve lived / But it’s just stone with a little chalk.” In the singalong-friendly Love Is, he roars, “Love is not the antidote to all your problems,” but concludes, “Love is your last chance.” In Jaundice he uses the unlikely vehicle of rumbustious rock’n’roll infused with an Irish jig to seemingly rail against unfairness: “Sometimes a child is born without any face / At the breast of their own mother right out of place.”Ellis has described To the Sandals – a Bandcamp release now mixed/spruced up by Big Thief producer Andrew Sarlo – as concerning “reflections on a failing shotgun marriage in Cancún”. Not that the unlikely subject of an ill-fated union hastened by pregnancy in Mexico is particularly obvious in lines such as: “From your grace / The sadist fails / Their red blade / A-rallying, tallying.”Trying to unravel the songs’ meanings can become a parlour game, but it’s enough to savour his dazzling use of language or the sheer emotion in heart-swelling songs such as When You Tie Your Hair Up. The 10 tunes are so strong they seem as familiar as old friends, and if Ellis isn’t reinventing the wheel, he’s certainly giving the old thing a caring coat of varnish. His songs sound meticulously crafted but the recordings themselves have a beautifully intimate, unadorned, down-home feel. At times, the picked and strummed guitars, rolling 70s rock piano, wind instruments and clattering percussion are interspersed with random noises and distortion, but somehow everything seems to have fallen perfectly into place on a glorious debut.This week Dave listened toLouis O’Hara – MagpieFrom Pembroke Dock in west Wales, this gently folksy tribute to a longstanding friendship is unusually touching and truly lovely.Alexis Petridis is awayExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Mark Bowles’s debut novel, which won the audiobook fiction category at the inaugural British Audio awards (where, full disclosure, I was a judge), is a deliciously sweary monologue from a middle-aged malcontent.A sideways reflection on working-class identity and masculinity, the novel gives voice to Henry Nash, a man of little patience. Sitting in a London coffee shop and trying to write a monograph of his father, he rains judgment on the other patrons whose obnoxious phone calls he can’t help but overhear. An Oxford graduate turned writer and academic, Nash lives in a Soho flat where he has been known to furtively drop eggs on passersby who disturb him with their drunken racket.Along with rants about business jargon and city hipsters, he recalls scenes from his working-class childhood in Bradford and his university days, where he struggled to fit in with his public school-educated peers and “where I wore my learning, such as it was, like a trenchcoat on a summer’s day”. But since then, Henry has grown comfortable with academia and decries the anti-intellectual English, “who hate anything which doesn’t return them to the prosaic and the everyday”.Feminist History for Every Day of the Year by Kate Mosse review – the women who helped change the worldRead moreThe narrator is the actor Paul Hilton, who brilliantly inhabits this hopeless grouch and conveys his many contradictions. That Nash seems to hold his fellow humans in contempt makes him sound like dreadful company.

It includes all three larger chamber works plus the composer’s own two-piano arrangement of his orchestral masterpiece La Valse: Alasdair Beatson and Simon Crawford-Phillips are a polished team in this, sounding wonderfully louche early on and then dispatching fistfuls of notes and long glissandos with seeming ease, all while catching the music’s increasingly sinister nature.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Ravel: Chamber Music.Photograph: OnyxThe 1905 Introduction and Allegro was a commission from a harp manufacturer, intended to make their instrument sound good – which it duly does as played by Lucy Wakeford, although what is most striking is the way the seven instruments coalesce and separate to create kaleidoscopic textural interest. Indeed, as confirmed by their quicksilver, sometimes excitably fierce String Quartet and especially by their vibrant performance of the Piano Trio, it’s the attention to the details of colour and tone that really makes these performances take flight, the instruments combining to catch the dazzling light and intriguing shade that are such intrinsic features of Ravel’s music.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

For Margaret Atwood, an author who has sold more than 40m books, the idea of writing about herself seemed “Dead boring. Who wants to read about someone sitting at a desk messing up blank sheets of paper?” Happily, she did it anyway.Book of Lives: A Memoir of Sorts(Chatto & Windus) is a 624-page doorstopper chronicling Atwood’s life and work, and a tremendous showcase for her wisdom and wit. Helen Garner’s similarly chunky, Baillie Gifford prize-winning How to End a Story (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) is a diary collection spanning 20 years and provides piquant and puckish snapshots of the author’s life, work and her unravelling marriages. Mixing everyday observation and gossipy asides with profound self-examination, it is spare in style and utterly moreish.In Arundhati Roy’sMother Mary Comes to Me(Hamish Hamilton) and Jung Chang’sFly, Wild Swans(William Collins), formidable mothers get top billing.In the former, The God of Small Things author reveals how her mother, whose own father was a violent drunk, stood up to the patriarchy and campaigned for women’s rights, but was cruel to her daughter. Describing her as “my shelter and my storm”, Roy reflects on Mary’s contradictions with candour and compassion. Fly, Wild Swans is the sequel to Chang’s bestselling Wild Swans, picking up where its predecessor left off and reflecting how that book was only made possible by the author’s mother, who shared family stories and kept her London-dwelling daughter apprised of events in China.View image in fullscreenMatriarchby Tina Knowles(Dialogue) is an unusual take on motherhood, as it reveals the reality of rearing two musical superstars: Beyoncé and Solange. We learn how Knowles, whose great-grandmother Célestine was a slave in Louisiana, became the ultimate stage mom, guiding her girls to realise their creative dreams while fostering pride in their blackness and womanhood. Elsewhere in the crowded pantheon of celebrity memoirs, Anthony Hopkins’We Did OK, Kid(Simon & Schuster) stands out as a thoughtful and unvarnished account of a storied life and career. The book digs deep into the actor’s problems with anxiety and addiction – he sought help for alcoholism after driving from Arizona to Los Angeles blind drunk – and his discomfort with fame.Vagabond(Century) by Tim Curry is a brisk and bracingly sweary memoir by the actor best known for playing Rocky Horror’s Frank-N-Furter. Though he skimps on the details of his personal life – “respectfully, none of your fucking business” – he is enjoyably scathing about the talents (or lack thereof) of some of his acting peers.Kathy Burke’sA Mind of My Own(Gallery)begins in an Islington council flat where, as a child, Burke shared a room with her alcoholic and fitfully violent father. “We were living with a lunatic,” she notes. But you won’t find any self-pity in this terrifically entertaining life story, which goes on to recall her time at the Anna Scher theatre school and a career-defining role in Gary Oldman’s Nil By Mouth. Her stories of posh actors and directors looking down their noses at her, a working-class woman, are a hoot.View image in fullscreenLike Burke, the musician and poet Patti Smith had a tough start in life, living in poverty and frequently confined to her bed from illnesses including tuberculosis, scarlet fever and pneumonia. Soulful and intimate,Bread of Angels(Bloomsbury) is Smith’s fourth volume of autobiography, and details her childhood, her decade away from music raising a family and her return to work following a series of devastating personal losses.In Lionel Richie’sTruly(William Collins), the All Night Long singer traces his path from Tuskegee, Alabama, to member of the Commodores, before making it as a chart-topping solo artist. His story brims with gratitude at his good fortune and is punctuated by cameos from Gregory Peck, Sammy Davis Jr and Nelson Mandela, among others. There are stars aplenty inThe Uncool(4th Estate), in which Cameron Crowe, director of Almost Famous, looks back on his days as a teenage music journalist for Creem and Rolling Stone, during which he enjoyed months-long access to David Bowie, Iggy Pop and the Stones. Casting himself as the nerdy outsider, his account is full of charm and lyricism.View image in fullscreenFrankly(Macmillan) by the ex-first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, andA Different Kind of Power(Macmillan) by former New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern, both reveal much about the misogyny endured by female leaders. Along with the sexist jibes from opponents and the press, one of the biggest challenges for Sturgeon was quelling the voice in her head “telling me I wasn’t good enough”. Meanwhile, Ardern, who gave birth less than a year into her premiership, had to deal with the pressure of keeping her early pregnancy hidden, and later, as a new mother, worrying about being perceived as not giving her all to the job.The first nonfiction work by the Essex Serpent author Sarah Perry,Death of an Ordinary Man(Jonathan Cape), is a moving chronicle of the final days of the author’s father-in-law, David, who died aged 77 of oesophageal cancer. Loved by his family, David lived an unremarkable existence, yet Perry renders the life and death of this reserved soul in brilliant and penetrating detail.Another unremarkable life comes under the microscope inI Deliver Parcels in Beijing(Allen Lane), a powerful memoir by Chinese author Hu Anyan now translated into English. Anyan, who had 19 jobs in six cities after leaving high school, details the lonely and dehumanising grind of China’s gig economy. The book is a grim indictment of a terrible system, though Anyan finds humour and dignity in his bleakest moments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Loss but also laughter pervadesA Truce That Is Not Peace(4th Estate), a bracingly blunt and deliberately fragmented memoir from Canadian writer Miriam Toews in which she recalls the deaths of her father and sister from suicide, along with her repressive Mennonite upbringing.Lifeblood(Daunt) is an impossibly poignant memoir by Mina Holland about her experience of caring for a daughter with a rare and life-threatening blood disorder.It has been a vintage year for biographies of cultural giants. Readers undaunted by the prospect of 1,000+ pages are rewarded with depth and insight in Ron Chernow’sMark Twain(Allen Lane), an account of the life of the author of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Shorter, but no less heavyweight, is Andrew Graham-Dixon’sVermeer: A Life Lost and Found(Allen Lane), which explores the life and work of the Dutch painter. Among the revelations is the identity of the Girl with a Pearl Earring, who is not, the author believes, either Vermeer’s daughter or his maid.View image in fullscreenFrances Wilson’sElectric Spark(Bloomsbury) is a terrific study of Scottish writer Muriel Spark, focusing on the formative decades before the publication of her first novel. Meticulously researched and illuminating,Gertrude Stein: An Afterlife(Faber), by Francesca Wade, analyses its subject’s life alongside her posthumous reputation.Katherine Mansfield: A Hidden Life(Reaktion) by Gerri Kimber is a sensitive and scholarly account of the fiercely independent life of the modernist writer whose talent was the envy of Virginia Woolf. Hanna Diamond’s Josephine Baker’s Secret War (Yale) tells the gripping tale of the music hall star and actor who worked with the French Resistance and the British and American intelligence services during the second world war. Less well known but still fascinating is Rosemary Woodruff, fourth wife of counter-culture luminary Timothy Leary, whose story is skilfully told in Susannah Cahalan’s The Acid Queen (Canongate). Woodruff’s unusual life – which took in communes, drugs, criminal cartels and breaking her husband out of prison – proves more than worthy of posthumous attention.Finally, Ian Penman’sEric Satie Three Piece Suite(Fitzcarraldo) adopts a fresh approach to biography, examining the achievements of the French composer in the form of an A-Z anthology, with entries including Les (as in Dawson, who Penman posits may have been a fan) and Bowler Hat (Satie’s preferred headwear). The book is as delightfully oddball as its subject.To browse all biography and memoir books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

The second in the trilogy pits the Brightlanders, who persecute those with “songlight”, against the Aylish, who prize them – and the Teroans, spacefaring telepaths who see ordinary humans as disposable. As multiple finely drawn protagonists – including Elsa, searching desperately for sanctuary, Nightingale, forced to appease a terrifying captor, and Rye, trying to understand an extraordinary discovery – fight to find love, acceptance and safety, the book blazes like its title, consuming the reader more fiercely with every page.

The power of words to wound, but also to tell of authentic living, courage and change, delivered via sit-ins, marches and protests on every scale, is apparent throughout this book, which chronicles queer activism in the UK and US from the 1950s to the early 21st century. Though it contains many stories of violence and suffering, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the ravages of HIV/Aids, the prevalent mood, emphasised by Roberts’s bold, colourful, expressive artwork, is of defiance, joy and proud hope – from Quentin Crisp’s flamboyance to the iterations of the Pride flag, Julian Hows wearing a skirt as a London Underground worker in the 70s to the first same-sex pre-watershed kiss. An outstanding achievement, setting out via individual, accessible narratives the hard-won rights that remain continually under threat.No RefugePatrice Aggs and Joe Brady(DFB)This standalone sequel to the superlative No Country is set in a horribly plausible war-torn Britain, where hostile bureaucracy preys on refugee children. Now that civil war has reached their home, Hannah, Bea and their little brother Dom flee, leaving their father behind; following The Plan, they hope to be reunited, but hiding from Free Kingdom soldiers and keeping themselves safe becomes steadily harder, even before they find themselves trapped in the oppressively policed Green Zone on the way to their rendezvous. Aggs’s dynamic images, muted colours and unsettling perspectives create a pervasive sense of fear in this empathy-honing, finely crafted and compelling graphic novel.View image in fullscreenWhat Happens OnlineNathanael Lessore (Hot Key)Fred’s life is tough. His dad works away, his mum’s struggling to cope, and at school he’s a nonentity with no friends. Online, though, Fred’s alter ego Existor is a gamer and streamer with an off-the-charts follower count – the polar opposite of his unpopular creator. Two worlds collide when Fred is tempted to use Existor’s influence to seed rumours about his bullying classmates – but when his lies spread like wildfire, the eventual consequences are damaging and painful. Who is Fred really, and who is willing to accept his offline self? With his deadpan humorous light touch, the award-winning Lessore investigates self-esteem, identity and on- and offline realities in a standout 13+ story that effortlessly blends the serious and comic, tackling the tough stuff without ever feeling preachy.Feminist History for Every Day of the YearKate Mosse, illustrated by Sophie Bass (Pan Macmillan)Spirited and inspiring, this compendium of “trailblazers through time and space” features a genuinely impressive range of iconic women – anti-apartheid campaigner Lilian Ngoyi and bra-designing Caresse Cosby stand alongside Florence Nightingale, Mary Wollstonecraft and Boudicca – while thought-provoking essays on subjects such as the climate emergency, male feminism, names and fashion introduce each month. Acknowledging that the views of some of her chosen heroes might tempt younger readers to “cancel” them, Mosse argues persuasively for not simply “leav[ing] out those we don’t agree with or don’t like” – since “women, like men, contain contradictions”. A deeply absorbing resource for anyone interested in fairness.To browse all children’s and young adult books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

(You didn’t think you could get Brexit into a romance?) The writing is wonderful, and the book has genuine heft – which might dial back the escapist fun, but it’s no less enjoyable for that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Despite highlighting its own issues in the title, this novel got a rather mixed reception from the more judgmental corners of the internet on account of the age difference between the lovers. The gap between Maya and Conor, her big brother’s best friend, is 15 years – she is 23 to his 38. Depending on your generation and point of view, this is either completely and absolutely fine, or intensely concerning, despite the heroine insisting valiantly on her own agency and a reluctant romantic hero who resists the affair for this very reason. The book itself is typically charming and incredibly enjoyable, full of one-liners and cheek. (Far less controversially, she has followed it up with Mate, about a vampire bride falling in love with a werewolf. Sex with an actual animal is notably less problematic than an age gap in 2025.)Sweet HeatBolu Babalola (Headline)Previously a Reese Witherspoon book club pick for her 2022 novel Honey & Spice, Babalola continues to show why with this gorgeous, lush new book featuring the same characters. Kiki is now running a romance podcast while her own love life is the traditional disaster area, when suddenly her handsome ex Malakai turns up as the best man at a wedding where she is maid of honour … It’s witty, obviously, but there’s a warmth and real depth to the characterisation and the issues affecting the young Londoners it portrays. Will you see what’s coming a mile off? Definitely. Will you enjoy the journey? Every bit of it.View image in fullscreenCover StoryMhairi McFarlane (HarperColins)McFarlane is so funny she was drafted in to the writers’ room for Slow Horses, the wittiest show on television. Fortunately she’s also still working as a novelist, which is excellent news for her avid fans. Cover Story is about two journalists who hate each other having to pretend to be a couple, but really it’s just an excuse for her sharp observations and deep, fundamental sweetness. The world is always a better place with McFarlane’s stories in it.Heart the LoverLily King (Canongate)“You knew I’d write a book about you one day,” begins this intensely brainy, tightly observed love story. From the cover, a homage to the classic Great Gatsby cover image of weeping eyes on a blue background, to the narrator’s adopted name – Jordan – and the two other sides of the triangle, Sam and Yash, calling their dates “Daisies”, you know you’re in proper, wallowing, literary-allusion territory. This is a book that explores youthful passion and its consequences down the decades with charm and precision: a perfect, no-brainer gift for the romantically minded English lit student in your life.To browse all romance books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

But if there’s no food for thought, the jokes have to hit big. And tonight, they don’t. By the end, it’s clear even Jones doesn’t think he’s had a good gig, protesting to his audience that we’ve been the most “tepid” of his tour – and musing aloud about how little the Guardian critic will have enjoyed it. In fact, the Guardian critic enjoyed the Mancunian’s company well enough – camp and ebullient, he’d be hard not to like – but wished for a better show: for more substantial content, some structure, or for jokes that developed beyond first (or – credit where it’s due – sometimes second) base.What we get is a seemingly formless meander through the 32-year-old’s life, taking in his family, a stint on Dancing on Ice and the social climb that has taken him from a “bin fire” Manchester suburb to the fringes of well-heeled Cheshire. For that, he has a new relationship to thank, and there’s a fun routine here about the encounter between his “hugger” boyfriend and Josh’s very non-tactile dad. Another choice gag late in the show, about “bumming”, sharply contrasts his postcoital feelings depending on whether he’s played “bummer” or “bummee”.But elsewhere, pickings are slim. Too often, so-called jokes are just vaguely amusing things that have happened to Jones – like being hit on by a woman in Cancún. He makes a great play about his supposedly transgressive “nonce” joke, but the gag itself barely registers as such – it’s just a setup, a situation, with no punchline or incident. Then there’s his digression into the slave trade, with its drive-by ignorance of local context (he ascribes to a Glasgow a history free of colonial guilt) and very underwhelming payoff.Wrapping up in under an hour, this is a vanishingly insubstantial set, then, without the craft or quality of gags that might redeem that flimsiness. Far from being got at for tepidness, I’d say tonight’s audience deserves credit for its discernment.AtMonkey Barrel Edinburgh, on 4 December.Then touringto April.Explore more on these topicsStageComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Within a minute, you’ll forget about the outside world. The Baltic has curated a concise, brave first solo exhibition in the UK of film pieces by the Uzbek artist and film-maker. It is exhilarating, terrifying and unforgettable.The room is dark. Four works are arranged around a padded black square in the centre for sitting or lying down on – a reference to the void, something Ismailova has been fascinated with throughout her two-decade practice. She grew up during perestroika, a period of widespread political, social and economic reform in the late 1980s, whenSoviet ideology began to collapseleaving a void in the culture. Ismailova felt this deeply – her father was a cinematographer and she was on sets with him from a young age. The family lived in a building opposite the largest and oldest film studio in Uzbekistan. During perestroika, films stopped being screened in public.Each film here is a universe of its own, richly layered, steeped in allusionThe four works sing to each other across the void; they crackle, scream and collide. The atmosphere of the space is elemental – images of fire, ice and cascading currents of water recur across the projections, while you can almost feel the sand whipping the back of your neck as you listen to the powerful desert wind.View image in fullscreenAspects of ASMR and video game aesthetics … Melted Into the Sun.Photograph: Image courtesy the artist. © Saodat Ismailova.The first work that draws me towards it is the mesmerising, eponymousAs We Fade, projected through 24 sheaths of silk suspended in the air, arranged in a glittering, shimmering line. The silk is significant, since the artist’s homeland, Uzbekistan, sat at the heart of the ancient trade route between east and west. The number of silks mimics the old cinematic standard number of frames projected per second. The footage, found and new, is of people performing rituals on the sacred Sulaiman Too mountain. It can’t be seen on every panel – they fade and disappear. Ismailova wants us to think about the images, but also what is not seen.References to the subconscious abound – the whole space feels like a psychic dreamspace. The strange, mysticalMelted Into the Sunplays at the bottom of the space, with traditional cushions (that once belonged to the artist’s grandmother) on the floor. The film loosely and lyrically explores an 8th-century prophet-like figure, Al-Muqanna. Faceless figures pace through the dusky topographies and under magenta skies, between significant locations: the Amu Darya river, the burial ground of Chillpiq; the city of Bukhara. With aspects of ASMR and video game aesthetics, the film avoids getting too bogged down in its retelling of local history. And its questions, asked by a narrated voiceover in the uvular sounds of Uzbek, are universal: who determines where is east and where is west?View image in fullscreenA woman’s domestic inner world … a still from Zukhra.Photograph: Image courtesy the artist. © Saodat Ismailova.I was blown away by Swan Lake, a rapturous ode to films from the central Asian region made between 1988 and 2001, from the collapse of the eastern bloc to the post-Soviet period. Ismailova’s film is visceral, poetic, avant garde but intelligible, deeply rooted in a time and place yet without boundaries. It captures the ambience of the time with an orchestral command of the exquisite cinematography taken from 28 films made in Kazakhstan,Uzbekistanand Tajikistan.There is scene after scene of breathtaking beauty, violence, protest, disorientation and anxiety; men, women and children dreaming; a woman kissing a fish; a man licking a shard of glass and a woman bursting into flames. There is crackling footage of ballet dancers performing Swan Lake, which was broadcast on state TV on a continuous loop following the deaths of Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko in the 1980s, and later when the Soviet Union collapsed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You allow yourself to be pulled along even as it warns that you are being manipulated. It was inspired by Ismailova’s memories of watching the hypnotistKashpirovsky, a Rasputin-like figure, on Soviet state television. In 1989, he attempted mass hypnosis – an excerpt of the broadcast is included – in the USSR’s last effort to save its crumbling regime and control its population.Ismailova is known for making works that consider the distinct male and female realms in central Asia, and this show riffs on these parallel worlds – centred on Zukhra, which was shown at the 2013 Venice biennale. It is a single, long shot of a woman sleeping on a bed, soundtracked with archival news recordings and a narration of the legend of Venus. Then she gets up and walks out of the room, leaving us looking at the empty bed. It is a daringly simple work that perfectly evokes the enormity and possibility of a woman’s apparently passive and domestic inner world – the space in which she is often confined to but not diminished by.You could be subsumed in this world for hours. Each film here is a universe of its own, richly layered, steeped in historical allusions. Yet clear meanings and political context matter less than magic and feeling in As We Fade. It is a show about how we hold on to the past and how to let go – and leaves you staring into the darkness, wondering what might emerge.Saodat Ismailova: As We Fade is at the Baltic, Gateshead, until 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsVideo artExhibitionsArtUzbekistanBaltic Centre for Contemporary ArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

In hip-hop theatre company ZooNation’s new Christmas show, Charles Dickens goes to places he’s never been. Choreographer and director Dannielle “Rhimes” Lecointe has created a fresh, fun and very funky reinvention of A Christmas Carol, with a Caribbean twist, which flips the story and turns Ebeneezer into Ebony. This Scrooge is a fashion maven, “cold as a December wind in London”, strutting across the floor in sweeping cape while her employees freeze in her wake. No Christmas holiday for them, machine-like as they make her monochrome designs. Meanwhile, her sweet niece Freddie is neglected and Bob Cratchit dreams in colour amid Ebony’s strictly black and white world (but has a secret soft spot for her nonetheless).Leah Hill’s Ebony is a glam baddie, the sharp edges of her catwalk dancing matching her personality. But of course, the ghosts come for her: ghosts of the present first, who pull off her chic platform heels and make her wear trainers instead – now that’s a nightmare! Back in the past, Scrooge returns to her Caribbean roots, and suddenly a warm glow and new rhythms flood the stage, and Ebony’s backstory of grief and loss comes to the fore.View image in fullscreenFresh, fun and very funky … Ebony Scrooge.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe characters aren’t fully fleshed out. ZooNation shows always have fairly broad strokes but a lot of heart. One minute you’re wondering if you really buy the emotional journey, the next you’ve got a lump in your throat. And the story absolutely does work as a framework for fantastic dancing. The standard is just blistering across the board, the energy effervescent. Lecointe pulls from a wealth of street dance styles – buoyant locking, infectious house dance, slick and sassy vogue – every scene succinct (and clearly narrated through text and songs, with music by award-winning Michael “Mikey J” Asante).Move over Ebenezer! Ebony Scrooge gets Dickens dancing with a hip-hop Christmas Carol – in picturesRead moreThe versatile cast can be joyfully unconstrained or as tight as a vacuum pack. And Malachi Welch as Cratchit, wow, his body makes weightless sweeps through the air, curling like the softest ice-cream scoop; it’s delicious dancing.Lecointe has been a longtime member of ZooNation and assistant to founder Kate Prince, but she is clearly more than ready to take the reins as a director.

Noël Coward’s comedy of (wishful) female infidelity is one such play, first performed 100 years ago and brought to life now as a period piece that offers insight into the mores of the day – and Coward’s fearlessness in the face of bourgeois morality. Almost banned by the UK censor, it was deeply shocking then, and amusing now, with its two interwar-era “girls behaving badly” on a champagne-fuelled night before and regretful morning after.All of Coward’s preoccupations are here, from disappointment and distance in a pair of marriages to sexual yearning and unfaithfulness – even if the latter is not realised. Except now it is two women plotting it together. The play kicks off at the residence of Julia (Janie Dee) and Fred Steroll (Richard Teverson), over breakfast, when a newspaper notice of a divorce is read out. A sign of things to come?Not quite. Firm friends Julia and Jane (Alexandra Gilbreath) spend the day together while Fred and Jane’s husband, Bill (Christopher Hollis), go on a golfing trip. Little do the men know that their wives are preparing to meet Maurice, a hot moustachioed Frenchman and old flame of both women whose memory reignites all the carnal desire that has lain unspent in their marriages.Directed entertainingly by Christopher Luscombe, it builds to comic drunkenness, crossed-wire phone calls and Restoration comedy-style mayhem until the marital reckoning – and an appearance from Maurice (Graham Vick) himself, who until late in the day is an elusive, Godot-like figure.View image in fullscreenPeriod fun … Fallen Angels.Photograph: Manuel HarlanIt is not as rich as Blithe Spirit or Private Lives, and a little one note, but it is impeccably performed, with shades of 1920s screwball comedy and excellent turns from Dee, who plays Julia as blithely imperious, and Gilbreath, who becomes more cackling and crude as she tips back the bubbles. Both women bring midlife malaise and the plays’ final note of renegade spirit does not quite restore the old marital order.Coward wrote additional material for the play in 1958, expanding the part of the maid, Saunders (Sarah Twomey), which has been included in this production. She is an absolute hoot, turning out to be a proficient dancer, French-speaker, piano player and inveterate raconteur.The handsome set, designed by Simon Higlett, is another highlight, with all its art deco detail intact, along with elegant costumes (silver Mary Jane pumps, beaded, dropped-waist dresses) designed by Fotini Dimou.So a nugget of dramatic history and lesser-known early play by Coward – a bookend to the Orange Tree theatre’s recent, revived trilogy of late works,Suite in Three Keys. And well worth seeing for the sheer period fun of it.AtMenier Chocolate Factory, London, until 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMenier Chocolate FactoryNoel CowardreviewsShareReuse this content"

This will be accompanied by other reductions in our budget.“This will not alone close the gap between the costs of running the organisation and its current ability to generate revenue, meaning there will be more work to drive income growth and maximise efficiencies next year, and beyond.”Philippa Childs, head of the arts workers union Bectu, said: “Bectu recognises the financial challenges the RSC is currently facing – it is not the only company in the industry dealing with these issues. We are working through what that means for our members at RSC and supporting them through the consultation process.”The RSC is in the middle of a consultation with staff, which ends in January 2026, and unions will be able to respond to the plans.In September the RSC announced thathalf of its 835 employees were being invited to apply for voluntary redundancy, with the company saying it needed to make “urgent” savings.The move is the largest redundancy programme at the RSC since 2020, when the company announced cuts during the pandemic.Explore more on these topicsRoyal Shakespeare CompanyTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

But his work with his fellow musicians and singers at Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee, established him as one of the most creative and influential musicians of the 1960s.Actually, pretty much every rock icon of that fabled decade looked up to Cropper,who has died aged 84. The Beatles seriously considered recording at Stax, and the Stones covered songs he played on and emulated his crisp rhythm and lead guitar playing. As a jobbing musician in 1964, Jimi Hendrix drove from Nashville to Memphis to meet Cropper (they chatted about guitars and jammed), while Janis Joplin insisted her new band play Stax’s Christmas party so as to rub shoulders with Cropper and co. Across the world, garage bands played songs he had helped to shape.View image in fullscreenVenerated … Cropper in New York City, 1967.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesIf it was just for his guitar playing then Cropper would be venerated. His incisive, tasty, never ostentatious style marks him – alongside Lowman Pauling (his main influence), Curtis Mayfield and Bobby Womack – as someone who defined the sound of original R&B. But this slim, somewhat gawky youth also developed into a remarkable engineer, producer and co-writer of soul anthems. Cropper was not a solo songwriter (nor did he ever seriously attempt to be a solo artist) but, paired up with such great soul singers as Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett and Eddie Floyd, he helped give structure to the song ideas they had, ensuring they had intros, verses and choruses that leapt out at the listener. Cropper never felt the need to act as a “guitar hero” – his playing was economical, complementary rather than seeking attention: even when Sam Moore of Sam & Dave shouts “play it, Steve!” onSoulMan, Cropper plays a fill, embellishing the song rather than showing off his own prowess.Cropper grew up in Memphis and formed his first band, the Royal Spades, while in high school. Back then, Memphis practised extreme segregation and his school was all white, yet he and his fellow band members loved R&B. The band’s tenor sax player, Charles “Packy” Axton’s mother, Estelle, had co-founded Satellite Records, a tiny independent record label, with her brother Jim Stewart. The Spades recorded an instrumental called Last Night, and Estelle – a doting mum as well as a discerning, fledgling record exec – convinced Jim that Satellite should release it (although she was wise enough to insist the teens change the band’s name to the Mar-Keys).Last Night was a US hit and helped establish the label, which was forced to change its name to Stax after a legal complaint from another Satellite Records. Cropper didn’t enjoy touring – Packy was already a heavy drinker and the band partied too hard for his liking – so he requested a job helping Jim in the studio.View image in fullscreenAl Jackson Jr, Steve Cropper, Booker T Jones and Donald ‘Duck’ Dunn AKA Booker T & the MGs in 1971.Photograph: Gilles Petard/RedfernsHe learned to engineer and produce records, alongside playing on sessions. He was Stewart’s most trusted – and well remunerated – employee at Stax and here he formed Booker T & the MGs with teenage organist Booker T Jones, drummer Al Jackson Jr and bassist Lewie Steinberg (both veterans of the Memphis club scene). In 1962, Stewart thought that a studio jam that the quartet had worked up showed potential, and so Green Onions was released – quite possibly the most influential instrumental record of the 1960s and a mod club favourite to this day.It was Cropper who recognised the potential of a youth from Macon, Georgia, who arrived at Stax as a valet to guitarist Johnny Jenkins for a failed session. When Otis Redding grabbed the last minutes of the session to demonstrate two songs he had written, Cropper played piano behind him on These Arms of Mine and a legend was born. The two young men would work together for the rest of Redding’s brief life – Booker T & the MGs provided the ideal backing for Redding at his famous Monterey pop festival performance in 1967 and Stax’s subsequent European tour – trading ideas, licks and song titles, so helping shape the remarkable canon of work that Redding left. It was Cropper who turned a brief reminiscence from Redding, about watching boats go in and out of a bay, into a fleshed-out set of lyrics and one of Redding’s greatest hits.View image in fullscreenCropper performs in Pasadena, California, 2018.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty ImagesRedding died in 1967, and Booker T decamped to California, furious that Stewart gave Cropper a more preferential contract (racial tensions ran high at Stax in the late 1960s). Cropper slipped into a sideman role: after leaving Stax he played on sessions for John Lennon, Rod Stewart and other famous names. Then he became part of the Blues Brothers band (and films), which surely paid well even if it reduced those great R&B anthems to comedy pub kitsch. No matter: Steve Cropper helped shape a whole genre. Rest in peace, soul man.Explore more on these topicsSoulR&BPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

Arden was separately acclaimed for his early playsSerjeant Musgrave’s Dance, The Workhouse Donkey and Armstrong’s Last Goodnight.Butwriting together from 1960– they had first met in London in 1955 – Arden and D’Arcy shared authorial credit for The Happy Haven (1960), a remarkable, sardonic farce played by masked actors in an old people’s home; The Ballygombeen Bequest (1972), a tight and funny satirical attack on British military action in Northern Ireland rewritten, after being halted by a libel suit, as The Little Grey Home in the West (1982); and The Island of the Mighty (also 1972), a sprawling Arthurian mythical/historical trilogy relating to developing-world struggles of that time, notably in India.This last epic was a defining moment for them, and playwrights generally, as a compression of the work to which they had agreed exploded in a dispute several weeks into rehearsal. They disowned the production, and the presentation by theRoyal Shakespeare Company, and picketed their own work, in effect going on strike and withdrawing from the British establishment theatre.They had also gone on strike, less spectacularly, in a chaotic epic, four performances only, of The Hero Rises Up (1969), about the life and loves of Horatio Nelson, at the Roundhouse in north London. The directorMike Bradwell, then a student, but operating the lights, recounted (in his book The Reluctant Escapologist) the absurdity of Arden and D’Arcy picketing their own show on the first night as the performance fell apart and insisting on free performances for the remainder of the short run, with Arden passing round a bucket to the meagre audience for contributions to pay the actors.View image in fullscreenEstelle Kohler and Patrick Allen in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of The Island of the Mighty at the Aldwych theatre, London, 1972.Photograph: Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesSome critics thought that D’Arcy’s intransigent hot-headedness had done Arden no favours, arguing that his writing deteriorated. This is not true. He continued to write ferociously and passionately, and not just plays but also – without D’Arcy – novels (including the 1982 Booker short-listedSilence Among the Weapons) and brilliant essays.Their action against the RSC led to the formation, in 1976, of the Theatre Writers’ Union, though in an essentially collaborative art form, most playwrights do conform to both major and minor changes to their work in rehearsals, where the play is properly discovered. Subsequent performances, as the directorMichael Blakemoreonce said, are about discovering the audience.Arden and D’Arcy were at one in their belief that politics in all things, especially theatre, came before theatre as theatre. This discounts the view that all theatre, to a greater or lesser extent, is political.D’Arcy campaigned at Greenham Common against cruise missiles in Europe and was imprisoned in Armagh jail twice: for three days in 1978, after protesting at the banning of an H-Blocks prison camp march; and for three months in 1979, for protesting, on International Women’s Day, against the inhumane, degrading conditions for female Republicans in that antediluvian 18th-century lock-up. She wrote a scorching account of the experience in Tell Them Everything (1981).Indomitable to the end, she spent her last days on a walker, brandishing pro-Palestinian placards and campaigning for Catherine Connolly as Irish president. On D’Arcy’s death, Connolly paid tribute to “a woman of extraordinary conviction and radical honesty … a singular voice in Irish culture and civil life”.She was born in Whitechapel, London, the third of four daughters of Joseph D’Arcy, a Dublin-born civil servant who was a member of the IRA during the war of independence, and his wife, Miriam (nee Billig), from Odesa in Ukraine, whose Jewish family had fled from Russian pogroms to the East End; her sister was Hannah Billig, a distinguished and popular physician known locally as the angel of Cable Street, where she had a clinic.View image in fullscreenD’Arcy in 2015.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe family (without Hannah) relocated to Dublin after the second world war where Margaretta was educated at school in the suburb of Cabra and at Trinity College, studying drama. In 1953, she worked briefly at the newly opened, internationally minded Pike theatre before moving back to London. She worked as an actor and, with Arden in 1960, was an original signatory of Bertrand Russell’s anti-war Committee of 100, which also included the film directorLindsay AndersonandPat Arrowsmith, co-founder of CND.There was a more decisive move back to Ireland with Arden in 1968, settling in Galway (though often crossing over to London for plays and demos), joining the civil rights movement there as well as Sinn Féin (she was expelled over “political differences” in 1972) and the Society of Irish Playwrights (later the Writers Guild of Ireland).In 1975, the couple wrote The Non-Stop Connolly Show, a rousing, rambling six-part chronicle of the life of James Connolly, the Marxist union leader, who led the Irish Citizens’ Army against the British in the Easter Rising of 1916. The premiere in Dublin played over Easter weekend for 26 hours continuously.Other notable collaborations included a touring production of Vandaleur’s Folly (1978), charting the angry disillusion of both communal farmers with the incipient Orange Order of the early 19th century, and feudal injustices including the slave trade; and a nine-play epic for BBC radio, Whose Is the Kingdom? (1988), critically setting the earliest days of Christendom against the concept of a deistic monarchy.Arden died in 2012. Margaretta was predeceased by two of their five sons, Gwalchmei (a Welsh name that roughly translates as Gawain), who died at eight weeks, an experience she recorded most movingly in her 2005 memoir, LooseTheatre, and Jacob in 2013. She is survived by the other three sons, Finn, Adam and Neuss, and six grandchildren.Margaretta D’Arcy, writer and activist, born 14 June 1934; died 23 November 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatreJohn ArdenRoyal Shakespeare CompanyobituariesShareReuse this content"

To mark its recent release, she’ll be joining us to answer your questions.After leaving the US midwest and striking out for London in the mid-1970s – where she worked for the NME and Vivienne Westwood’s shop Sex – she shuttled between punk bands and couldn’t get anything off the ground until she formed the Pretenders in 1978.With the No 1 hit Brass in Pocket among their earliest singles, their career trajectory was near-vertical, and as the 80s continued, the lineup shifted but always with Hynde out front, her insouciant style making her a defining frontperson of the era. Hits mounted up – I Go To Sleep, 2000 Miles – and the band released one of the biggest power ballads of the 90s, I’ll Stand By You. They’ve eventually released 12 studio albums, with the latest, 2023’s Relentless, giving them their highest chart placing since the mid-1990s.Along the way, Hynde has been a brilliant vocal foil in a series of collaborations: her cover of I Got You Babe with UB40 was a UK chart-topper, while Frank Sinatra, Cher and INXS’s Michael Hutchence have been some of her other vocal partners. There are 13 more duets on the new album as Chrissie Hynde & Pals, with Lucinda Williams, Shirley Manson, Alan Sparhawk and Cat Power among the other names.Hynde will answer your questions on that star-studded project and anything else in her long career. Post them in the comments below before 10am GMT on Monday 8 December, and we’ll publish her answers in the Friday 12 December edition of the Film & Music section, as well as online.Explore more on these topicsChrissie HyndeFilm & Music reader interviewPop and rockcalloutShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Halloween hadn’t even happened this year when my local supermarket began proudly displaying its festive womenswear. Almost exclusively spattered in sequins, it looked much the same as the previous year’s party offering and was already reduced by 50% by – wait for it – 11 November. For £9 you could pick up a black sequin vest a mere two weeks after it was available at an already worryingly low full price.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Judging by the sale and well-stocked rails, the items didn’t appear to be in demand, and with so many identikit sequin garments in existence (more than 500 black sequin vests at the same price and under on Vinted at the time of writing in the UK), what’s the point of producing more every year?You may have guessed I am not a fan of sequins. Aside from being itchy and uncomfortable to wear, they come with myriad environmental issues. Like the polyester they’re often stitched to, sequins are made from plastic, which is oil-derived and highly energy intensive to produce. In order to fashion them into sequins, discs need to be punched out of a sheet of shiny plastic, which means 33% of the material is wasted during production. And according toFashion Roundtable, it’s unlikely that those stitching the sequins to a fast fashion item would have been paid a fair wage.The damage continues once they’re in our possession. Sequins are prone to falling off garments, leaving plastic litter all over the planet for hundreds, if not thousands, of years (yes, I will bang this drum again come summer’s festival season). When washed, they release microplastics into the water system and the environment. But many will never even make it into the wash:according to Oxfam, most sequin items are worn an average of just five times before being thrown away.I would also caution against brands touting items made using recycled sequins. They aren’t made from old sequins but recycledPET(usually made from recycled plastic bottles and packaging), so come with all of the same problems minus the initial oil extraction. Since the planet undoubtedly already has enough sequins, you could try getting yours preloved (Oxfamhas a great selection) or rental (By Rotationwill do the trick), while simply wearing the sparkly stuff you already own for as long as possible is the best way to keep it out of landfill.In spite of my own feelings about sequins, I am by no means a party pooper, and have been embracing less damaging festive fabrics and finishes – from velvet to tartan – for many years. Buying better in a way that’s less damaging to people and the planet means investing in things you will wear year after year; timeless classics that are well made to stand the test of time. So if you want to bring some sequin energy to your look, minus the sequins, I have some alternatives up my puffed sleeve.The best sequin-free Christmas partylooksVelvet stridesView image in fullscreenCotton velvet trousers£75 at Lucy & YakThe warm sheen and soft touch of velvet makes it the ultimateChristmasfabric, in my opinion. My mum reckons she’s been wearing her black velvet trousers for at least the past 25 Christmases, and this will be the fourth year that my own have been in rotation. If I needed a new pair, I’d go for these – the ideal Christmas Day combo of a luxury fabric with a comfy elastic waist.Tartan armyView image in fullscreenTartan dress£180 at the Well WornView image in fullscreenTartan print dress£85 at JoanieI’ve always worn tartan as a year-rounder, and thanks to The Traitors this is truer than ever (new season starts in January!). While festive colour combos of red and green are undoubtedly a great option at Christmas, picking something in a different palette may give you more wears in the long run.Pep me upView image in fullscreenCotton ribboned vest£56 at OliveNothing says, “I’m off to a fancy dinner and I might need to loosen my waistband” like a peplum. There are lots around at the moment, yet they’re never truly out of style, so are a good investment to whip out as the ultimate nice top to accompany your jeans. This one should work with pretty much anything in your wardrobe. I like to wear this style over a slim-line roll neck with a long skirt and look-at-me-shoes.Bauble earringsView image in fullscreenSingle stripy earring£45 at the MercantileFestive-feel earrings don’t need to be novelty ones that require a battery, nor do they need to be Christmas exclusive.

This versatile dress could be worn on its own, or styled with a roll neck and jeans underneath for a more casual party vibe. If you’re feeling creative, you could embroider stars and other festive motifs to something you already own withthis kit.Bags of joyView image in fullscreenPuffy silver bag£55 at Damson MadderA snazzy little bag will do wonders for your sequin-free party personality.

I am very happy that he enjoys readingand want to help him find the next good read. Unfortunately he’s extremely easily influenced by cover art. He will unwrap a gift book and immediately dismiss it and refuse to give it a go if he doesn’t like the cover. He doesn’t even read the blurb. When I was still reading to him, we had a pact that he had to listen to at least one page, and that’s how he was introduced to many of his favourite books despite initial reluctance. I completely understand the appeal of great illustration but, now that he reads chapter books, I wish he could get over the two least important pages. How can I help him not to judge a book by its cover?Eleanor says:I totally appreciate the virtue of getting him to see beyond the cover but, on the other hand … could you just change the cover?What’s he attracted to in a cover? Iridescence? A dragon? A cool dude? He could make a new cover! A collage, even a collage from other books. He could make a dozen all-purpose covers, ready to be stuck on to whatever book you’d like to give him next. Or he could redo a particular cover after saying why he doesn’t like the one they gave it; or you could cover books in brown paper so he never sees the cover, and have him design one once he knows what the book is about. Coloured foils! Laser eyes! Give him a director’s chair.I’m estranged from my parents. How do I explain this to my child? | Leading questionsRead moreWhen I was a kid my mum and I used to make exercise book covers together, colourful crayon and watercolour, that got contact-papered on to my homework books. That way school work wasn’t so unbelievably tedious. Among a slew of other belongings left carelessly at the bottom of the school bag to accrue crumbs and creases, the homework books always looked kind of special to me. They didn’t seem standard issue or severe. They looked like me, like the care other people invested in me. If your son understands the appeal of illustration, he could make his books feel more like him.Maybe that doesn’t feel right to you. Maybe you’d prefer to guide him away from this sensibility rather than cater to it. You might not want flame decals on Aslan. You might want him to love the serifs of a publisher’s setting. Believe me, I totally get the instinct to improve a kid’s aesthetic judgments. Just the other day I went to see some Van Gogh and as (terribly aesthetically sophisticated) tears rolled down my face, a nearby kid said: “This is the boringest thing I’ve ever seen.” I completely understand wanting to shriek: “You’re missing something! This is so much better than whatever you think you’d prefer!”But when you make art proof of virtue, you can make it feel like a drag. It’s such good news that he’s reading for joy. It’s not, so far, something he does because he “should”.Many things will try to capture his taste in the next few years – algorithms, TV, peers, all saying “people like you should like this”. Of course, you don’t want your voracious reader’s taste to be captured by the iPad-algorithm-AI event horizon of bad kid’s art. But the reaction doesn’t need to be adding another “should” – “youshouldlike this cover”. Instead, the reaction might be to encourage him to develop his ownsensibility. Whydoes he like this one more than that? Can he design something he’d be happy to put on anybook? Or if he thinks some covers only make sense with some books – why is that?Allowing and working with his emphasis on covers doesn’t have to be a capitulation. It could be a way to deepen his relationship with the books you’d love him to love.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While their consumption is particularly high in the west, forming more than half the average diet in the UK and the US, for example, UPFs are replacing fresh food in diets on every continent.This month,the world’s largest reviewon the health threats of UPFs was published in the Lancet. It warned that such foods are exposing millions of people to long-term harm, and called for urgent action. Earlier this year Unicef revealed thatmore children around the world were obese than underweightfor the first time, as junk food overwhelms diets, with the steepest rises in low- and middle-income countries.Carlos Monteiro, professor of public health nutrition at the University of São Paulo, and one of the Lancet series’ authors, says that profit-driven corporations, not individual choices, are driving the change in habits.For parents, it can feel like the entire food system is working against them. “Sometimes it feels like we have zero control over what we are putting on to our kid’s plate,” says one mother fromIndia. We spoke to her and four other parents from around the world on the growing challenges and frustrations of providing a healthy diet in the age of UPFs.Nepal: ‘She craves cookies, chocolate and juice’Raising a child inNepaltoday often feels like trying to swim against the current, especially when it comes to food. I cook at home as much as I can, but the moment my daughter steps outside, she is surrounded by brightly packaged snacks and sugary drinks. She constantly craves cookies, chocolates and packaged fruit juices – products aggressively advertised to children. A single pizza commercial on TV is enough for her to ask, “Can we have pizza today?”Even the school environment reinforces unhealthy habits. Her canteen serves sweetened fruit juice every Tuesday, which she eagerly awaits. She receives a six-piece biscuit pack from a friend on the school bus and chocolates on birthdays, and faces a chip shop right outside her school gate.View image in fullscreen‘Even the school environment reinforces unhealthy habits’: Manita Pyakurel and her daughter Merissa.Photograph: HandoutSome days it feels like the entire food environment is working against parents who are simply trying to raise healthy children.As someone working in the Nepal Non-Communicable Disease Alliance and leading a project called Promoting Healthy Foods in Schools to Reduce NCD Risk Factors, I understand this issue deeply. Yet even with my expertise, keeping my eight-year-old daughter healthy is incredibly difficult.These repeated exposures at school, in transit and online make it nearly impossible for parents to limit ultra-processed foods. It is not just about children’s choices; it is about a food system that normalises and promotes unhealthy eating.And the data reflects exactly what families like mine are experiencing. TheNepal Demographic and Health Survey2022 found that 69% of children between six and 23 months ate unhealthy foods, and 43% were already drinking sweetened beverages.These numbers echo what I see every day.A studyconducted in the Lalitpur district, where I live, reported that 18.6% of schoolchildren were overweight and 7.1% were obese, figures closely associated with the rise in junk food consumption and increasingly inactive lifestyles. Another study showed that many Nepali children eat sweet snacks or processed savoury foods almost daily, and this regular consumption is tied to high levels of tooth decay.Nepal urgently needs stronger policies, healthier school environments and stricter marketing regulations. Until then, families will continue fighting a daily battle against junk food – one biscuit packet at a time.Manita PyakurelSt Vincent and the Grenadines: ‘Greasy, salty, sugary fast food is the preference’My situation is a bit unique as I was forced to relocate from an island in our archipelago that was devastated by Hurricane Beryl last year. But it is also part of the stark reality that is facing parents in a region that is feeling the very worst effects of climate change.The situation definitely worsens if a hurricane or volcanic eruption wipes out most of your vegetationArlene Williams-JackEven before Beryl, as a food nutrition and health teacher, I was deeply concerned about the increasing proliferation of fast food restaurants inSt Vincent and the Grenadines. Today, even smaller village shops are complicit in the transformation of a country once defined by a diet of healthy locally grown fruits and vegetables, to one where greasy, salty, sugary fast food, packed with artificial ingredients, is the preference.But the situation definitely worsens if a hurricane or volcanic eruption wipes out most of your vegetation. Fresh, healthy food becomes scarce and very expensive, so it is really difficult to get your kids to eat right.View image in fullscreenArlene Williams-Jack with two of her children, Jonathan and Alina. She says fresh food has become more expensive after the hurricane.Photograph: HandoutDespite having a steady job I wince at food prices now and have often resorted to choosing between items such as peas and beans and meat and eggs when feeding my four children. Serving fewer meals or smaller servings have also become part of the post-Beryl coping strategies.Also it is quite convenient when you are juggling a demanding job with parenting, and rushing around in the morning, to just give the children $2 or $3 to buy snacks at school. Unfortunately, most school tuck shops only offer ultra-processed snacks and sugary sodas. The result of these challenges, I fear, is an increase in the already epidemic rates of lifestyle diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.Arlene Williams-Jack, as told to Natricia DuncanUganda: ‘It’s in every mall and every market’The KFC sign looms large at the entrance of Akamwesi, a mall in Mpererwe neighbourhood in Kampala, daring you to pass by without stopping at the drive-through.Many of the children and parents visiting the mall have never gone beyond the borders ofUganda. They certainly don’t know about the Great Depression that inspired Colonel Sanders to start one of the first American international food chains. All they know is that the three letters KFC represent all things sophisticated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features, opinion and photography, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As one of the more expensive options, KFC is considered a treat. It is the place Kampala’s families go to celebrate birthdays and baptisms. It is the children’s reward when they get a good school report. In fact, they are hoping their parents take them for Christmas at KFC.“Mom, do you know that some people pack KFC for school lunch,” my 14-year-old daughter, who attends a school between Mpererwe and the more upscale neighbourhood of Acacia, tells me. She says that on the days they do not pack KFC, they pack food from Café Javas, an east African fast-food chainselling everything from fried breakfasts to burgers.View image in fullscreenPatience Akumu and her children, in Mpererwe neighbourhood in Kampala, Uganda.Photograph: HandoutIt is Friday evening, and I am only half-listening as I struggle to do the weekend shopping at Acacia mall while steering her and her brother away from the restaurants suggesting that life would be so much easier if we bought chips and chicken and ate in front of a Netflix movie.When we get home, I find my husband has already slaughtered one of the free range chickens in our back yard. I hope the aroma of chicken slow boiled for hours and served with fresh vegetables from the market will triumph over the allure of fast food.Patience AkumuIndia: ‘It can feel like we have zero control’When I was growing up, we literally ate everything. There was not much awareness about what was healthy and what was unhealthy. Today, what children can and can’t eat it is a constant conversation – in school, at home, in the news.My daughter loves ice-cream and chocolates. Her grandparents are very indulgent, and I often have to put my foot down. I try to rationalise the amount she eats, but it is difficult. What I hate most are lollipops. They are sticky, messy and she keeps them in her mouth for hours. Sometimes I give in because it is tiring to constantly be on top of this. As working professionals, it is not always possible to do everything from scratch, such as paneer (homemade cottage cheese). However, arecent scandalsurrounding synthetic paneer had me concerned for days, as we source store-bought paneer on a regular basis.It also does not help that when we go shopping all the treats and chocolates are right at the checkout. My daughter often accompanies me to the store and asks me to buy chocolates or some other packaged snack. Even things like peanut chikki (like a brittle) that I grew up eating are highly processed today. If I say no, she sulks a little, saying I always say no.The rule in our home is no refined sugar, no fizzy drinks. That means no biscuits, which are basically made of maida (refined flour) and palm oil. My doctor tells me it sticks to children’s teeth and gives them cavities. But when someone else offers them, she goes nuts.View image in fullscreenAmoolya Rajappa and her five-year-old daughter Ibbani, who ‘loves ice-cream and chocolates’.Photograph: HandoutI try to read the ingredients on the packaging, and anything that lists more than 10, I don’t buy.Sometimes it feels like we have zero control over what we are putting on to our kid’s plate and that sense of helplessness is very frustrating.Moreover, there are very few options available for wholesome snacks in the Indian market and they are very pricey. So, economically speaking, it is also a constant challenge to ensure my child is eating healthy and balanced meals all the time.Amoolya Rajappa, as told to Anuradha NagarajKenya: ‘One bite and he was hooked’My son says it all started when he saw his friends eating things he knew he wasn’t allowed to. One bite and he was hooked. He was probably nine. The Indonesian noodles were one of the tastiest things he had ever eaten, he told me. Having heard and read what these foods were doing to the health of young people around the world, I was not happy.But that initial taste piqued his curiosity and he started trying to introduceinstant noodlesto the weekly shop – by stealth. Our nearby mall was the crime scene. During one visit, he snuck a pack of beef-flavoured noodles from either Singapore or South Korea, burying it under other items. I was too distracted to notice.He repeated the move during another shopping trip. This time I was keen enough to notice not one, but three packets of UPFs in the trolley. He had to return them to the shelves, much to the consternation of other shoppers queueing at the checkout.View image in fullscreenPeter Muiruri and his son, who is starting to appreciate healthy eating.Photograph: HandoutBut just removing such items from the shopping basket is not enough. What do you replace them with? So many exotic treats that appeal to children carry health risks. I sat in a recent media briefing where an eye doctor said that many young people presenting with eyesight issues are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. “They come for an eye checkup but unknown to their parents, diabetes is the root cause of the eyesight issues,” she said. “Junk food is at the centre of the declining health among young people inKenya.”While local markets abound with healthy foods such as tubers and traditional vegetables, it has been a constant battle getting my son, now 14, to eat them.Happily, he is slowly adjusting to healthy eating habits. “It comes with age,” he joked recently. “Junk food is really appealing but it doesn’t help much. You could eat all you want but after about an hour you’ll have to eatugali[stiff dough made of maize flour] andsukuma wiki[a dish made using greens] – to fill you up.”Peter MuiruriExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentUltra-processed foodsFoodGlobal healthNepalSt Vincent and the GrenadinesUgandafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The proper kind of pudding, too: all dense but not leaden, heavy with prunes and warm with careful spicing.As December crept in, forgotten cousins and semi-estranged uncles seemed to find reasons to drop by her place. She never advertised the fact, of course, but everyone knew that if you came bearing even a modest offering, you might just leave with a pudding wrapped in waxed paper and still warm with possibility. The exchanges were subtle. One neighbour would “pop by for coffee” and just happen to bring two dozen mince pies; a friend would promise to collect the Christmas turkey from the butcher and bring it round, saving this lady the schlep across town. Nothing was said, no ledger kept, but the pudding always travelled in the right direction.I love this kind of seasonal bartering, not least because these edible interactions manage to bypass the digital world entirely. In an age where every conversation seems to take place on a screen and every relationship is fodder for some Silicon Valley metric, these small, delicious acts feel almost rebellious. We know we can count on the huge annual box of savoury nibbles from our nut suppliers, the one that keeps us and our guests going long after the last table has staggered home. And every year our neighbour’s daughter leaves a carefully wrapped block of Christmas cake by our door, shyly anonymous except for the neat handwriting on the label.View image in fullscreenFor giving and receiving … mince pies.Photograph: Isabella MooreAnother treat we look forward to every year isFuchsia Dunlop’s Christmas email – yes, it’s technically digital, but itfeelsedible. Each year she bakes something extraordinary and sends out a picture, along with a quiet, thoughtful story and her wishes for the season. Even though we can’t exactly eat it, the flavour is all there.We try to do our part, too. Every December, we offer the subscribers on our mailing list something different. Usually, that means some gingerbread tiles orchocolate from Ocelot, both of which are very letterbox-friendly. One year, after service, we made a gingery quince chutney from whatever happened to be lurking in the kitchen, jarred it in a sleepy haze and sent it out into the world. We got more requests for the recipe for that than anything else we’ve ever done, but we couldn’t share it because none of us could remember what we’d put in it.In much the same festive spirit, last weekend our friends atthe Fine Cider Companycame to our Christmas makers’ market with some seriously delicious things to drink – so delicious, in fact, that this year we may well give champagne a miss and take up sparkling cider as our celebratory tipple; we may also take ice cider over the annual obligatory port. For more cider-centric inspiration, check out Thomasina Miers’ feature on cocktails in Feast, free with the Guardian this Saturday and on the Feast app.It’s comforting to think that this kind of tiny ecosystem – this gentle, edible economy of gifts and favours – still exists. A community, I think it’s called: look after yours, and it’ll look after you. To feed your community with edible gifts,here are a few of our tried-and-tested favourites, and some we would absolutelylove to receive.My week in foodView image in fullscreenTruly sumptuous … papaya, persimmon and passion fruit.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverA winter fruit to savour|Persimmon season is always very exciting for us, but we seem to be almost alone in appreciating this glorious fruit. The question people always ask is: “But what do youdowith it?” The simple answer is: just eat it and enjoy its sweet glory! And if you really need something more elaborate, try a simple salad. Mix slices of good winter tomatoes, chopped celery and sliced persimmons with as much chilli as you can take and as much coriander as you have in the house. Season with salt, orange juice and olive oil, and enjoy the best, most joyous winter salad. You can also experiment with Nigel Slater’spersimmon and papaya salador try Rachel Roddy’s warmingapple, pear and persimmon crumble.

And, after those time-consuming nibbles, the smoked salmon starter and the turkey-with-all-the-trimmings main event, the last thing you want is a pudding that demands even more hands-on time at the culinary coalface. For me, the main requirement of any Christmas dessert is that it can be made well in advance, not least because, by the time the pudding stage comes around, I’ll be completely knackered and more than ready to put up my feet and finally relax (or, more likely, fall asleep on the sofa).Chocolate and hazelnut tart (pictured top)Prep15 minRest3 hr+Cook40 minServes6-8For the sweet pastry500g plain flour, plus extra for dusting150g caster sugar250g cold butter, diced2-3 eggs, lightly beatenFor the filling640g 70%-cocoa dark chocolate, broken into small pieces800ml double cream64g glucose syrup64g cold butter, cubed100g roasted hazelnuts, lightly choppedPut the flour and sugar in a large bowl, stir to combine, then add the diced butter and work it in with your fingertips until the mix takes on the consistency of rough breadcrumbs. Add two of the beaten eggs, then mix until the dough comes together into a ball; if need be, add the third beaten egg, but take great care not to overwork the dough. Wrap the pastry in clingfilm, then put it in the fridge and leave to rest for at least an hour.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the sweet pastry into a roughly 28cm round, then use it to line a lightly greased 24cmtart case with a removable base. Line the pastry with baking paper, fill with baking beans and blind bake for about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven, lift out the paper and beans, and leave tart case to cool in its tin. Once cool, neatly trim off any pastry overhang.Meanwhile, put the broken-up chocolate in a large bowl. Put the cream and glucose in a medium saucepan, bring slowly to a boil, then immediately pour the hot cream over the chocolate and whisk until smooth and emulsified. Finish by beating in the cold butter.Pour the chocolate mix into the cooled tart shell and set aside at room temperature for two to three hours, so it settles and sets.Just before serving, remove the tart from its tin, carefully transfer to a pretty plate, scatter the chopped hazelnuts all over the top, then slice and serve.Christmas zabaglioneView image in fullscreenPrep10 minCook10 minChill4 hr+Serves612 amaretti biscuits, roughly crumbled10 egg yolks250g sugar200mlmarsala50ml whisky50ml brandyBring a large pan of water to a boil. Meanwhile, divide the crumbled amaretti between six serving glasses – I use bog-standard wine glasses, but champagne coupes are a bit fancier.Put the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl that will later sit easily on top of the pan of boiling water without the base touching the water. Whisk until nice and frothy, then add all the alcohol and whisk again.Turn down the heat under the water pan to a simmer, set the bowl over the top and vigorously whisk the boozy egg mix for about five minutes, until it turns thick and creamy – once the whisk leaves a clear trail in the egg mix, the zabaglione is ready.Spoon or pour the zabaglione evenly over the biscuits in the glasses, then chill uncovered for at least four hours, and up to overnight, until set.

I’m not interested in dating at the momentI am not anti-love. I’ve been in relationships, but I’m currently the only single friend in my girls group and I’m being treated like a sad case.I’m not interested in dating at the moment, especially after breaking up with someone a year ago. But my best friend, Whitney, keeps telling me to get back in the saddle. I know she’s just looking out for me, but sometimes I think it’s more about what suits her than what’s right for me.Whitney thrives in relationships. She’s what I’d call a serial dater. As soon as one relationship ends, another is waiting in the wings. But I, on the other hand, am fine by myself. I broke up with my ex as we had drifted apart. He was only my second boyfriend. It was hard at first, but then I began to love my own company again. This is the first time in ages when I’ve felt genuinely calm, with no compromises.Whitney said she wants me to date so I can be more included in her life. She loves hosting couples’ dinner parties. But couples aren’t the only people who can go to dinner parties.Whitney has tried to be my matchmaker with her boyfriend’s friends, but I find that embarrassingThen there’s the whole kids conversation. She’ll drop comments like: “Don’t leave it too long, Haile.” I think it’s because I once said I wanted kids with my ex, but who knows now?Maybe it’s because we’re from quite Christian east African families. But we are 28 and I hear enough of this from my mum. I don’t need it from a friend as well, even if it’s well-meaning.Whitney has tried to be my matchmaker with her boyfriend’s friends, but I find that embarrassing. At the moment, it’s like I’ve switched off the part of my brain reserved for dating. I don’t know when it will switch back on, or if I even want it to.I don’t want to date someone just because it’s convenient,and I don’t need rescuing. I love my friends and family, but if I hear one more person ask, “How’s your love life?” I will lose it. Why do single people always have to explain their lives?I don’t see being single as being stuck in a waiting room. It’s a choice.The defence: WhitneyHaile’s happiest when she’s in love. I’m glad she’s found peace, but I worry she’s closing herself offI’ve known Haile since we were 16, so I’ve seen her at her happiest, which is when she’s in love. After her breakup, she went through a tough patch and now she’s hyper-independent, which isn’t great, in my opinion. She has her own place and car, and says: “What do I need a partner for?” But I remember how happy she was when she was looked after by her ex. I am glad she’s found peace now, and I admire that she has become so self-sufficient, but sometimes I think she’s confusing comfort with contentment.It’s true that I was a serial dater, but now I am in a happy relationship. I want Haile to be in one too, because then we can socialise more. Her ex was really good friends with my current boyfriend, and it just made everything better for everyone. I did invite Haile to one of my recent dinner parties, but she said she didn’t want to go because she wouldn’t know anyone.Now I’m in a happy relationship, I want Haile to be in one too, because then we can socialise more togetherWhen I said Haile would benefit socially from having a partner, I didn’t mean to suggest she’s not enough on her own – I just meant that I miss seeing her out there flirting and having fun. I set her up with a few mutual friends because I thought she might enjoy it. I accept that it might have made her feel pressured.And my comment about kids came from concern, not judgment. I know she wants children one day, as we spoke about that growing up, and she recently talked about it when she was with her ex. Maybe I push too hard because I know she’s worth so much.If she’s genuinely happy on her own, then of course I need to respect that. I just want her to have the best life. I do get that it’s annoying for single people to be asked about their love lives, but it’s an increasingly hot topic for women approaching 30. When I see Haile pulling back from the idea of love altogether, I worry she’s closing herself off from something amazing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As bedtime routines go, however, this one involves a novel step – placing my lower legs in a mesh bag and clipping it into seatbelt-style buckles on either side; the bed will be travelling at around 50mph for the next 12 hours and there are safety regulations to consider.Last month Swiss startup Twiliner launched a fleet of futuristic sleeper buses, and I’ve come to Amsterdam to try them out. Running three times a week between Amsterdam and Zurich (a 12-hour journey via Rotterdam, Brussels, Luxembourg and Basel), with a Zurich to Barcelona service (via Berne and Girona) launching on 4 December, the company’s flat-bed overnight sleeper buses are the first such service in Europe.“Flying is one of the main drivers of climate change. We wanted to design an alternative that people would actually want to use,” the company’s co-founder and CEO, Luca Bortolani, told me before Twiliner’s launch. Their solution is a seat that turns into a genuinely comfortable bed. Manufactured by Greater Manchester-based Airline Services Interiors, it’s similar to a business class plane seat.Hoping for more shut-eye than red-eye, I lean into that luxury. While I could shorten my journey by taking a Eurostar from London to Brussels and catching the Twiliner there, I’m going London to Amsterdam, and trialling the full Zurich route. With Eurostar adding a fifth direct weekday service to Amsterdam this month, it’s a good alternative connecting hub for UK travellers venturing further into Europe.View image in fullscreenThe buses run on HVO fuel, considered highly sustainable compared with dieselAs viewers ofRace Across the Worldwill know, flatbed buses are common in Asia and South America, but they have been less successful in Europe. Twiliner hopes to change this by offering a service that’s both comfortable and sustainable. Run mostly on hydrotreated vegetable oil fuel (HVO, also called renewable diesel), the company claims its buses produce less than 10% of the CO2emissions of a comparable flight. Even when running on normal diesel, which sometimes the buses have to, a Twiliner bus is as sustainable as a sleeper train per passenger kilometre, it says.Currently operating three buses – one for each launch route plus a third for private charters – Twiliner hopes to offer 25 routes by 2028, possibly even adding a UK service. Though not exclusively targeting routes without sleeper trains, “our niche will be routes where lots of people travel and you don’t have a night train, or good connections,” said Bortolani.Our niche will be routes where lots of people travel and you don’t have a night train, or good connectionsLuca BortolaniA generous luggage allowance and the efficiency of being able to travel while asleep are pluses. These benefits (plus the novelty factor) aside, the biggest selling point is likely to be the comfort factor.The blip on this journey is boarding at Amsterdam’s outdoor bus station in Sloterdijk, a five-minute train ride from Amsterdam Centraal station. Standing in the dark, a chill wind chasing through the open space, I’m not entirely sure I’m in the right place. But then I spot a flash of violet and the bus arrives, navigating its huge bulk like a cruise liner inching into a small fishing harbour. The doors open and the lights on the Twiliner’s steps glow a soft, spaceship purple as I climb aboard.Downstairs are three seats, a spacious toilet, a changing room and self-service shelves selling eye masks, toothbrushes and snacks; ear plugs, coffee and wifi are free. I’m on the upper deck, in one of 18 seats with lofty views as well as USB ports. As we leave Amsterdam lights flicker in high-rise windows around me like colonies of square glow worms, and I click on the QR code by my seat to find instructions for my bed.View image in fullscreenThe bus reaches Zurich from Amsterdam in 12 hours 15 minutes.Photograph: Olena Serditova/AlamyAround me there is much excitement but the chatter soon dies down. A no-children-under-five policy and strict guidelines on food, drink and noise make for calm travelling. By 10pm I’m fast asleep only waking at 5.30am in high heat (a teething issue Twiliner is ironing out) and lie back, dozing like a very overgrown baby being wheeled along in a cushioned pram, until the sun rises and the temperature drops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rolling into Zurich on a frosty weekday morning, the city is streaked with silver and gold as it begins to stir. By the bus’s Nespresso machine I chat to Adrien, a student from St Gallen university. “It’s not quicker. It’s not cheaper. But it’s another option, and it’s a good one,” he says. “I slept. I feel rested.”Just over 25 hours after leaving my home in Somerset, a good chunk of which I’ve slept through, I arrive at Zurich’s Sihlquai bus station. Soaking up sunshine, I walk the 10 minutes to my hotel via the Christmas market on Europaallee, stopping for a hot, cinnamon-dustedÖpfuchüechli(apple doughnut) at one of its wooden booths.Along the river, the art-lined Helvetia hotel extols the virtues of its hand-stitched Hästens mattresses, designed to ensure its guests a restful night’s sleep. There’s one thing their beds can’t promise, though: to transport me, magic carpet-style, to a new destination the following morning.The trip was provided by Twiliner,Eurostar andZurich Tourism.Twilinertickets between Amsterdam and Zurich cost from150 Swiss francs (£141).

But how easy is it to spot these strange and charismatic marsupials – and why would a quintessentially Australian creature settle here?Sam WollastonThu 4 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 03.31 ESTShareIt was about 9.30 or 10 on a dark, late November night; Molly Laird was driving her pink Mini home along country lanes to her Warwickshire cottage. Suddenly, the headlights’ beam picked up an animal sitting in the road. “I thought it was a deer at first,” Molly tells me. “But when it moved, its tail wasn’t right, and it was hopping. It took me a while to realise, but I thought: that’s a kangaroo!”Molly’s next thought was: “I’m going insane,” closely followed by, “No one’s going to believe me.” So she got out her phone and filmed it. Later, she posted the video on social media, where she was told it was likely to be not a kangaroo, but its smaller cousin, thered-necked wallaby.I have come to meet Molly, who is 19, and her mum, Becky, where the encounter happened, just outside the village of Oxhill. Molly had woken her mum up on the night she spotted the wallaby. “I did actually ask her: are you on LSD?” says Becky, before quickly adding: “Not that she takes anything like that. I’ll shut up!”View image in fullscreenSam (right) with wildlife tracker Darren Parkin and Molly Laird, who took a video of a wallaby she spotted while driving home.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianBecky has spent time in Australia and recognises a native of those parts when she sees one; she knew the creature on her daughter’s phone video was no deer.Also with us is Darren Parkin from nearby Stratford-upon-Avon. Adventurer, outdoors instructor, bushcraft enthusiast and tracker, Parkin has been interested in the UK’s wallaby population for years. “When you’ve been everywhere and done everything in the outdoors in the UK, if there’s something slightly different, that doesn’t fit that normality, it becomes fascinating,” he says.She knew the creature on her daughter’s phone video was no deerParkin has followed wallaby tracks in the Peak District (where there used to be a well-known population). Then, a couple of years ago, after several sightings near his home town,he spent a night in a hammockstrung between trees in the Welcombe Hills with some borrowed thermal imaging equipment. Again, no joy; a potential wallaby turned out to be a rabbit. Parkin has never seen a wallaby in the wild. Maybe today he will.This is classic wallaby country, he says, surveying the terrain. “Nice open spaces, but also copses, plenty of hedgerows to skirt around.” Molly shows us where she came across hers, and where it went. Parkin scours the hedges looking for fur, and the verges looking for footprints. He has brought along a sketch of a footprint to show us what to look out for. The line between the footprints is made by the tail, he explains. Nothing definitive so far, this cloven one is a deer, a big stag judging by its depth. And here is a badger’s. Tracker Parkin should have lived in the wild west. “Yeah, I don’t belong in this time,” he says.Before coming tracking I consulted Anthony Caravaggi, an ecologist who has spent years studying non-native species and has a special interest in wallabies in the UK. He was first involved in a project on the Isle of Man, home to about 1,000 wallabies, descendants of escapees from a wildlife park in the 1960s. That’s how they get out there. “They’re really adept at escaping,” says Caravaggi. “Obviously, they can hop, but they also dig, they can manipulate things with their claws. They’re popular in wildlife parks, farm zoos, and more ubiquitous in private collections than you might think. People are even keeping them as an alternative to sheep to control vegetation.”View image in fullscreenWildlife tracker Parkin shows Sam a diagram of a wallaby footprint.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianOnce out, wallabies feel, perhaps surprisingly, at home. The scrubby habitat of the Isle of Man, for instance, is quite similar to Tasmania’s. And throughout the southern half of the UK, the temperate climate suits them, Caravaggi explains. “I think the main limiting factor historically – and whatput paid to the Peak District population– was our harsh winters, but with climate change our winters are getting milder.”Caravaggi carried outa study over 10 years, based on sightings (hecreated a websitefor submissions), then mapped their distribution across Britain. He won’t put a number on the UK’s wallaby population, because he is a scientist and he doesn’t have sufficient evidence, but he will say that there appears to be a continuous population across southern England, with a few hotspots. There have been regular sightings in the Chilterns, plus in Cornwall, where they appear to be breeding. “I base that on observations of joeys [baby wallabies] in the pouch.”Caravaggi says that more work – that he plans to be involved in – is needed on wallabies’ impact. In New Zealand, where they are also non-native, they are considered a pest, as they browse saplings and have a big impact on forestry. There are no reports of them having a major impact on the landscape in Britain, but on the Isle of Man landowners have been upset by the damage they cause.The effects of some other non-native species are well known: grey squirrels (originally from North America) have led to a massive decline in native red squirrel numbers, similarly minks’ effects on water voles, and ring-necked parakeets are likely to have an impact on nesting birds. “I wouldn’t imagine wallabies would have much impact in terms of the larger fauna,” says Caravaggi. “The only animals they’re going to compete with directly are, for example, muntjac deer [also non-native], or sheep if they got into the fields. But they might impact flora, and if you change the dynamics of plants, small-scale systems and habitats, that can change invertebrate populations, so there could be broader ecosystem consequences.”View image in fullscreenTracker Parkin zooms in on the escaped wallaby.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianCaravaggi mentions the coypu, a large semi-aquatic rodent from South America that was brought to the UK in the 20s for the fur trade. Some escaped and established colonies in East Anglia. (I grew up in Suffolk and I remember my mum once being presented with one by a neighbour – dead, to cook, which she duly did. It tasted a bit like chicken, maybe more ratty …) Anyway, coypus did a lot of damage, burrowing into the sides of waterways, causing erosion and destroying flood mitigation infrastructures. An eradication campaign, launched in the 1980s, successfully eliminated them.It might be harder to do that today. Caravaggi says modern wildlife management doesn’t work like it did historically, when landowners could kill what they didn’t like and any complaints could be brushed off. “With the advent of social media and global connections, the opinions of the public are more important than ever. They’ve explored grey squirrel culls but the public are just not on board. We’ve seen outcries over badger culls. Wallabies are charismatic and in our landscape very strange animals, so even if there was evidence of negative impact, we’d need to consider the associated relationships people have with nature and the wallabies.”He wants to be clear that he is not advocating lethal control. “Given global dynamics and climate change it’s not sufficient to say they’re not native so they should be culled. Like all countries, we’ve a ton of non-native species which have neutral impact. What’s needed for the wallabies is to accumulate evidence and consider their ecological role, economic role, all these things, then you can make informed decisions about how best to manage the populations.”Back in the bush, I mean the English countryside, there’s a twist in the tale of the Oxhill one. While Parkin is still scouring the ground for tracks, a farmer pulls up in a pickup truck with a jack russell emerging from the window. Is this going to be one of those get-off-my-land moments? No, he just wants to know what we’re doing. Looking for a medium-sized marsupial; has he seen one? Oh, that’ll be his son’s, he says, it escaped 10 days or so ago. Ah.View image in fullscreenThe wallaby had escaped from a locked paddock in Oxhill.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianTom Heritage agrees to take us to see his son, Paul, on the family sheep farm up the track. Paul initially isn’t thrilled to see us. He seems suspicious, but I can see that five strangers turning up armed with cameras and a notebook could be disconcerting. Yes, he has wallabies, three of them, keeps them in a fenced paddock. One of them, the male, got out, he thinks under – rather than over – the fence, which is seven feet (2.1 metres) high. Can we meet the remaining females? No, we can’t.The early frostiness thaws a little. Paul says he keeps them because he finds them fascinating, particularly their breeding cycle. “It’s very unusual, when they’re born they’re only this big,” he says, demonstrating with a section of his finger. A joey “has virtually no back legs, which is weird, but its arms are very developed, so it can pull itself into the pouch where it latches on and stays for six months. It’s a most unusual way of breeding, developed for where they come from. In drought they pause gestation.”Becky chips in: “I bet some women wish they could do that.”A water source would be a good place to start. We follow a stream into a woodIt’s clear that Paul Heritage is passionate about his wallabies. He says he never would have had them if he thought they could damage the environment. Is he sure we can’t come and see the remaining two? Yes, he’s sure. But we’re welcome to carry on looking for the missing one, though he doesn’t think we’ll find it during the day. No, it doesn’t have a name. He was last seen on the other side of the village. They tried to corral him into a trap but he wasn’t having it.Molly’s wallaby isn’t as wild as we suspected. But, as Parkin says, “it underscores the point that so many people in the countryside have strange creatures on their property and they escape.” About four years ago,another Warwickshire escapee, a distinctive white wallaby named Colin became well known around Kenilworth, not far from here, until, sadly, he was hit by a lorry. After some initial disappointment that our wallaby hasn’t been hopping around the West Midlands for years, we realise it’s actually the perfect illustration.View image in fullscreenSam and Parkin eventually spotted the wallaby under a tree, eating fallen crab apples.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianAll that remains is to try to see the bloody thing. Molly and her mum have to go home, so Parkin and I and photographer Fabio head to the other side of the village, where Paul’s escapee was last seen. Parkin snaps into tracker mode, says that a water source would be a good place to start, so we follow a little stream into a wood. This is a “desire path”, he says, an animal trail where the grass has been beaten down. He crouches down to look for signs. Fabio snaps away. I’ve found some binoculars, so I’m staring into the undergrowth, thinking it would be funny if the wallaby hopped into view.Guess what? He does! Parkin hisses, nods, and there he is, 30 metres ahead, sitting under a tree, eating fallen crab apples: a quintessentially Australian creature in a quintessentially English setting. It is both utterly incongruous and – precisely because of that – magical. Parkin, who has wanted to see a wallaby in the wild all his life, remember, is over the moon. “Sorry, I’m not a sweary man, but fucking hell,” he whispers. We creep a bit further, too close, the wallaby looks up again, finishes his mouthful, then bounds lazily off.An update:Molly’s wallaby, who indeed turned out to be Paul Heritage’s wallaby, was recaptured. A team of five went down to where we saw him, with a net, into which they corralled him, bundled him into the back of the pickup and returned him to his pen. He didn’t get to join Britain’s burgeoning wild wallaby population. This time.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeFarmingAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stirchley is a modest kind of place, sandwiched between better known (and better off) areas such as Bournville and Moseley, but there is plenty of evidence here of the lively community spirit that last year resulted in the area beingnamedthe best place to live in the Midlands.Posters in shop windows along Pershore Road advertise a knitting group, a neighbourhood winter fair and the local food bank, while in the former swimming baths, now a community hub, friendly flyers for coffee mornings and choirs are stacked.Scratch just below the surface, however, and there are signs of something much less harmonious going on. Outside the farm foods shop, someone has pasted photos of a number of Stirchley residents, whose faces have since been scraped away. “I AM THE PERSON TAKING DOWN THE FLAGS,” reads one image that has been stuck on a bin. Another picture, since torn off the post box, was tagged: “I HATE THE UNION FLAG”.View image in fullscreenSome in favour of flying the flags have been pasting photographs of residents they say have removed them on bins and postboxes.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianFor months, this small collection of Victorian streets has found itself the scene of a fractious and at times very ugly dispute over the flying of flags. On at least four occasions since September, members of a Birmingham-based group called Raise The Colours (RTC), wearing branded hard hats and hi-vis vests and using a cherrypicker, have hung hundreds of Saint George and union flags from Stirchley’s lamp-posts, as part of awidespread campaignthey say is intended to “fill the skyline with unity and patriotism”.On each occasion a group of local residents, objecting to what they describe as territory-marking as part of an anti-immigrant movement, have taken the flags down, but say they have been subject to harassment and intimidation when they have tried to protest.Those objecting to the flags are routinely filmed, with the clips later posted on social media. Two independent Stirchley businesses whose owners challenged people erecting flags outside were vandalised with flour and eggs the next day. After RTC posted on X about a third dissenting small business, later reposted by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, the business was hit with hundreds of negative Google reviews.RTC, which says its members are acting out of a“patriotism”it describes as “positive and inclusive”, has characterised the confrontations on social media as “the Battle of Stirchley”. But David, a 65-year-old management consultant who brought up his family in Stirchley and is one of about 150 local people who have joined a loose grouping opposed to the flags, said: “We don’t want a battle here. We want to go on with our lives, our work and bringing up our families.“We don’t want to spend our time battling with some guys from out of town who have a political agenda and want to use us as their battleground. But equally, we won’t retreat from our streets and be intimidated by these people. We will continue to make our case as a welcoming, caring community of people.”Like most of those interviewed for this article, he asked not to be fully identified, fearingdoxingor other retaliation.View image in fullscreenRemnants of Saint George flags on a lamp-post in Stirchley.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianFlag-flying has faded from the political agenda in England since the febrile summer months, when tensions over migration and anemboldening of the far rightwere accompanied by a wave of flags being erected in streets across the country, with the vocal approval of some residents and despite the often silenced objections of others.But in many communities, including some where flags are no longer so visible, this has remained a fraught and highly divisive issue, even if strikingly few politicians are willing to speak about it. In the absence of political leadership, some neighbourhood groups say it has been left to them to push back against an organised and well funded movement that, while certainly galvanising support among many individuals, has beendrivenand encouraged by figures with links to the far right.Some local authorities have removed flags that have been attached to civic infrastructure – technically an offence if done without permission – though there have been widespread reports of workers being abused while doing so, including inKnowsley,Trafford,HertfordshireandLondon. In Salford, a subcontractor working on camera equipment waspulled from a ladderin September by a man who mistakenly believed he was removing flags.Elsewhere, however, councils refuse to intervene, or residents have decided to take matters into their own hands, sometimes leading toangry confrontationsor worse.View image in fullscreenIan, from Norwich, says his face was smashed into the pavement.One Norwich man, Ian, 68, said he wasassaulted last monthwhile attempting to remove a flag from a lamp-post in the early hours of the morning. After he was spotted from inside a house, he said, a car pulled up, he was surrounded and had his face smashed into the pavement. He believes someone stamped on his head. Officers from Norfolk police were called, but told Ian they could not investigate as there was no CCTV evidence. The case has now been closed.James Harvey, a Green councillor on Broadland district council in south Norfolk, said in some places, groups of people opposed to flag-flying were now organising to take direct action against it. He said: “There are teams that go out late at night to remove the flags. They don’t want any fuss or any publicity. They just want to take them down because they see them as the far right marking territory. They see them as divisive and hate-filled, not patriotic.“My fear is it just escalating. If the authorities are seen to do nothing, then it just carries on. My fear is that it’s only a matter of time before there is a larger or more serious confrontation and somebody could get very seriously hurt.”One man who is part of a group of anti-flaggers in the area said they work in small teams of about six “for safety”, organised via the secure messaging app Signal, and go out in the early hours of the morning to targeted areas. “We have contacts in other places who have requested flags to be taken down and have given us maps of where they are before we go,” he said.View image in fullscreenPosters and stickers in response to those who have put up flags in Stirchley.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianThe group have developed a device with an extendable pole and brush that allows them to remove flags even where they have been placed with cherrypickers at the top of very high lamp-posts. “It always feels a bit scary,” the man said. “We are aware of the possibility of being infiltrated, which could mean that the flaggers might be waiting for us in an organised group when we arrive somewhere to deflag. This means we need to be careful about recruiting. Or perhaps we are being paranoid, it is hard to tell.”Anne, 66, from Walkley in Sheffield, said the disputes over flags near her home have felt like “a miniBattle of Cable Street” – referencing the 1936 clashes in London’s East End when neighbours united to resist a march by fascists.Walkley has been the scene ofangry standoffsbetween a group identifying itself on Facebook as Reform Sheffield East, which erected many flags in the area, and a group of local residents who did not want them. “We really do feel that it is designed to intimidate, and it is intimidating,” said Anne, who has lived in the neighbourhood for more than 20 years. “A lot of us feel – and I think the evidence bears this out – that when these flags start going up, people then feel emboldened to say the sort of things that they haven’t felt able to say for 30 years.”“It’s like there’s a very quiet and very English guerrilla war going on, in terms of different groups putting up and taking down flags,” said Andrew Scarsdale, spokesperson for a group called SheffieldCommunitiesagainst Racism and Fascism (Scarf).“One thing that’s definitely happened inSheffieldis people have been spontaneously taking them down. So the flags have had to go physically higher to stop them being ripped down by enraged passersby. There are fewer flags now, but they’re higher up and more difficult to get to.“We know what these flags are. This is not like flags coming out for the football. This has been a deliberately toxified symbol. Everyone knows what it means, including the people who put the flags up.” AYouGov polllast month found the majority of ethnic minority adults now see the Saint George flag as a racist symbol.View image in fullscreenStirchley was voted best place to live in the Midlands last year.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianLike many people in the area, Anne sees the flag-flying in Walkley as a carefully planned tactic. “They come into an area and they put up a load of flags. Some people will come out to support it and some people will come to take it down. But now they’ve found the people who support them, they’ve found their local support base.”A spokesperson for Reform UK said Reform Sheffield East was not an officially affiliated Facebook page, but that the party supported the hanging of flags, which it saw as “symbols of unity and inclusion”. Sheffield city council said it regarded flags on lamp-posts as illegal but if they were not an immediate safety risk, it would remove them “in a timely manner”.Back in Stirchley, the main strip of Pershore Road is still festooned with flags, although instead of the Saint George Cross and union flag, mostly since removed, they are now Remembrance-themed flags, which RTC erected across Birmingham last month at the top of the very high street lamps. While most people may support commemorating the war dead, local anti-flag residents still regard the banners, which arenot supportedby the Royal British Legion, as a provocation.RTC says it has raised more than £115,000 to fund further flags, and for “community support” and “campaign outreach”. It did not respond to a request for comment.Birmingham city council said it was engaging with communities but suggested it did not intend to remove flags, as previous efforts “have unfortunately been met with hostility and abuse and we must consider workers’ safety”.“They are not going to do it. We have to do it ourselves,” said Allie, 30, a web designer who has been active in Stirchley’s anti-flag group. “Community is where change comes from. This is what true democracy looks like. It doesn’t look like coming in [to a neighbourhood] and putting up flags and not talking to anyone.“It’s about all of us organising and doing shit ourselves, and not only taking down flags, but also trying to start migrant support networks, or create local community events, or volunteering at the food bank. And that’s what we’ve been doing.”Some names have been changed"

Many homes in DRC are near the tracks.Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPADemocratic Republic of the CongoUS and EU critical minerals project could displace thousands in DRC – reportGlobal Witness says plan to upgrade railway line to Angola puts up to 1,200 buildings at risk of demolitionRachel SavageAfrica correspondentThu 4 Dec 2025 11.08 ESTFirst published on Thu 4 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTShareUp to 6,500 people are at risk of being displaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project funded by the EU and the US, amid a global race to secure supplies of copper, cobalt and other “critical minerals”,according to a report by campaign group Global Witness.The project, labelled the Lobito Corridor, aims to upgrade the colonial-era Benguela railway from the DRC to Lobito on Angola’s coast and improve port infrastructure, as well as building a railway line to Zambia and supporting agriculture and solar power installations along the route. Angola has said itneeds $4.5bn(£3.4bn) for its stretch of the line.The project is designed to facilitate the export of minerals used in green energy technologies, such as electric car batteries. It comes as western countries, China and Gulf states vie to control the critical minerals trade.Up to 1,200 buildings are at risk of demolition due to the planned rehabilitation of the stretch of railway from the Congolese mining city of Kolwezi to the Angolan border, most in Kolwezi itself, Global Witness estimated, based on analysis of satellite data.Many poorer residents of the Kolwezi neighbourhood Bel Air have built houses and businesses close to the railway line. A buffer zone where construction is not allowed was previously rarely enforced, according to Global Witness.The line has mostly been out of use since the 1980s, until recently when the line started to be rehabilitated. Lobito Atlantic Railway (LAR) – a consortium of companies including Portuguese construction company Mota-Engil, Singapore-headquartered commodity trader Trafigura and Belgian railway operator Vecturis – won a 30-year concession to operate the Angola section of the Benguela Railway in 2023.Some residents had bought land from vendors who may not have owned it, a community leader named only as Emmanuel told Global Witness.Others said they had bought plots from workers who had been given land by their employer, Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo (SNCC), the DRC state railway company. SNCC is still operating the railway line, although LAR is now using it.Jean-Pierre Kalenga, the minister for land affairs in Lualaba province, where Kolwezi is located, said people living inside the buffer zone were “illegals”, according to Global Witness. The Guardian has approached the DRC national communications ministry for comment.“You can’t say [the residents] are ‘illegal’. No one has prevented them from building. They’ve been left to live there for 10, 20, 30 years,” Donat Kambola, the president of a local non-profit organisation, Initiative pour la Bonne Gouvernance et les Droits Humains (IBGDH), told Global Witness.The current buffer zone for the railway, for which emergency works are under way, is 10 metres either size of the track, according to LAR. For the expected future rehabilitation of the line, which has not been confirmed yet, Congolese officials and a member of the SNCC union told Global Witness the buffer zone would be 25 metres either side. It is this larger buffer zone that could displace up to 6,500 people, the campaign group estimated.UK launches critical minerals strategy to reduce dependency on ChinaRead moreA LAR spokesperson said: “Lobito Atlantic Railway consortium is providing financing for the existing railway in the DRC, in exchange for use of the line. SNCC retains full responsibility for the line’s maintenance and operation within the DRC.“LAR Consortium is not aware of, and has not been presented with, any evidence to support the claim that 6,500 people residing in the informal settlement of Bel Air in Kolwezi could be displaced by the ongoing project to rehabilitate the existing railway in the DRC.”Kolwezi residents interviewed by Global Witness said they feared being forcibly evicted without compensation, claiming they knew of houses that had been demolished without payment to make way for new roads and mines.When it secured the concession, LARcommitted to spending$455m on the 835-mile Angola section of the railway and $100m on the 249-mile DRC segment. Western financing pledges include a$553m loanfrom the US government’s development finance corporation for Lobito port and the Angola railway and€50m (£44m)from the EU to upgrade Zambian rail infrastructure.An EU commission spokesperson said: “The project is still at an early stage. Any possible impacts linked to the planned rehabilitation of the Lobito railway line in the DRC will be assessed through a full feasibility study and detailed technical design, which also includes an independent environmental and social impact assessment study. These are still under way.“What we can confirm is that the EU applies the highest social and environmental standards in all the projects it finances.“These foresee, among others, thorough consultations with relevant communities and, where needed, a resettlement action plan to ensure fair compensation and support.“The EU is not involved in the rehabilitation works currently carried out by SNCC or the LAR consortium. We therefore have no additional information to provide at this stage.”This article was amended on 4 December 2025 to clarify some details from the Global Witness report.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAngolaAfricaZambiaCritical mineralsRail transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The contribution, worth $2.9m, was received at the UN agency’s warehouse in the northern Ugandan city of Gulu.View image in fullscreenCongolese refugees on Uganda’s border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo after fleeing fighting between Rwandan-backed M23 rebels and the DRC.Photograph: N Kajoba/Anadolu/GettyUganda hosts an asylum andrefugee population of nearly 2 million– the largest in Africa – including more than 56,000 Eritreans, nearly 50,000 Somalis and about 16,000 Ethiopians, according to UNHCR. Many have fled forced conscription, political or religious persecution, and climate crisis-related crises.One Eritrean refugee official based in Uganda’s capital, Kampala, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very complicated matter and has a life-threatening risk. It’s a very dangerous move that puts at risk the lives of hundreds of people.”Donald Trump’sfreeze on US aid spendingand theUK’s planned reduction in aid spendingfrom 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% by 2027 are among the cuts that have badly hit Uganda’s ability to look after refugees and will, analysts say, push people into displaced person camps or back into conflict zones.Abdullahi Halakhe, a senior advocate at the humanitarian organisationRefugeesInternational, said Uganda’s directive was part of a larger global clampdown. “For many refugees affected, this will be a massive blow,” he said.“They cannot go back to their home country; they cannot have third-country resettlement; and they cannot be integrated in the country of refugees. They’re left in a limbo,” Halakhe said.Tanzania’s descent into repression is a stark warning of how fast Africa’s progress can be eroded | Kenneth MohammedRead moreUganda’s 2025 refugee response plan, budgeted at $968m, remainsseverely underfunded, with the UNHCR saying in August thatonly 25%had been secured, raising concerns over the country’s ability to sustain essential services and threatening to undo years of progress for its refugee population.The announcement marks a big shift for Uganda, which has long had a more liberal policy towards arrivals from other countries, with refugees allowed to work in the country and access public services.Halakhe said: “It’s a massive step backwards from Uganda after years of being a leader in a progressive refugee policy.”In February, the WFP cutfood rationsfor a million people in the east African country amid a funding crisis after severe cuts in aid from the US and European countries, raising fears that refugees and asylum seekers would be pushed back into countries at war.The UNHCR was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentUgandaRefugeesMigrationAidEritreaSomalianewsShareReuse this content"

The MENA region has historically always been a bridge between east and west.”The power list’s top 10 features several artists and curators from the Middle East andAfrica. Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, one of the most powerful women in Qatar and the chair of Qatar Museums since 2006, is at No 2, in part due to her immense purchasing power.Last year’s No 1, Sheikha Hoor al-Qasimi, the president and director of the Sharjah Art Foundation in the United Arab Emirates, slips two places to No 3, and the Egyptian artist Wael Shawky comes in at No 4.Singapore’sHo Tzu Nyen(5), the AmericansAmy Sherald(6),Kerry James Marshall(7) and Saidiya Hartman (8), the UK-based groupForensic Architecture(9) and Germany’sWolfgang Tillmans(10) round out the top 10.Mahama has had an incredibly busy couple of years. He is represented by the influential Apalazzo Gallery and White Cube galleries and his practice includes using old hospital beds, discarded train carriages and other artefacts that he turns into art objects.Last year at Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery, Mahama’s Songs About Roses, which focused on the rise and fall of the railway that the British government built in Ghana between 1898 and 1923, was described as being “as extraordinary as a great magic-realist novel”.TheGuardian’s Jonathan Jones saidthe work’s reckoning with history’s ghosts “puts Mahama up there with William Kentridge and Anselm Kiefer as one of today’s most important artists”.View image in fullscreenMahama’s work Purple Hibicus at the Barbican in 2023.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianA few months before his Edinburgh show opened, Mahamadraped the Barbicanin 2,000 sq metres of bright pink fabric, which had been stitched together in a football field in Ghana because it was so large.In 2019, Mahama opened the Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art in Tamale, a 900 sq metre site that is an exhibition space, library, residency space, archive and studio.Rappolt said many of the highest-ranking artists ran programmes in their local communities. He said of Mahama: “He’s not acting as this classic idea of the sole artist producing his own the flashes of genius, but also as a person who’s part of a community.”Thirty anonymous experts from around the world compiled the annual power ranking, which has been running for 24 years.Explore more on these topicsArtGhanaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, US navy admiral Frank Bradley, who commanded the attack, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Dan Caine, appeared before the House and Senate’s armed services and intelligence committees for a closed briefing in which they showed video and discussed the attack with lawmakers.“What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service,” Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House armed services committee, said after exiting the meeting.However, he said Bradley “confirmed that there had not been a ‘kill them all’ order, and there was not an order to grant no quarter”.The Republican chair of the Senate intelligence committee, Tom Cotton, defended what he called “righteous strikes” and said Hegseth had not explicitly ordered that all onboard be killed.“Adm Bradley was very clear that he was given no such order to give no quarter or to kill them all. He was given an order that, of course, was written down in great detail, as our military always does,” Cotton told reporters.The comments came days after the Washington Postreportedthat Hegseth had verbally given such an order before the attack, which resulted in the death of two people who had survived an initial airstrike targeting the vessel off the coast of Trinidad.The 2 September bombing killed a total of 11 people and was the first in a wave of attacks on boats thatDonald Trumpsays are ferrying drugs from Venezuela to the United States, though experts have disputed that claim and questioned whether the air campaign is legal.Trumpposted video of the initial strike on his Truth Social platform shortly after the operation, but no footage of the follow-up attack, which killed the two remaining crew members, has been released. On Wednesday, he pledged to make the entire video public, but the Pentagon has not yet done so. Spokespeople at the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Lawmakers differed over what the full video shows, which could prove crucial to determining whether the second air strike killed survivors who were defenseless, or capable of posing a threat. Himes said he saw “two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who are killed by the United States”.Describing those on board as “bad guys” who “were not in the position to continue their mission in any way”, he added: “Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors.”Cotton said he “saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs, bound for the United States, back over so they could stay in the fight”. Other “narco terrorists” in the area may have been coming to rescue them, he added.Cotton also pointed to another strike “where survivors actually were shipwrecked and distressed and not trying to continue on their mission, and they were treated as they should be, as non-combatants. They were picked up by US forces.” He did not provide details of that incident.While Himes called for the full video to be released, Cotton deferred to the defense department, but said: “I didn’t see anything in there that concerned me.”Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate armed services committee, vowed to continue investigating the attack. “I am deeply disturbed by what I saw this morning,” he said in a statement that called on the full video to be released.“This briefing confirmed my worst fears about the nature of the Trump administration’s military activities, and demonstrates exactly why the Senate armed services committee has repeatedly requested – and been denied – fundamental information, documents and facts about this operation.”Trump has defended the decision to destroy the boats, saying that those piloting them were guilty of trying to kill Americans. Hegseth said he didn’t see any survivors, explaining that it “exploded, there’s fire, there’s smoke” adding “this is called the fog of war”. A White House spokesman earlier this week denied that the defense secretary personally ordered that the vessel’s occupants be killed, and defended Bradley’s handling of the attack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The campaign, which Trump has said is necessary to stop the flow of fentanyl and other illegal substances into the United States, marks a sharp departure from the previous US strategy of interdicting such vessels, and faces mounting criticism from legal and human rights experts.Marcus Stanley, director of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said the strikes themselves constitute potential war crimes even before the killing of survivors. “You’re already talking about entities that don’t have any means of defending themselves,” he said. “This is a totally extrajudicial process. They’re simply destroying them and killing everyone on them without any judicial process whatsoever.”Sarah Yager, Washington director of Human Rights Watch, rejected the administration’s characterization of the boat strikes as military operations in an armed conflict. “The president, even though he says it’s a conflict, he can’t just make up a conflict. There isn’t one,” she said, explaining that war had to be declared by a congressional vote. “Nobody on those boats can be killed legally by the United States military.”The report that survivors were deliberately killed prompted criticism from some congressional Republicans. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina senator who is not running for re-election aftera disputewith Trump earlier this year, said if reports were substantiated that the strike targeted survivors clinging to burning wreckage, it would violate ethical and legal requirements.“Whoever made that order needs to get the hell out of Washington,” he said.Senate Democrats have meanwhile announced plans for a war powers resolution that could undermine the air campaign if approved by Congress, buta previous similar effortdid not attract Republican support to pass.Human Rights Watch has called on Congress to investigate the entire campaign of strikes, which Yager said fell into “the same bucket of illegal”. She added that regardless of whether the US considers itself at war or in peacetime, any government action to kill, detain or arrest individuals requires due process that should typically be transparent.Emily Tripp, executive director of Airwars, a civilian-harm watchdog that monitors armed conflicts, called on the administration to be more transparent about the strike, saying her organization would like to know “what considerations are made around shipwrecked survivors, and why the use of force was chosen over search and rescue when as far as we understand the targets here are the drugs, not the people onboard”.Asked what should happen if Congress fails to act, Yager said: “Congress’s job is to have oversight over military operations and they should be stepping up.”Stanley warned that the precedent extends beyond drug interdiction.“What’s the next step? There’s somebody committing a street crime, or you claim they’re committing a street crime in a United States city, and then you can unleash the military on them without judicial evidence,” he said. “The American people should get as much transparency and information here to judge what’s being done in their name as possible.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryInternational lawTrump administrationPete HegsethDonald TrumpUS crimeVenezuelanewsShareReuse this content"

A family friend gave her plane tickets so she could fly home to Austin and surprise them for Thanksgiving.The 19-year-old business student was already at the boarding gate at Boston airport when she was told there was an “error” with her boarding pass; when she reached customer service, she was handcuffed and arrested by what she believed were two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.“I thought: ‘I was travelling to surprise my parents for Thanksgiving, and now the surprise will be that I won’t be there,’” López told the Guardian.She was allowed a phone call to her parents, who contacted a lawyer. The next day, a federal judge issued an emergency order barring her removal from the US for at least 72 hours until her case could be reviewed.But the next morning, she was shackled at her wrists, ankles and waist anddeportedto her nativeHonduras, a country which she left at the age of seven and of which she has virtually no memory.Home to about 11 million people, Honduras is one of the main trafficking routes for drugs moved from South America to Mexico, and has spent decades grappling with the growing power of armed gangs that control entire neighbourhoods, extort families and recruit young people. The country’shomicide rateis three times the global average.College student deported when flying home for Thanksgiving, despite court orderRead moreHonduras is also in a political maelstrom, with a knife-edge presidential election of which the vote count has dragged on since Sunday, with local politicians and analysts criticising repeated attempts by the US president, Donald Trump, toinfluence Hondurans’ votes.“I never thought I would go through this tragedy,” said López, who, since being deported on 22 November, has been staying at her grandparents’ home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras’s second-largest city.Her lightning-fast deportation – less than 48 hours after she was arrested at the airport – has drawn global attention as one of the starkest examples of alleged abuses under Trump’s mass deportation policy.“Her case is an unconstitutional horror show,” said her lawyer, the Boston-based Todd Pomerleau, who has represented other high-profile ICE detention cases, including that of the mother of the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’snephew.View image in fullscreenAn armed member of the elite gang taskforce on patrol in San Pedro Sula, the city where López left when she was seven.Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc./Alamy“She wasn’t told why she was detained,” said Pomerleau. “She was shackled like she was some type of hardened criminal, and then deported to Honduras with no opportunity to have a court hearing or even talk to an attorney,” he added.“If that isn’t unconstitutional, I don’t know what is,” Pomerleau said.Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed the chief focus of arrests and deportations wasdangerous criminals, but – likemost immigrantsdetained by Ice agents – López had no criminal record. Being undocumented in the US is not a crime but a civil infraction.A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said López, “an illegal alien”, was arrested because she “entered the country in 2014 and an immigration judge ordered her removed from the country in 2015, over 10 years ago. She has illegally stayed in the country since.”Her lawyer said that neither she nor he was ever shown the removal order, and that even if it does exist, afederal lawstipulates that arrests in such cases can only take place within a 90-day window after the order is issued – “not 10 years later,” said Pomerleau.“Her mum brought her here because of how horrific the circumstances were in Honduras, where gang members were killing and extorting people … They came here just like the Pilgrims 400 years ago, for a better life and to escape persecution,” said the lawyer.Honduras “has a large out-migration problem”, said Elizabeth G Kennedy, a social scientist and Soros justice fellow who researches deportees in Central America. In the past decade, about a fifth of Hondurans left the country, most heading to the US.Inside San Pedro Sula – the most violent city in the worldRead moreIn 2014, when López’s family left Honduras, their home town, San Pedro Sula, was considered themurder capital of the worldand their neighbourhood, La Pradera, was one of the most violent.“The children and families that I’ve interviewed from there [La Pradera] reported a very strong presence of gangs who forced multiple families to leave,” said Kennedy.Gang violence takes a particularly heavy toll on women, having been themain driverof femicides in Honduras last year. Teenage girls are particularly affected, making up the majority of female victims of sexual violence.“And now you have a young woman back in a country where it’s very dangerous to be a young woman, who was given no due process rights in the US,” she added.Pomerleau, the student’s lawyer, said they are now awaiting an official explanation from the US government to the court as to why the emergency order barring her removal was not respected.View image in fullscreenA suspected gang member in San Pedro Sula. A social scientist said that gangs had forced families in the La Pradera neighbourhood of the city to leave.Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc./Alamy“It’s possible the government will say: ‘Sorry, we made a mistake here, and we’re going to bring her back.’ That would be the easy and reasonable thing to do.“But they might have a different approach, and that’s going to require me to make a forceful argument that the court order was violated and demand a remedy,” he said.“We’re not stopping until we get her back”.López said she was trying to keep her mind occupied: “I try to be as positive and as strong as I can.“I want to be able to move forward and maybe continue my studies, whether here [in Honduras] or by finishing my semester at the university. And one day, to be able to see my parents and my family again,” she said.Babson College, the university she was attending in Wellesley, 14 miles from Boston, issued astatementaddressing her case and saying that “our focus remains on supporting the student and their family”.“My main goal in the US was always to study,” said López. “What happened to me isn’t fair, because we went there to study and work hard, to move forward in pursuit of that American dream so many of us had.”Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)HondurasAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The follow-up strike reportedly killed two survivors clinging to the side of the vessel.Amid speculation that a war crime or even murder may have been committed, the Republican-led armed service committees in the Senate and House of Representatives – until now, acquiescent to the demands of Donald Trump – have vowed to investigate.Fuelling the urgency, say legal analysts, are suspicions that the strikes violate long-established laws of warfare, even if the White House’s highly contentious claims that it is at war are accepted.Greater piquancy is added by the allegation that the strike occurred in compliance with an order from Hegseth. Days before the Post’s report, the defence secretary threatened to recall Mark Kelly, a Democratic senator, to active military duty to face court martial for his role in a video, created with fellow Democrats, advising service personnel that they have a right to disobey illegal orders.“Even if we buy into their framing that the individuals on these vessels are combatants, it would still be unlawful to kill them if they arehors de combat, which means they’re incapacitated,” said Rebecca Ingber, a professor at Cardozo law school and a former legal adviser to the state department.“It is manifestly unlawful to kill someone who’s been shipwrecked. This is such a longstanding textbook principle of the law of armed conflict.”The prohibition is made explicit in the Pentagon’s ownLaw of War manual.“Members of the armed forces and other persons … who are wounded, sick, or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances,” it says. “Such persons are among the categories of persons placed hors de combat; making them the object of attack is strictly prohibited.”Significantly – given the allegation that the second strike was conducted in accordance with Hegseth’s order to kill everyone onboard – the manual also addresses the question of illegal orders.“The requirement to refuse to comply with orders to commit law of war violations applies to orders to perform conduct that is clearly illegal or orders that the subordinate knows, in fact, are illegal,” it states, citing as an example orders to “fire upon the shipwrecked”.The statutory compulsion to resist clearly illegal orders are bolstered by the 1950Nuremberg principles– adopted after the allied tribunals that tried Nazi war criminals after the second world war. The principle lays down that an individual carrying out illegal instructions on behalf of a superior is not absolved of responsibility under international law.US law also rejects the principle of superior ordersas a defence under a precedent established in the prosecution of the former army lieutenant William Calley, who was convicted for his role in the notorious My Lai massacre during the Vietnam war.The rules are enshrined under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the legal system governing the US armed forces.The administration has offered a mix of caveats. While Trump has distanced himself from the second strike – telling journalists he would not have wanted it to be carried out – Hegseth has denied ordering the killing of survivors.Administration officials have gone further by suggesting that Adm Frank Bradley, the commander in charge of the operation, had not been trying to kill survivors but was instead targeting the disabled vessel and the drugs it presumably carried.Such an explanation could complicate matters, analysts say, but still rebound on the administration by intensifying scrutiny over the legality of the boat strikes.Geoffrey Corn, director of the Center for Military Law at Texas Tech University and a former senior adviser to the US army on warfare law, said it also raised questions over why the survivors could not be rescued first before sinking the vessel – as reportedly happened after at least one subsequent strike.“I think the first question for the admiral is: what was your target on the second strike? Was it the boat, or was it the crew members?” said Corn.“If it’s the crew, you have a real problem, because that’s simply improper. If the boat was your alleged military necessity for the second strike, why did you have to do it while they were clinging to the side? Why couldn’t you have intervened to save them?” he said.Corn compared the action of sinking the boat to two naval vessels doing battle, saying the analogy illustrated why the actions against the alleged trafficking vessels did not qualify as an armed conflict, as the administration insists.“If one of them is struck multiple times, which means, inevitably, there are wounded and sick or wounded enemy sailors on that ship and it continues to fight, you don’t stop fighting back because of the potential harm to the wounded sailors,” he said.“This is the crux of the problem. You’re treating a criminal menace as a wartime menace, and the rule doesn’t fit in that situation. With an enemy warship, there are ways to know that it’s done – it stops firing, or it strikes its colors. But how does that apply to a drug boat?”A possible answer to that question emerged on Thursday as Bradley prepared to go to Capitol Hill along with Dan Caine, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to address senators in a behind-closed-doors session.The New York Times reportedthat Bradley ordered the second strike after one of the two survivors was seen radioing suspected cartel members for help.The paper reported that Hegseth had approved a contingency plan for what to do if the first strike left survivors. If they were shipwrecked and “out of the fight”, US forces would help them. But if they took potentially hostile action such as communicating with fellow smugglers, attempts would be made to kill them.The explanation seemed to raise the possibility of any investigation getting bogged down in complex detail.Brian Finucane, senior adviser of the International Crisis Group and a former state department legal adviser, said the focus on the second strike risked obscuring the flimsy legal case for the boat strikes.“There’s a risk here of losing sight of the forest for the tree, because the broader campaign is really problematic,” he said.“The strike, and the attack itself, is likely unlawful regardless of the precise details, because there is no armed conflict. Without an armed conflict, you don’t have a law of war apply with either its permission structure to conduct lethal attacks, or its relevant prohibitions and criminal penalties. My concern is if there is [congressional] oversight, it may be myopic and narrowly focused on the details of this specific strike, which would be a mistake.”Corn urged the Senate to direct a series of specific questions at Bradley.“They need to ask him: What was the order you received? What exactly did Hegseth tell you to do? Did he make that statement about ‘kill them all’? Did he make it before the first strike or before the second strike? What was the target you were attacking? What was the weapons package you used? Why did it have to be attacked at that moment? Why were you indifferent to the plight of the shipwrecked crew members?” he said.“If we saw an enemy do this to a couple of our sailors, I think we would be outraged.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryAmericasDrugs tradeTrump administrationPete HegsethVenezuelaUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Any person who works without such a visa, commits an offence and is liable to be prosecuted or deported,” the notice, seen by Guardian Australia, says.Asylum seekers could also have their living expenses cut, or cancelled, if they are caught working, the government’s decree warns.The notice also warns Nauruan businesses not to employ asylum seekers.Home affairs officials confirmed in Senate estimates on Tuesday that Nauru’s policy prevents asylum seekers from working. Those who are granted refugee status after a protection claim – so far, only eight people since 2023 – are able to apply to work legally.Under the agreement between Nauru and Australia, the refugee status determination process has a target timeframe of 60 days.But some asylum seekers have been held on Nauru for more than four months – double that time – without a decision on their protection claim, and say they are going hungry while they wait for a decision.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe home affairs secretary, Stephanie Foster, told estimates on Tuesday “it’s one of the priorities in our new agreement around regional processing that that process be expedited”.Asylum seekers’ accommodation and utilities are covered by the Australian government under its agreement with Nauru, and thethree-quarters-of-a-billion dollar “reception, garrison and welfare” contractit has signed with private prisons operator MTC.Amonthly data planwith the country’s main internet and mobile provider Digicel costs $99. Nauru imports most of its fresh fruit and vegetables, raising the cost ofeveryday produce to prices far abovea typical supermarket in Australia.‘How is it possible to survive?’The difficult situation means some asylum seekers work unlawfully at petrol stations and on construction sites to supplement their stipend and cover the rising living costs.“We cannot survive on the $230 per fortnight allowance,” said one person, who wished to remain anonymous.“The money is not enough because everything is expensive here – rice, fish, we cannot buy any fruit here, internet for $100 per month. How is it possible to survive?”Another asylum seeker said he could not afford more than two meals a day, and skipped breakfast to make ends meet.“Here food is so expensive, vegetables and fruit it’s impossible for me to buy,” the man said.“Day by day I lose weight and my health condition is not good. I can’t support myself properly. It’s so difficult to survive in Nauru. When I see the doctor in IHMS they always say, ‘eat vegetables, fruits and milk’, but I can’t afford it.”Abag of grapes can cost $20on Nauru (the country uses Australian dollars), and a quarter-sliced watermelon $24. Small boxes of cereal retail for $15.Another man told Guardian Australia the latest notice ramped up the pressure on an already vulnerable group.“No one here cares about us, our mental health, our … difficulties which we going through here,” he said.Asylum seekers say they have been told they could face forcible deportation to a hostile country of origin, including countries riven by violence and systemic persecution of minorities, if their protection claim is not accepted.“If I go back to my country I can’t live because some people are waiting for me. If they find me they will kill me … I want to live and I want to start my life again,” one said.“I have a family. If I die, my family [will] also die with me. Please help me find safety.”Ogy Simic, the advocacy head of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, said it was “unconscionable” that asylum seekers were being punished “for doing what any of us would do in the same situation”.Albanese defends $2.5bn Nauru deal as transparency advocates warn taxpayer dollars could fuel ‘kleptocracy’Read more“The measly allowance refugees receive on Nauru is so low that people cannot afford food or drinking water, and many have had no choice but to work to survive,” he said.“We cannot outsource accountability. If Australia sends people to Nauru, then Australia must ensure they have the right to work, the means to survive and basic human dignity.”Australia and Nauru are both parties to the refugees convention, which imposes a non-refoulement obligation: states cannot return a refugee to a place where they areat risk of irreparable harm, including persecution or torture.The UN human rights committeeearlier this year ruledAustralia remained responsible for upholding the non-refoulement rights of asylum seekers it sends to Nauru for processing.Explore more on these topicsNauruAustralian immigration and asylumAsia PacificPacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Chen, who is also facing indictment by the US, could not be reached for comment. Last month, Prince Group denied the company or Chen were involved in any illegal activity.Reuters was unable to contact Kok An, Yim Leak or their representatives and they have not publicly commented on the allegations.Age of the ‘scam state’: how an illicit, multibillion-dollar industry has taken root in south-east AsiaRead moreHundreds of people in the region have been detained for alleged involvement in scam centres that have defrauded people across the world, but law enforcement agencies have yet to arrest the suspected masterminds of the lucrative networks.“We have seized assets worth 10,157 million baht [$318m],” Sophon Saraphat, deputy commissioner of the Thai Central Investigation Bureau, told a press conference. “Arrest warrants have been issued by the criminal court for 42 individuals.“As of yesterday, 29 individuals have been arrested.”Some of the assets seized were tied to Chen. Thailand’s Anti-Money Laundering Office (Amlo) said in a statement that investigators had found “information on networks of online fraud, human trafficking and money-laundering” that were linked to Chen and his associates. They did not give further details.Chen’s whereabouts were unknown and it was not immediately clear if he was one of the people subject to a Thai arrest warrant.In the past two months authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore froze or seized assets linked to the Prince Group worth $354m and $116m respectively, after Britain and the US sanctioned the southeast Asia-based multinational network over accusations it was involved in running scam centres.In October, theUS justice department indicted Chenfor wire fraud conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy for allegedly directing Prince Group’s operation of forced-labour scam compounds across Cambodia.Prince Group rejected those allegations as baseless, saying in a statement that neither the company nor Chen had engaged in unlawful activity.Another alleged scam operation involved Yim Leak, who Thai authorities described as “the heir of an influential network in Cambodia” that conducted fraudulent transactions, including domestic and international money transfers, the Amlo statement said.Amlo said it had seized trading accounts connected to Yim Leak as part of the investigation, including shares in energy major Bangchak Corporation worth 6 billion baht ($188m).Bangchak said the actions taken by Thai authorities concerned an individual shareholder, adding it would cooperate with authorities and was committed to transparency.“This matter is separate from Bangchak’s business operations and management, which continue as normal and remain fully stable,” it said in a statement.Bangchak’s shares closed up 1.87% on Wednesday.Thai authorities alleged they had also identified a criminal group operating out of facilities in Cambodia owned by Kok An that used illicit earnings to acquire assets in Thailand.Cambodia’s government and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thai authorities implicating Cambodian nationals in online fraud.Explore more on these topicsThailandMyanmarCybercrimeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The eight-tower complex – home to nearly 5,000 people – was under extensive renovations that have since beenfound to contain substandard, flammable materials.The secretary for development, Bernadette Linn, on Wednesday ordered allHong Kongbuildings undergoing major maintenance to remove their scaffolding netting by Saturday. The South China Morning Post reported the order would affect about 200 buildings.Authorities have arrested 15 people on suspicion of manslaughter, and another six on a different charge, over the estate’s fire alarms, which malfunctioned at the time of the blaze, police said. But much of the government’s focus has been on perceived political disruptors.Since the2019 pro-democracy protestsand subsequent government crackdown on all civil and political dissent, authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have made national security an overriding priority in the city, effectively crushing or silencing all opposition.Anger swelling in Hong Kong over deadliest fire in more than 70 yearsRead moreAt least three people have been detained under national security laws since the fire, including a university student, Miles Kwan, who promoted an online petition making “four demands” for victim support and accountability for those responsible.View image in fullscreenPeople leave flowers and pray near the Wang Fuk Court residential estate.Photograph: Leung Man Hei/EPAHong Kong’s government on Wednesday warned against “foreign forces, including anti-China media organisations”, sowing discord, making “malicious attacks” and “slanderous remarks”.The city’s leader, John Lee, also warned against crimes that “exploit the tragedy”.Beijing’s national security arm in Hong Kong on Wednesday accused a “small group of hostile external forces” of taking advantage of the disaster to “stir up trouble and incite chaos”, creating petitions and replicating tactics of the 2019 protests.In a lengthy statement, the Office for Safeguarding National Security accused the unnamed forces of hiding in shadows, fanning flames, and “throwing mud” at the Hong Kong government and rescuers.“Their intentions are sinister, their actions are despicable, and they have provoked the wrath of both man and god,” it said, using a Chinese idiom.None of the statements provided details or examples of the behaviour they warned against, or identified the “external forces”, except for the reference by the office to petitions.A student union-run noticeboard at Hong Kong Baptist University – nicknamed a “democracy wall” – was blocked off on Wednesday, an Agence France-Presse reporter saw.The message stuck to the board, which remained visible behind tall barricades, read: “We are Hongkongers. Urge the government to respond to public demands so justice can be done.”Meanwhile, the search and rescue officials said the number of dead might still be revised as “suspected human bones” had been found that required forensic testing. Police said 19 of the 159 dead were yet to be identified.Investigators are focused on the materials used in the renovation works, some of which are believed to have made the fire worse. As the blaze spread, flamesquickly covered the surfaces of the apartment blocks, which were wrapped with bamboo scaffolding, protective netting and foam boards.View image in fullscreenHong Kong construction workers walk near a building being renovated.Photograph: Chan Long Hei/APLee had announced a judge-led independent review committee, rather than the more legally powerful inquiry commission that many had expected would be set up.Outgoing pro-establishment lawmaker Doreen Kong has said an inquiry commission would be better.“The government should give a valid justification for choosing to use a non-statutory committee to investigate,” she told Hong Kong Free Press.Mourners have continued to stream to a small park near the charred buildings, placing hundreds of bouquets and notes of remembrance for the victims – the youngest of whom was a one-year-old, and the oldest 97.“I hope people can come here to lay their grief to rest,” said Sarah Lam, a volunteer organiser of the memorial events, adding that the victims suffered “many injustices”.Residents of the sole unaffected tower were allowed to return home briefly on Wednesday to retrieve belongings.More than 2,900 residents had been provided with temporary housing, officials said.Explore more on these topicsHong Kong apartment firesHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But unions and large energy users maintain any reservation must capture gas from existing projects, except for those already under contract for export.Paul Farrow, the national secretary of the Australian Workers’ Union, said a policy that only applied to future projects would “achieve virtually nothing for anyone”.“To shore up Australian industry for the 21st century, we need affordable gas reserved for domestic use right now – not years down the track,” said Farrow, whose union has campaigned for years for Labor to adopt the policy.Manufacturing Australia, which represents large energy users including BlueScope Steel and Rheem, has argued an “effective” gas reservation scheme is critical to curtail the high gas prices that risk jobs in the sector.“To be effective, gas reservation needs to put enough gas into the local market to see prices fall. In the short term, that means immediate reservation of uncontracted gas,” said Ben Eade, the chief executive of Manufacturing Australia.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“In the medium term, we can grandfather existing export contracts, but reservation should apply to all new contracts, variations or renewals, any gas project expansions or variations and any new gas production from this point onward.”Two models canvassedThe government has canvassed two models for a gas reservation in private consultation sessions with stakeholders over the past six weeks, two sources familiar with the development of the policy confirmed to Guardian Australia.The first would create a system in which the three Queensland-based LNG exporters supply a prescribed amount of gas into the domestic market in exchange for export permits. The second option would require all gas producers – exporters and domestic-only producers – to supply a certain volume into the local market, the sources said.The AWU wants the government to adopt the first option to directly target the exporters, which they say “broke the domestic market in the first place”.East coast gas prices have tripled over the past decade after the major LNG export terminals linked the domestic market to international demand.“Australian industry has been bleeding for over a decade while we’ve waited for the gas reservation scheme we desperately need,” Farrow said.“The priority now is getting a simple, workable model in place urgently – not designing some elaborate credit trading system that the gas companies will find ways to exploit.”The government would not confirm details of options under consideration when contacted by Guardian Australia.“The government is conducting a review of the gas market. The government is committed to ensuring Australian homes and businesses get access to Australian gas at fair prices,” a spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenLabor MP Ed Husic says it is a ‘real barbecue-stopper’ that foreign buyers are on-selling Australia’s gas.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPA gas reservation scheme already exists for the separate Western Australian market, which requires exporters to supply the equivalent of15% of LNG productionto the local market.The Labor MP and former industry minister Ed Husic wants his government to pursue even more drastic interventions, including cracking down on importers that on-sell Australian gas to third countries.“It’s a real barbecue-stopper for many Australians that foreign buyers are on-selling our gas while we’re facing forecasts of local gas shortages,” Husic said.The Greens are advocating a different approach to prevent domestic gas shortages, backing the Australian Council of Trade Union’s push for a 25% levy on LNG exports.“Taxing gas will be much more effective way of keeping gas in this country and replacing the Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT) that’s broken and simply not bringing enough money,” said Steph Hodgins-May, the assistant climate spokesperson for the Greens.Explore more on these topicsGasAustralian politicsBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

How the HyperVerse scheme caught fire onlineRead moreThe motion also argues that the Department of Justice should dismiss the case because “President Donald Trump favors civil regulation over criminal prosecution of the digital asset industry”.Central to Burton’s argument is that he conducted “extraordinary due diligence” before promoting the scheme, including travelling to Hong Kong and Dubai where he met Lee and saw the corporate offices of HyperFund.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“The apparently legitimate corporate infrastructure that Mr Burton relied upon was deliberately created by Sam Lee and others to deceive investors.”The memorandum included a photograph of Burton with Lee and others in what was claimed to be the Dubai corporate office of HyperFund.View image in fullscreenRodney Burton, in the red jacket, with Sam Lee, in what was claimed to be the Dubai corporate office of HyperFund.Photograph: Maryland district courtThe global reach of HyperVerse was revealed in aGuardian Australia investigationin late 2023 beforeLee was chargedwith conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud in the US in January 2024. Aseparate civil complaintbrought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Lee with fraud and with the unregistered sale of securities in breach of the US Securities Act.Lee’s alleged co-founder, Ryan Xu, was not indicted in the US proceedings, but according to Burton’s motion Xu was HyperFund’s general counsel.Lee, a former Melbourne-based blockchain entrepreneur dubbed the “crown prince of bitcoin”, moved to Dubai in late December 2021.In October, Lee filed a defence to the civil charges, arguing the court had no jurisdiction over him and denying all charges.In a statement to Guardian Australia, Lee said he was “deeply sympathetic” to Burton, saying he was among those “caught up in Biden Era anti-crypto witch-hunt”, but called his claims “baseless”.Lee suggested a similar program to HyperVerse – which was called a “pyramid and Ponzi scheme” in US court documents – would not face regulatory hurdles if pursued now under the Trump administration.“Rodney is a pioneer that I only had the privilege of meeting once in 2020, and the model he promoted via Hyperfund if done today, will not run into any regulatory hurdles,” Lee said.Lee said: “I don’t understand how I can be responsible for his ‘deception’ or part of his ‘extensive due diligence’ when I haven’t transacted with him beyond 2020.”Lee insisted that his involvement in the HyperVerse schemes was “limited to tech provision”.‘I do feel bad about this’: Englishman who posed as HyperVerse CEO says sorry to investors who lost millionsRead moreBurton’s memorandum also points to companies registered in Australia that were allegedly used by Lee and the HyperFund project to convince investors of their legitimacy, arguing these were relied upon to “perpetrate fraud”.The memorandum says short video endorsements from celebrities such as the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and presentations from a man called Steven Harrison, who wascommissioned to pose as a chief executivenamed Steven Reece Lewis, also formed part of Lee’s alleged deception. There is no suggestion Wozniak or Harrison were aware of any alleged wrongdoing.“This elaborate deception … demonstrates the sophisticated nature of the fraud that Mr Lee orchestrated and how far he went to deceive investors – including Mr Burton,” the memorandum says.“In sum, Mr Lee knew of these lies.”After Guardian Australia’s investigation, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) agreed to examine Lee’s previous company Blockchain Global.Asicsecured a travel banon one of Lee’s fellow directors, Liang “Allan” Guo, but this expired before Asic announced it would sue him, and he left the country.In October, Asic also secured an interim travel restraint order against Xu, but it is unclear whether he remains in Australia.Burton’s legal counsel argues he had already served 22 months in pretrial custody, and the court should restore his “traditional right to freedom before conviction”.The memorandum also points to Donald Trump’s election as president since Burton’s incarceration as a reason for his release, saying Trump “wants to make America the ‘crypto capital of the world’”.Last month the civil case against Lee was stayed pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings, given the two cases share “common questions of fact” and are likely to rely on similar witnesses.Lee has not filed a defence in the criminal matter, but has previously denied any responsibility for the HyperVerse scheme.Burton’s case is listed for trial in March 2026.Explore more on these topicsHyperVerseCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Rockliff once pledged the state would not contribute “one red cent more” than $375m.Additional state funding for the stadium would require the approval of both houses of parliament.The AFL is contributing $15m to the build, while the federal government is chipping in $240m for the site.Roland Browne, a spokesman for anti-stadium group Our Place – Hobart, flagged further protests but conceded there was no avenue for legal challenges.Explore more on these topicsTasmaniaTasmania DevilsAustralia sportAFLnewsShareReuse this content"

This is about enforcing the rules of the EBU and being inclusive,” it said. The German broadcaster SWR confirmed it would participate.The Spanish national broadcaster, along with seven other countries, had formally requested a secret ballot at a summit of broadcasters in Geneva on Thursday.“The EBU presidency has denied RTVE’s request for a specific vote on Israel’s participation. This decision increases RTVE’s distrust of the festival’s organisation and confirms the political pressure surrounding it,” it said in a statement.View image in fullscreenDelegates leave the headquarters of the European Broadcasting Union after the first day of a two-day general assembly on Thursday.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesSpain’s culture minister, Ernest Urtasun, backed the boycott. He said: “You can’t whitewash Israel given the genocide in Gaza. Culture should be on the side of peace and justice. I’m proud of an RTVE that puts human rights before any economic interest.”In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, the Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said it would also withdraw from next year’s contest. “After weighing all perspectives, Avrotros concludes that, under the current circumstances, participation cannot be reconciled with the public values that are fundamental to our organisation.”The Slovenian national broadcaster, RTVSLO – the first to threaten a boycott this summer – said participation “would conflict with its values of peace, equality and respect”.At the meeting on Thursday, EBU members discussed new rules designed to stop governments and third parties from promoting songs to influence voters.Some countries had raised concerns over undue promotion methods after Israel topped the public vote at the contest in May, finishing second overall after the jury votes were taken into consideration.The proposed rule changes were seen as an olive branch to broadcasters critical of Israel, but appear to have been deemed insufficient to most of the nations who had signalled their willingness to boycott the event.Sixty-five per cent of delegates voted in favour of the changes to the song contest and no further discussion on participation of Israel, while 23% voted against and 10% abstained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

ORF, the Austrian host broadcaster, had also said it wanted Israel to compete.SWR said before the meeting that Israel was entitled to compete in the contest. It said the contest, for decades, was “a competition organised by EBU broadcasters, not by governments” and “the Israeli broadcaster Kan meets all the requirements associated with participation” for 2026.Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Israel, which has won the contest four times since its debut in 1973, has competed for the past two years despite disputes over its participation.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropeIsraelTelevisionSpainIrelandSlovenianewsShareReuse this content"

The moves follow restrictions against Google’s YouTube, Meta’s WhatsApp and Instagram, and the Telegram messaging service, itself founded by a Russian-born man, that came in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Under Vladimir Putin, authorities have engaged in deliberate and multi-pronged efforts to rein in the internet. They have adopted restrictive laws and banned websites and platforms that don’t comply. Technology has also been perfected to monitor and manipulate online traffic.Access to YouTube was disrupted last year in what experts called deliberate throttling of the widely popular site by the authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not properly maintaining its hardware in Russia.While it’s still possible to circumvent some of the restrictions by using virtual private network services, those are routinely blocked, too.Authorities further restricted internet access this summer with widespread shutdowns of cellphone internet connections. Officials have insisted the measure was needed to thwart Ukrainian drone attacks, but experts argued it was another step to tighten internet control. In dozens of regions, “white lists” of government-approved sites and services that are supposed to function despite a shutdown have been introduced.The government has also acted against popular messaging platforms. The encrypted messenger Signal and another popular app, Viber, were blocked in 2024. This year, authorities banned calls via WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in Russia, and Telegram, a close second. Roskomnadzor justified the measure by saying the two apps were being used for criminal activities.At the same time, authorities actively promoted a “national” messenger app called Max, which critics see as a surveillance tool. The platform, touted by developers and officials as a one-stop shop for messaging, online government services, making payments and more, openly declares it will share user data with authorities upon request. Experts also say it does not use end-to-end encryption.Earlier this week, the government also said it was blocking Roblox, a popular online game platform, saying the step aimed at protecting children from illicit content and “pedophiles who meet minors directly in the game’s chats and then move on to real life”. Roblox in October was the second most popular game platform in Russia, with nearly 8 million monthly users, according to the media monitoring group Mediascope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He called the restrictions against the service “predictable” and warned that other sites failing to cooperate with Roskomnadzor “will be blocked – that’s obvious”.Explore more on these topicsSnapchatAppleRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

At that visit – lasting just five hours due to the Covid pandemic – Putin and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, discussed economic and military cooperation and reaffirmed their special relationship.Three months later, Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainewould turn him into a global pariah, isolating the Kremlin from the world and restricting Putin’s international travel.Since then, Donald Trump’s re-election has upended years of closely nurtured US-India relations with his inflammatory rhetoric and some of theworld’s most punishing import tariffs, throwing Delhi into a tailspin.The Ukraine peace deal has stumbled yet again over an inevitable obstacle: PutinRead moreAgainst this turbulent geopolitical backdrop, analysts emphasised the significance of the Russian president travelling to India on Thursday to meet Modi, both as a symbol of the enduring relationship between the countries and as a message that neither would be cowed by US pressure.The summit comes at a critical juncture for both countries. Putin has arrived in Delhi afterrejecting the latest US-proposed Ukraine peace plan, confident thatrecent advancesby Russian forces on the battlefield have strengthened his hand.View image in fullscreenPutin and Modi in Delhi on Thursday. The visit comes at a critical juncture for both countries.Photograph: Alexander Kazakov/AFP/Getty ImagesPetr Topychkanov, a Moscow-based senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said that for Russia, “the importance of this visit lies primarily in the fact that it is happening at all”.“It will signal that Russia is returning to something resembling normal international relations,” said Topychkanov. “Russia is no longer anxious about the risks of political isolation.”ForIndia, there are even greater stakes at play. As Aparna Pande, the director of the India and south Asia initiative at the Hudson Institute thinktank, put it, Delhi is grappling with its most unfavourable geopolitical climate in years thanks to “a semi-isolationist America, a weaker Russia and a very powerful China”.In a notable sign of the tightrope India has to walk, on the eve of Putin’s arrival a joint opinion piece by the French ambassador, the German high commissioner and the UK high commissioner to India was published in the Times of India, titled “Russia doesn’t seem serious about peace”.It prompted a stinging response from India’s foreign ministry, which said it was “not an acceptable diplomatic practice to give public advice on India’s relations with a third country”.‘China remains the greatest threat to India’India’s relationship with Russia goes back to the cold war and has remained deeply entrenched, with Russia India’s biggest defence supplier. It is an alliance that was long tolerated by western governments, even after Putin’s actions in Ukraine, but Trump’s return to the White House has signalled a markedly different approach.Over the past three years, the US and Europe turned a blind eye as India became one of the largest buyers of cheap Russian oil, despite sanctions in the west. But after the US president’s peacemaking efforts in Ukraine failed earlier this year, Trump began to accuse India of bankrolling Russia’s invasion. He publicly put pressure on Delhi tohalt its Russian oil purchases, which culminated in a punishing additional 25% punitive US tariff on Indian imports.In Delhi, which has pursued a multi-alignment foreign policy since independence and reacts poorly to any outside interference, the perceived attempts by Trump to meddle and coerce were met with outrage, resulting in the worst decline in US-India relations in years.Xi, Putin, Kim and the optics of a new world orderRead moreIn response, Pande said, India had returned to its default mode of “hedging” in its unorthodox alliances, “signalling to the US it has multiple options and waiting to see where everything will fall”. The last meeting between Putin and Modi was just three months ago, alongside the Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, wherethe three leaders were pictured holding handsand sharing jokes – optics that prompted fury from Trump.View image in fullscreenPutin, Modi and Xi Jinping together in China in September. India has returned to its default mode of ‘hedging’ in its unorthodox alliances.Photograph: APYet India has other pressing priorities in its engagement with Russia, namely the vast superpower that sits along its febrile north and north-eastern border. “From the Indian side – for all the talk of Russia being a great and loyal friend – the real reason that relationship is important is geography,” said Pande. “China remains the greatest threat to India for the foreseeable future and since the Soviet Union, India has always relied on Russia as a continental balancer against China.”The increasingly close, “no-limits partnership” between Moscow and Beijing has rattled India, said Pande, and left it hoping to find a way to “prevent Russia from ever getting too close to China and ensure it can count on Moscow to put some pressure on the Chinese”.It has also prompted India to try to move away from its dependence on Russia, particularly on defence. For decades, about 70% of Indian defence purchases came from Russia but in the past four years this has reduced to less than 40%.While the sale of weapons and planes – in particular Russian S-400 air defence systems and the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter aircraft – will probably be a key component of Modi and Putin’s talks on Friday, Pande said: “India will try to strike a balance; keep purchasing enough Russian weapons to retain the alliance, but not be so dependent that if Russia suddenly cut off supplies under China’s pressure, India would be left hanging.”For all the bear hugs and golf buggy rides that Modi and Putin have publicly enjoyed together in recent years, “this is a relationship based on pure realpolitik”, she added.The question of oilGrowing economic cooperation and bilateral trade between the two countries is also likely to be on the table at the summit. At an event on Tuesday with leading Russian economists, Putin emphasised Russia’s plan to take its cooperation with China and India “to a qualitatively new level”, flying in the face of western sanctions.The question of oil also looms large. While Modi has insisted that India would continue to buy Russian oil, newly imposed sanctions by the US and EU whichthreaten companies that buy from Russiahave led to a notable slowdown in purchases by the Indian private sector. Meanwhile, in a move seen as an attempt to appease Trump, India has agreed to import more US oil and gas.In a briefing this week, Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, acknowledged “obstacles” in economic and energy cooperation between the two countries but said they would continue uninterrupted. Western sanctions would cause only “insignificant drops and decreases” in how much oil Russia exports to India, and only “for a very brief time”, said Peskov, adding that Moscow possessed the technology to circumvent sanctions in the long run.As Modi and Putin sit down, mention of Ukraine will probably be limited to India’s repeated calls for peace, said analysts, emphasising that the Indian prime minister was unlikely to be able to move the needle in the global push for a halt to the war. “Yes Modi can speak to both Putin and Zelenskyy, but aside from asking both countries to talk to each other, India doesn’t have the leverage to make a difference on either side,” said Pande.Explore more on these topicsIndiaRussiaVladimir PutinNarendra ModiSouth and central AsiaEuropeUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

It was launched in 2023 at the College of Europe with a budget of nearly €1m.The European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the EU prosecuting agency thatissued formal changes against Mogherini and two othersthis week, said the accusations involved “procurement fraud and corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy”.It added: “All persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty by the competent Belgian courts of law.”Mogherini’s lawyer, Mariapaola Cherchi, told the Associated Press that her client was “transparent, clear and serene” during her 10-hour questioning, and she was confident Mogherini would be cleared.Mogherini served as the EU’s high representative for foreign policy from 2014-19 before being appointed rector of the College of Europe, the prestigious postgraduate school for EU studies with campuses in Bruges, Natolin and Tirana.She began a second five-year term in September. Apress releaseabout her reappointment lauded her role in establishing the EU Diplomatic Academy “to train a future generation of European-minded diplomats”.The case is examining whether the College of Europe had inside information that allowed it to secure the tender.The contract was awarded by the EU’s foreign service in 2021-22. Stefano Sannino, the top civil servant at the European External Action Service (EEAS) from 2021-24, has also been formally accused.Sannino went on to lead the European Commission’s department for the Middle East, north Africa and the Gulf. The commission said on Thursday he was “no longer active in his function”.“In light of the allegations brought forward by the EPPO … [he] has offered to take leave until the end of the year, when he will retire as planned,” the commission said, noting the presumption of innocence.Sannino, in a letter to staff announcing his departure,first reported by the Euractiv website, said he was “confident in the work of the magistrates and confident that everything will be clarified”.The investigation, which included raids on the EEAS headquarters in Brussels and on Mogherini’s home, is likely to be seized on by critics of EU policies at home and abroad.The US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, retweeted an article about the case, noting that Mogherini was “the same person, incidentally, who characterised communist Cuba as a ‘one-party democracy’ and fostered European investment, tourism and trade that propped up the island’s repressive and stridently anti-American regime”.He was referring to the 2016 edition of theEEAS’s annual report on human rights and democracy, released during Mogherini’s tenure, which described Cuba as a “one-party democracy”, where elections took place at municipal, regional and national level. The report also noted the increased harassment and jailing of political opponents and restrictions on freedom of speech.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeBelgiumnewsShareReuse this content"

Germany’s chancellor,Friedrich Merz, reportedly added that the Ukrainian leader needed to be “very careful”.“They are playing games with both you and us,” Merz was reported as telling him – a remark the magazine concluded was a reference toa diplomatic mission to Moscow this weekby President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.The magazine said other leaders also voiced their concerns, with Finland’s Alexander Stubb, who hasbonded with Trump over golf, reportedly warning “we must not leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys”.Even the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte – whoin public is very complimentary of Trump– reportedly said he agreed with Stubb “that we need to protect Volodymyr”.Der Spiegel said it spoke with “several” participants of the call, who confirmed it took place, and two of them reportedly said the remarks were “accurately reproduced”.A spokesperson for Zelenskyy declined to comment, as did Merz’s office, while the Élysée Palace contested the quotes attributed to Macron. Der Spiegel said Rutte’s office had declined to comment.The magazine produced a report in German andseparately published an English version, saying it contained original quotes from the summary note.Last month, Washingtonpresented a 28-point proposal to halt the war in Ukraine, drafted without input from Ukraine’s European allies and criticised as too close a reflection of Moscow’s maximalist demands.A flurry of diplomacy has followed, with US and Ukrainian negotiators holding talks in Geneva and Florida before Witkoff and Kushner headed to Moscow on Tuesday.The pair spent five hours in talks with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin andWitkoff is due to meet Ukraine’s national security council chief, Rustem Umerov, in Miamion Thursday.The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said in parliament on Thursday that an imposed peace would be “disastrous” not only for Kyiv but also Europe’s security.He called on European nations not to let up in their support forUkraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All appear to have benefited from Israeli support as part of astrategy of arming proxiesto degrade Hamas and control the population.The exact timing of Abu Shabab’s death is unknown but it appears to have been in the last 48 hours.The Popular Forces said in a statement that their leader died of a gunshot wound as he intervened in a family quarrel, and it dismissed as “misleading” reports thatHamaswas behind his killing.Sources in Gaza and reports on social media and in Israel earlier suggested that Abu Shabab, who was in his 30s and had been expelled by his own clan, died in a clash after refusing to release a hostage taken by his men from a powerful and heavily armed local family.Relatives of the hostage were said to have mounted an attack on the Popular Forces base, which led to casualties on both sides. Abu Shabab was reportedly badly injured and died of his wounds in Gaza.A spokesperson for Hamas, which had called Abu Shababa collaboratorand promised to hunt him down, denied any involvement in the killing.In June, Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel hadarmed anti-Hamas clans and factionsin Gaza. There has been no official comment from his government on Abu Shabab’s death.Israel’s policy has drawn criticism from some experts who have said such groups can provide no real alternative to Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007.Dr Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli military intelligence officer and expert on Hamas at the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University, said: “The writing was on the wall. Whether he was killed by Hamas or in some clan infighting, it was obvious that it would end this way.”Several other anti-Hamas groups have emerged in areas of Gaza held by Israel. The Palestinian political analyst Dr Reham Owda said Abu Shabab’s death would fuel doubts among them about their ability to challenge Hamas.Hossam al-Astal, the leader of another newly formed militia operating in the area of Khan Younis,said in Septemberthat he and Abu Shabab offered “an alternative force to Hamas”. Astal’s whereabouts is unknown.Abu Shabab’s hundred or so fighterscontinued to operatefrom areas of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces after a US-backed ceasefire between Hamas and Israel was agreed in October.View image in fullscreenA screenshot taken from a video released on 18 November 2025 is said to show Abu Shabab and his deputy, Ghassan al-Duhaini, with armed men in Rafah.Photograph: Yasser Abu Shabab/Popular Forces/ReutersOn 18 November, Abu Shabab’s group posted a video showing dozens of fighters receiving orders from his deputy to launch a security sweep to “clear Rafah of terror”, an apparent reference to Hamas fighters believed to be trapped in tunnels there. A week later, the Popular Forces claimed to have captured Hamas members.Israel’s internal and military intelligence services turned to individuals such as Abu Shabab when it became clear that their efforts to build an anti-Hamas coalition of community leaders and family elders would not succeed in the face of fierce Hamas repression of any threat among Palestinians in Gaza.Convincing evidence Israel backed aid convoy looters in Gaza, historian saysRead moreMany of those recruited into the new factions had been engaged in systematic looting of aid convoys, leading to allegations that Israel was allowing some theft of humanitarian assistance to bolster its new allies.In June, Abu Shabab – a member of the Tarabin Bedouin tribe –told the Guardianhis activities were “humanitarian”, adding that he did not work “directly” with the Israeli military.The Israeli strategy of backing militia factions such as the Popular Forces was one consequence of Netanyahu’s refusal to allow the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial control over parts of the Israel-occupied West Bank, to administer Gaza in any way. Abu Shabab’s Popular Forces coordinated closely with Israeli forces around controversial aid distribution sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an opaque US- and Israel-backed private organisation that hasnow been shut down.Donald Trump’s 20-pointGaza planforesees Hamas disarming and the territory run by a transitional authority supported by a multinational stabilisation force. But progress has been slow, with Hamas so far refusing to disarm and no sign of agreement on the formation of the international force.The war in Gaza was triggered by a Hamas raid into Israel in 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to the abduction of 250. The ensuing Israeli offensive and strikes since the ceasefire have killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and left the territory in ruins.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineHamasIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

With Donald Trump brooding over missing out on the Nobel peace prize, and shortly beforeGianni Infantino, the president of world football’s governing body, Fifa, was due to meet the US president in Miami, an announcement was made.In a press release and a post on his personal Instagram account last month, Infantino saidFifawould launch its very own peace prize, to be awarded each year to “individuals who help unite people in peace through unwavering commitment and special actions”.Who could possibly be in the running on 5 December when the winner is announced at the glittery draw in Washington for next year’sWorld Cupin the US, Canada and Mexico?Infantino had already been accused of a breach of Fifa’s neutrality rules during an unconventional appearance next to his “friend” Trump at a Gaza peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.“I think we should all support what he’s doing because I think it is looking pretty good,” Infantino had said.View image in fullscreenTrump and Infantino pose for a photo at a world leaders’ summit on ending the Gaza war in Sharm el-Sheikh in October.Photograph: Getty ImagesThe subsequent lack of information about how the inaugural award-winner would be chosen could not fail to be a cause of further disquiet for those concerned this could just be a sop to Trump.Those misgivings may now deepen. The Guardian has learned that the Fifa prize is seen internally as its version of thepresident’s awardat Uefa, the European football body, suggesting Infantino’s say will be decisive.It is also understood that a new “social responsibility” committee within Fifa has been given the central role in devising the “process” through which winners will be chosen – but will not sit before this year’s recipient is announced.The background of the chair of the committee tasked with coming up with a proposal on the process may not convince everyone that he will speak truth to power either.He is Zaw Zaw, the 59-year-old president of theMyanmarfootball federation for the past two decades who, along with his company, Max Myanmar, was the subject of EU and US economic sanctions at various points between 2009 and 2016.The US state department described him in a press release in 2009 as one of the “cronies” of Myanmar’s brutal ruling military junta as it suppressed democracy and violated human rights.View image in fullscreenZaw Zaw (centre) receives an Asian Football Confederation lifetime achievement award from Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa and Infantino in May 2024.Photograph: SOPA Images Limited/AlamyAccording to US diplomatic cables from 2009 and leaked in 2010, Zaw Zaw, who was again described as “one of Burma’s up-and-coming cronies”, had interests in gems, cement and bottling plants, among other things, as well as being chair of the Myanmar football federation, and owner of Delta United, one of the professional football teams in what was then a new Myanmar national league.“Contacts confirm that Zaw Zaw hired senior general Than Shwe’s grandson to play on the team,” the leaked cables went on, with reference to the country’s then dictator, who had been accused by the US of overseeing severe human rights abuses, including “extrajudicial killings”, custodial deaths, disappearances, rape and torture.The Myanmar football federation did not respond to a request for comment. In an interview in 2013 with the South Morning China Post, Zaw Zaw was reported as saying that his only crime was “in this poor country, I have become rich”. He added: “Only the government has projects,. If I don’t do projects with them, who will I do projects with?”Nick McGeehan, a co-director of FairSquare, a human rights advocacy group that published a report on Fifa last year, said Infantino’s personal announcement of the peace prize, seemingly without the involvement of Fifa’s council, the main decision-making body, was quite typical of the man.View image in fullscreenInfantino was elected as Fifa president in 2016.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersTelevision crews at the 2022 Qatar World Cup had reportedly been ordered to show Infantino at least once during matches. An inscription on the Fifa club World Cup trophy read “inspired by FIFA president Gianni Infantino”.But McGeehan said the Guardian’s findings highlighted a deeper problem at the Zurich-based sporting body. “These developments certainly suggest that this peace prize award process is being reverse-engineered to ensure the favoured result of President Infantino,” he said. “But there’s a structural problem. Infantino is like a sort of increasingly clownish symptom of the problem, but he is not the problem.”View image in fullscreenThe extraordinary Fifa congress held in February 2016, where delegates voted to adopt a radical reform package.Photograph: Patrick B Kraemer/EPAIn February 2016, delegates at a Fifa extraordinary congress in Zurich voted 176 to 22 in favour of adopting a radical reform package intended to herald a new dawn for an organisation that had been mired in scandals.Rolling crises at the body had culminated a year earlier with more than a dozen plainclothes Swiss police officers, acting under instructions from the US Department of Justice (DoJ), entering the Baur Au Lac hotel in Zurich andarresting seven senior Fifa officialsas part of an investigation into bribery and corruption.There is no suggestion of similar corruption today, said McGeehan, but he argued that key changes proposed at this new dawn had not been properly implemented.For example, the number of committees within Fifa has gone up rather than down as proposed, he noted. Fifa says this offers more oversight. FairSquare suggested it provided more opportunities for patronage.A report published last year by FairSquare argued that the power of Fifa’s most senior and powerful officials was “rooted in a model of patronage that disincentivises ethical conduct”, with the national members seeking funds, or even lucrative committee positions, and those at the top of the governing body requiring political support for their climb up the greasy career pole. Fifa has described FairSquare’s findings as “unfair”.Infantino was elected as Fifa president in 2016 on a platform of reform of its institutions but also that of increasing revenues to member associations, McGeehan said. “These two things are in absolute tension,” he added.View image in fullscreenInfantino reacts after winning the Fifa presidential election in Zurich in 2016.Photograph: Olivier Morin/AFP/Getty ImagesAs to why Infantino would want to cosy up to certain leaders, McGeehan suggested that part of the story was that Infantino appeared “smitten” with Trump as well as Saudi Arabia’s de factor ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, whose country will host the men’s World Cup in 2034.There were, though, also structural incentives that pushed Infantino to cleave close to leaders with power and money, he added.“The only year Fifa makes money is in a men’s World Cup year,” McGeehan said. “So every men’s World Cup year, you need to squeeze as much money as possible out of your host. The way that you do that is you stick as closely to them as possible, because you’re going to take all of the broadcasting money, all of the sponsorship money, and you’re going to pass all the cost on to them, all the costs for hosting Saudi 2034, all the costs for hosting US 2026. You’re going to ask them for tax exemptions. So the whole process cleaves the president closer to these people.View image in fullscreenA picture taken in a Saudi football fan tent in Riyadh, where a projector screening the 2018 World Cup match between Russia and Saudi Arabia showed Mohammed bin Salman, Infantino and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, seated together.Photograph: Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images“Infantino clearly likes [Trump and Prince Mohammed], and they probably recognise that he is a man with a big ego, but there’s a strategic reason he needs to do it because he needs their political support to deliver the revenue that entrenches his political support.”Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty International’s head of labour rights and sport, said that while there was lip service and even structures that suggested human rights considerations were at the core of Fifa’s decision-making, it appeared that “finance and power” remained the priority.McGeehan said he was concerned by what he viewed as Infantino’s “clear violation of the duty of neutrality of the Fifa code of ethics”. “There’s this incredible effort to sort of talk about transparency and accountability and all that,” he said, “but not change the way it’s actually done”.A Fifa spokesperson said that“only Fifa could be criticised for recognising those who want world peace”and “rather than be criticised for endorsing peace in a divided world, Fifa should be recognised for what it is – a global governing body that wants to make the future a brighter place”.This article was amended on 4 December 2025 to add Canada as a co-host of the 2026 World Cup alongside the US and Mexico.Explore more on these topicsFifaGianni InfantinoFootball politicsDonald TrumpMyanmarWorld Cup 2026World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Venture Global was among the “top donors” to Trump’s inauguration, donating $1m, according to theWall Street Journal.On his first day back in the White House, Trump issued an executive order rolling back regulations to favor fossil fuel production, including LNG export licences, while revoking existing climate and clean energy policies.Three days after Trump’s inauguration,Venture Globalissued an IPO – an initial public offering of shares, becoming a publicly traded company. The share prospectus highlighted theUnleashing America Energy executive order, and the following day,Sabel and Penderrang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.Despite the IPO being billed byReutersas a “blockbuster” event, the shares opened nearly 4% below the original asking price at just over $24 each, valuing the company at $58.2bn.While substantially belowthe $110bn Venture Global had hoped for, Sabel and Pender – who between them still owned more than 80% of the firm – pocketed a paper fortune of $24bn each, according toBloomberg.Senior executives’ share purchases since the IPO have been reported to the US Securities and Exchange Commissionand postedon its website.Since the company went public, there has been no significant additional share-buying by Sabel and Pender, aside from during one noteworthy week in March.On 6 March,Venture Globalannounced a $18bn expansion to its vast LNG export terminal in Plaquemines parish in Louisiana, situated on the Mississippi River just south of the New Orleans terminal.Among the high-profile guests to the event in Plaquemines parish were Chris Wright, Trump’s energy secretary, who has regulatory oversight of Venture Global’s operations, and Doug Burgum, secretary of the interior, who leads Trump’sNational Energy DominanceCouncil. Louisiana’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry, was also there.“I’m proud to be among you. I cannot overstate how important what you’re doing is and how aligned it is with the agenda of President Donald Trump,” said Wright. Burgum said Sabel and Pender were “amazing”, adding that there was “nothing more patriotic than an American worker that’s working to build energy dominance for this country”.On 10 March, Sabel and Pender went on a share-buying spree. The Venture Global share pricethat week was a relativelylow $9.37, falling after a disappointing fourth-quarter results.Every day for a week, the pair bought thousands or hundreds of thousands of shares. By the end of the week on 14 March, they had amassed just under 1.2m shares each, worth little under than $12m each.The only other share acquisitionsince the IPOwas 1,226 shares bought by Pender on 26 June.The following week on 19 March,Wright grantedan export license to another Venture Global LNG project, the Cameron Parish 2 (CP2) terminal, which Joe Biden had paused amid widespread protests from climate scientists, environmental groups and local fishers.CP2 has the capacity to produce28m tonnes of LNG a year, with the company now on track to be thelargest supplierof gas to Germany.“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are cutting the red tape around projects like CP2, unleashing our energy potential and ensuring the US can continue to meet growing energy demand for decades to come,” said Wright.“We are grateful for the Trump administration’s return to regular order and regulatory certainty that will allow us to further expand US LNG exports,” saidSabelon behalf of Venture Global.Individuals connected to Venture Global spent $860,000 on lobbying on Capitol Hill in 2024, and another $810,000 so far this year,according to Open Secrets,a non-profit campaign financial watchdog. The previous high was $70,000 in 2019.“Both the timing and amount invested raise serious red flags. It does require a subpoena and an investigation,” said Craig Holman, from Public Citizen, an expert on ethics, lobbying and campaign finance rules.All parties deny any wrongdoing.“Venture Global has regularly engaged with government officials on a bipartisan basis across four different presidential administrations. We strictly adhere to all laws, rules and regulations relating to our interactions with government officials, and support policymakers who recognize both the economic and environmental benefits of the US LNG industry,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.“Mr Sabel’s and Mr Pender’s acquisitions of shares fully complied with SEC rules and regulations and Venture Global’s Policy Concerning Trading in Company Securities. The timing of these acquisitions had no connection to any meeting or regulatory action. Any suggestion otherwise is false,” the spokesperson added.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt: “The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read. The president has never engaged, and will never engage, in conflicts of interest.”The Guardian’s requests for comment to Chris Wright at the department of energy, Doug Burgum at the interior department and the transition committee went unanswered.After Wright gave the green light to the export license, the company’s share price rose slightly over the next two days, before falling again.The company is currently valued at $19.6bn, with the share price at $7.90 on the New York stock exchange in mid-November – a 67% decrease since the IPO. Sabel and Pender continue to hold on to their collective 2.37m shares, currently worth almost $19m.The fall in stock prices comes despite recent long-term deals withGreeceandGermany,and the company’s close ties to the Trump administration.The global energy watchdog,the IEA, recently warned of oversupply, saying in its World Energy Outlook that “questions still linger about where all the new LNG will go”.Mike Wirth, the Chevron boss, said there was “more supply coming into the market than demand will be able to absorb. That probably results in lower spot prices.”Analystshave also warned that Venture Global’s business model is particularly exposed to market fluctuations because it signs fewer long-term contracts than some rivals. Thecompany recentlylost a billion-dollar arbitration case against BP.Explore more on these topicsOil and gas companiesTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That was up more than a third against last year and the highest since UBS started its research in 2015.Among them are the six grandchildren of the late Asian paint tycoon Goh Cheng Liang, who died in Singapore in August aged 98. Each grandchild inherited stakes in a public company worth more than $1bn, according to reports.Meanwhile, 196 “self-made” entrepreneurs became billionaires this year, with a collective wealth of $386.5bn, UBS said.Benjamin Cavalli, an executive at the bank, said the increase in billionaire inheritance was proof of a “multi-year wealth transfer that’s intensifying”, with this group expected to inherit at least $5.9tn in the next 15 years.Most of the inheritance is expected to come from the US, followed by India, France, Germany andSwitzerland. The UK ranked seventh, with $164bn in wealth expected to be passed down over the next 15 years.However, this could change as footloose billionaires move around the world, motivated by a better quality of life, geopolitical concerns and tax considerations, UBS found.Various European governments have facedcalls to introduce a wealth taxon the international elite this year. In Switzerland, where UBS estimates that $206bn will be inherited over the next 15 years, voters on Sunday overwhelmingly rejected a proposed 50% tax on inherited fortunes of £47m or more.In October, the French parliament voted against a proposed 2% tax on fortunes over €100m. Italy, which has attracted many wealthy residents thanks to its flat-tax regime for foreign income, has set out plans to increase the levy by 50% to €300,000 a year from 2026.Meanwhile, the UK, which distanced itself from reports of a formal wealth tax over the summer,officially ended non-dom status this yearunder which UK residents who declared their permanent home as overseas could avoid paying UK tax on foreign income and gains. It also announced plans for a council tax surcharge, labelled a“mansion tax”, on homes worth more than £2m in last week’s budget.Last year, Spain, Brazil, Germany and South Africa signed a motion at the G20 fora minimum 2% taxon the super-rich to reduce inequality and raise public funds. Forecasts on its impact vary, buta study by the leading French economist Gabriel Zucmanfound it could net up to $250bn in extra revenue.The four countries have called on other governments to support the campaign, saying a levy on the ultra-wealthy would complement negotiations on the taxation of the digital economy and continuing efforts to bring in aglobal minimum corporate tax of 15%for multinational businesses.This article was amended on 4 December 2025. Because of an error in the UBS report, an earlier version said there are 9,919 billionaires around the world this year. This figure has been corrected to 2,919.Explore more on these topicsThe super-richRich listsUBSBankingTax and spendingInequalitySwitzerlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The giant matchstick figure denotes movement and energy, risk and possibility. As Shapiro himself has said, it is supposed to “reconfigure depending on how you look at it”.It has the perfect home at the Kennedy Center, the vast cultural hub for ballet and opera, stage productions and concerts. And it resonates on a new level now as the venue prepares to host Friday’sWorld Cupdraw, at which the competing nations at next summer’s extravaganza in the United States, Canada and Mexico will discover their group opponents and knockout round pathways. Because from one angle it is plain that Blue is executing a raking pass. From another, it is a spectacular side-on volley. Squint a little and it is Ciao, the Italia 90 mascot.Quick GuideWenger backs France as 'super-favourite' for 2026 World CupShowArsène Wenger has described France as the “super-favourite” for next summer’s World Cup based on their enviable attacking options and major tournament knowhow.The former Arsenal manager, who is now Fifa’s chief of global football development, cannot see beyond his native France, who won the World Cup in 2018 and were the runners-up in 2022.The France manager, Didier Deschamps, can call upon an array of talent for his front line including Kylian Mbappé, Ousmane Dembélé, Hugo Ekitiké, Marcus Thuram, Désiré Doué, Bradley Barcola and Michael Olise.Wenger was asked to assess England’s chances and he essentially called them nearly men, though he accepted they too had the quality to win. However, it was not long before he found himself talking up France.“England will be one of the favourites,” Wenger said. “They are always nearly there to win it – semi-finals, quarter-final, final. They have to make the next step. They have the quality to do it.“I believe in Europe, trying to be as objective as possible, that France is the super-favourite just for one reason – it is the country which has more world-class strikers than any other country in the world. By having four knockout stages [in the expanded 48-team tournament] … to have such a bench with such good quality will make a difference.“There is one thing that is important in life is that when you know you can do it … when you have done something, it gives you something extra, the belief that you can do it. France has been in the last two finals so we know they can be there and they have the quality of the players.”David HytnerPhotograph: Michael Regan/FIFAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Kennedy was a champion of the arts and he was determined to have a national centre for them in the capital city, pushing hard to fund it. Two months after his assassination in 1963, it was decided by Congress that it should be named after him.Washington DC is steeped in grandeur and self-assurance. It honours the most revered American presidents in style. You do not have to walk far from the White House to marvel at the monument to George Washington; when it was completed in 1884, it was the tallest structure in the world. Or to find memorials to Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, to Theodore and Franklin D Roosevelt.View image in fullscreenUS president Donald Trump puts himself centre stage at the Club World Cup final, as bemused Chelsea players look on.Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty ImagesAs the gaze of the world prepares to fall on the Kennedy Center, to remember JFK, to feel a rush of excitement, it is his most recent successor in the Oval Office who has his elbows out, making a familiar dash for centre stage. It was confirmed on Tuesday thatDonald Trumpwould attend the draw and confirmation is the appropriate word. There was never the scintilla of doubt about the president clearing a window in his schedule; Trump is not a man to miss an opportunity.Nobody at Chelsea will forget Trump’s appearance on the podium for their Club World Cup trophy lift in New Jersey last summer and it even led to a question for the USA manager, Mauricio Pochettino. Would he allow Trump to get in on the celebrations in the unlikely event of a US World Cup win?“For sure, I will give him the trophy and he can lift it … no problem for me,” Pochettino said. “Maybe he’s not a soccer person, and he was a little bit in a situation [at the Club World Cup] where he didn’t know what to do, but it was funny. That is America.”Fifa had originally planned to stage the draw in Las Vegas – as it did for the 1994 World Cup, when the US were the lone hosts. As an aside, Bill Clinton, the president at the time, did not attend. But Trump pushed for Washington, even though it is not among the 16 host cities.Trump has made another move. One of the musical acts on Friday will be the Village People and they will play their disco classic YMCA – which Trump has used as an anthem for his Make America Great Again rallies. The group performed at Trump’s inauguration event for his second presidency.Revealed: Myanmar junta ‘crony’ given key role behind Fifa peace prizeRead moreThenthere is the Fifa peace prize, the brainchild of the organisation’s president, Gianni Infantino, who is a devoted member of the court of Trump. When the latter, to use the football parlance, was “robbed of” the Nobel peace prize by María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan politician, Infantino did what every good friend of a world leader ought to do – he created an alternative prize. There are a growing number of cynics who suggest that Trump is poised to collect it.If and when that happens, it would not change a simple truth: the draw is not about Trump. It is about firing the starting gun on the most important tournament in football, the pinnacle. It is about the hopes and dreams of every participant in every team; every fan. They range from those connected to the Big Four nations, as Spain, Argentina, France and England (in that order of seeding) have come to be known. They will be placed in different quadrants to ensure they do not meet before the semi-finals, assuming they win their groups and progress.Quick GuideWorld Cup 2026 draw: pots and playoffsShowPot 1:Canada (world ranking 27), Mexico (15), USA (14); Spain (1), Argentina (2), France (3), England (4), Brazil (5), Portugal (6), Netherlands (7), Belgium (8), Germany (9).Pot 2:Croatia (10), Morocco (11), Colombia (13), Uruguay (16), Switzerland (17), Japan (18), Senegal (19), Iran (20), South Korea (22), Ecuador (23), Austria (24), Australia (26).Pot 3:Norway (29), Panama (30), Egypt (34), Algeria (35), Scotland (36), Paraguay (39), Tunisia (40), Côte d’Ivoire (42), Uzbekistan (50), Qatar (51), Saudi Arabia (60), South Africa (61).Pot 4:Jordan (66), Cape Verde (68), Ghana (72), Curaçao (82), Haiti (84), New Zealand (86); four European playoff teams, two intercontinental playoff teams.European playoffs:Path AWales (32) v Bosnia (71), Italy (12) v Northern Ireland (69)Path BUkraine (28) v Sweden (43), Poland (31) v Albania (63)Path CSlovakia (45) v Kosovo (80), Turkey (25) v Romania (47)Path DCzechia (44) v Rep of Ire (59), Denmark (21) v N Macedonia (65)Intercontinental playoffs:DR Congo (56) v New Caledonia (149) or Jamaica (70)Iraq (58) v Bolivia (76) or Suriname (123).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.And they get to the New Four. Uzbekistan, Jordan, Cape Verde and Curaçao (in that order of seeding) will play at their first World Cup. The number of debutants will swell if any of Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Suriname and New Caledonia emerge from the playoffs next March. The ties will account for the final six places in the expanded 48-team tournament.It can sound corny when players and managers talk about fulfilling childhood dreams at the World Cup. But the emotion during qualification has been real. The scenes, for example, when Scotland secured their first spot at a finals since France 98 with theepic Hampden Park victoryover Denmark will live for ever. And how about when Cape Verde got there with the home win over Eswatini? Africa had five places for Qatar 22. They now have a guaranteed nine. It will be 10 if the Democratic Republic of the Congo win their playoff final against New Caledonia or Jamaica.View image in fullscreenThe official balls for the World Cup draw are seen on stage at the Kennedy Center.Photograph: Michael Regan/Fifa/Getty ImagesFifa has assigned every group game to a stadium but will wait until Saturday before it says which teams play in each game. It will also reveal the kick-off times in what will have the feel of a follow-up ceremony, beginning at 5pm GMT (noon EST). After Friday’s draw, which also starts at 5pm GMT, teams will at least have either/or answers for where they play and will know their general region. It will mark the start of an arms race for training bases, long-researched options suddenly whittled down.In Washington on Thursday, it was hard to see any evidence that the draw was about to take place. Or to find many locals aware of it. But it will be supersized because that is how things are over here – and not just the security for Trump.Heidi Klum and Kevin Hart will host the show. Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger will perform. Rio Ferdinand and Samantha Johnson are the draw hosts. Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Shaquille O’Neal and Aaron Judge – legends of the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB – are the draw assistants. Brady and Gretzky were in Trump’s VIP suite at the Club World Cup final.It will be easy for supporters of a certain age to cast their minds back to USA 94. The Roberto Baggio penalty miss. The Diana Ross penalty miss. The Republic of Ireland storming to the last 16. USA reaching the last 16. No England.

Norway’s Adrian Smiseth Sejersted finished third. The finish line was moved up the hill – and just barely visible by fans in the stands – due to a lack of snow to properly place the safety netting.Mikaela Shiffrin claims another slalom victory to stay perfect in Olympic seasonRead moreThe 11th race on the course, Odermatt said he was able to attack the steeper sections and carry enough speed through the flatter part.“For me, a perfect race,” Odermatt said.These days, when isn’t it a perfect race for him?Odermatt has won the last two overall World Cup downhill titles. He’s been consistent in the event and hasn’t finished outside of the top seven in a World Cup downhill race since 2023. This was his fifth World Cup downhill win.Odermatt also started the World Cup super-G season with a Thanksgiving win at nearby Copper Mountain.“How do you catch him? I don’t know,” Cochran-Siegle said of Odermatt, who’s won the last four overall World Cup crowns. “I think the rest of the world’s still trying to figure that out.”Cochran-Siegle spent some time in the leader’s box after a smooth run. He’s the first American to be on a World Cup downhill podium in Beaver Creek since Steven Nyman finished third in 2014. The last American racer to win a World Cup downhill at Beaver Creek was Bode Miller in 2011.“It’s cool to stand among those legends,” said Cochran-Siegle, a silver medalist in the super-G at the 2022 Beijing Games.View image in fullscreenSwitzerland's Marco Odermatt, left, celebrates with second-place finisher Ryan Cochran-Siegle, center, and third-place finisher Adrian Smiseth Sejersted after Thursday’s downhill.Photograph: John Locher/APCochran-Siegle, 32, is the newest standard-bearer of one of American skiing’s most enduring families. The son of 1972 Olympic slalom champion Barbara Cochran, he grew up on the family’s small ski area outside Burlington, Vermont, where generations of Cochrans have learned the sport. He began his career as a promising giant slalom specialist before shifting his focus to the speed events, steadily carving out a place on the World Cup circuit.Odermatt wins super-G at Copper Mountain as Kilde’s return leaves Shiffrin in tearsRead moreHis path has also been shaped by resilience. Cochran-Siegle has endured a series of serious setbacks – including a major knee injury that required multiple surgeries and a broken neck that threatened to end his career – only to return stronger each time. He claimed his first World Cup victory in 2020 in his 101st start andstunned the field in the Olympic super-Gthree years ago.Over recent seasons he has become one of the tour’s more consistent performers in downhill and super-G, recording 28 top-10 finishes across the two disciplines.Sejersted notched his first World Cup podium in the downhill. He has two other podium finishes in super-G.His Norwegian teammate, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, finished in 11th place as he took another big step in his return from a serious crash.This was Kilde’s first downhill race sincehis crash in January 2024. Kilde underwent surgery for a severe cut and nerve damage in his right calf and two torn ligaments in his shoulder.“I’m super happy with how I could control things today,” said Kilde, who alsocompeted in the super-G on Thanksgiving. “I can’t be more satisfied with the feeling that I had in the finish.”Rok Aznoh of Slovenia had a scary crash near the end of the race. He was taken to the hospital to evaluate head and knee injuries.Earlier in the day, organizers announced the super-G race would be moved to Friday with the weather forecast not looking favorable for Saturday.

Or the 1990 appearance by the US men? Or the 1991 World Cup win by the US women?), Alan Rothenberg was a key player.Rothenberg came up as a lawyer under Jack Kent Cooke, owner of Washington’s NFL team, the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA, the LA Kings of the NHL, and – crucially, the Los Angeles Wolves of the North American Soccer League (NASL), a team that started life fielding mostly players from Wolverhampton Wanderers.From there, Rothenberg was named commissioner of soccer at the 1984 LA Olympics, then headed up the US committee that ran the 1994 World Cup, while also serving as US Soccer president from 1990 through 1998. His work with Fifa to host the World Cup in 1994 is directly responsible for the creation of Major League Soccer (MLS), whose championship trophy bore his name from the league’s founding in 1996 until 2007.Next year, Rothenberg will release a new book.The Big Bounce: The Surge That Shaped the Future of US Socceris a chronicle of his time in positions of power as soccer grew in popularity in the United States. He spoke with the Guardian about his history in the game, the influence of big business on sports, why Americans have gravitated to soccer, and how Fifa’s efforts at political influence have changed over time.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.–--What are you anticipating for this World Cup draw?It’s gonna be interesting. Let me put it that way. I take credit for a lot of things that we did in ‘94 that had never been done before, and one of those was turning the draw into a big event that wasn’t just deciding which groups would exist. We had a lot going on, we were in Las Vegas. DC is different. And I think we all know why it ended up in DC. And I also think it means there’ll be a teeny bit of a political overload on it. [In 1994] we we had a video message from President Clinton, but it was just a small portion of the event. Obviously both President Trump and Gianni Infantino made this a very personal project of theirs, and so they’re going to be probably more prominent than what we’re accustomed to seeing. But it’s going to be great at the end of the day.I noted this passage from your book: “I was a sports lawyer before there were sports lawyers. In those days … the business side of sports was run by ex-jocks. They played, they coached, and then they became general managers. They knew the sport. But as the dollar signs started to pick up and contracts grew more complicated, it changed dramatically.” Is there any part of you that wonders if it’s swung too far the other way? Do you wonder if business interests have an outsized influence on the way sports are run these days?[The business of sports] is where it is because of a free market economy, and a free market for the fanbases. If fans were really upset and stopped going to games, stopped watching it on television, it would change. But it’s going the other way.It’s the case for some teams, though. I was just looking at crowd shots at a New Orleans Pelicans game where it looks like there’s like 400 people. How do you square the national interest in sports that you point out with images like that in local markets where teamsare clearly not connecting with their fans, for one reason or another?I think local [interest] still dominates. As things get toward final competition, playoffs, championships, it becomes more national. We just had a great World Series. But on a day-to-day basis, the local Dodgers TV package is way more fruitful to them than their participation in the national package. They have 162 games, so it’s a lot of product, a lot of inventory, but that’s true in most [leagues]. You mentioned the Pelicans – their fans can’t stand the fact that the team is really pathetic, so they’re not going [to the games]. On the other hand, I will bet you anything when it gets to the NBA Finals, and it’s Oklahoma City, who people wouldn’t even know about otherwise, those people in New Orleans who are basketball fans will be watching it.Do you think that soccer is different from that sort of dynamic you’re describing? I think a lot of people are attracted to global club soccer because very often those teams were community assets first, and then they became businesses later. And that creates this dynamic among the fans where they’re dedicated no matter what. What do you think that says about what fans want out of soccer in the United States?I think there’s probably more of an emotional connection between soccer fans and their team than in most other sports. I mean, I don’t know how any other sport, and frankly, in any other country, would have had the experience that went on with the Premier League when the Super League was proposed. It was basically a fan revolt that got everybody to, at least temporarily, back off.Lamar Huntsaid that you have to build up local teams and have local fans, and that’s going to be the backbone of the growth of the sport. I think that’s true. I mean, I look at the phenomenon LAFC have created out of nothing. They set that group out in the south end of the stadium, it’s as if they transported them from Brazil or from England. You don’t really see that in other sports.View image in fullscreen‘LAFC fans look like they were transported from Brazil or England. You don’t really see that in other sports.’Photograph: Marcio José Sánchez/APHow would you describe the American soccer audience to someone from another country, where soccer is the No 1 sport and always has been?I think that there’s a huge appreciation for the sport and a huge knowledge base for the sport, and that’s good news, and it’s also challenging news. The good news is there’s a really huge number of true soccer fans in this country, and that’s the core, the fanbase for MLS, for NWSL and all the USL teams. The challenging part is the fans are so sophisticated that they follow teams in Europe. I mean, it’s great for the sport, but the challenge is that we’re trying to grow the support for the American teams, and I think that’s where 2026 is going to help a lot. I just think that there’s going to be an exponential growth of soccer fans, which is going to mean more television, more revenue, which means MLS can be more competitive in the international market. That plus their change to the international calendar, I think you’re going to see more top players still in their prime coming into MLS, which in turn, I think will again create greater audiences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These were issues in 1994. How did you get over them?Soccer fans, I think, are really unique. They find their way. People have talked about some of the immigration issues making people reluctant to come. I think those soccer fans will find their way over here no matter what. And similarly, frankly, to the extent there isn’t or wasn’t public transportation, it was readily available. I think each city is going to do a good job of putting out pamphlets and brochures and things so that visitors know their way. These cities really rely on the fact that people are going to go to restaurants, bars and museums, and so it’s going to be a big economic boost to the cities, and they’re going to do everything they can to inform fans what the options are. We really did not experience any kind of significant issue.Do you feel that dynamic also applies to ticket prices? People are spending thousands on tickets to these games, and others can’t go because of how dynamic pricing has impacted the cost. Fifa has a responsibility to create revenue for their member associations, but do they also have a responsibility to allow fans to affordably access this tournament that’s meant to be so transformative?I equate it to a Taylor Swift tour. Somehow people are able to pay the price and find their way, in some cases, to remote venues. So where there’s a will, there’s a way, and especially in soccer fans, there’s a will.[Dynamic pricing] is the reality of today. With Taylor Swift, you’ve got young people somehow coming up with several thousand to go to a concert. And if they didn’t have dynamic pricing, it would still be the same, because everybody would go to the after-market, and they’re going to end up paying what the market price is. It’s today’s world. And yes, it does mean that a lot of middle-class, working people and their families are priced out. I don’t mean to sound unsympathetic, but it’s the free market at work.View image in fullscreenThe World Cup opening ceremony in 1994. “Political leaders were supportive, but didn’t try to insert themselves,” says Rothenberg.Photograph: Chris Wilkins/AFP/Getty ImagesThe good news, at least, is Fifa has been insistent on making sure that every host city has a major fan festival. In some ways, that’s as good or a better experience. It’s a festival, and you’re there with thousands of people, jam packed. So you don’t see the game live, but you got it on a massive screen, so you probably actually see the game better than if you were at the stadium.You mentioned before that the 1994 opening ceremony was not overly political, but Fifa has clearly been way more willing to engage politically around World Cups than they have been in the past. Do you agree with that approach?I don’t think it’s necessary. Infantino, for each of the World Cups since he’s been president, has sort of made himself a part of the government in power. It doesn’t hurt, because you want good cooperation, but I don’t think it’s necessary. I mean, we had first George HW Bush and then Bill Clinton in 1994 and they were fine. They were supportive. They were, you know, we went to them when we needed something, and it was, frankly, pretty infrequent, and they gave moral support. We didn’t try to get them to be engaged in the operation, and they didn’t try to insert themselves. I think you just have a different dynamic, both in Infantino and in President Trump. It’s unusual. It’s good and it’s bad. It’s good in the sense that it’s often great to have your head of state taking a personal interest in the event. He’s going to be darn sure that it works. Does it put a political overhang on the tournament, which probably upsets a lot of fans? Yeah.But again, as a practical matter, you’ve got to do things locally. Here we got the LA Olympics coming, and the head of that is Casey Wasserman, part of a longstanding, influential Democratic family. He went back to meet with Trump to get government support for the Olympics. A lot of people here were saying “Well, what a hypocrite.” Come on. He’s got a job to do. His job is to have a successful Olympics, and it’d be awfully nice to make sure you got a great relationship with your government. I love your media, but the media likes good stories, and so they’ll grab anything they can.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Business of soccerWorld CupMLSinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Giants need him to start acting like a quarterbackThe rookie plays like a linebacker at quarterback. His reckless style is costing his teammates and coaches as well as himselfOliver ConnollyThu 4 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 08.32 ESTShareJaxson Dart wants you to know something:this is real football. It’s not soccer or flag. It’s tackle football, the kind where quarterbacks go airborne. Aftertaking the latestin a growing compilation of bone-crushing hits, Dart brushed himself off and delivered a post-game sermon on toughness. “We’re not playing soccer,” he said. “You’re going to get hit. Things happen.”Yet these “things” continue to happen to Dart at an alarming rate. In his eight NFL starts, he has absorbed as many unnecessary hits as any rookie quarterback in recent memory. On Monday night, Darttook another heavy hitnear the sideline in the first quarter of the Giants’ 33-15 loss to the Patriots. Dart scrambled out of the pocket on second-and-13 and ran for a first down. As he approached the sideline, Dart could have stepped out and gained fewer yards while still moving the chains. Instead, he braced, lowered his shoulder andwas sent soaring through the airby Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss.The hit left Peyton Manning, covering the game alongside his brother Eli, speechless. “Obviously, he told me he would run out of bounds if he was near the sideline,” Eli Manning said. “He lied to me.”Dart’s recklessness has become the defining tension of his young career. He plays like a linebacker in a quarterback’s body. There is an old-school charm to his style, a kind of throwback bravado that a fanbase quickly falls in love with. Coaches love it, too, until they remember their job security depends on the quarterback remaining conscious.In another hapless Giants season, Dart has been one of the few sources of promise. His dynamism has brought a jolt to an otherwise moribund offense. And that’s what a team expects when they trade up to draft a quarterback in the first round. But the physical cost has been too steep.It’s not just the rah-rah coaches or macho fans who love his yards-at-all-costs attitude, either. There is a segment of former players who see Dart’s recklessness as laudable, as a young quarterback on a struggling team fighting for everything. “I don’t know when it became OK for us to tell a player to be less competitive,” ESPN’s Dan Orlovsky said in the aftermath of Dart’s latest hit.But Orlovsky is wrong. A quarterback refusing to embrace contact is not weakness. It’s about understanding the stakes, acknowledging that for his team to have a chance, he needs to stay upright.In the NFL’s season of meh, even the battered 49ers are Super Bowl contendersRead moreDart’s style is dangerous. It’s a danger to himself, his long-term health and the future of the Giants. There’s a sense that if a quarterback plays with the mindset of the other 21 players on the field, the guys in his huddle will rally around him. But, more than anything, the rest of the locker room want him on the field. They have mortgages to pay, and contracts to earn. Their own careers – the hitstheytake and the sacrifices they make – rest on the starting quarterback being fit.Toughness in a quarterback is admirable, but availability is priceless. Too often this season, Dart has missed snaps and games due to taking unnecessary punishment. He hasn’t just absorbed hits,he’s dished them out.We know more than ever about the consequences of blows to the head. The league has madesignificant stridesin reducing the overall volume of concussions during games. Repetitive head impacts are baked into the sport, with long-term consequences likeChronic Traumatic Encephalopathy(CTE) an endemic part of the game. In the past year alone, nine former and current NFL players under the age of 48 have died, according toThe Nation. Of those nine, seven were the result of suicide or undisclosed reasons. We can never say for sure that CTE led to all seven of those deaths, but they hint at the long-term damage repetitive head impacts can cause, let alone the immediate and long-lasting effects of sustaining a single concussion or multiple concussive blows within weeks.But Dart has continually scoffed at the idea that he should change his style. “I watch quarterbacks who play kinda like me around the league,” Dart said after the Patriots game. “I watch how Josh Allen plays, I watch how Patrick Mahomes plays. They take hits, too. I’m not an anomaly here.”Every quarterback takes hits. But there’s a difference between taking them and chasing them.The Elliss hit did not trigger the concussion protocol. But it’s a place Dart has found himself too frequently in his young career. Allen has sustainedone documentedhead injury during his career. In college and the pros, Mahomes has hadthree documented concussionsin 12 years. Dart has already been in the league’s concussion protocolfour timesin his rookie season, including preseason. A hit in Chicago ruled him out for two weeks with a concussion, his first documented case in the NFL.For Dart, this is nothing new. It’s how he’s always played. During the pre-draft cycle, the quarterback sat down with Jon Gruden for his showThe QB Class. Gruden, infatuated with Dart’s potential, treated him like a parent scolding a toddler. “You’re a reckless son of a bitch,” Gruden said. “You’re kind of like Evel Knievel.” Dart grinned, because of course he did. He thought it was a compliment.View image in fullscreenJaxson Dart has been on the receiving end of some heavy hits this season.Photograph: Steven Senne/APBut Gruden kept hammering the point. You won’t go out of bounds, he said. You won’t slide. Prophetically, Gruden told Dart: “You’re going to be in that concussion protocol tent, and I’m gonna be holding the gameplan like, ‘Where the hell is Dart at?’” Dart was finally pushed to admit the truth: It’s not smart.Then came the tell: “Any time I get hit, I want to fall two yards forward,” he said.That’s great in college, where a quarterback may start for one or two years before they advance to theNFL. But in the pros, that mindset for a quarterback is selfish. Their career is supposed to be long. The future of the franchise – from ownership, to players, to coaches and everyone in the building – rests on the arm of the quarterback. The players are also bigger, faster and stronger. Gaps close quicker. Players hit harder. And defenders’ careers are staked on blasting the opposing quarterback, no matter the short or long-term consequences. It is a merciless profession.But Dart hasn’t shown any willingness to change. Even in his own teammates’ comments, there is a degree of resignation. “That’s just how he is. We’re just going to have to keep talking to him,” Giants guard Jon Runyan said. “Maybe he’ll listen to us one of these days.”It’s time for the Giants to protect Dart from himself. If that’s sitting him until he’s ready to take care of himself, then so be it.So far, they have lived with the consequences. The organization drafted Dart as a lifeline for head coach Brian Daboll, a so-called quarterback whisperer who was running out of time and quarterbacks. For a time, the bet looked shrewd. Once installed as the starter, Dart brought renewed verve to the offense. Daboll leaned into the quarterback’s reckless ways, unable or unwilling to separate what Dartcoulddo from what heshoulddo. Daboll’s job was on the line, and so he featured Dart’s athleticism as a runner, offering up more opportunities for him to take hits in the open field. Designed quarterback runs became the building block of the offense. In just seven starts under Daboll, Dart logged 25 designed carries, more than any quarterback in the league. Along with fellow rookie Cam Skattebo, putting their bodies on the line for an extra yard became part of the team’s lunch pail mantra.But the approach faltered. Daboll was fired after the Giants started the season 2-8. He was relieved in part because he failedto protect the young quarterback. Both because he didn’t have his best quarterback on the field in key spots, and because the Giants recognize the future of the franchise rests on the health and development of their rookie. If he’s hurt, he cannot develop. And his injury record will already raise questions about his viability as a long-term starter.Daboll was already on thin ice. Earlier in the season, he wandered into the blue tent during one of Dart’s concussion evaluations, before getting into ananimated discussionwith the team’s doctor on the sideline. It was coaching desperation masquerading as concern, which earned him a$100,000 fineand the franchise an additional $200,000 penalty. In Daboll’s final game in charge, the bill for the season came due: Dart hit his head against the turf and was removed from the game after his fourth concussion evaluation of the season.Sprinkle in ankle and hamstring injuries, and you have a young quarterback taking punishment at a scary rate.In his first start under interim coach Mike Kafka, Dart had zero designed rushing attempts. It’s a clear effort from the team to force Dart to try to alter his style in the final weeks of the season. Yet on a rushing attempt out of the coach’s control, Dart refused to give up on a play when the going was good.Dart may insist that this is who he’s always been. Fine. But the NFL is not high school or college football. The stakes are too high, the punishment too severe. It’s not a place where quarterbacks can out-tough linebackers or run through a safety’s face during a meaningless blowout.The best quarterbacks develop a sixth sense for when the extra yard is worth the bruise and when it’s not. But right now, Dart’s impulse is off. He plays as if pain is the point. At times, it’s thrilling. It’s also unsustainable.“We’re not playing soccer out here,” he said. No, he’s not. But this is the NFL, where the bravest thing a quarterback can sometimes do is step out of bounds and live to play another down.Explore more on these topicsNew York GiantsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Real Madrid are purring againSid LoweThu 4 Dec 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 13.26 ESTShareKylian Mbappé returned to the Cathedral where he experienced his epiphany in 2024, his resurrection born after hitting rock bottom, and delivered something like salvation. Exactly a year since he missed a penalty there, a bad moment he later said was a good one, the Frenchman was back at San Mamés on Wednesday night.Last time, he missed a second penalty in a week, an awakening accompanying failure; this time, he scored two goals in an hour and set up another, light let in through the dark again. As the Frenchman headed off the pitch early,Madrid 3-0 up against AthleticBilbao with 15 minutes left, he embraced Xabi Alonso, who is still his manager.By the time Madrid got to bed in their hotel on Tuesday, showing just how serious they were by travelling to Bilbao the day before,Barcelona had beaten Atletico Madrid 3-1in the first of two games brought forward a month to accommodate the Super Cupin Saudi Arabia, successfully overshadowing the Copa del Rey and shunting the best league meetings of the season into midweek, and leaving Madrid four points behind. Leaving Alonso on the edge too, or so it goes.Pablo Fornals emerges as Betis’s ‘New King’ in emotional Sevilla derby win | Sid LoweRead moreLast year Hansi Flick called it “Shit November”, but Barcelona overcame it. This year, it was Madrid’s turn. WhenReal won the clásico at the end of October, Alonso’s side moved five points clear at the top of the table, a lead that didn’t look like was going to be relinquished any time soon. They had actually won a big game after a year of losing all of them, and there was a superiority about them, a sense of solidarity if not yet a system exactly. In short, a shift. Because Barcelona were in bits. It was only 2-1 but WojciechSzczesny made nine saves in Barça’s goal.Since then, Barcelona have won five in a row. Perhaps it was not always that brilliant andthe beating at Stamford Bridgeappeared to deliver a painful truth, but the results came and Pedri and Raphinha both returned on Tuesday night. Against Atlético they really did look like Barcelona again. Madrid, meanwhile, had been heading in the other direction, or more accurately not really heading in any direction at all. “In the future we’re going to need a lot of what we did today,” Alonso said the evening of the clásico but mostly they didn’t have anything much. And with the fixture list shifted to allow them to fit the NFL into the Santiago Bernabéu, they went away three times in a row – and didn’t win any of them.View image in fullscreenAgainst Atléti on Tuesday, Pedri made his first start for Barcelona since being sent off in October’s clásico.Photograph: Europa Press Sports/Europa Press/Getty ImagesAt Rayo, Elche and Girona, Madrid drew and were mostly dreadful, although in Girona they had at least forced chances, been a little more proactive. The high press Alonso wanted was absent, the football in the middle too, the control and solidity simply not there, and as for the attitude and application: forget it. Alonso’s system, seemingly emerging in the United States for the Club World Cup and, slowly, in the opening weeks of the season just wasn’t there (yet). Before heading off to Bilbao, Alonso was asked what his team was playing at. “Football,” he replied, butwhatfootball,how? And was it the type of football his footballers play? Here was a coach that was counter cultural.As bad was what was happening below the surface – and, importantly, on the surface too, tensions building and barely hidden. The lasting image of the clásico, wouldn’t so much be the goals they scored as Vinícius’ reaction at being removed, mouthing off as he went marching off.His “apology” didn’t help either,verypointedly saying sorry to everyone except his coach. There was no public backing of the manager, no reinforcing of his authority, the presidential view that Vinícius just shouldn’t have been taken off in the first place. Instead, Alonso was chipped away at, familiar hounds released. Beforeplaying Olympiakos in Athens, there had been conversations internally, an attempt to release the tension. And before Bilbao too. This needed fixing. “Yes, I have spoken to the president again: the conversations are positive,” Alonso said. “We talk about turning the results around.”Trent Alexander-Arnold ruled out for months in blow to World Cup hopesRead moreWhile focus did shift a little towards the players, the ultimate “fix” hung heavy: it always does at a club where a ‘crisis’ is never more than a couple of defeats away, and there’s always someone else who can coach. Defeats? Draws will do. Madrid arrived four points behind, anine-pointswing since the clásico. Sure, they had a game in hand, but it was Athletic, where they were beaten last season. And if they hadn’t won in Vallecas, the Martínez Valero and Montilivi how were they going to win here at San Mamés, a place of community, traditional and liturgy so revered, so powerful, they call it the Cathedral?Like this. Their way, Madrid’s way, Alonso adapting to his players. After the victory in Greece, José Luis Mendilibar, the Olympiakos manager, had said that Vinícius and Mbappé don’t run back, which leaves them fresh to attack – and, against his high line Madrid had certainly attacked, streaming into the spaces as Mbappé scored four. Madrid had also conceded three. If Mendilibar’s analysis could be conceived as criticism, it could also be seen as a suggestion, and at San Mamés it was similar.“Athletic play with a high line and there are more spaces, it’s more complicated for us against Girona or Elche; we have to improve against low blocks,” Thibaut Courtois admitted. “We said that we have to stop talking and start acting. If you don’t play at 100% you can be beaten easily.”Athletic, struggling all season, were poor, lacking goals and the intensity that is supposed to come as standard: wide open and weak, oddly docile. Madrid had created three opportunities inside five minutes, Athletic overrun, and when Ernesto Valverde’s side did create a couple of chances, they were stopped by Courtois, for whom miracles come as standard.If that urges caution, if that won’t always be so easy as it was in Bilbao and Athens and any conclusions remain tentative, to be tested again when Manchester City come next week, this mattered. This was Madrid’s best performance of the season, releasing the tension in the short term. It felt like a step in the right direction, something a little more than just stemming the bleeding, although that was the immediate concern: some accommodation found, Alonso adapting more to the players perhaps than they had to him. It felt significant, if only as a staging of some sort rapprochement, even if it washad-to-be donerather than heartfelt, when Vinícius went off and embraced the manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arda Güler was left out, Vinícius and Mbappé were up front, Jude Bellingham part of a muscular midfielder rather than No 10, and Madrid were direct. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s diagonals were at the heart of it, the origin of the first two goals and much more. El País called his right foot “angelic.” Alas, he wassoon injured again, and the Englishman is now expected to be out for at least two months.If there is a question of the collective functioning against the individual and a dependency on Mbappé – and there is – it is hard to avoid, even if you want to. But even in the bad moments, the forward has been extraordinary.And it all started here. When he missed a penalty at San Mamés last seasonoff the back of missing one at Anfield, something shifted. Mbappé later admitted that he had“hit rock bottom”, which in truth seemed a bit dramatic, but he insisted it was good for him. It came as a realisation, making him see that he had to shake off his timidity, play with personality. He arrived at San Mamés on 4 December 2024 having scored 10 goals in 20 games, the kind of ‘crisis’ most players would kill for. He arrived at San Mamés on 3 December 2025 having scored 57 in 58 since. He departed again having scored 59 in 59.We must look beyond the brute numbers to really appreciate Haaland’s legend | Jonathan LiewRead moreMbappé’s goals here were extraordinary goals too. For the first, he controlled Alexander-Arnold’s long diagonal, an impeccable first touch taking him to the right while Iñigo Lekue slid by and out of shot on the left. Space opening, he ran from near the halfway line and produced a superb shot from the edge of the area. For the second he did what he does so often and so well, albeit a little further than normal, scoring from outside the area again. Opening his body out as if going to the far post, just enough for Unai Simón to take a step he shouldn’t, a turn of the ankle and Mbappé instead bent it in at the near post. Between those, he had nodded a clipped Alexander-Arnold cross back for Eduardo Camavinga to head in.Five kilos lighter than he was last season, Mbappé already has 25 goals and four assists in this campaign. He has 55 in 2025, four off Cristiano Ronaldo’s club record with a month to go. He has more than Vinícius, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Valverde and Güler put together over the last 12 months and almost 60% of Madrid’s goals this season. “Super Mbappé and at last a good Madrid,” ran the cover of Marca. Inside they claimed “Mbappé is Cristiano (and) Ronaldo,” and there was something about the Brazilian’s one-man stampedes in that first goal; as if, as Jorge Valdano liked to put it, the whole herd is attacking. “Infinite”, he had “put out the fire”, AS’s cover said.“No one has his acceleration, his runs: he’s unstoppable,” Courtois said. “During games I say to myself: how lucky I am to have him on my side.”PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona1525372Real Madrid1519363Villarreal1416324Atletico Madrid1514315Real Betis148246Espanyol142247Getafe14-2208Athletic Bilbao15-6209Rayo Vallecano14-21710Real Sociedad14-21611Elche14-21612Celta Vigo14-31613Sevilla14-41614Alaves14-31515Valencia14-91416Mallorca14-71317Osasuna14-61218Girona14-131219Levante14-10920Oviedo14-159Explore more on these topicsReal MadridKylian MbappéLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both he and his teammate,Oscar Piastri, insisted they had not yet discussed the potential use of orders for the decisive grand prix.Norris goes into the 24th and final race of the season as favourite but still in a close, high-pressure fight withRed Bull’s Max Verstappenand Piastri, enjoying a 12-point lead on Verstappen and 16 on Piastri. Norris will take his first title if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri would need to win and have Norris finish sixth or lower.Win in Abu Dhabi and hope for chaos: how Oscar Piastri can still win the F1 world titleRead moreThe question of team orders and McLaren’s attempts to be scrupulously fair to both drivers by allowing them to race has been a major point of debate all season. However, when asked about the possibility of team orders being implemented for Piastri to cede to Norris should Verstappen otherwise be able to win, the British driver insisted he believed it would not be fair to ask his teammate to do so.“No, not been discussed,” he said. “Honestly, I would love it. But I don’t think I would ask it. It’s up to Oscar if he would allow it. I don’t think it’s necessarily down to me. It’s the same if it’s the other way around.“Would I be willing to or not? Personally, I think I would, just because I feel like I’m always like that and that’s just how I am. But it’s not really up to me and I’m not going to ask it. I don’t want to ask it because I don’t think it’s necessarily a fair question. If that’s how it ends and Max wins, then, well, that’s it. Congrats to him and I look forward to next year.”The team’s position has always been that they would let their driver’s race freely while both were still in the title fight. However, they have intervened in order to maintain pre-agreed arrangements. At Monza, McLaren hadPiastri cede a place to Norris, which the British driver lost through a slow pit stop.After the last round in Qatar the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, said the team would discuss relevant scenarios so all parties were clear going into the final round. There is no doubt McLaren want to secure their first world championship since 2008,when Lewis Hamilton won.The most likely scenario where Piastri might be required to give way to his teammate would be if Verstappen was leading with Piastri third and Norris fourth and the pair switching would ensure the British driver secured the title.With the three title protagonists lined up together in the press conference at the Yas Marina circuit on Thursday, sat beside the trophy one of them will win on Sunday night, Piastri added that he had yet to be apprised of the team’s expected position.View image in fullscreenThe three title protagonists Max Verstappen, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri alongside the trophy one of them will lift on Sunday.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images“It’s not something we’ve discussed,” he said. “Until I know what’s expected, I don’t really have an answer.”Aware of the importance of the weekend, McLaren cancelled Norris’s usual session of speaking to the British media, which takes place on the Thursday before every race, with the 26-year-old doubtless happy to not have to answer more questions about his title chances. However, in the official press conference he did address what it would mean to him to win it.“This has been my whole life, it’s everything I’ve worked towards my whole life, so it would mean the world to me, it would mean the world to everyone that’s supported and pushed me for the 16 years of my life,” he said. “It would mean everything. It would mean my life until now has been a success and I’ve accomplished that dream I had when I was a kid.”Mercedes’ George Russell, meanwhile, said it would be “unacceptable” to ask Piastri to move aside and sacrifice his own title ambitions even if that meant Verstappen won the title.“I don’t think it’s acceptable or reasonable to ask a driver who’s also in a shot of a championship in the very last race to move over for your teammate,” Russell said. “They both need to be given a shot and if they lose out because of it, you just need to say the other guy did a better job and that’s racing.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneLando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, questions about their solidity remain because West Ham had rarely threatened until their hosts switched off and were punished.The Irving corner came when Leny Yoro, on as a substitute after being dropped, missed a clearing header. Then Bowen was left unmarked by Bruno Fernandes. As Bowen said: “Not many people pick me up in the air. I’m 5ft 9in or something like that, so not the tallest.”They were two material errors that can augur sourly for United and which left Ruben Amorim upset. “Angry and frustrated, that’s it,” said the Portuguese. “We are really inconsistent but if you look at the goal [conceded], we have a long ball, we have everything under control, [so] we need to do better.“The game was in control. We knew it, [so] let’s defend far from the box. We knew set pieces would be a problem with the difference in height in the team but we could do it. We could maintain the ball after the first goal and again we lost two points.”Amorim was pressed if he had given the players a dressing-room rollicking. “In that regard I am almost always consistent [calm]. I had one [such incident] after Brighton last year [a 3-1 loss]. I will talk to them tomorrow [Friday],” he said.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim insisted he had stayed calm with his players despite another disappointing home display.Photograph: Peter Powell/EPATen points and nine places separated the teams at the start. West Ham, in 18th with 11 points after 13 games, were bidding to become only the ninth side to survive with that tally (or lower) at this juncture. United’s 21 points had Amorim’s men only two behind fifth place that may be sufficient for a Champions League berth, which, despite the manager downplaying the notion, is a target.Jab and counter-jab was the pattern in early exchanges that featured Amad Diallo and Fernandes both going down in the Hammers area and having penalty shouts rejected by the referee Andrew Kitchen.Amorim’s surprise selection was in central defence where Ayden Heaven, 19, was in for Yoro and a concerning start featured a seventh-minute yellow card and him being turned twice by the 33-year-old Callum Wilson.Better for United was Diallo’s dart down the right. The wingback’s cross was kneed goalwards by Joshua Zirkzee, Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line, Matheus Cunha’s overhead stab was repelled before Fernandes sprayed a scissor-kick wide.While Amorim’s other changes were Cunha for Mason Mount and Mazraoui for Matthijs de Ligt, Lucas Paquetá’s silly sending-off against Liverpool meant Tomas Soucek was drafted in by Nuno Espírito Santo. If he had taken a fall when Diallo clipped him near the break, Kitchen might have awarded a spot-kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then West Ham broke, Bowen’s dribble eluded Fernandes and Heaven, and the captain left fly but the ball, deflecting off Luke Shaw, was gathered by Senne Lammens.Yoro replaced Heaven for the second half, Amorim accepting that the teen’s selection might backfire. Then came a move of high quality. Mazraoui zoomed forward and fed Zirkzee, whose backheel put Bryan Mbeumo in. He was thwarted but it demonstrated the value of quick ball movement. Zirkzee showed the same on halfway when a sweeping pass right had United motoring forward, claiming a free-kick and then a corner.View image in fullscreenDiogo Dalot celebrates with teammates Matheus Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee after putting Manchester United in front in the second half.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesWest Ham, living off scraps, broke and Magassa fired wide of Lammens, only for United to nose ahead via Dalot. Diallo turned the ball back to Casemiro, he blazed towards goal, the ball pinged off Mateus Fernandes and came to the Portuguese, whose finish was expert.United were on top and sought to stay there. Mbeumo thundered down the right, while Cunha made inroads down the left. Could Amorim’s unit remain in the ascendancy and finish the job, as they often find so difficult?But for a brave Casemiro block, Freddie Potts might have pulled West Ham back level with a fierce shot. It was a warning that was not heeded.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He believes the public are behind him and the team and his mood was bullish before the draw.“Everyone knows that we cannot promise that we win it but they want to see a team, a team spirit, a team that gives everything and fights for each other,” Tuchel said. “If the players bring that then I think anything is possible. We will be brave enough to dream about it, we will be brave enough to try it.Noise around Donald Trump an unwanted distraction to World Cup draw of dreamsRead more“I feel the change in expectation and a change in the feedback I get from fans and people who I meet because they like what they saw. Am I more confident now? Yes. Because we have got better. We have to arrive and try to make a special thing happen but we cannot guarantee it.”Tuchel said in interviews with the BBC and ITV that the draw would feel “surreal”. He was “curious and excited” and, channelling the “bring it on” spirit he has pushed with the players, he made it clear that there was no opponent he wanted to avoid.“Absolutely not,” Tuchel said. “I am very superstitious about this. I learnt this in academy football in Germany and played 40 indoor tournaments and when you thought you had an easier group or wished for one, the opponent had the match of his day and beat you. We just want to know who we face and get the thing going.”View image in fullscreenMark Bullingham (right) with Thomas Tuchel. Bullingham said: ‘We’re really excited about where we are. You can feel the brilliant energy in the camp.’Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty ImagesTuchel was asked about the prospect ofEnglandbeing drawn in the same group as Scotland. “If it happens, it happens and we make the most of it,” he replied. “It will be a nice story. I have no wishes on opponents. I think if you wish for something and think you are superior, it’s close to arrogance and you don’t want to be arrogant. We want to respect everyone.”The German talked about how he was ready to accept difficulties in terms of the heat and humidity that will await at many of the venues in the US, Canada and Mexico; the travel, too, even the potential for delays to matches because of thunderstorms. “It is more about the mindset than having a solution,” he said.One solution to the extreme temperatures would be to keep the substitutes back in the dressing-room – something Tuchel did not rule out. “If this is what helps us later in the match when they come on … OK, we consider that as a possibility,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it was not long before he found himself talking up France.“England will be one of the favourites,” Wenger said. “They are always nearly there to win it – semi-finals, quarter-final, final. They have to make the next step. They have the quality to do it.“I believe in Europe, trying to be as objective as possible, that France is the super-favourite just for one reason – it is the country which has more world-class strikers than any other country in the world. By having four knockout stages [in the expanded 48-team tournament] … to have such a bench with such good quality will make a difference.“There is one thing that is important in life is that when you know you can do it … when you have done something, it gives you something extra, the belief that you can do it. France has been in the last two finals so we know they can be there and they have the quality of the players.”David HytnerPhotograph: Michael Regan/FIFAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Nobody likes it as I want the players to be out here and feel the energy and give the energy from the bench. But I saw teams doing this and players doing this at the ClubWorld Cup[in the US last summer]. Hopefully we can avoid it. It is always better if they can be with us.”Tuchel has been credited with bringing a “brilliant energy” to the job by the Football Association’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham; with generating encouraging levels of buy-in from the players. The manager’s first two camps last season were largely underwhelming but the team have since impressed with their performance levels.“We’re really excited about where we are,” Bullingham said. “Thomas has come in and really hit the ground running brilliantly. You can feel the brilliant energy in the camp and see that the players are really responding well to him. We’re looking forward to the tournament.”Bullingham said that the FA’s logistics team would spring into action as soon the draw is finished to secure the best possible training base. They have earmarked Kansas City as a preferred location due to it being situated in the middle of the US but much will depend on where England’s ties are played. The provisional plan is for a pre-tournament training camp in Fort Lauderdale where the team could work and also play warm-up matches at Inter Miami’s stadium. The club are co-owned by the former England captain, David Beckham.“We’ve got a really clear plan and we’ve mapped out every eventuality depending on where we get drawn,” Bullingham said. “We’ve got a plan, as every leading country will have, to acclimatise and to give ourselves the best chance. We’ve got a brilliant team that’s put together some brilliant base camps.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Hislop said he had been diagnosed with “a fairly aggressive prostate cancer” about 18 months ago, which required surgery. Further tests showed the cancer had spread.“Roughly 18 months ago, I went for my annual physical and insisted on a PSA test, as I always do,” Hislop, 56, said in a video on Instagram. “This time around though my PSA was elevated. An MRI and biopsy quickly determined that I had a fairly aggressive prostate cancer.“A year ago, almost to the day, 6 December to be exact, I had a radical prostatectomy, and I thought that was it. But then, six months later, my PSA was again on the rise and another scan showed that my prostate cancer had spread to my pelvic bone. I started on medication pretty soon after, and just this morning completed seven and a half weeks of radiation therapy. The journey continues.”In a draft recommendation last week, the UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC), which advises the government, said prostate cancer screening should not be made routinely available for the vast majority of men in the UK. Hislop, who played for Trinidad and Tobago at the 2006 World Cup, has urged anyone concerned to get tested.“Doctors recommend that all men over the age of 50 get their PSA checked regularly,” he said. “If you’re of African descent, that age drops to 40. If you’re somewhere like the UK or somewhere else where PSA tests aren’t encouraged, you have got to insist.“Having a history of cancer in the family doesn’t matter. I had genetic testing done and it showed no traits in my family, yet this year would show that, without going into too much detail, even that didn’t exclude everybody in my immediate family.“The highest rate of prostate cancer mortality is in Caribbean men, so if you allow me to speak to my community, my people. Please, go get tested, know your PSA, track its history. Prostate cancer is survivable if caught early enough. There are treatments for it. Testing saves lives. It saved mine.”Explore more on these topicsFootballNewcastle UnitedCancernewsShareReuse this content"

An exemption to the ban was granted to athletes, coaches or “persons performing a necessary support role” who were travelling for the World Cup. The Iranian federation said last week it had applied for seven visas but that three names had been rejected by the US, including the president of the FFIRI, Mehdi Taj.Concerns remain over the possible effect of the travel ban on supporters of Iran and Haiti, who are also on the list, who wish to attend the tournament next year. Fifa has confirmed the creation of the Fifa Pass, a scheme that will allow World Cup ticket holders priority access to the visa application process before the tournament. But applications are not guaranteed to be successful.This week a number of human rights organisations raised concerns over the possible mistreatment of fans from overseas or from minority communities at the World Cup. “The Trump administration has aggressively pursued a systematic anti-human rights campaign to target, detain and disappear immigrants in communities across the US – including the deployment of the National Guard in cities where the World Cup will take place,” said Jamil Dakwar, human rights director at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).A spokesperson for the US State department said in relation to the distribution of visas for the World Cup: “We are doing everything we can to support a successful World Cup. At the same time, the Trump administration will not waver in upholding American law and the highest standards of national security and public safety in the conduct of our visa process. We generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupIranUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The chair of Fifa’s referees committee, speaking at a media briefing in Washington, made clear he supported the advance of technology.Collina saidconversations were taking placeover whether VAR could adjudicate on second yellow cards. They will continue at the next meeting of the International Football Association Board, the law-making body, in Wales next March, meaning there would be time for the ruling to come into effect for the World Cup. Collina also said discussions were taking place over how bestto combat time-wasting, including when goalkeepers go to ground, seemingly feigning injury to allow managers to hold team meetings. He added that Fifa wanted to explore AI-based innovations to help match officials and improve the game, although he gave no details on this.Quick GuideWenger backs France as 'super-favourite' for 2026 World CupShowArsène Wenger has described France as the “super-favourite” for next summer’s World Cup based on their enviable attacking options and major tournament knowhow.The former Arsenal manager, who is now Fifa’s chief of global football development, cannot see beyond his native France, who won the World Cup in 2018 and were the runners-up in 2022.The France manager, Didier Deschamps, can call upon an array of talent for his front line including Kylian Mbappé, Ousmane Dembélé, Hugo Ekitiké, Marcus Thuram, Désiré Doué, Bradley Barcola and Michael Olise.Wenger was asked to assess England’s chances and he essentially called them nearly men, though he accepted they too had the quality to win.

The technology could be used to assess whether the ball had fully crossed the line or which team had last touched it. The major factor in whether such a move could be viable was the potential delay to the game.“We are in a process of discussions,” Collina said. “We should all have the objective to make correct decisions on the field of play. It would be a pity if the result of a competition is decided not by what the players do on the field of play but by an honest mistake made by the decision-maker. This is what convinced us 13, 14 years ago to start thinking how to support referees [with technology]. So if we can get this, to me, it’s positive.Noise around Donald Trump an unwanted distraction to World Cup draw of dreamsRead more“The main criteria is no delay. With corners, there is a physiological delay because when a corner is given, normally you wait until the two centre-backs come up. It normally takes 10-15 seconds to get the attackers ready. In these 10-15 seconds, if the corner kick is wrongly given … everybody has the evidence that the start of play is wrong and to me it’s difficult to understand if they have the possibility to see that [the decision is wrong] … why we have to hide our heads under the sand and hope that nothing happens on the corner kick which is taken?“This is my opinion as I live matches in important competitions hoping the result is determined by what the players do on the field of play … If I can avoid to have this kind of circumstance I would be happy.

In his absence Joe Root plundered the home side’s all-seam attack for an unbeaten 135 on the opening day at the Gabba, his 40th Test century and his first on Australian soil, an effort teammate Zak Crawley acclaimed as “one of his best”.Sublime Starc is last man standing after Australia’s mystifying call to leave out Lyon | Geoff LemonRead moreLyon, Australia’s all-time third-highest Test wicket-taker, described his mood as “absolutely filthy” as he came to terms with being snubbed. “I’m letting things settle down in my own head and trying to make sure that I’m doing whatever I can to make sure the guys representing Australia do the right thing and get the right result for us,” he said.“I’m not the first player to miss a Test match and I won’t be the last. But I’m obviously pretty gutted because I know the role that I can play, and especially at a venue like this.”Australia’s chair of selectors, George Bailey, attempted to assuage Lyon’s fury by guaranteeing him a place in the XI for the third Test. Bailey described the move as a “one-Test decision”, adding: “Nath will disagree with the decision, and that’s perfectly OK. I have no qualms about players feeling like they can impact the game and the fact of the matter is he could have. Very much it’s a one-Test decision, Nath will play in Adelaide.”View image in fullscreenNathan Lyon throws a rugby ball on day one of the second Ashes Test, having been told he was not in the XI for Australia.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PACrawley admitted that England had been surprised by the decision to leave Lyon out while Mitchell Starc, who added six first-innings wickets to the 10 he took in Perth, said: “It’s a tough one for Nath. Everyone wants to play every game and I’m sure he’ll be disappointed. It’s certainly not a reflection of his skills. They looked at conditions and made the choice of this attack for these conditions.”Root came to the crease in the third over with England reeling at five for two, after both Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope had been dismissed without scoring, and was unbeaten at stumps with England 325 for nine. “He played fantastically well, assessed the conditions, sucked up some pressure and got the result,” Starc said. “We’ve had a lot of good battles – he’s won a few of them and I won a few and today we both got some runs and wickets so we’ll call it even.”Crawley, who scored 76 and combined with Root in a third-wicket partnership of 117, said the Yorkshireman’s performance had been “brilliant”. “I forget some of his hundreds, that’s how many he’s got,” the England opener said. “But it’s a phenomenal knock. It was doing plenty when he first came in and he was so calm and he was so clear about how he wanted to go about it. It has to be right up there. If you put everything into consideration, it’s got to be one of his best.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re valuable runs but it would have worked out either way. We were pretty happy with 260 and having an hour at them to be honest, but I think we definitely won that last hour, so we’re positive going into tomorrow.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Nathan LyonJoe RootEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

DR Congo,who are in the playoffs, are the highest-ranked potential Pot 4 team from outside Europe. Ghana could be the trickiest non-European opponents in that pot but it is worth noting that Cape Verde,another Pot 4 teamand ranked four places higher, beat them at the Africa Cup of Nations last year.Revealed: Myanmar junta ‘crony’ given key role behind Fifa peace prizeRead moreA more worrying prospect for England could be drawing Morocco, Norway (orScotlandgiven the rivalry) and Jordan. Europe is the only confederation allowed two teams in a group so drawing Morocco would end the prospect of having to play Mohamed Salah’s Egypt, a Pot 3 team, Ghana or, if they qualify, DR Congo.Look out for Ecuador in Pot 2. They finished second in South American qualifying behind Argentina, conceding five times in 18 matches and losing only twice. They were stronger at home than away and, although Quito’s altitude surely helped, they also drew with Brazil and beat an (already qualified) Argentina in Guayaquil. Colombia and Marcelo Bielsa’s Uruguay, certain to be well supported, are also in that pot.Scotland’s worst-case scenarioOn rankings it would be Spain (world No 1) from Pot 1 and Morocco (ranked 11th) from Pot 2, or Argentina (ranked second) plus Croatia, given the rankings add up to the same figure. Scotland’s position in Pot 3 means they cannot face Norway. TheWorld Cuphosts tend to reach the knockout stage – in the past 10 tournaments, starting with Mexico 86, only South Africa and Qatar failed to do so – but Scotland would surely prefer to face Canada (in particular), Mexico or the USA over any of the other Pot 1 teams. In terms of Pot 4, the picture is the same as England’s.USA’s worst-case scenarioTheir position in Pot 1 as hosts means they avoid the world’s top nine teams. With all options open from Pot 2 because it contains no Concacaf sides, the instinct may be to want to avoid Croatia, but the tricker scenario for theUSAmay be to land Morocco (or Colombia or Uruguay) and then Norway from Pot 3. Mauricio Pochettino’s side cannot face Panama, the second-best team in Pot 3 according to the rankings, which may be welcome given that Panama have won four of their past six meetings. The USA would probably want to avoid one of the European playoff teams and cannot be in a group with the intercontinental playoff teams because a country from their confederation may win.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Australia’s worst-case scenarioArgentina from Pot 1 and Norway from Pot 3 would be an unwelcome combination but would end the possibility of meeting a European team from Pot 4. Jordan, the qualified team from Pot 4 with the highest ranking, can be discounted because they, likeAustralia, are from the Asian confederation. An alternative unwanted mix for Australia would be Argentina, one of the non-European teams ranked in the 30s in Pot 3 (Panama, Egypt, Algeria and Paraguay) and a European playoff winner. Remember too that Cape Verde, Ghana and potentially DR Congo are looming in Pot 4. Australia’s record against New Zealand suggests that should hold no fears despite being a derby.Overall possible group of deathThe European playoffs in March will determine who from Pot 4 will be the most feared. If Italy make it, few will be keen to face them despite their dismal recent qualifying record. For now, Ghana are perhaps the trickiest of the Pot 4 opponents. In Pot 3, Norway will be a concerning sight for anyone. Pot 2 is an eclectic mix spanning five continents. It includes Ecuador and Morocco, the latter of whom defeated Spain and Portugal en route to the semi-finals at the last World Cup. Theoretically, Argentina, Morocco, Italy and Norwaycould be drawn together, which would put the teams ranked No 2, No 11, No 12 and No 29 in the world in the same group. But for all the group of death talk, don’t forget that the best eight third-place teams will end up in the knockout stages, removing plenty of jeopardy – and excitement.Low-hanging fruit?The expansion of this tournament to incorporate a further 16 teams means plenty lower down the rankings have made it. Australia look the most straightforward opponents in Pot 2. South Africa are the lowest-ranked of the third seeds but Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the debutants Uzbekistan will not send shivers down the spine. The other debutants, Jordan, Cape Verdeand Curaçao, are in Pot 4. Haiti and New Zealand are the lowest-ranked teams who have definitely qualified.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Iran loom largest. Trump signed an executive order in Junebanning Iranians from entering the USbut that will not apply to the players, coaches or “persons performing a necessary support role”. One other World Cup country was on that list: Haiti. Trump approved airstrikes on an Iranian nuclear site in June, then said he would “absolutely” consider bombing Iran again. A fixture between the two at France 1998, won 2-1 by Iran, was described as the “most politically charged game in World Cup history”. They also met in 2022, when the US came out on top, but a third fixture would create a political circus to outstrip the one four years ago. Any group match would have a two-thirds chance of taking place in Los Angeles, which has the US’s largest Iranian diaspora.View image in fullscreenIran beat the US at the 1998 World Cup.Photograph: Simon M Bruty/Getty ImagesThere has beentension in US v Canada ice hockeygames as a consequence of Trump, although that has calmed a little since the US president stopped talking about making Canada the 51st state. The countries could meet in the knockout stage.Look out too for the possibility of Curaçao facing the Netherlands. The Caribbean island is part of the kingdom of the Netherlands, most of their squad were born in the Netherlands and they have a Dutch (and former Netherlands) manager in Dick Advocaat.Sticking only with teams guaranteed to be at the World Cup, Iran and Saudi Arabia, between whom relations have been severely strained at times, cannot meet in the group stage. Spain could be drawn to face Morocco. Relations are on an upward curve after years of tension over issuessuch as immigrationfrom Moroccan territory and the future ofWestern Sahara. The seedings mean England could not meet Argentina before the semi-finals if both win their groups.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupUS sportsAustralia sportEnglandScotlandUSAexplainersShareReuse this content"

Bruce Arena, say, certainly has a fuller trophy cabinet. Nancy, however, lifted more than just trophies. He lifted standards. At Columbus Crew, he set a benchmark for the rest, showing what was possible even with limited resources. Columbusdidn’t have Lionel Messior Son Heung-min, but they had Nancy as head coach, and that was often enough.For the past three seasons, the Crew have been the most dynamic, boundary-pushing team inMLS. Nancy’s CF Montreal team weren’t bad either, establishing the style of play that would come to be known as Nancyball. He changed MLS’s managerial landscape for ever. It was only a matter of time until a call came from Europe.Football Daily | Martin O’Neill proves doubters wrong again with remarkable Celtic returnRead moreAfter weeks of waiting owing to a drawn-out work permit process, Nancy will take charge ofhis first game as Celtic manageron Sunday. Some Crew fans will surely watch. Others may wish to ignore the loss of their manager. MLS will be worse off for Nancy’s exit, but the 48-year-old’s departure could cement his legacy further.While MLS has become a credible talent pool for European clubs to dip into for players, few managers have made the same leap. Patrick Vieira did it, joining Nice from New York City FC, but he isPatrick Vieira. His status as a legend of the game might have bagged him a job in Europe’s “big five” leagues regardless of what he did in MLS.By contrast, Nancy’s name has counted for little over the course of his career. He never played at a high level. WhenCelticwere initially linked, headlines in Scotland focused on his time as Thierry Henry’s assistant to provide context. Even on his hire at Montreal, most fans hadn’t heard of him. Nancy instead stood out over time for his ability as a coach and leader, and other MLS coaches could stand out too now that European clubs are looking more closely.Steve Cherundolo won’t return as Los Angeles FC head coach for 2026. While the former USA defender views the game very differently to Nancy, his success in MLS could make him an attractive candidate for a job in Europe. Cherundolo spent his professional career as a player in the Bundesliga. Could a German club come calling?Quick GuideNancy checks in at Celtic: 'I'm not a boss, I'm a leader'ShowWilfried Nancy declared Celtic the perfect fit for his “open-minded” approach to life and football after starting work as manager. The Frenchman arrived at the club’s Lennoxtown training centre on Thursday and will kick off his reign against Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts on Sunday.The former Montreal and Columbus Crew head coach spoke about his focus on connecting with people in an interview with Celtic TV. “The story of this club is amazing and I can feel the connection,” he said. “I have been following the club for many years and know the club really well. I think the connection with my background, and the story of Celtic, fits perfectly with the person I am and the person I want to become.“This is a club for all. And the way I have been educated by my parents is about being open-minded and also about having empathy for people, and to understand where they come from.”The 48-year-old, whose father was in the navy, added: “I have been travelling a lot from when I was young, that has helped me see people with new eyes. The way I see football is a connection with the way I live. It’s a way of life and the brand of Celtic fits me really well. This is something that I love.”On his style of management, Nancy said: “I don’t consider myself as a boss. I am a leader. And for me the definition of a leader is create a good environment to help people express themselves. For me, that is so important. Because of my background, I was able to connect with people.“My style of play is about the way I live,” he said.”I like to be proactive in my life, I like to discover things. I also like to try things because the more you try things, the more you learn and the more you’re going to maximise your chance to have success in your life.\"We want to take care of the ball. The ball is the only tool in our life, without talking, that we can connect people. So can we use the ball to create emotions? Can we use the ball to score goals? Can we use the ball to have messages between us? So that’s why I want proactive football.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Under Mikey Varas’s stewardship, San Diego exceeded all expectations in their expansion season. Gregg Berhalter’s former USA assistant coached up a team from scratch to play a brand of modern, high-energy soccer that has surely attracted the attention of European observers. Could Nancy’s appointment at Celtic set a precedent for Varas to follow?Could Nancy be to the MLS managerial pool what Miguel Almirón was to the league’s player pool? While European clubs now regularly buy from the league, it took the Paraguayan’s record-breaking move to Newcastle from Atlanta United in 2019 to reframe MLS as a springboard league – a statement about MLS’s rising quality.That Celtic were the ones to recruit Nancy isn’t out of character for a club that hired Ange Postecoglou from the J-League and Ronny Deila from the Norwegian Eliteserien. They have looked to new markets for managers before and there is enough overlap between Angeball and Nancyball to make Celtic Park an ideal landing spot for the Frenchman.Scottish clubs are increasingly looking to new markets for players and managers because they have no choice. They can’t compete against their financially bloated rivals from south of the border. While Nancy will coach in the Europa League, and possibly the Champions League, in seasons to come, the domestic level in Scotland is generally lower than in MLS. According to Opta, only Celtic, Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian would infiltrate the 30 teams that make up the league Nancy has come from.View image in fullscreenWilfried Nancy soaks up the acclaim after winning the MLS Cup with Columbus Crew in 2023.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesThe reality, however, is Scottish football is a step or two closer to the Premier League and Europe’s other “big five” leagues than MLS. For Postecoglou, success at Celtic led him to Tottenham. Steven Gerrard was hired by Aston Villa on the back of winning the title at Rangers. There is an established pathway that doesn’t exist for MLS coaches.MLS will miss Nancy. Not only do his teams play brilliant football, he is a strong personality and one of the league’s most outspoken figureheads. When Nancy talks, people listen. When he produces quotes such as his famous line that “impossible is an opinion” after leading Columbus Crew to the MLS Cup in 2023, people make viral raps out of them.Nancy will encounter a lot of strong opinions in Scotland. Many Celtic supporters are sceptical. At a time when the club’s board is facing protests over a perceived lack of ambition and spending, Nancy is regarded by some as the cheap option. And it’s true he doesn’t have the résumé or standing of Brendan Rodgers or Martin O’Neill,who has held the forton an interim basis these past few weeks.Similar was said when Nancy replaced Henry as CF Montreal head coach as an unknown and unheralded former academy coach. It didn’t take him long, however, to make a name for himself as MLS’s boldest and most progressive manager. European clubs may be quicker to act if another like him emerges again.Explore more on these topicsCelticMLSScottish PremiershipUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A separateAppledatacenter complex is just down the road. ATesla“gigafactory”, which builds electric vehicle batteries, is a resident too.In the mid-1800s, this area was an old west boomtown. It’s situated in Storey county, where one of the largest deposits of gold and silver in the American west was discovered, lending it the epithet “the Richest Place on Earth”. It’s where Mark Twain came to be a miner, then got his start as a writer for the local newspaper. He later wrote about it in his book Roughing It, saying: “The ‘flush times’ were in magnificent flower … Money was as plenty as dust.”The gold rush is long history, but Storey county is once again one of the fastest-growing economies inNevada. A new boom is happening here in the high desert – fueled by artificial intelligence.The burgeoning tech, which Silicon Valley vows will be the next frontier for humanity, is mintingunfathomable trillion-dollar valuations. It’s a product that’s still being tested, and there’s uncertainty as to how exactly it will transform the economy. But that hasn’t stopped its real-world infrastructure from being built at mass capacity and record speed – a frenzybuoyed up by hundreds of billions in venture capital funding.View image in fullscreenThe Tahoe‑Reno Industrial Center’s reservoir surrounded by desert vegetation.Microsoft, working with OpenAI, announced last month that it plans todouble its datacenter footprintover the next two years. Amazon, partnering with Anthropic, justopened a major clusterwith plans for more. Google, Meta and Oracle are preparing vast buildouts, as is aconsortium of companiesworking with the Trump administration on a $500bn project called Stargate. In all, estimates by the consulting firm McKinsey and Company peg global spending on AI datacenters tototal nearly $7tn by 2030– nearly twice as much as the GDP of the UK.The buildup comes at a cost. As the planet’s most powerful companies race to fulfill their dreams of artificial general intelligence – a futuristic version of AI that can perform tasks as well as humans – it means an ever-increasing need for computing power. AI requires far more energy and water than other internet tasks. A ChatGPT query needs nearly10 times as much electricityas an internet search without AI. And because supercomputers run hot, they typically need intensive water-cooling systems. As datacenters continue to multiply in communities around the world – from Frankfurt to Johannesburg – AI’s thirst for power and water shows no signs of letting up.In a place such as Storey county, which ison the frontline of the climate crisisand has an average rainfall of roughly 11in a year, some locals fear the datacenters’ demands could decimate already scarce resources.That includes the Pyramid Lake Paiute, a Native American tribe that has lived downriver from where the industrial center now sits since long before Europeans arrived in the Americas.View image in fullscreenA Switch datacenter at the Tahoe‑Reno Industrial Center.“Everyone cannot keep moving to a space that has no resources. Nevada is completely over-allocated on its groundwater resources. It’s the driest state in the union,” said Steven Wadsworth, the tribe’s chairman. “Our tribe’s number one goal is protecting our resources. And it makes it difficult when we have partners upstream who are blissfully unaware.”‘Miracle in the desert’On a chilly fall day in October, Kris Thompson hopped into his SUV to take a drive. He has a gravelly voice and fading gray hair and works for Gilman Commercial Real Estate Service, which has been the industrial center’s exclusive brokerage firm since its founding in 1998. As he turned on to USA Parkway, the 18-mile highway that cuts through the park, he pointed out the tall yellow cranes dotting the landscape and the constant stream of semitrucks rumbling by. “You’re gonna see a lot of hard hats and heavy equipment,” he said.“When I first came up here, there was nothing but desert dirt trails, coyotes and rabbitbrush,” Thompson said. “Nothing else was here. No roads, no water wells, no businesses, no drainage, no sewer system, nothing.”Now, the entire area looks like a city being built from the ground up.“How do you take 160 sq miles of desert, of high desert in the mountains, and turn that, 25 years later, into the hottest tech and datacenter development in the United States?” Thompson asked rhetorically. “They had some cowboys up there, and they were willing to think outside the box.”Satellite map showing the scale of the Tahoe Reno Industrial CenterOne of the cowboy masterminds is Lance Gilman, who also owns the Mustang Ranch brothel. He and his partners bought most of the property from the Gulf Oil company in the late 1990s, which had planned to use the expanse of land for a corporate hunting retreat.Gilman and his western crew were property developers who struck it big on what Thompson said “has to be the greatest real estate deal ever made on the planet”. They paid $20m to buy a vast private ranch – covering more than 100,000 acres – and created the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. It has no residential properties and pre-approves most industrial and commercial uses. Essentially, it can fast-track the local government permit process.The center’s swift permitting hookedTeslainto setting up its first gigafactory there in 2014. The company bought 3,300 acres (13.4 sq km), which span an entire mountain, and immediately set to work building a 6m-sq-ft foundation (nearly 560,000 sq meters) for its battery facility. Tesla convinced the county to rename the road leading to its property “Electric Avenue”.View image in fullscreenPyramid Lake, at the Pyramid Lake Paiute Reservation, is fed by the Truckee River and is  located about 40 miles north-east of Reno.“That put us up on the global stage,” Thompson said of the mega manufacturing facility. “That speed is everything. In this economy, if it takes you two or three years to get a permit to start building, your product could be obsolete by that point.”Switch, which builds and operates some of the world’s largest datacenters and rents them to a variety of clients, came next, then Google, Microsoft and more. These companies purchased thousands of acres of land to build their datacenters. Tract, which has a similar business model to Switch,purchased 11,000 total acres(44.5 sq km) andpledged to invest $100bninto its datacenter project.A gold rush-esque boom and bust has already come for the industrial park once before. One of the biggest buyers in 2018, four years before the release of ChatGPT, was the multimillionaire Jeffrey Berns, who threw down $170m in cash to acquire 67,000 acres (271 sq km) – roughly two-thirds of the park – through his company Blockchains. His goal was to transform the place into a cryptocurrency utopia, which he described to the Guardian as having a “blockchain-based self-sovereign identity that eliminated the need for many politicians and governmental agencies”.That plan didn’t pan out. So Blockchainssold 2,200 acres (8.9 sq km) to Tractfor $250m and plans to offer long-term leases on the remaining acreage. Berns said he was now focusing on building a billion-dollar bunker in Switzerland.Every square foot of Gilman’s land at the industrial center has been sold, according to Thompson. What’s available now are parcels that are being resold. Thompson said the fact that those cowboys were able to transform the dusty landscape into a “tech city” is nothing short of a “miracle in the desert”.View image in fullscreenA water truck sprays near a construction site at the Tahoe‑Reno Industrial Center.Driving through the tech city, it’s impossible to see the full extent of each company’s construction projects. Google’s complex is triple-fenced and only accessible by private roads. The same goes for other companies, some of which are buried behind desert mountains and towering walls. These businesses arenotoriously secretive, citing the need to protect trade secrets, and their security patrols don’t take kindly to curious strangers.On three separate occasions, private guards told the Guardian to move along when parked on what seemed to be public roads. In one instance, a guard drove up and walked over to the driver-side window. “What are you doing?” he asked curtly. As he peered through the window, he smiled broadly and tilted his head, showing that he was wearing Meta’s smart glasses with the red video recording light turned on.‘We know what happens when we don’t fight for the water’Pyramid Lake is the largest lake in Nevada. Situated at the base of several mountain ranges, the lake is owned by the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe and entirely surrounded by the tribe’s reservation. Tribal members have lived in the region for thousands of years. The Pyramid Lake Paiute’s petroglyphs date back 10,000 to 14,000 years BCE, the oldest in North America.View image in fullscreenSteven Wadsworth, chairman of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe.Wadsworth, the tribal chairman, recognizes the need for datacenters, but worries if the ones upriver aren’t kept in check, they could intensify threats to the lake – which is the lifeblood for the tribe. The Truckee River supplies the industrial center with water and also serves as the primary source of water for Pyramid Lake.“It’s not like we’re out here to be a pain,” Wadsworth said. “We know the destruction.”In the tribe’s governmental office, Wadsworth, sporting waist-length hair and a white button-up shirt tucked into slacks, walked over to a giant satellite map showing the region’s watershed – from California’s mountains to Nevada’s Great Basin. Next to the deep green of Pyramid Lake was a large, flat, white mass, the remnants of a second lake.“We know what happens when we don’t fight for the water,” Wadsworth said, pointing to the white mass. “This lake used to be full.”Lake Winnemucca was once fed by Pyramid Lake, but when the Truckee River was dammed in the early 1900s, Wadsworth said it took less than 30 years for Pyramid Lake to drop 80ft and Lake Winnemucca to dry.The tribe has been fighting for decades now to protect Pyramid Lake and the native fish that inhabit it, including the endangered cui-ui and the threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout. Some of its efforts include purchasing thousands of acre-feet (one acre-foot is equivalent to 1,233 cubic meters) of water rights and bringing several lawsuits over the years. The tribe also lodged complaints with the local Truckee Meadows water authority to ensure any water the industrial park siphons from the river is replenished, according to theMIT Technology Review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the last 10 years, datacenter water use has tripled to more than 17bn gallons (64bn liters) of water a year in the US, according to aDepartment of Energy report. Much of that is attributed to the “rapid proliferation of AI servers” and is expected to multiply to nearly 80bn gallons (303bn liters) by 2028. While the figure pales against total US water use,117tn gallons per year in 2015, it still can mean a struggle to meet the demands of both human beings and hot computer chips.An area near the dry lake bed of what was once Lake Winnemucca.An area near the dry lake bed of what was once Lake Winnemucca, near Nixon, Nevada.And as datacenters continue toproliferate in water-stressed areasaround the globe, which can offer cheap land and energy as well as low humidity for easier chip cooling, one of the central concerns in local communities is what happens if the water runs dry.A large datacenter using evaporative water cooling consumes around 1m gallons a day, said Shaolei Ren, an associate professor at the University of California at Riverside. He studies AI water consumption and said non-evaporative water-cooling technology can diminish water use, but it’s a balancing act because those systems need more electricity, which, in turn, requires more water.“Water and energy are not separable,” Ren said.The industrial park built a reclaimed-water reservoir for its datacenter clients that went into operation in 2023. The project, which cost upwards of $100m, involved constructing a 21-mile pipeline to pump effluent from a wastewater treatment plant to the industrial park. While seen as an alternative to taking water directly from the Truckee River, Wadsworth said the effluent previously would have been treated and deposited back into the river. So the tribe still got involved to ensure the river maintained its flow.Some environmentalists question the wisdom ofputting datacenters in any drought-prone region, especially as the climate crisis accelerates.View image in fullscreenKyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.“This place is being touted as the epicenter of the energy revolution, the data revolution, the tech revolution,” said Kyle Roerink, the executive director of theGreat Basin Water Network, which works to protect water resources in the region. “But they’re never going to be making water.”‘We just don’t have the power capacity’The largest datacenter in the US is tucked into the industrial park. The sleek gray building with red accents is more than half a mile long, comprising 1.3m sq ft, and has the capacity for 130 megawatts of electricity – enough topower 100,000 homesa year. It’s owned by Switch, the company’s first datacenter in what is now a sprawling campus called “the Citadel”.The entrance to the Citadel does give the impression of a fortress. It sits high on a giant pile of crushed rocks surrounded by 20ft cement walls topped with dagger-like iron stakes. Guests drive in through a metal gate and security guards in bulletproof vests hold visitors’ IDs for the duration of their visit.The campus, which comes with its own power substation and water reservoir, has multiple gargantuan datacenters terraced up into a valley, and Switch is building several more. The company says that when the Citadel is done, it will have approximately 10m sq ft (930,000 sq meters) of datacenter space combined.Inside Switch’s biggest datacenter, Reno 1, noisy wall-sized fans blow air over the computers to keep them cool. Rows of identical servers behind black mesh gates line long aisles, an infinite, blinking hall of mirrors. The room is dimly lit except for the servers’ blue and green LEDs as they perform incredibly complex computations.View image in fullscreenPower lines run along Interstate 80 outside Reno, Nevada.Datacenters like this are cropping up worldwide, which means not only an intensified strain on water, but also on power. Google wrote in its latestsustainability reportthat it has seen a51% increase in carbon emissionsin its operations since 2019, while Microsoft had a23% increasesince 2020.AmazonandMetaalso saw increases over the last few years, with rises of 33% and 64%, respectively. Some researchers saythose are undercounts.The International Energy Agency estimates total electricity consumption from datacenters worldwidecould double by 2026from 2022 levels – roughly equaling the amount used per year by the entire country of Japan. In the US, about 60% of electricitycomes from burning fossil fuels, a predominant driver of the climate crisis.Revealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areasRead more“These are large cities in terms of their electricity consumption,” Ari Peskoe, the director of Harvard’s Electricity Law Initiative, said of datacenters. “And then, utilities and other power generators are having a massive buildout of natural gas-fired power plants to support this growth.”Some companies, like Elon Musk’s xAI, haveadded huge temporary methane gas generatorsto supply additional energy to their facilities. And in datacenter-heavy regions across the US, plans todecommission coal plantshave been delayed to keep electricity flowing. Research analystsfor Goldman Sachs saythey “expect the proliferation of AI technology, and the datacenters necessary to feed it, to drive an increase in power demand the likes of which hasn’t been seen in a generation”.The power plant that serves the industrial center runs on natural gas and is owned by NV Energy, a utility acquired by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in 2013. The utility has received regulatory approval for at least four new natural gas units over the last couple of years. Meghin Delaney, a company spokesperson, said NV Energy also hasseveral renewable energy projectsand requires large energy users, like datacenters, to “cover transmission and distribution costs upfront before new projects are built”.View image in fullscreenA Google datacenter at the Tahoe‑Reno Industrial Center in Storey county, Nevada.One of Switch’s focuses isgreen design and energy efficiency. The company says its datacenters are completely powered by renewable energy, and what it uses from natural gas facilities it feeds back to the grid from solar and wind projects. Jason Hoffman, the chief strategy officer for Switch, said the company hadraisedmore than “$20bn in 100% green financing since 2024”. Switch was alsoa major sponsorof the reclaimed water reservoir at the industrial center.Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Apple are also tapping into solar and wind to fuel their datacenter ambitions. Some tech giants are investing in nuclear and geothermal energy. Apple says its datacenters in the Reno arearun entirely on solarpower.Tesla, Meta and Tract did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople forMicrosoft, Apple and Amazon declined to comment but pointed the Guardian to their company’s sustainability reports. Chrissy Moy, a Google spokesperson, said the company uses air cooling in its Storey county datacenters; and despite a rise in carbon emissions, she said Google saw a 12% reduction in datacenter energy emissions in 2024, which the company attributes to “bringing new clean energy online”.View image in fullscreenKris Thompson points to a map of the Tahoe‑Reno Industrial Center in Storey county.On the reservation at Pyramid Lake, Wadsworth said rolling brownouts are common during the hot summer months. “Right around 5 o’clock, everybody gets home, and the power will dip multiple times,” he said. He’s concerned it will only get worse with the deluge of datacenters, adding: “We just don’t have the power capacity to keep running all of these things.”Wild horsesBack on the USA Parkway, Thompson steered his SUV through the industrial center’s mountains. He said about 75% of the calls he now gets are from businesses wanting to secure land for datacenters. Thompson has spent years on this land, and its development is a point of pride. So is its preservation. He looked out at the arid terrain gesturing to a cluster of scruffy pinyon pines and rabbitbrush that painted the hillside yellow with blooms. A pair of wild horses grazed nearby.View image in fullscreenHorses graze at the Tahoe‑Reno Industrial Center in Storey county, Nevada.Thompson said the park and its hi-tech residents do what they can to protect the horses, which were originally brought to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors and now run wild throughout Nevada’s deserts. The horses areseen by some as controversial, as herds can overrun the hills, trampling the distinct natural landscape. But, in the industrial park, the tech companies love them, Thompson said.“You know, these tech rogues see themselves in the wild horses,” Thompson said. “They’re independent, they’re running free, they’re self-reliant, they’re doing their own thing.” Which sometimes means a trampling stampede.Explore more on these topicsThe future of AIArtificial intelligence (AI)WaterTeslaMicrosoftGoogleClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Microsoft’s European headquarters are located inIreland.Joe O’Brien, the executive director of ICCL, said: “Microsoft’s technology has put millions of Palestinians in danger. These are not abstract data-protection failures.”He said that the cloud services “enabled real-world violence” and it was “essential that the DPC move quickly and decisively” in view of the “threat to life posed by the issues at the heart of this complaint”.He added: “When EU infrastructure is used to enable surveillance and targeting, the Irish Data Protection Commission must step in – and it must use its full powers to hold Microsoft to account.”A cache of leaked documentsreviewed by the Guardian revealed that Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s spy agency, had opened talks as far back as 2021 to move vast amounts of top secret intelligence material to the US company’s cloud service.The documents showed how Microsoft’s storage facility had been used by Unit 8200 to store an expansive archive of everyday Palestinian communications, facilitating targeted airstrikes and other military operations.In response to the revelations Microsoft ordered an urgent external inquiry to review its relationship with Unit 8200. Its initial findingsled the company to cancel the unit’s accessto some of its cloud storage and AI services.ICCL claims that Microsoft facilitated critical components of Israel’s military surveillance “Al Minasseq” system.It says the alleged “removal” of the records of intercepted phone calls from EU servers to Israel obscured evidence of illegal processing before investigations could commence within the EU and claims that unlawful processing was a breach of the EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR) governing use of personal data.Equipped with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity and computing power, Unit 8200 had built an indiscriminate system allowing its intelligence officers to collect, play back and analyse the content of cellular calls of an entire population.A spokesperson for the DPC said: “I can confirm that the DPC has received a complaint and it is currently under assessment.”Microsoft has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftIsraelPalestineIrelandComputingEuropeCloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

It was certainly more than most survivors of deepfake image-based abuse could expect.They had met as students and bonded over their shared love of music. In the years since graduation, he’d also become her support system, the friend she reached for each time she learned that her images and personal details had been posted online without her consent. Jodie’s pictures, along with her real name and correct bio, were used on many platforms for fake dating profiles, then adverts for sex work, then posted on to Reddit and other online forums with invitations to deepfake them into pornography. The results ended up on porn sites. All this continued for almost two years, until Jodie finally worked out who was doing it — her best friend – identified more of his victims, compiled 60 pages of evidence, and presented it to police. She had to try two police stations, having been told at the first that no crime had been committed. Ultimately he admitted to 15 charges of “sending messages that were grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing nature” and received a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for two years.At that time, there were no laws against deepfake intimate image abuse, although experts had beenraising the alarm since 2016. “I felt really lucky to get a conviction, something that will affect the rest of his life,” says Jodie. Her main focus in the months that followed had to be her recovery. “I was in a dark place,” she says. “I’m not ashamed to say I was suicidal. I couldn’t sleep, and when I did, I had nightmares.” More than two years passed before she felt ready to campaign for change, starting by telling her story on BBC Radio 4’s File on 4 in April 2024. “The more I learned, the more I understood and that brought rage,” says Jodie, who works in financial services. “I gradually realised the significance of there being no law which held him accountable for the deepfake abuse – and I wanted change.”Within little more than a year, she had it. The Data (Use and Access) Act, which received royal assent in June, has made the creation of a deepfake intimate image without consent a criminal offence and also criminalised requesting others to create the deepfake image – as her best friend had when he posted images of Jodie on forums. Both now carry a custodial sentence of up to six months, as well as an unlimited fine. It’s a huge victory won fast in a space where progress has been mind-bendingly slow. However, this isn’t the story of a new government determined to tackle an ever-evolving crime. It was fought for and pushed through by a small group of victims and experts who formed a WhatsApp group called Heroes.Jodie joined the group last year, shortly after the File on 4 programme aired. She had been invited to the House of Lords to meet Charlotte Owen,Boris Johnson’s controversial appointment, who had taken her seat the previous summer. Lady Owen was theyoungest life peer in historywhen she arrived in the Lords, aged 30, and she was intent on tackling deepfake intimate image abuse. “It was rapidly proliferating, and such a huge threat,” says Owen. “Loads of women my age were very concerned about it, but it wasn’t getting the spotlight.”The Lords were blown away by these brilliant women. Lots of the peers referenced them in their subsequent speechesOwen organised a core group of experts and campaigners, which included Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University;the Revenge Porn Helpline;Not Your Porn;MyImageMyChoice; the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW); and survivors such as Jodie. They formed a tight team in the WhatsApp group Owen set up, aiming to criminalise the creation and requesting of deepfake intimate image abuse. They were braced for a long fight. “In those initial conversations, I was under the impression that it was going to take years,” says Jodie, “so I’ve been kind of gobsmacked by how quickly it happened.”It isn’t surprising that expectations were low. Since 2015 and thefirst lawto address so-called “revenge porn”, legal protections have been patchy and piecemeal, always months or years behind the latest development in intimate image abuse.View image in fullscreenClare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University, and member of the Heroes WhatsApp group.Photograph: Courtesy of Clare McGlynn“There has been such a resistance to taking any action in parliament, a complete lack of urgency and absence of interest,” says McGlynn. “Even back in 2015, when they passed the first law against sharing private sexual materials, myself and others were saying that it ought to include altered images because we were already seeing women who had been Photoshopped. The government response was that altered images weren’t sufficiently harmful to be included.”The protections that were afforded in that early legislation were full of holes. One glaring example was that it made the sharing of intimate images without consent a crime only if it could be proved that this had been done with “intent to cause distress”. Doing it for a laugh, to impress friends, or for sexual gratification wasn’t a crime at all. (After a decade of campaigning, this should finally be rectified in thecrime and policing bill, but it still hasn’t quite happened yet.)By 2019, cases of intimate image abuse reported to police hadmore than doubled, and cyberflashing and deepfakes had emerged, so the Law Commission was asked to examine whether new laws were required. It took three years – the final report, theIntimate Image Abusereport, was not published until July 2022. “In these years between, we were writing to MPs about what was happening to women and girls and what needed to be done, but the response was always, ‘We just need to wait for the final report’,” says McGlynn. “Five lines added to a piece of legislation could have made a massive difference to millions of women’s lives, but any changes we put forward were rejected.” The report did conclude that the sharing of deepfake abuse should be criminalised – as a result, the Online Safety Act 2023 has made it an offence to share deepfake intimate images without consent. However, criminalising thecreationof deepfakes was not recommended. (It acknowledged that “this may be disappointing to those who have been victims of such behaviour”.)18:40My Blonde GF:  a disturbing story of deepfake pornographyThe “Heroes” group set out to change this, and McGlynn at last had some reason to feel hope. They finally had someone on the inside. “Charlotte was right in the middle of the legislative process, and that was essential,” she says. Elena Michael, co-founder ofNot Your Porn, which supports victims of intimate image abuse and campaigns for change, agrees. “For a decade, the victims and experts working in the field have been kept in separate rooms to the people making the laws, and the laws we’ve had just haven’t worked,” she says. “When the government doesn’t listen to survivors, they’re not just devaluing their experience, they’re also discarding their expertise. These women have had to fight for years. There’s nothing they don’t know about what change is needed.View image in fullscreenElena Michael, co-founder of Not Your Porn.Photograph: Courtesy of Elena Michael“When Charlotte called me up to meet me, I was really excited,” she continues. “From the beginning, she was always about listening and meeting as many victims as she could. She wanted to hear stories and understand every single facet.”The campaign kicked off in February last year, with Owen’s question in the chamber on deepfake porn and why its harms were not deemed serious enough to criminalise. “It’s a good way of seeing if people care about the issue,” says Owen, “and in the House of Lords, people were shocked. There was so much support.”The following month, her speech for International Women’s Day again focused on deepfakes. In May, she was drawn from the private members’ bill ballot and set about creating a bill that was essentially written by the women she had gathered together. It criminalised the making of sexually explicit deepfakes and the requesting of them. It was consent-based – if the deepfake was made without consent, it was a crime; the intentions behind it made no difference. It included forced deletion – anyone convicted of creating a deepfake image would be forced to delete it. This was crucial, given one victim’s experience when, after a conviction for intimate image abuse, police returned devices to her perpetrator with the images still on them. “Every single line represented a woman’s real experience,” says Owen.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Owen in the House of Lords chamber in November 2023.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty ImagesAll those women, including Jodie, were invited to the Lords for briefings and attended all the subsequent debates. “That was the most poignant part,” says Owen. “The Lords were blown away by these brilliant women. When they sat in the gallery, lots of the peers referenced them in their subsequent speeches.” There was strong cross-party support but by its second reading the government indicated it would not support it, as it wanted to address the issue itself. “We were gutted,” says Owen. “But I don’t really take no for an answer.”Instead, Owen took the contents of the bill and tabled them as amendments to the data bill that was already before the Lords. (“It was the perfect opening,” she says.) The government response was initially an insistence on writing its own amendment instead, but its first attempt did not make the offence consent-based, instead linking the offence to specific intentions. After a lot of argument, including a dossier from McGlynn, itU-turned.“By now, everything was moving so fast. We were messaging and meeting and updating pretty much all the time,” says Jodie. Every element they were asking for was met with resistance, so required more presentations, new evidence, legal argument, extra briefings.Being with these women who were all so passionate, and who just got it – they have healed me. It’s as simple as thatWhile the government agreed to criminalise the creation of deepfakes, it initially objected to criminalising the requesting of them. Early drafts also applied a statutory time limit to the offence, which meant it could only be prosecuted within six months of being committed. (Many victims don’t discover the images online until outside that time frame.) Iman Mazhari – an abuse survivor and volunteer with Not Your Porn – spotted this at the 11th hour. Her perpetrator had escaped a harassment charge (but was convicted of others) because it “timed out”, so she is, she says, “obsessed with statutory time limits”. Mazhari emailed McGlynn, who drafted a clause that Owen added to the amendment with days to spare.View image in fullscreenIman Mazhari.Photograph: Courtesy of Iman MazhariAnother point of conflict with the government was whether or not the crime should carry a possible prison sentence – the government first opposed this, but Owen believed it was essential as a deterrent. (In her speech, she pointed out that you can go to prison for fly-tipping. Why was the violation of someone’s consent less important?) “Every single word, every line, we were arguing over,” says Owen.When the bill passed in June, Jodie was watching from the balcony with other survivors of deepfake abuse and McGlynn. “Charlotte left the chamber and sat up there with us,” she says. “It was a gorgeous evening. It felt like we were in a film, and at the end of it, we had a glass of champagne and toasted all the women who had worked for this.“On the way home, on the tube by myself, the enormity of it really hit me and I just sobbed. We’d fought so hard and achieved so much. Being with these women who were all so passionate, and who just got it – they have healed me. It’s as simple as that.”It’s not the end, of course. The new law still needs to be fully implemented and as yet there is no date on this. “There’s so much more to do,” says McGlynn. There will also certainly be future forms of AI abuse not covered by this legislation. “If I had my way, I’d introduce a general legal provision that would cover all forms of intimate violation and intimate intrusion so we don’t need to start a new campaign every single time the technology moves on and the abuse changes,” say McGlynn. “We also need better processes to get material removed swiftly and easily, and hold non-compliant platforms to account.“Still, this is significant progress,” she adds. “We’re now able to say, ‘Creating this stuff without consent is wrong.’ It’s unlawful and it’s wrong. The message is clear and that’s great.”*Not her real nameIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

This is on top of a £300 daily penalty until it responds to requests for information or for a maximum of 60 days.Ofcom has opened investigations into 92 online services since the new rules were introduced. It is prioritising sites with millions of monthly UK visitors and, according to the level of harm that they may pose.Oliver Griffiths, group director of online safety at Ofcom, told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 the fine was part of a “broader tide turning” in cleaning up platforms, including the “wholesale” adoption of age checks across pornography sites tackling child sexual abuse material.Griffiths added that more than 90 websites were still under investigation for potential breaches of the act, including 83 pornography sites, and further fines were imminent.Ofcom also said one major social media company, which it did not name, may face formal action if it did not improve its compliance procedures. The unnamed platform has submitted inadequate risk assessments, where a website must gauge the risk of illegal content such as fraud and illegal pornography appearing in front of users.“We have gone back and told them they have to do a reassessment,” said Griffiths. “If they haven’t taken this seriously again then we will be going straight into enforcement.”Ofcom also revealed it is reviewing an unnamed major platform’s systems for taking down illegal terror and hate content, including antisemitic and anti-Muslim material, and could take enforcement action.The Online Safety Act brought in a new set of laws aimed at protecting children and adults from harmful content, with breaches of the act carrying the potential punishment of a fine of £18m or 10% of annual revenue – or being shut down in the UK.More than half of the top 100 most popular adult services in the UK had introduced age checks since the new rules came into force in July, as well as social media platforms such as X, TikTok and Reddit, the regulator said. Griffiths acknowledged a surge in use ofvirtual private networks[VPNs], which allow people to circumvent a country’s restrictions on viewing certain websites, from 600,000 people to more than 1 million when age checks came in, but said the number was now “significantly” under 1 million.“There has been some increase [in VPN use] but not wholesale and there’s been someinteresting research… showing that it doesn’t seem like children are the big pickup in those numbers,” he said.The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said: “Since the enforcement of the Online Safety Act, platforms have finally started taking responsibility for protecting children and removing illegal and hateful content.“Ofcom has the government’s full backing to use all its powers to ensure that services put users’ safety first. Keeping children safe online is this government’s and my personal priority.”Explore more on these topicsPornographyOfcomChildrenYoung peopleInternet safetySocial mediaRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Could they derail Australia’s net zero ambitions?Read moreTechnology companies, including Open AI and Atlassian, are pushing for Australia to become a hub for data processing and storage. But with 260 datacentres operating and dozens more in the offing, experts are flagging concerns about the impact on the supply of drinking water.Sydney Water has estimated up to 250 megalitres a day would be needed to service the industry by 2035 (a larger volume than Canberra’s totaldrinking water).Cooling requires ‘huge amount of water’Prof Priya Rajagopalan, director of the Post Carbon Research Centre at RMIT, says water and electricity demands of datacentres depend on the cooling technology used.“If you’re just using evaporative cooling, there is a lot of water loss from the evaporation, but if you are using chillers, there is no water loss but it requires a huge amount of water to cool,” she says.While older datacentres tend to rely on air cooling, demand for more computing power means higher server rack density so the output is warmer, meaning centres have turned to water for cooling .The amount of water used in a datacentre can vary greatly. Some centres, such as NextDC, are moving towards liquid-to-chip cooling, which cools the processor or GPU directly instead of using air or water to cool the whole room.NextDC says it has completed an initial smaller deployment of the cooling technology but it has the capacity to scale up for ultra-high-density environments to allow for greater processing power without an associated rise in power consumption because liquid cooling is more efficient. The company says its modelling suggests power usage effectiveness (PUE, a measure of energy efficiency) could go as low as 1.15.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterThe datacentre industry accounts for its sustainability with two metrics: water usage effectiveness (WUE) and power usage effectiveness (PUE). These measure the amount of water or power used relative to computing work.WUE is measured by annual water use divided by annual IT energy use (kWh). For example, a 100MW datacentre using 3ML a day would have a WUE of 1.25. The closer the number is to 1, the more efficient it is. Several countries mandate minimum standards. Malaysia has recommended a WUE of 1.8, for example.But even efficient facilities can still use large quantities of water and energy, at scale.NextDC’s PUE in the last financial year was 1.44, up from 1.42 the previous year, which the company says “reflects the dynamic nature of customer activity across our fleet and the scaling up of new facilities”.Calls for ban on use of drinking waterSydney Water says its estimates of datacentre water use are being reviewed regularly. The utility is exploring climate-resilient and alternative water sources such as recycled water and stormwater harvesting to prepare for future demand.“All proposed datacentre connections are individually assessed to confirm there is sufficient local network capacity and operators may be required to fund upgrades if additional servicing is needed,” a Sydney Water spokesperson says.In its submission to the Victorian pricing review for 2026 to 2031, Melbourne Water noted that hyperscale datacentre operators that have put in applications for connections have “projected instantaneous or annual demands exceeding nearly all top 30 non-residential customers in Melbourne”.“We have not accounted for this in our demand forecasts or expenditure planning,” Melbourne Water said.It has sought upfront capital contributions from the companies so the financial burden of works required “does not fall on the broader customer base”.Greater Western Water in Victoria had 19 datacentre applications on hand, according to documentsobtained by the ABC, and provided to the Guardian.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The groups havecalled fora ban on the use of drinking water for cooling, and mandatory public reporting of water use for all centres.“We would strongly advocate for the use of recycled water for datacentres rather than potable drinking water.”Closed-loop coolingIn hotter climates, such as large parts of Australia during the summer months, centres require more energy or water to keep cool.Danielle Francis, manager of customer and policy at the Water Services Association of Australia, says there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach for how much energy and water datacentres use because it will depend on the local constraints such as land, noise restrictions and availability of water.“We’re always balancing all the different customers, and that’s the need for residential areas and also non-residential customers, as well as of course environmental needs,” Francis says.“It is true that there are quite a lot of datacentre applications. And the cumulative impact is what we have to plan for … We have to obviously look at what the community impact of that is going to be.“And sometimes they do like to cluster near each other and be in a similar location.”Revealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areasRead moreOne centre under construction in Sydney’s Marsden Park is a 504MW datacentre spanning 20 hectares, with six four-storey buildings. The CDC centre will become the largest data campus in the southern hemisphere, the company has boasted.In the last financial year, CDC used 95.8% renewable electricity in its operational datacentres, and the company boasts a PUE of 1.38 and a WUE of 0.01. A spokesperson for the company says it has been able to achieve this through a closed-loop cooling system that eliminates ongoing water draw, rather than relying on the traditional evaporative cooling systems.“The closed-loop systems at CDC are filled once at the beginning of their life and operate without ongoing water draw, evaporation or waste, ensuring we are preserving water while still maintaining thermal performance,” a spokesperson says.“It’s a model designed for Australia, a country shaped by drought and water stress, and built for long-term sustainability and sets an industry standard.”Planning documents for the centre reveal that, despite CDC’s efforts, there remains some community concern over the project.In a June letter, the acting chief executive of the western health district ofNew South Wales, Peter Rophail, said the development was too close to vulnerable communities, and the unprecedented scale of the development was untested and represented an unsuitable risk to western Sydney communities.“The proposal does not provide any assurance that the operation can sufficiently adjust or mitigate environmental exposures during extreme heat weather events so as not to pose an unreasonable risk to human health,” Rophail said.Explore more on these topicsWaterAustralian climate and environment in focusArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingVictoriaNew South WalesEnergy (Environment)Energy (Australia news)featuresShareReuse this content"

He deserves to stay in AmericaFrancine ProseIn a more reasonable, more compassionate country, we would thank Ali Faqirzada for how much he has done on behalf of his people and our ownThu 4 Dec 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 11.13 ESTShareOn 14 October, Ali Faqirzada – an Afghan refugee, a resident of New Paltz, New York, and a computer science student at Bard College – arrived for an interview at a federal immigration office on Long Island. He was applying for political asylum, a designation for which he was – and remains – a perfect candidate.In his native country, Faqirzada had assisted the American government and Nato with projects designed to improve the lives of Afghan women and help them get an education. But after the US withdrawal fromAfghanistanin 2021, the ministry where he, his mother and sister had worked was bombed by the Taliban, and one of its employees was murdered.Understandably concerned that they would be tortured and killed like so many Afghans targeted by the Taliban for their cooperation with humanitarian agencies, the Faqirzadas made their way to Mexico, and from there to the US, where they immediately applied for refugee status. Six family members have already been granted asylum after having successfully made the case that repatriation to their Taliban-controlled homeland would probably mean a death sentence.When Ali Faqirzada went for his 14 October interview, it seemed probable that his petition would also be approved. According to Malia Dumont, a military veteran formerly deployed in Afghanistan and now chief of staff and vice-president for strategy and policy at Bard, Ali is a brilliant, generous, community-minded student who has worked in New York state as a hospital security guard, a position of great trust and responsibility.In a more reasonable, more compassionate country, the immigration official would have walked around the table, shaken Faqirzada’s hand, and thanked him for how much he has done on behalf of his people and our own. In a more recognizably American country, the interviewer would have congratulated Ali on how obviously he is thriving in his adopted land and on the good chance that he will go on to make valuable contributions to our society.But that is not what happened. That is not how the story went in Donald Trump and Stephen Miller’s America. Immediately following his interview, during which he convinced the authorities that his claim of “credible fear” was justified, Faqirzada was arrested by ICE agents and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, a for-profit prison operated by the GEO Group. He has been there ever since, in a cell with 12 other men, where his access to books, water, and halal food has been severely restricted. According to visitors, he has devoted his energies to maintaining the morale and the welfare of his fellow inmates.The merits of Ali’s case and the sheer absurdity of the suggestion that the genial, well-liked college student could pose any sort of terrorist threat has prompted an outpouring of popular support.Among his advocates are Leon Botstein, president of Bard College and himself a refugee from the Nazis, who has stated that wisest course in such situations is to be as vocal – to make as much noise – as possible. Others who have spoken out on Faqirzada’s behalf include the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, Congressman Pat Ryan, a Democrat of New York, the communities of New Paltz and Stone Ridge, New York, and the Episcopal bishop Matthew Heyd, who led a vigil in November outside Delaney Hall.Their efforts to free Faqirzada have been complicated by a 29 November government ruling that has paused the final approval of all asylum applications. It’s the newest and most drastic addition to a series of recent measures – including the temporary cessation of the US Refugee Admissions Program on 20 January – that have made the process of asylum-seeking steadily more challenging. In addition, there is now a pause on new immigration from Afghanistan and on the issuing of green cards to Afghans already residing in the United States. Decisions on the granting of asylum are made by the Department of Homeland Security and not the judiciary, thus making it easier for the Trump administration to drastically curtail the flow of refugees.The sweeping new changes targeting Afghans were enacted in the aftermath of the tragic Washington DC shooting of two national guard soldiers, one fatally, by an Afghan national who had worked with the CIA and whose application for asylum had been thoroughly vetted and approved.Common sense – a trait that the Republican party has claimed as an essential aspect of their political agenda – suggests that a genial, kind-hearted, highly motivated computer science student and hospital security guard should not be held accountable for someone else’s crime. Nor should the entire Afghan community, many members of which have fled great danger at home, be punished for the actions of one man and made to worry about whatever safety and stability they have managed to find in our country. There is great confusion, uncertainty and a dispiriting lack of clarity about what precisely these new measures mean and how to proceed from here.Many questions remain about Ali Faqirzada’s detention. How long will he continue to be held prisoner at Delaney Hall? How will the new rulings affect his chances of being granted the protections he clearly deserves? But perhaps the most important questions are the ones that we have been asking ourselves since January 2025 and that we will likely ask ourselves for years to come. How did we let this happen – and what can we do about it now?Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionAfghanistanUS foreign policyUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Misogyny is an ever-evolving idiom, and men and women alike have found particularly of-the-moment ways to operate within the genre. Think ofthe appsthat take images of women and remove their clothes, or the AI bots that men and boys can use to generatepornographyor depictions ofgraphic violenceagainst women and girls for the crime of going to the same school as they do or running for office. Think of the influencers of the so-called “womanosphere” who tell their female audiences that women who seek out friendship or equality with men are morons or cows, all through the gleam of a TikTok filter. Sexism may be the world’s oldest prejudice and its first unjust hierarchy, but it is continually innovating, adapting to new technologies and the most recent rhetorical needs of male supremacy.But some of the forms of misogyny that have been bubbling up in American political discourse lately can seem a bit retro. I don’t just mean thetradwives, who dress alternately like June Cleaver or like Ma Ingalls from Little House on the Prairie – evoking bygone eras, or at least the ways those eras are depicted on television. And I don’t just mean the pro-natalists, either, who donweird bonnetsand proposenational breeding medalsfor prolific mothers. Since last month’s massive election victories for Democrats, some on the right have looked to revive a form of sexism that has been out of fashion for more than one hundred years: the idea that women should not have a right to vote.More and more, influential voices in the Maga movement and the far-right Republican party are calling to strip women of the franchise. It’s not that this is strictly a new development. Opposition to women’s voting rights has long been a fringe, but persistent, feature of the American right. It’s been a favorite hobby horse of extremist preachers; it trended among Trump supporters on social mediain thelead-up to the2016election, when polls showed that Trump would win if only men voted. (As it happened, he won anyway.) In the century that followed the passage of the 19th amendment – which barred the United States or any state from restricting the vote on the basis of sex, and enfranchised hundreds of thousands of women when it was ratified in 1920 – opposition to women’s right to vote has simmered at the extreme edges of political opinion.It was kept alive in large part in ultra-conservative Christian communities, which tend to cast women as something between children and property. Claiming women to be intellectually and morally unfit for citizenship, these sects declared that women should withdraw from the public sphere, including from political participation, and submit to the rule of their husbands.Joel Webbon, a pastor and YouTube personality, has been at the forefront of this brand of misogynist Christian reaction. (Webbon claims not to be a misogynist but is rather a self-identified “sexist”; what he imagines the difference to be is not entirely clear.) In 2022, just before the nation’s first post-Dobbs midterm elections,he tweeted: “The 19th Amendment was a bad idea.” He is broadly opposed to women’s participation in the political realm,saying in an interviewlast year that “God has not designed women for warfare, and that’s part of what politics is – it’s really all that politics is, it’s war without the blood”. (That war is not politics would be news, I think, to those who have waged it, women among them.)Dale Partridge, also a pastor, justified his own opposition to women’s suffrage using a term of art that has become popular on the fringe right: “I think we should repeal the 19th Amendment because I love America and American women,”he said, “and want to protect our nation from theirsuicidal empathy.”(Emphasis mine.) Here, women are cast as supposedly naturally, inherently more empathetic than men are – and this, in turn, is undesirable, indeedsuicidal. It is something of a back-handed compliment.Like the racist “great replacement” theory and other strains of white nationalism, the opposition to women’s suffrage has entered the mainstream as the Republican party has radicalized. In August, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, who has been accused of sexual assault,reposted a videoin which pastors explain their opposition to women’s right to vote, with the caption “All of Christ for All of Life” – aChristian nationalist slogan. (Hegseth, who denied the allegation,reached a settlementwith the alleged victim.)But in recent decades, a more secular brand of anti-suffrage feeling has also challenged women’s voting rights, this one emerging from the strains of the right invested in biological determinism – a set of commitments ranging from evolutionary psychology to eugenics. This worldview tends to cast women as inferior not due to divine mandate, but due to nature, which, it is claimed, has made them either too stupid or too irresponsible for the vote.Helen Andrews, a rightwing magazine editor whose recent pieceThe Great Feminizationsuggests women’s presence in public life may pose “a threat to civilization”, claims women have “evolved” toward several various and seemingly contradictory habits – too empathetic and consensus-based, on the one hand, and too gossipy, conniving and passive-aggressive, on the other. The logical conclusion to Andrews’s argument is that women should be immediately excluded from political life and from all major institutions; perhaps lacking the courage of her convictions, she does not argue women should be deprived of citizenship, instead proposing a shift of public life towards further male dominance – claiming, for instance, that “the rule of law will not survive the legal profession becoming majority female”. In describing women as an obstacle to conservative priorities, she echoes Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist, rightwing mega-donor and longtime mentor to JD Vance, whowrote in 2009that his ideal libertarian world had been rendered politically unfeasible by “the extension of the franchise to women”. (Helater seemed to contradict this, sayinghe did not “think any class should be disenfranchised”.)These two assertions – that women are ordained by God to be men’s inferiors, or that they have been designed by nature to be men’s inferiors – use pseudoscience, lies and heresy to conceal their plain sexist bigotry behind a thin veneer of patronizing condescension. They claim, implausibly – with the sneering tone of a cartoon villain baring his rotting teeth at a child hero – to be looking to strip women of their rights, freedoms and dignity for their own good.But they are now joined by a third strain of anti-suffrage sentiment: that of undisguised misogynist contempt. A growing number of rightwing influencers simply state that they feel that women should not vote because they hate women, and want women to be subjected to male domination. Andrew Tate, the men’s rights influencer andalleged human trafficker, posted in September to his X account: “Stop letting women vote, stop giving women position as judges, stop giving women political appointments … WOMEN: giving you political and social power is how we ended up here.”The opponents of women’s suffrage have, for now, no way of enacting their ambition: there is no path to repealing the 19th amendment. But they are part of a growing movement to blame women’s advancement – and their increased access, participation and visibility in education, the workforce, politics and public life – for a slew of social problems, from political polarization to economic stagnation to a vague sense of spiritual anomie. As Jessica Winter recently pointed out inthe New Yorker, in a piece on the centrist pundits who have declared a crisis of men, this sentiment – that women’s citizenship and status should be lower, and that recognizing it has hurt the country – is peddled by thinkers and writers far more respectable than the likes of Webbon or Tate. “The [New York] Times pundit Ezra Klein has lately suggested that Democrats consider running anti-abortion candidates in red states, even though more than three-quarters of Gen Z women support abortion rights,” Winter writes. “Rights, like jobs, can be gender-coded, and these rights are valued accordingly.”This range of sexisms that have attained mainstream credibility in politics and the press rest on one assumption: that women’s citizenship is partial and conditional compared with men’s, that we have less of a claim on rights, dignity and public participation than our brothers do. That this assumption is even held is an insult to women’s dignity; that it is now so blithely accepted is a sign of how far women’s status has already sunk.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionUS voting rightsGenderFeminismcommentShareReuse this content"

But it won’t be able to for everMartin KettleIn the 21st-century imbalance of power, Europe and Nato have neither the arms nor the wealth to impel Russia or the US to take its peace settlement seriouslyThu 4 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 06.58 ESTShareThe failure ofthis week’s peace talksbetween Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff fits into a now well-established pattern of standoffs on Ukraine during Trump’s second term. But the dynamic that produced these talks may be becoming more entrenched. The US andRussian interestsdriving the process have not changed, while the conflict on the ground is intensifying. The lack of progress this week means there will be another attempt to end the war soon, and perhaps another after that, until, one day, there is some kind of US-backed deal to halt the conflict onterms broadly favouring Russia.The geopolitical algorithm driving this effort is too consistent to ignore. It has been repeated ever since Trump re-entered the White House in January. On the campaign trail, Trump had claimed he couldstop the war in a day. That was never going to happen. But from 12 February onwards, whenTrump first talked directly to Putinabout Ukraine, the intention and approach have not altered. There is no reason to suppose they will do so now. Indeed, Tuesday’s impasse may spur them on again.The internal logic of the interactions that have brought us to this point is familiar by now. Trump refuses to give arms toUkraine. Instead he attempts a bilateral deal with Putin to stop the war at Ukraine’s territorial expense. Russia bombs Ukraine and makes attritional battlefield progress. Ukraine and its other allies mobilise to challenge any emerging pro-Russian deal. The US rebalances its plans to take account of the objections. Talks take place. Putin says no deal. The war continues, but so does the diplomacy.As this process repeats itself, as it will, one of two things will happen. Either the process will be recognised as achieving nothing, or some aspect of it will be changed to make an outcome more likely. The first option, abandonment of the process, is a possibility, but this would mean humiliation for Trump. It would also mean the war would intensify and become more lethal, destructive and destabilising. Pressures to stop it would thus recur, leading to the resumption of the US diplomatic effort, but from a weaker position than today.The Russia-Ukraine peace deal is not a loss. Nor is it a victory | Stephen WertheimRead moreThe second option, the alteration or bypassing of some aspect of the process, therefore seems more likely. This inevitably places Nato and Europe firmly in the crosshairs of Moscow, in particular, and also of Washington. It explainswhy the Kremlin hintedyesterday that there were still agreements worth making – agreements, in other words, between Russia and the US, from which Europe is excluded. Putin could not be clearer that he sees Europe as Trump’s weak link. “Europe is preventing the US administration from achieving peace on Ukraine,” he said before the talks with Witkoff this week. “They are on the side of war,” he said a little later. “Russia does not intend to fight Europe, but if Europe starts, we are ready right now.”Some of this is nonsense. But Putin’s key insight is right. Europe – more accurately Nato minus the US – is indeed managing to frustrate Trump from making the kind of deal with Putin that he wants. The Nato allies’ consistent dedication to this task has not been widely celebrated, for fear of provoking Trump, but it is impossible to miss. The effort has been intense, from the moment that Trump and JD Vance publiclyabused Volodymyr Zelenskyyduring his Oval Office visit on 28 February. It has also been more or less successful.This so-called “coalition of the willing” has the power to wound US-Russia plans, but it lacks the power to shape them. The coalition involves most European nations, plus Canada, all of whom have committed to material support for postwar Ukraine. Its aims have been pursued ad hoc, and partly within Nato, as in yesterday’sforeign ministers’ meetingat Nato HQ in Brussels, from which the US secretary of stateMarco Rubio was conspicuously absent.Either way, the European scramble on Ukraine’s behalf has repeatedly managed to hold the line against Trump and Putin. It did so again this week when the Witkoff plan was tweaked before the Putin meeting. Hugging Zelenskyy closer has been a key part of this effort ever since the Oval Office disaster. It would be surprising if Zelenskyy was not being intensively advised and consulted by the allies at almost every turn. I would bet that, if we ever get access to a log of his messages, memos, meetings and travels, we will find that Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, plays a big role in this effort.Yet this cannot and will not continue indefinitely. The central problem for both Ukraine and Europe is that the 21st-century imbalance of power is turned against them. In this new imbalance, Europe and Nato have not enough arms, power or wealth to leverage an alternative peace settlement thatRussiaand the US are compelled to take seriously or accept. The postwar idea of the west may not be dead, but it is in intensive care. European and some American surgeons are battling with all the skill at their disposal to keep it alive. The truth, though, is that Trump could very easily pull the plug tomorrow.If that were to happen, the danger of Russian troops eventually marching down Whitehall might remain remote. But the threat to Kyiv’s main street, Khreshchatyk, would undoubtedly increase. Whether Trump grasps this, or cares, is hard to say. It is not impossible that an effective Ukrainian government, whether headed by Zelenskyy or not, could continue to function and win the financial and military support of international backers to begin reconstruction. Much would depend on whether the west’s frozen Russian assets,worth £253bn, ended up in Kyiv or are returned to Moscow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Nato nations would all still have their weapons and armed forces. They would retain their commitment to an independent Ukraine and to their common values. They would also continue to possess what the London-based historian Georgios Varouxakis, author of the widely praised The West: The History of an Idea,calls their “capacity for self-criticism and self-correction”. But the strategic self-correction required of Europe in the absence of a fully committed US partner would be arduous, and could involve a price tag that few European nations and voters would be willing to pay.It may not be true, yet, that Trump’s US has reached a fateful fork in the road, where it decides to choose between Europe and Ukraine on the one hand, and Russia on the other. But that place and that moment are getting closer than at any time since 1945. The looming tragedy is that history has conferred upon Europe a role in support of Ukraine that it is ultimately unable to fulfil to anything like the degree required.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionNatoEuropean UnionTrump administrationVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

We all need better evidenceWes StreetingThe surge in mental ill health is hugely distressing. That’s why I’ve commissioned a review to find out what’s driving itThu 4 Dec 2025 12.34 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 12.39 ESTShareEarlier this year, I appeared on the BBC and was asked a question by Laura Kuenssberg that I hadn’t anticipated: did I believe there’s a problem withmental health overdiagnosis?I gave a simple answer, that yes, I did think there was overdiagnosis, that too many people were being written off, and too many people weren’t getting the support they needed.I was then deluged with messages and emails of both enthusiastic agreement and visceral disagreement – including from mental health clinicians on both sides of the argument. One angry patient messaged to say: “Far from overdiagnosis, I can’t even get an appointment to get a diagnosis.” The worst thing was that I agreed with them, but I had failed to capture the complexity of this problem.The truth is there has been a massive growth in mental health and behavioural issues and there isn’t a consensus within the mental health clinical community on what is driving it. There was an almost 50% increase inmental health problemsamong adults between 1993 and 2023. Mental health referrals for children and young peopleincreased by about 50%in just two years during the pandemic. And13 times morepeople are waiting for an autism assessment today compared with 2019.Whether this is because people are more open about their mental health, there is growing awareness of these conditions, these are consequences of the pandemic or there have been other drivers, we have got to get to the bottom of the causes of this.Because services are not keeping up.As the Darzi investigation uncovered, around 109,000 young people and children were waiting more than a year for their first appointment with a mental health specialist. This is despite an increase in spending on mental health services bymore than 50% since 2019.I know from the personal experience of some of my nearest and dearest the pain this is causing. One has attempted to take their own life after struggling to get any mental health support. A family member has suffered fromthe shortages of medicationfor attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, seriously affecting his mental health. At the same time, I have seen the transformational impact an early autism diagnosis can have for the support and education a child receives.It was following my own episode with foot-in-mouth syndrome on live television that I decided this issue was too important to be left unresolved and required a proper evidence base. That’s why my department has asked the esteemed Prof Peter Fonagy, along with Sir Simon Wessely and Prof Gillian Baird, tolead a reviewinto the prevalence and support for mental health conditions, autism and ADHD. The review brings together some of the most respected researchers, clinicians and voluntary organisations in the country, alongside people with lived experience.I’ve asked them to weigh the data, examine the quality of evidence, diagnose the problem and offer recommendations on how theNHScan meet the needs of all.I’m delighted that this review is backed by Mind, the MentalHealthFoundation, the National Autistic Society, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner for England. All can see the current system is failing, and are motivated by the need to fix it. As Dr Sarah Hughes, Mind’s chief executive, said: “This is a huge opportunity to really understand what is driving increasing levels of mental illness, especially among our young people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even if it means 300 attempts at conversation with other tired parentsThu 4 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 14.26 ESTShareWhen my beautiful firstborn turned one, about 70 people came to the pub to celebrate. There were drinks, there were meals, there were balloons, there was singing. They were celebratingme. Since then, his birthdays have become about him and his friends and the quality of the event has spiralled precipitously.These days, with two kids out in society, kids’ birthday parties dominate our family’s schedule. Barely a weekend goes by without a scramble to find a gift that’s appropriate, I’m getting increasingly desperate for some form of wrapping apparatus, and I have long given up on cards.When we arrive at a party, the gorging begins. I consider myself on the chill end of the spectrum yet even I can feel the teeth deterioration from across the room. The only thing worse than this is a “sugar-free” event, which should be a reportable offence.The most gastronomically memorable kid’s party I attended had a coffee cart for the parents. I’ll probably never know a joy like that for the rest of my days.Ditch the balloons and swap the plastic toys for cake: how to have a waste-free birthday partyRead moreBirthday parties allow me to observe my kids’ interactions with other kids – like David Attenborough with a wide-angle lens. A sort of mania takes over until they exhaust themselves and agree to be carted away.What chance do they have when they’re surrounded by self-conscious, tired parents making conversation with all the ease of undergoing a pap smear? How are the little ones supposed to learn social graces when their role models are trying to make small talk with parents they don’t know from a bar of soap and who screech “Oi!” mid-sentence to break up a dispute or get their kids out of a tree?There is a promised land, where the kids can be deposited at a party and I can spend the time quietly meditating or scrolling my phone. I have not yet arrived there but other parents tell me it exists, and it sounds akin to paradise.My kids’ demands when it comes to their own parties have become louder. The days of a sheet-pan brownie with a single candle in it are no longer acceptable. Now a theme must be adhered to, their interests reflected, their wishes regarding the guest list and (infinite) balloon quantity heard.And now the other kids talk back. They ask questions. They have requests. They seem to miss that a couple of years ago I actually grew a human being from my flesh and, despite not being built for it whatsoever, successfully delivered this human being into this realm. I get very little credit for this at these events. Pointing this out is not well received by five-year-olds.Instead the kids tear around, create an 80-decibel environment and have elaborate beefs that flare up and dissolve in an instant. They ignore that they are coeliac, invent new games, inevitably leave someone out, try to blow out the candles.Sometimes they even provide feedback – imagine!I do my bit: blowing up balloons until I’m dizzy, putting out a sugar-rich spread, frantically cleaning, worrying nobody will come, freaking out when they do. I have 300 attempts at a conversation, none of which go beyond a few sentences.Despite my inability to gracefully host a few sweet kids and adults, the fact that my kids have lived another year is a triumph. They grow, they change, they stay the same, they ask perplexing questions, they go to school, they have parts of their lives that I am not a part of. It’s scary and it should be celebrated.As society becomes increasingly weird – moderated through our phones and where we often don’t know our neighbours – kids’ parties can be part of the cure. They build real-world relationships and our kids’ friends at these agescould be part of our lives for ever. Every connection is a new or potential friend in our area. What could be more social than celebrating life’s mundane milestones?After all, the worst part of a party is not being invited.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilyAustralian lifestyleChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

Here is the truth of the matterJonathan SwarbrickFrom income to home ownership and public services, everybody is disgruntled – but for different reasonsThu 4 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 11.53 ESTShareThe British economy has endured a series of setbacks in recent years: austerity, Brexit, the global pandemic, soaring energy prices and an increasingly fractured and uncertain world. The early optimism that accompanied Labour’s election victory faded quickly, witha recent pollranking Rachel Reeves as the worst chancellor in modern history.But is this fair? Is the economy really in as bad a shape as people feel?WagesA good place to start is with recent trends in inflation and wage growth. If prices rise faster than wages, we feel the pinch as the cost of living rises.Price inflationshot upin the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, sharply eroding the spending power of our salaries.Wage inflation has nowcaught up with price inflation, with strong income growth for all but the very poorest. On paper, that should have eased the cost of living pressures for most people. So why does our everyday experience tell us something different?When we measure headline inflation, we average across all the different types of goods people buy. This is problematic since price inflation hits different items in different ways, and many frequent purchases are still relatively expensive.Even though our wageshave grownfaster than the prices ofelectronicsandclothing, average incomes have not kept pace with the cost of essentials such asfoodandhousing. And even if things balance out overall, we might tend to anchor our sense of the cost of living on a few frequent purchases – a takeaway coffee, or the price of eggs.And this uneven inflation matters. Poorer households tend to spend more of their income on precisely those goods with prices that have risen the most: rent, energy and food. They are then hit twice over: exposed to the sharpest inflation and facing the weakest income growth.AssetsAs well as income, we also judge how well we are doing in relation to the assets we own and our personal wealth. Take the housing market. The house-price-to-income ratio hasmore than doubledsince the 1990s, and most people cannot afford the kind of home their parents bought at the same stage of life. And for a growing number, buying at all is out of reach. We actually havemore real disposable incomethan previous generations thanks to strong income growth and low inflation in the early 2000s – but housing has become far more fraught.Years of (necessary) expansionary monetary policies have boosted the value of financial assets, such as property, and widened wealth inequality. Years of easy money flowed into property as well as equities, and this liquidity, combined with a housing stock that has not kept pace, has driven prices ever higher and worsened the affordability squeeze. While, for most, owning a home is an aspiration; for international investors it isjust another financial asset.Public servicesAn underresourced NHS and strained public services are further sources of deep dissatisfaction. Waiting timeshave been risingacross a host of services, from A&E and ambulances to scheduled treatments. The UK has fewer practising doctors per 1,000 people thanmost EU countries, and fewer dentists thanall but one(for which there is available data). Similar comparisons can be made across a whole range of measures.Two big factors stretching public services are a lack of investment and anageing population. Pension systems were built on assumptions of fast growth and shorter lives. In a world of lower economic growth in which people are living longer and demanding more healthcare, that model no longer works.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The poorest are unambiguously worse off, withlower real incomesthan 20 years ago. And while those on low to middle incomes have seen their wages grow, they areless likely to own their own homeor have larger mortgages. Both these groups are more likely to rely on public services than those on higher incomes, and so are experiencing a tangible fall in living standards.There is a growing sense of discontent among middle- to high-income householdswho contribute an unusually large share of the UK’s tax take. The average worker pays relatively little by international standards, but taxes risemore steeplywith income in the UK than almost anywhere else.So what can the government do? If it wants to get serious about public service improvement and the investment needed to fuel growth potential, then it will probably need even higher taxes.The recent welfare increases will be welcomed by some and rankle with others, but survey evidence suggests many wouldsupport higher taxesif they went towards much-needed spending on the NHS and other public services.Reducing wealth inequality would increase the purchasing power of all but the richest, and most would like to see them contribute more. But wealth is notoriously difficult to tax, and financial capital is very mobile in a global economy. Capital we also need for business investment – vital for growth and missing for years.If the government succeeds in navigating these issues, then we will benefit from a more dynamic economy, rising home ownership and improved public services. If not, the public will give others a go in charge, and those that promise simple solutions are likely to make things worse.Jonathan Swarbrick is a lecturer in economics at the University of St Andrews Business SchoolExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionRachel ReevesLabourInflationcommentShareReuse this content"

But I first heard them given that potentially lethal label – for socialists, at least – shortly after arriving at Your Party’sacrimonious founding conferencein Liverpool last Sunday.The young man who used the words did not seem to be one of the hardbitten leftwing fanatics who had taken over the party,according to most of the press. He was attending his first political conference and enjoying it immensely. Which faction did he think was ahead, I asked, in the weekend’s maze of votes and debates? “Not the Corbynists,” he said with a grin. “But us – the left!”Ever since itschaotic launch in July, Your Party has been seen by many voters and journalists – when they have noticed it at all – as a step-by-step demonstration of the futility of leftwing politics. Through ideological disagreements, disorganisation and delays, domineering personalities and disputes over leadership structure, management of funds and membership data, Your Party has seemingly squandered the opportunity offered by Labour’s rightward shift and record unpopularity. Instead, Zack Polanski’s radicalised Green party has become the preferred vehicle for many leftwing voters, thinkers and activists. Meanwhile, Your Party has been marked, by both enemies and disillusioned potential supporters, for either a quick or lingering death. From this perspective, the Liverpool conference’s onstage rows,open factional divisionsand competing purists of the left simply further confirmed the party’s fate.Yet could it be premature and simplistic to see theYour Partysaga this way? One lesson of British and wider western politics over the past decade, still insufficiently learned by mainstream parties and commentators, is that rebellions should not be written off, even when they seem to be failing or contained. In discontented times, with conventional politics widely disliked and increasingly discredited, revolts against it can subside and then flare up again, or leave remnants that fuel more insurrections. From Scottish nationalism to Euroscepticism and Corbynism, rebellions have survived setbacks to reappear in new, sometimes stronger forms. Your Party’s messy existence might be a beginning rather than an ending.Over the past year, as I’ve spent time in the milieu that eventually produced the party, I’ve met a striking number of activists who don’t fit the media’s usual leftwing categories. Often quite young but politically experienced, strongly committed to the left but not sectarian, keen on building coalitions rather than maintaining ideological purity, and not particularly reverent towards Corbyn or Your Party’s other leading personality, the MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana, these activists have found the party’s splits and tantrums infuriating.“This whole process has been led from the top by two politicians who have incredibly machiavellian, pushy advisers … engaged in bitter trench warfare,” one of these activists told me, as the conference was getting under way with a disastrous flurry of delegate barrings, ejections and boycotts – most damagingly,by Sultana herself. “Everyone I know who was keen is now totally dejected. We were very close to getting everyone on the grassroots left inside the tent.”Yet on the final day of the conference, he was suddenly much cheerier: “The programme we wanted has won all its votes. Zarah has basically signed up to it.” The party would be led by an elected committee of ordinary members – not by a single leader, as Corbyn and “the right” had wanted – and members would be allowed to be in other political parties as well. “The members have taken control,” Sultana declared to a crowd of journalists, before finally deigning to enter the conference hall.The speech she then made there was intoxicatingly fierce: attacking “the parasites” who own privatised utilities, and the mainstream politicians and corporate interests who would “lead us into fascism to protect their wealth and power”. Your Party, she vowed, would be “a party that belongs not to nameless, faceless, unelected bureaucrats” – a swipe at Corbyn’s advisers – “but to you”. Inadvertently, the speech made the tension between her rare gifts as a communicator – and therefore her tendency to dominate political situations –and her advocacy of Your Party as a collective endeavour very clear. Next year, the party promises to “commence a review into different options for future leadership models”.Before and after she spoke, there were debates about the structure, workings and purpose of the party. The audiences were larger than most of those at this year’s Tory conference, and livelier than at Labour’s. A diverse succession of delegates made combative speeches, ignored the chair’s orders to keep to time limits, and were almost constantly applauded or heckled. The lack of deference towards rules and hierarchies felt startling – and refreshing: a throwback to the unruly Labour conferences of the 1970s, or a prototype for a participatory politics to come.Shortly before the conference, aYouGov poll showedthat 12% of Britons “would consider” voting for Your Party. While down by a third since the party’s launch, the figure was still surprisingly high given the turmoil, and the fact that no party scored more than 29%. Our politics remains in a fragmented and volatile state, not least because Labour, Reform and the Tories share some of Your Party’s problems: divisive leading figures, widely disbelieved approaches to reviving the country, and hostility from most voters.The Greens and Liberal Democrats currently have fewer negative associations. But the Lib Dems’ opportunistic, ambiguous politics is unlikely to lure many of Your Party’s consistently socialist supporters. Meanwhile the Greens, despite Polanski’s canny leftwing populism and appealingly direct manner, can’t match Your Party’s connections to working class, trade union and anti-racist politics. The Greens’ leftward shift is also heavily dependent on Polanski, who has limited powers as leader, and, assuming he wants to carry on, will have to stand for re-election in 2027.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To maximise its chances, the party appears to be moving towards an agreement with the Greens not to stand in each other’s target seats.Was this politics of survival, small gains, and participation as an end in itself, what people were expecting when they started talking about a new leftwing party in packed rooms a year ago? My sense is yes. With good reason, there are fewer wild optimists and more realists on the British left than there used to be.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYour PartyOpinionJeremy CorbynGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

His brutal approach to judging them will have to change, tooThu 4 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 11.48 ESTShareThere is a moment in the trailer for Simon Cowell’s new Netflix show,The Next Act, that is almost touching in its adherence to the way things once were. Cowell, who we see on a variety of beige sofas primly clutching his knees, talks about how to curate a new boyband, 20 years after the launch of his first TV talent show. “There is a huge risk here,” he says, heavy with drama. “If this goes wrong, it will be: ‘Simon Cowell has lost it.’” In fact, as anyone who has an eye on dwindling audience figures for his existing shows knows, for the vast majority of 18- to 24-year-olds – or even for younger millennials – the more likely response will be, “Simon who?”Which doesn’t mean that a new generation of viewers can’t be lured in by Cowell’s expertise. The question of whether 66-year-old Cowell can tweak a dusty and decades-old model has less to do with current music trends – just as well, since pop music has moved from TV to TikTok, which Cowell says he hates – than the music executive’s extremely well-tested ability to make good TV and bend his persona to align with the times. In the rollout of publicity for the new show, Cowell has made a good fist of expressing regret at how rude he used to be to contestants,apologisingin the New York Times, after some cajoling, for “being a dick”, and putting his eye-rolling, grimacing performance as a judge down to the tedium of audition days rather than what most of us understood it to be: the extraction of lolz out of confused individuals who had the misfortune to appear on his shows.Anyway, we’ve heard it all before; Cowell has been making these sorts of noises after being prodded by journalists for a good 15 years now. He made them to me in 2011 whenI visited himat his rental house in the Hollywood Hills, a place of white marble and empty surfaces, and where he spoke about his life from the standpoint of a passive observer. It was, it appeared to me at the time, as if Cowell regarded his personality itself as running on free-market principles over which he had no particular influence – competing elements in which, inevitably, sometimes the baser ones prospered. Whatever the outcome, it came with a shrug and a “What can you do?”It is a babyish dodge common to those who, having done very well, feel under no pressure to explain themselves. Still, I’ve always had a soft spot for Cowell, who combines American drive and ambition with a properly and compellingly odd duck personality that can really only be British. “I’m very odd,” he said at the time. “I am.” The pointy shoes, the funny wardrobe, the awkward physicality; all of which, in the context of LA conformity, still seem to me to be vaguely endearing. You only had to look at the empty mansion to imagine the challenges of that particular interior life. (Cowell has been open about his depression and insomnia.) If he’s a difficult person to work with – and I imagine he is – when Cowell talks about his receptiveness to anyone in his company, from the doorman up, to come to him with a good idea, I believe him.The new show will present an older, softer version of Cowell, whether because that’s who he is these days or because the market requires it, who knows – but it’s a fact communicated in the show by the inclusion of Lauren Silverman, Cowell’s longtime girlfriend and glancing shots of their 11-year-old son, Eric. And while he will, presumably, hold back on all his old judging antics, I’m more curious about the contestants. Namely: what the gen Z, or even gen Alpha boys auditioning for Cowell understand their roles in the new show to be.In their heyday, Cowell’s reality shows were an early precursor to the now common idea of mining your life for content, and I remember very clearly him telling me what a problem it became once contestants realised they’d have a better chance of being picked for X Factor or America’s Got Talent if they had a strong backstory. “I once had a guy,” Cowell said, “who came rushing out on stage and literally shouted, ‘I’ve got cancer!’ Like it was great news. He was so happy that he had a sad story.”The difference these days is that even if the young men competing on Simon Cowell: the Next Act make similar calculations, their social media accounts alone ensure they will have a greater ownership stake in their own stories than their counterparts of the mid-2000s. (Cowell hates phones and claims not to read anything online – augurs well!) The bigger question is whether he can get a face that, like Jeremy Paxman’s, seems in its resting state naturally to describe incredulity, to do something warmer and more friendly, as the era requires. And there it is – the impetus to watch the first episode.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To my right, an officer in the French Foreign Legion types up the daily situation report. In front of me a French gendarme named David is standing in front of a table full of large assault rifles, pointing out locations on a paper map. A generator hums. All around us, splotches of forest dot the hundreds of islands that make up the archipelago of Petit-Saut, a watery ecosystemthree times the size of Paris.Except Paris is 7,000 kilometres away from where I am, in Guyane, or French Guiana,a department ofFrancein South America, just north of the equator.The size of Portugal but with a population of only 300,000, French Guiana sends deputies to the Assemblée Nationale, votes for the French president and prices things in euros. Administratively, it is no different from Brittany, but this region is home to France’s longest land border – with Brazil – and Europe’s only space rocket launch site.The legacy of European colonisation of the “new world” means that France and theEuropean Unionare directly implicated in the fate of one of the world’s most critical havens for biodiversity.Here, in this unlikely fragment of the EU in the Amazon, global crises converge into a paradox: a microcosm of humanity’s failure to deal with the climate crisis and protect biodiversity, despite possessing all the data we need.From French Guiana’s Atlantic coast, the EuropeanSpaceAgency (ESA) launches satellites capable of observing the heating of the planet, the destruction of its forests, the collapse of its ecosystems. But what they see most clearly is the gap between what we know and what we do.Beneath the tree canopy of the Amazon rainforest, illegal gold mining has produced an ecological crisis that ispoisoningFrench citizens. Yet even after two decades and nearly €1bn spent on the deployment of an armed mission involving the Foreign Legion, France cannot bring this activity to an end.The obstacle? A river called the Maroni, France’s border with Suriname, which cuts through sovereignty like a machete, leaving one of the most powerful countries in the world hamstrung. On one side, French and EUhealth and safety law; on the other, a toxic mining supply chain that operates just out of reach, and with impunity. Fortress Europe? Not here, not by a long shot.A map of French Guiana.‘This is what we’re after,” David says, handing me a small plastic bottle with a yellow cap. When I grasp it, my hand drops from the weight: mercury is more than 13 times as dense as water. Bannedsince 2006, because of both the environmental and neurological damage it causes, the toxin is the primary reason why 200 gendarmes and 600-700 soldiers have been deployed in a controversial€55m-a-yearmilitary operation across French Guianarelaunched as Opération Harpiein 2008 by Nicolas Sarkozy, then president. The legionnaires, soldiers and gendarmes (French military-style police) are stuck in a loop of “seek, chase, seize, repeat” with small, often-armed groups ofgarimpeiros–economically desperate, mostly Brazilian, gold prospectors, who use enormous quantities of mercury in pursuit of their dreams of one day striking it rich.It takes me two hours by car from Cayenne, the capital, and then over an hour in a pirogue, a canoe-like vessel with an outboard motor, to arrive at Avant Poste 51 (AP-51), a makeshift jungle camp on one of the islands of Petit-Saut. This is where a detachment of two gendarmes and a dozen legionnaires from the 13ème DBLE string their hammocks every night. Now, I’m observing as they plan tomorrow’s mission.Yesterday, the garimpeiros heard the patrol boat’s motor and fled before the soldiers could get there, David tells me. To avoid that happening again, tomorrow morning he wants to go ahead quietly in a kayak, with the pirogue following a few minutes later. He looks around for feedback from the small group standing around me. They comprise the camp commander, a stocky Frenchman who tells me to call him Chief Nuri; Pavel, the legionnaire boat pilot orpiroguier; a lieutenant in the gendarmerie and the other gendarme posted to AP-51. Operating on French soil, the legionnaires can only act with gendarmes present.“If we find a mining site, take my picture with whatever we seize,” Nuri says to me.I tell him that Harpie’s command have warned me not to photograph the faces of the famously secretive legionnaires – these men from anywhere and everywhere who, while in service with the French Foreign Legion, have no other nationality but the Legion itself.Legio Patria Nostra, as goes the motto of the oft-mythologised, elite military unit that has a history of being deployed to difficult places. The13ème demi-brigade de la Légion étrangère(DBLE) in particular, from itsformation as part of the Free French forcesin 1940, to Indochina in the run-up to the Vietnam war, Algeria in the 1950s and 1960s, and more recently the Sahel when Malirequested French assistanceagainst jihadist groups in the desert in 2013.“To hell with that,” Nuri says. “I didn’t give the Legion the rights to my image. Take my picture. But not now, not when I’m sweaty and wearing Crocs.”Missions undertaken by the Foreign Legion and gendarmes across Petit-SautMissions undertaken by the Foreign Legion and gendarmes across Petit-SautThe French army lieutenant, on the other hand, is definitely not wearing Crocs. His boots are polished, and the knots holding up his hammock are the expert kind with a name. He exudes order and discipline that contrast with the surprisingly laid-back nature of the legionnaires.We’re not to be messed with, their vibe seems to say.And so, to a certain point, we do as we please.With the sun beginning to set on the camp, there is just enough time left to clumsily string up my own hammock, shower in the lake (“All my men shower in the lake, so you too, no exceptions,” the lieutenant tells me) and eat dinner (chicken in a thin stew, cooked by two legionnaires from Nepal). During the night, a low rumble cuts the air like the forced breath of something possessed. In another era, I would think demons stalked the forest from somewhere across the reservoir lake. “Howler monkeys,” the lieutenant says, his hammock a few feet away, the knots perfect, his boots hung upside down on two wooden posts.There’s a humidity in French Guiana that seeps into everything – wood, concrete, skin. Morning beneath the tree canopy is already hot, and the night-time howler monkeys have been replaced with a low-level shriek: the high treble of whistling frogs and a cascade of insects.“L’hygiène, c’est important,” the lieutenant – clearly a stickler even in these unsanitary conditions – insists again as he steps away from his hammock to brush his teeth, his southern French accent as punchy as his obvious scepticism towards the knots I’m now fumbling to untie.By the camp’s dock, the legionnaires are loading bottles of drinking water into the pirogue. At the lieutenant’s insistence, they’re all wearing their standard-issue life vests – though by the end of the day, everyone, including me, has thrown them off because it’s just too hot. I climb in and we depart, trailing the kayak. “Drink, even if you don’t feel thirsty,” David tells me. Half an hour later, the pirogue nears the target spot; David and a legionnaire get in to the kayak and row away. Ten minutes later, another pirogue approaches in the distance, sees us, does a hasty about-face, and runs.View image in fullscreen‘Chief Nuri’ of the French Foreign Legion on patrol in Petit-Saut.Photograph: Alexander Hurst/The GuardianPavel guns the motor, but the other boat, with only three people on board, is lighter and faster. Eventually we find it, half-hidden and overturned, the remains of the garimpeiros’ would-be lunch bobbing in the water. As the legionnaires jump out of the pirogue to give chase on land, the lieutenant hands me a bulletproof vest and warns me to not break away from the single-file line. Several French soldiers have died since Harpie began in 2008, including twoduring a clash with miners in 2012, and another whilecrossing river rapidsthis year. And in 2022, the Guardian journalistDom Philips was murdered, alongside indigenous rights advocate Bruno Pereirawhile reportingon mining, poaching and drug-trafficking in the Javari valley, in the Brazilian Amazon.In the jungle, there is no path. Someone at the front has a machete. Towards the back of the line, I sweat, stumble, try to keep up with the sometimes-run, sometimes-scramble. It’s pushing past 30C, which feels like even more in the humidity and the vest. Over an hour later, we’re back at the overturned pirogue. The legionnaires flip it over, confiscate the motor, tow it to a marsh, where we leave the miners’ boat and two soldiers – just in case the garimpeiros circle back. Then we are off to a different island to search on foot for the same group of prospectors. But for hours, there’s nothing more but a ceaseless sun and the overturned boat, which the legionnaires puncture holes in and sink.Returning to camp in the boat, I try to find out more about just who joinsthe French Foreign Legionin the 21st century, and why. Some are talkative, others are extremely guarded. The Legion has a reputation, at any rate, for taking peopleseeking to escape an old lifeand gain a new one.One of the Nepalis tells me he saw a documentary, and that the money is good. Another says the Legion was more accommodating of a hand injury than the Gurkhas. Paulo, a Brazilian, hit his time limit in the Forças Armadas do Brasil and wanted to keep working as a soldier, but won’t say much more. A legionnaire from Mali would rather tell me about the chilli peppers he’s planted at AP-51 than previous missions he’s been on. As for Chief Nuri, he’ll stay in the Legion as long as he can, he says.By the time we get back to AP-51, it’s near evening. I’ve had six litres of water, but despite thinking I’ve adhered to David’s morning advice, I have a headache anyway. I almost make it out with my dignity intact, but just before boarding the pirogue that will take me back to normal life, heatstroke drops me to my knees and I puke. “Don’t vomit in the pirogue,” the lieutenant says. I cringe.An inactive illegal mining site in the rainforest south-west of CayenneAn inactive illegal mining site in the rainforest south-west of CayenneThefirst French settlersofla Franceéquinoxiale, as they called the colony, arrived in 1503. The colony then changed hands multiple times, with the Dutchbringing the first slavesin 1676 during a brief period of control. The French Revolution abolished slavery a century later in 1794, Napoleon brought it back in 1802 and the Second Republic reabolished it for good in 1848, freeing some 13,000 people in French Guiana.For a century, the territory was used by France as a prison colony, or dumping ground for politically inconvenient citizens. Captain Alfred Dreyfuswas incarceratedin the notorious penal settlement of Devil’s Island, off the coast of Kourou, in 1895 after being convicted of treason. The ex-convict Henri Charrière’s 1969 account of brutality in the same jail in Papillon, a bestselling book later made into a film starring Steve McQueen, seared it into the consciousness of a generation. Perhaps the fame of the Île du Diable is why so many –including Jean Castex, the former French prime minister – still mistakenly think that French Guiana is an island. (The Cayenne-born jazz legend Henri Salvador probably did his birthplace no geographic favours when he released Dans mon Île in 1957.)View image in fullscreenA French gendarme in pursuit of garimpeiros in Petit-Saut.Photograph: Alexander Hurst/The GuardianThe first, fevered gold rushengulfed the region in 1858, and 170 years on the prospectors’ extraction methodhas barely changed. They dredge sediments from riverbeds or boreholes, pump in water and add mercury, which binds to gold particles and forms an amalgam, which sinks. Then they sift out the pieces of amalgam, burn away the mercury to discard the slurry, and reveal a nugget of pure gold. Mercury vapour enters the atmosphere and the contaminated mud enters the water system and the food chain, causing serious health problems, and development issues in infants and children.Today illegal prospectors still number between 6,000 and 7,000, working across roughly 600 mining sites. In the eight months since AP-51 (one of many such camps) was established, the gendarmes and legionnaires have sufficiently suppressed illegal mining activity that it’s become tough to find. For Harpie’s commanders, “success” is in having “stabilised” mining at these levels, despitegold tripling in pricesince 2018.Others are less convinced. In 2020, a member of the French parliament representing the territory led an inquiry into why the illegal gold panning situation was still“such a disaster”, despite Sarkozy’sinsistencenearly a decade earlier that stamping it out was a “national priority”. After a visit to the region a year later, aparliamentary delegation criticisedthe “insufficient” means allocated to enforcement.Far from Paris’s political squabbles, a question hangs heavier than mercury. With economic incentives to mine anywhere and everywhere, what kind of ecological devastation would there be without Harpie? But success and failure is also tallied in the real and present impact from mercury and mining – on the jungle, the river and the people who rely on both.Aimé Césaire, a poet from Martinique and member of the French parliament, and Gaston Monnerville, the Guyanais grandson of a slave and former president of the French Senate, were among decolonisation activists who campaigned in the first half of the 20th century, not for independence for French Guiana, but for full status as a part of France.When the territory became a full French “department” in 1946 (along with Martinique, Guadeloupe and Réunion), it was the realisation of that long-held goal. In2010, 70% of voters rejected a shift towards greater autonomy. And attachment to EU membership is stronger here than it is in most of France’s other regions.But income levels in the Amazonian department are only half of what they are in the “Hexagon”, the six-sided shape of France that sits on the European continent. This is roughly comparable to the ratio between the poorest and wealthiest US states, or between Paris and its most economically depressed banlieue.And often, the attitude from Paris towards French Guiana can feel like that of the core to the periphery: exacerbated by present-day plans to build, in this former prison colony, a new detention facility to house high-security inmates from metropolitan France.Within French Guiana, the core is the coast, where90% of the population lives. In the Haut-Maroni region in the interior, the inhabitants arelargely Bushinengue– the descendants of escaped slaves who fled Dutch and French plantations and established isolated, free communities deep in the jungle along the Maroni River. It feels like the periphery.Illegal mining between Taluen and Lipo Lipo has left the river polluted and discolouredIllegal mining between Taluen and Lipo Lipo has left the river polluted and discolouredFrom the window of Air Guyane Express’sCzech-built, 15-seat turboprops, the Amazon rainforest looks like an enormous head of broccoli. Endless and indivisible. Except every now and then there appears a rust-coloured scar on its face: a pockmark of deforestation where the garimpeiros, the prospectors, have clearcut and savaged the earth, leaving it polluted and desolate.There are no roads to Maripasoula,a town of 8,000on the Maroni River, but it has an airport. Getting farther south to Taluen, to find out how the Wayana community – one of French Guiana’s five original Amerindian populations – is affected by illegal gold mining means a journey by pirogue. This tough geographic reality shows up in prices: a bottle of water costs twice as much as in the capital, Cayenne.A Wayana man in a baseball cap waits at the river, next to a silvery pirogue. “Al-Qaida,” he says, hand outstretched, grin on his face, bemusement on mine. It is a nickname, I learn later, from his time in the French army, in Afghanistan.Contaminated slurry is discharged into the Maroni River from a mining site on the Surinamese side of the borderContaminated slurry is discharged into the Maroni River from a mining site on the Surinamese side of the borderOnce again, the sun blisters everything – but before I can burn too much, Marie Trémolet from the World Wildlife Fund arrives, along with two local fish-farming consultants and Aïmawale Opoya, the chief of Taluen, the largest Wayana town.Dry season has just begun, which means the water level in the Maroni is beginning to drop. In 2024, climate change made parts of this already shallow, rapids-filled river temporarily impassible, leaving the Wayana pincered between the macro polluting effects of carbon and the micro effects of mercury. Of the two, they feel the impact of the mining most keenly. “The garimpeiros have polluted everything,” says Aïmawale. “The rivers, the forest, the game, the fish.”Only a few minutes downriver from Maripasoula, nature erupts. Awara palms with their thick spikes. Iridescent blue flashes of morpho butterflies beneath the canopy. The red eyes of black caiman crocodiles that glower back flashlight beams in the night. Home to1,800 tree species,96% of French Guianais rainforest. In fact, Maripasoula, Taluen and a host of other towns lie within the protected area of the Parc Amazonien de Guyane, the EU’slargest national park, which stretches across 34,000km2– an expanse bigger than Belgium. Whenthe reserve was created in 2007 with the agreement of French Guiana’s Indigenous populations, it was with the understanding that making this “protected land” would bring illegal mining to an end.Every now and then, Aïmawale and “al-Qaida” gesture towards the shore, pointing out signs of gold panning. Here, you can see and taste the destruction mercury wreaks in the Maroni River and thecriquessprawling around it in the rusty, metallic quality it imparts to the water. As we swerve from one side to the next to navigate the river, I begin to understand why Operation Harpie is necessary, but sisyphean. The problem is that on the Suriname bank of the river, all ofthis happensin the open,unenforced. The equipment, the mercury, the sifting through and jettisoning of earth.View image in fullscreenFrench gendarmes and members of the World Wildlife Fund at an illegal gold panning site south-west of Cayenne, French Guiana, 2019.Photograph: Jody Amiet/AFP/Getty ImagesThe commercial supply points on the Surinamese side – there are 120 “storefronts” run by Chinese shopkeepers along the river,according to a 2023 estimate– make no effort to hide. Red metal walls and droopy porches overhanging the river, where groups of thin, bare-chested men sit drinking beer and liquor. Video displays show grids of rectangular video feeds from an assortment of security cameras. Rows of prepackaged foodstuffs sit alongside plastic goods made in China, with mining materials stuffed into corners. “The mercury is usually in a back room, out of sight,” Marie tells me. The storefronts don’t just sell equipment and purchase gold, they have recently moved into a “sharecropping” arrangement, taking a percentage of everything mined.From the pirogue, the Maroni looks murky with mining contamination. “Before, fish was the major part of our diet,” Aïmawale says. “Now, when it rains, the river looks like milk. We can’t let our children bathe or swim in that …”Wayana communities have to venture further and further to find clearer water and fish that they hope are less contaminated. Sometimes, they brave the indignity of buying processed foods or chicken from the Chinese storefronts. It’s a situation that leads to “a fair amount of diabetes, hypertension, and otherwise poor health”, says Lisa Michard, a nurse who has worked at Taluen’s health clinic. If a new fish-farming project for Taluen goes well, fish will maintainits place in the Wayana diet, but in a way that is tragic adaptation, rather than a real solution.In Taluen, we string our hammocks in the dimming light, my knots as amateur as ever. The first night we are served chicken; the second, fish. When we see the pot of fish, Marie and I exchange a glance and a grim half-laugh at the irony, though we know a single meal is relatively innocuous. Shortly after I arrived in Taluen, eight French cities, including Paris, announced that their public schoolswould no longer serve tunain lunchrooms out of concern for mercury levels. As for the Wayana, the French regional health authority’s recommendation is to restrict fish consumption to no more than once a month.In 2024, Linia Opoya, who is married to Aïmawale,brought a lawsuit against the French government, alleging that France had failed its legal duty to protect citizens and the environment. The health problems that plague the community range from learning disabilities to memory loss, concentration problems, damaged eyesight, pins and needles in the limbs, and a loss of physical strength, she says.View image in fullscreenSatellite imagery of French Guiana from Copernicus Sentinel 2, Q3 2025 mosaic.Illustration: Guardian DesignLater, in Taluen’s communaltukusipan, Patrick Touenké, chief of all the Wayana, gets visibly frustrated when I ask him about the mining. “We’ve been talking about the mining situation forever and nothing changes,’ he says, with the tukusipan’s maluwana – an intricately painted disc that maps Wayana cosmology – looking down from above him. 2009 was the last time the Wayana confronted the miners directly, with barricades on the river. That was just after the French government launched Harpie, which Aïmawale – who has himself participated in Harpie missions in the past as a reservist in the gendarmerie – calls “insufficient”.Linia goes further. “Harpie destroys the miners’ equipment, then two days later the miners are back,” she says. For three or four days after a mission, the water clears up, and then the miners resupply on the Surinamese side of the river and restart. What’s needed are regular patrols of the river, she says, and a permanent Harpie presence in the area – something like AP-51.“I grew up drinking from the river,” Linia reminisces – a relationship with the natural surroundings that her 15-year-old son will never know. Even if all gold mining stopped tomorrow, experts from the national park told me, each contaminated Amazon waterway would take 200 years to return to its former state.On my final night in Taluen, as I adjust my body in my hammock, something cuts through the quiet, the peace, the calm, the wisp of the Milky Way. Not a howler monkey this time, but an insect. It sounds almost precisely like a buzzsaw.A burst of light in the dark. I watch, as 5km from the viewing site, the Ariane 6 rocket lifts off, steadies, streaks upwards above its launchpad. Twenty seconds after the earth seems to exhale a new sun, the sound hits – as if the air itself were ripping. The Ariane 6 programme represents Europe’sindependent access to space, and this particularrocket carries a meteorological satellite over a decade in the making:Metop-SGA1. Primarily a weather satellite, SGA1 also carries a compact moral proposition, a collection of sensors calledSentinel-5, designed to see what human beings have become so good at ignoring.Methaneslithering out of oil and gas fields, carbon dioxide stewing above continents, the exhaust of our species.It was Charles de Gaulle who decided to build a spaceport in Kourou in 1964, to replace France’s former launch site at Hammaguir, in the Algerian desert. With Algerian independence approaching, Kourou, another former penal settlement, offered advantages: at the equator, the Earth’s rotation naturally assists a rocket’s boosters, and provides both a launch trajectory over open ocean rather than inhabited land and stable weather conditions. Now jointly managed by the French space agency and ESA, the spaceport anchors thousands of jobs directly and indirectly, and accounts for at least15% of the departments’s GDP. In 2021, this iswhere the ESA sentthe James Webb space telescope – which astronomers are using to hunt for new planets andlook further back in time, by seeing fainter and more distant lightthan anything else on or of the Earth – intoorbit around the sun.Near Kourou, at Paracou research station, researcher Ariane Mirabelstands in front of a towering tree with a buttressed trunk. Thisarbre cathédralehas been tagged, measured, and will be measured again every one, two or five years, just like70,000 other treeson various plots of land at Paracou. It’s the most extensive tree-identification and tracking project in the world, andESA satellites need the datato estimate the quantities of carbon stored in the forest.View image in fullscreenThe base of a tree, known as anarbre cathédrale,inParacou, French Guiana.Photograph: Alexander Hurst/The GuardianThis rainforest that I’ve seen from the air and from pirogues, whose humidity I’ve felt on foot, ispart of the Guiana Shield– a swathe of the Amazon that stretches from Colombia to French Guiana and northern Brazil, and which is crucial to moistening, lifting and steering the atmospheric “rivers” that form over the Atlantic and move south to the Andes. The portion of forest that lies in French Guiana is among the least disturbed by human activity in the world, explains Mirabel, in part because of how few people live there.What the canopy data says about the immense Amazon rainforest is grim. A year ago things were dire, but perhaps bending towards hope. The EU had beenleading the wayin emissions reductions; China, longa source of emissions growth, was alsothe driver of the energy transitiontowards wind and solar; and in the US, the Biden administration had finally shifted national policy in support of real progress.Cop30 brought negotiators to Belém, to the edge of a rainforest under assault in every imaginable way: carbon emissions, clearcutting for soy and cattle, access roads for drilling sites, poaching, logging, illegal mining. On our current climate crisis trajectory, in the near future the Amazon will cross a tipping point anddry out into a savannah. That would cause the forest to release nearly a decade’s worth of carbon, turn millions of square kilometres into a probablefire plain, unleash new potential pandemics and devastate South American agriculture.The Earth and its forests inhabit a timescale beyond our own, and so none of us – not our children, our grandchildren, or their grandchildren – will ever see this reversed. Forget recreating any of this, says Mirabel, when “we don’t even understand how the existing forest fully works”.From Sentinel-5’s elliptical circuit832km above the Earth, borders look meaningless. On the ground, they’re anything but. For years, France has sung the refrain of “strategic autonomy” to its European neighbours, insisting that the EU acquires the ability to act with full independence in any number of domains, including space. Ariane 6 is a key component of this – autonomous access to space at a time when Donald Trump’s waragainst renewablesand on behalf of fossil fuels is a war on our ability to even know. At a time when his administration is preparing to order thatNasa terminatethe US government’s only satellites purposefully designed to measure greenhouse gases, the EU,which spends €12bn a year on space, has an additional responsibility to collect and safeguard climate data, says Simonetta Cheli, ESA’s director of Earth observation.The Ariane 6 rocket launching from the Guiana Space Centre in KourouThe Ariane 6 rocket launching from the Guiana Space Centre in KourouESA can track methane plumes, calculate carbon stored in the forest, or even spot the clearcut scar of a mining site – but nobody seems able to put a stop to the 20 pirogues a day that, Linia Opoya says, pass by Taluen loaded with mining equipment. Sovereignty is double-edged: in Kourou, France invokes it at both a national and European level every time a satellite lifts off and into orbit. On the banks of the Maroni, the same principle impedes France from tackling a problem that stretches from one sovereign space into another.On the other hand, is France, with the full weight of the EU behind it, really incapable of putting a stop to the mining supply chain violating one of its borders and putting its citizens at risk?During its most recent overflight, the Parc Amazonien, which draws 70% of its personnel from Amerindian communities, observed 176 mining sites – the highest number yet – within its territory. “On one side, we have a powerful, cooperative neighbour, and on the other side, a narco state,” says Yann Saliou, deputy director of the park. Without cooperation from Suriname, he continues, ending mining along the Maroni would require a gendarme behind every tree.For decades we’ve had the data, and the best recommendations of scientists; we know that we’re destroying something that exists beyond our brief human timescale. From high above and far away, the world is blue and green. On the ground, we attribute enormous value to a shiny metal with little intrinsic utility, while being systematically incapable of valuing and protecting the ecosystems that sustain us. If conflicting sovereignty can’t be coordinated across a waterway often narrow enough to hurl a stone from one side to the other, what chance is there that the view from 832km up – no matter how precise – will save what is already slipping away?Alexander Hurst writes for Guardian Europe from Paris.

NDIS automation will put vulnerable lives at the mercy of machinesGeorgia Van ToornIt’s hard to overstate the potential dangers of replacing discretion with algorithms in a system as consequential as the national disability insurance schemeWed 3 Dec 2025 20.59 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Dec 2025 00.05 ESTShareNever again. That was the resounding message delivered via the robodebt royal commission from the thousands of Australians whose lives and livelihoods were upended by the cruellest experiment in bureaucratic automation the country has ever seen.Now, with plans under way toautomate the calculation of individual NDIS support plans, it appears we’ve reached new heights of institutional amnesia. Once again, vital lifelines to support will be placed at the mercy of automated systems. Only this time, the mechanisms for review and redress will be vanishingly thin.In plans revealed by Guardian Australia this week, the NationalDisabilityInsurance Agency has set its sights on reforming the way individual disability support budgets are determined, reducing the scope for human discretion and giving data and algorithms a greater role.NDIS plans will be computer-generated, with human involvement dramatically cut under sweeping overhaulRead moreCurrently, a person’s support budget is determined through a combination of computer-based tools and human discretion. These tools help generate an initial support plan that an NDIA delegate modifies to suit individual needs and circumstances.From mid-2026, a new assessment tool will be introduced, the data from which will be fed into software to generate a budget. The NDIA delegate’s role will be limited to that of accepting or rejecting the budget.It is hard to overstate the potential dangers of replacing discretion with algorithms in a system as vital and consequential as the NDIS.There is no doubt people with disability are all too familiar with problems of bias inhumandecision-making. But removing human discretion altogether is not the answer. In fact, it raises the stakes dramatically.In a more automated system, a lot will hinge on the quality of data fed into the algorithm. If that data is inaccurate – if the assessment fails to capture a true picture of a person’s support needs – the resulting budget will be flawed and the person will pay the price.According to revelations in Guardian Australia this week, there will be no safety net – no scope for either the NDIA delegate or the administrative appeals tribunal to amend the budget. In other words, the computer will have the final say.In clearcut cases where a person’s disability aligns with standard categories, a more automated process may well suffice. It might succeed in streamlining the process and reducing administrative delays. But as is so often the case with digital tools, the benefits and harms will be unevenly distributed. The people who are most likely to have their funding cut or supports misjudged are the people whose disabilities are complex, fluctuating or not easily captured through standardised assessments.A more automated process may be particularly perilous for people whose disabilities are affected or compounded by social factors – such as poverty, racial, sexual or gender discrimination, and entanglements with the carceral system – which fall well beyond the bounds of data captured by existing assessment tools. Just like with robodebt, the system will inflict its heaviest toll on the communities least able to bear it.In discussions of budgets and algorithms, we must be mindful that what’s at stake for NDIS participants is nothing less than life-sustaining support. Cuts to budgets translate into fewer hours of funded support, fewer showers, reduced access to essential therapies, compromised independence and an increased risk of social isolation and harm. For some, it will be the difference between living independently or being forced into institutional care. In the worst cases, as the disability royal commission has made painfully clear, reductions in support can be a threat to life.Not-for-profit disability services are closing due to untenably low price caps, NDIS architect warnsRead morePeople with disabilities have historically been described as the canaries in the coalmine, subjected to experiments that would never be tolerated for other groups. Yet what we are seeing now in the automation of support planning is something perhaps even more troubling – that is, the conscious acceptance of predictable harms. Once efficiency justifies foreseeable harm, we have entered dangerous territory.But it is not too late. The Morrison government attempted similar reforms in 2021, but they were ultimately deemed too risky and politically untenable. These new reforms present a chance, indeed the obligation, to insist once again that algorithmic efficiency should never come at the expense of human need.Georgia Van Toorn is a senior lecturer in the School of Social Sciences at the University of New South Wales and an associate investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society. Her research explores the growing impacts of data analytics and algorithmic decision-making in the public sector, with a particular focus on disability and social justice.Explore more on these topicsNational disability insurance schemeOpinionDisabilitycommentShareReuse this content"

Chris, my older brother, got me into fishing, while he was my chaperone on Harry Potter. My mum chaperoned me for the first film, and my grandfather for the second. He looked so much like a wizard that [director] Chris Columbus cast him at the teachers’ table next to Dumbledore. Then my brother was commandeered. He was one of the worst chaperones in history – all he seemed to do was sleep the entire day – but that’s probably because we’d been up all night, fishing. Some days we’d leave set at 6pm, drive two hours back to Surrey where we lived, go straight to a lake, cast our rods, set up a tent, sleep – barely – for a few hours, wake at 6am, pack up, and head straight back to Hogwarts. It was a great introduction to a lifelong passion of being outdoors, fishing and walking the dogs.What are the advantages of being a blond?snazpizaz2I’ll tell you there are disadvantages to dyeing your hair every nine days; the fact I still have hair at all is remarkable.

But his work with his fellow musicians and singers at Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee, established him as one of the most creative and influential musicians of the 1960s.Actually, pretty much every rock icon of that fabled decade looked up to Cropper,who has died aged 84. The Beatles seriously considered recording at Stax, and the Stones covered songs he played on and emulated his crisp rhythm and lead guitar playing. As a jobbing musician in 1964, Jimi Hendrix drove from Nashville to Memphis to meet Cropper (they chatted about guitars and jammed), while Janis Joplin insisted her new band play Stax’s Christmas party so as to rub shoulders with Cropper and co. Across the world, garage bands played songs he had helped to shape.View image in fullscreenVenerated … Cropper in New York City, 1967.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesIf it was just for his guitar playing then Cropper would be venerated. His incisive, tasty, never ostentatious style marks him – alongside Lowman Pauling (his main influence), Curtis Mayfield and Bobby Womack – as someone who defined the sound of original R&B. But this slim, somewhat gawky youth also developed into a remarkable engineer, producer and co-writer of soul anthems. Cropper was not a solo songwriter (nor did he ever seriously attempt to be a solo artist) but, paired up with such great soul singers as Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett and Eddie Floyd, he helped give structure to the song ideas they had, ensuring they had intros, verses and choruses that leapt out at the listener. Cropper never felt the need to act as a “guitar hero” – his playing was economical, complementary rather than seeking attention: even when Sam Moore of Sam & Dave shouts “play it, Steve!” onSoulMan, Cropper plays a fill, embellishing the song rather than showing off his own prowess.Cropper grew up in Memphis and formed his first band, the Royal Spades, while in high school. Back then, Memphis practised extreme segregation and his school was all white, yet he and his fellow band members loved R&B. The band’s tenor sax player, Charles “Packy” Axton’s mother, Estelle, had co-founded Satellite Records, a tiny independent record label, with her brother Jim Stewart. The Spades recorded an instrumental called Last Night, and Estelle – a doting mum as well as a discerning, fledgling record exec – convinced Jim that Satellite should release it (although she was wise enough to insist the teens change the band’s name to the Mar-Keys).Last Night was a US hit and helped establish the label, which was forced to change its name to Stax after a legal complaint from another Satellite Records. Cropper didn’t enjoy touring – Packy was already a heavy drinker and the band partied too hard for his liking – so he requested a job helping Jim in the studio.View image in fullscreenAl Jackson Jr, Steve Cropper, Booker T Jones and Donald ‘Duck’ Dunn AKA Booker T & the MGs in 1971.Photograph: Gilles Petard/RedfernsHe learned to engineer and produce records, alongside playing on sessions. He was Stewart’s most trusted – and well remunerated – employee at Stax and here he formed Booker T & the MGs with teenage organist Booker T Jones, drummer Al Jackson Jr and bassist Lewie Steinberg (both veterans of the Memphis club scene). In 1962, Stewart thought that a studio jam that the quartet had worked up showed potential, and so Green Onions was released – quite possibly the most influential instrumental record of the 1960s and a mod club favourite to this day.It was Cropper who recognised the potential of a youth from Macon, Georgia, who arrived at Stax as a valet to guitarist Johnny Jenkins for a failed session. When Otis Redding grabbed the last minutes of the session to demonstrate two songs he had written, Cropper played piano behind him on These Arms of Mine and a legend was born. The two young men would work together for the rest of Redding’s brief life – Booker T & the MGs provided the ideal backing for Redding at his famous Monterey pop festival performance in 1967 and Stax’s subsequent European tour – trading ideas, licks and song titles, so helping shape the remarkable canon of work that Redding left. It was Cropper who turned a brief reminiscence from Redding, about watching boats go in and out of a bay, into a fleshed-out set of lyrics and one of Redding’s greatest hits.View image in fullscreenCropper performs in Pasadena, California, 2018.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty ImagesRedding died in 1967, and Booker T decamped to California, furious that Stewart gave Cropper a more preferential contract (racial tensions ran high at Stax in the late 1960s). Cropper slipped into a sideman role: after leaving Stax he played on sessions for John Lennon, Rod Stewart and other famous names. Then he became part of the Blues Brothers band (and films), which surely paid well even if it reduced those great R&B anthems to comedy pub kitsch. No matter: Steve Cropper helped shape a whole genre. Rest in peace, soul man.Explore more on these topicsSoulR&BPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

This is about enforcing the rules of the EBU and being inclusive,” it said. The German broadcaster SWR confirmed it would participate.The Spanish national broadcaster, along with seven other countries, had formally requested a secret ballot at a summit of broadcasters in Geneva on Thursday.“The EBU presidency has denied RTVE’s request for a specific vote on Israel’s participation. This decision increases RTVE’s distrust of the festival’s organisation and confirms the political pressure surrounding it,” it said in a statement.View image in fullscreenDelegates leave the headquarters of the European Broadcasting Union after the first day of a two-day general assembly on Thursday.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesSpain’s culture minister, Ernest Urtasun, backed the boycott. He said: “You can’t whitewash Israel given the genocide in Gaza. Culture should be on the side of peace and justice. I’m proud of an RTVE that puts human rights before any economic interest.”In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, the Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said it would also withdraw from next year’s contest. “After weighing all perspectives, Avrotros concludes that, under the current circumstances, participation cannot be reconciled with the public values that are fundamental to our organisation.”The Slovenian national broadcaster, RTVSLO – the first to threaten a boycott this summer – said participation “would conflict with its values of peace, equality and respect”.At the meeting on Thursday, EBU members discussed new rules designed to stop governments and third parties from promoting songs to influence voters.Some countries had raised concerns over undue promotion methods after Israel topped the public vote at the contest in May, finishing second overall after the jury votes were taken into consideration.The proposed rule changes were seen as an olive branch to broadcasters critical of Israel, but appear to have been deemed insufficient to most of the nations who had signalled their willingness to boycott the event.Sixty-five per cent of delegates voted in favour of the changes to the song contest and no further discussion on participation of Israel, while 23% voted against and 10% abstained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

ORF, the Austrian host broadcaster, had also said it wanted Israel to compete.SWR said before the meeting that Israel was entitled to compete in the contest. It said the contest, for decades, was “a competition organised by EBU broadcasters, not by governments” and “the Israeli broadcaster Kan meets all the requirements associated with participation” for 2026.Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Israel, which has won the contest four times since its debut in 1973, has competed for the past two years despite disputes over its participation.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropeIsraelTelevisionSpainIrelandSlovenianewsShareReuse this content"

Ayshea – Farewell (1973)Roy Wood occasionally wrote for others – psych fans should check the Acid Gallery’s splendid 1969 single Dance Round the Maypole – and the single he made with girlfriend Ayshea Brough, an early 70s TV presenter, exemplifies his idiosyncratic pop skillsandhis kitchen-sink approach to arrangement: kettle drums! More oboe!View image in fullscreenRoy Wood with Ayshea Brough in 1973.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images19. Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne – Me and You (1989)At the end of the 80s – a decade where musical trends didn’t fit Wood’s approach at all – the Electric Light Orchestra’s architects briefly regrouped, recording two tracks that were never released. Me and You is the pick, offering a tantalising glimpse of what latter-day ELO might have sounded like had Wood never left.18. Wizzard – Indiana Rainbow (1976)The great lost Wizzard single (recorded for the rejected 1976 album Main Street) saw Wood grafting a charming big band-influenced song and arrangement on to a thunderous dancefloor-adjacent drumbeat. The music sounds surprisingly like the disco-swing hybrid of Dr Buzzard’s Original Savannah Band’s 1976 debut album, which might have accounted for its belated release.17. The Move – Brontosaurus (1970)By the release of Brontosaurus, Wood’s career was in flux:Jeff Lynnehad joined the Move with plans to start ELO; Wood had started wearing backcombed hair and make-up that prefigured his Wizzard look. The track itself is proto-metal but still packs a great pop melody.16. Wizzard – Meet Me at the Jailhouse (1973)Wood was always keen to point out how different Wizzard’s albums were from their hits. He wasn’t joking, as evidenced by Wizzard Brew’s teenybopper-baffling 13-minute centrepiece Meet Me at the Jailhouse, which shifts between heavy riffing and rhythmless free jazz improv, laced with bracingly angular guitar shredding.15. Roy Wood – Why Does Such a Pretty Girl Sing Those Sad Songs (1975)Wood’s second solo album, Mustard, is almost as great as its predecessor, Boulders, repeating its Wood-plays-writes-and-produces-everything approach, if not its commercial success. But chart success isn’t everything: Why Does Such a Pretty Girl Sing Those Sad Songs is the most luscious and beautiful of Wood’s Beach Boys homages.14. The Move – Hello Susie (1970)View image in fullscreenThe Move …(left to right)Ace Kefford, Trevor Burton, Carl Wayne, Bev Bevan and Roy WoodPhotograph: Sylvia Pitcher/RedfernsThe Move’s second album, Shazam, was a commercial disaster that precipitated vocalist Carl Wayne’s departure. But that was no reflection on its contents, as proven by the awesome Hello Susie – the sound of Wood applying his irrepressible pop smarts to music built for a new, hoarier, heavier, proggier era.13. Roy Wood – Songs of Praise (1973)Songs of Praise was written as a potential 1972 Eurovision entry for the New Seekers. At risk of sounding snobbish, it was far too good for that, a perfect example of Wood’s ability to pluck melodies that sounded instantly familiar – as if they’d been around for years – out of the ether.12. Wizzard – Rock ‘n’ Roll Winter (Loony’s Tune) (1974)View image in fullscreenRoy Wood, centre,in Wizzard.Photograph: Alan Messer/ShutterstockYou could view Rock ‘n’ Roll Winter as a more subtle sequel to the deathless I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday (it was supposed to be released in January while its predecessor was still in the charts): the tinsel is down, the festivities are over, the mood has turned to a kind of wistful optimism.11. The Move – Wild Tiger Woman (1968)An incredibly exciting single, Wild Tiger Woman’s failure on the charts might simply prove it was too far ahead of its time: its combination of rock’n’roll influence, a dense, wilfully artificial sound and fizzy overheated production make it sound less like a product of the late 60s than the glam era.10. ELO – Look at Me Now (1971)From the start, Lynne and Wood were pulling ELO in different directions – the former more Beatles-esque, the latter more obviously influenced by baroque classical music. It couldn’t last, but when their debut album worked – as on Wood’s drum-free, cello- and oboe-bedecked Look at Me Now – it makes you wish it had.9. Wizzard – I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday (1973)There’s something mildly aggrieving about this song’s annual success overshadowing the rest of Wood’s rich oeuvre. But, equally, writing something that becomes part of the fabric of national life is quite an achievement. Note the cash register that opens the track: a winning speck of cynicism in the tinselly facade.8. Wizzard – Angel Fingers (A Teen Ballad) (1973)Be My Baby opulently recast for the 70s, with lyrics that sum up the wannabe pop star’s raison d’etre – “If I could get a job with that cool rockin’ band / You’d notice me with that red guitar in my hand” – and ponder fandom’s transience: “Will Dion still be so important to you on your wedding day?”It’s hairmageddon! Is the leather-codpieced world of glam metal making a comeback?Read more7. Roy Wood – Dear Elaine (1973)Wood’s debut solo album Boulders might be his masterpiece. Given the speed at which pop was moving at the time, it seems bizarre its contents were recorded in 1969-70 – they fitted the climate of 1973 perfectly. But then timelessness doesn’t date: the baroque loveliness of Dear Elaine would hit home in any era.6. The Move – Fire Brigade (1968)A masterclass in a particularly relentless kind of pop songwriting, Fire Brigade offers two and a half minutes in which every last second is crammed with hooks and earworm melodies: Byrds-y jangle, incredible vocal harmonies, twanging Duane Eddy guitar licks. The whole thing sounds like happiness rendered into musical form.5. Wizzard – Ball Park Incident (1972)A fantastic song and a head-turning statement of intent, Wizzard’s first release supersized the 50s rock’n’roll influence that ran through glam: a vast, thunderous wall of sound – two drummers, umpteen brass and woodwind instruments, honky-tonk piano, distorted guitars – topped off with a raw-throated vocal. What a fabulous single.4. The Move – Blackberry Way (1968)By now, Wood’s inability to stay in one place musically seemed to be wearing on his bandmates: Blackberry Way’s pivot into parent-friendly baroque pop – albeit of downcast, faintly psychedelic bent – helped hasten guitarist Trevor Burton’s departure, while vocalist Carl Wayne refused to sing it. Its fantastic melody sent it to No 1 regardless.3. Roy Wood – Forever (1973)By the time Forever made the Top 10, Wood had appeared on Top of the Pops in four different guises – the Move, ELO, Wizzard, and now solo – in 18 months. The song is just gorgeous, a loving hybrid of the Beach Boys and Neil Sedaka: both were credited “for inspiration” on the label.2. The Move – I Can Hear the Grass Grow (1967)The toughest example of Move on psychedelic form, in which the snarling superiority of the acid initiate towards “the people all in line” is undercut by the sense that the LSD experience has proved all too much: “I need you to help.” One ofthegreat British psych singles, it still sounds awesomely powerful.1. Wizzard – See My Baby Jive (1973)“Roy Wood was a super-fan,” wrote Bob Stanley, approvingly, in his book Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop. “He wanted to be all of pop, all at the same time.” It’s a brilliant summation of an oeuvre so rich and eclectic that picking a No 1 is genuinely tough. See My Baby Jive is both a masterpiece and one of the maddest, strangest 70s chart toppers, a superb pop song with an utterly euphoric chorus, an act of chaotic, teeming sonic maximalism: five minutes long, packed with unexpected key changes, a French horn solo and an outro that refuses to end.

In hip-hop theatre company ZooNation’s new Christmas show, Charles Dickens goes to places he’s never been. Choreographer and director Dannielle “Rhimes” Lecointe has created a fresh, fun and very funky reinvention of A Christmas Carol, with a Caribbean twist, which flips the story and turns Ebeneezer into Ebony. This Scrooge is a fashion maven, “cold as a December wind in London”, strutting across the floor in sweeping cape while her employees freeze in her wake. No Christmas holiday for them, machine-like as they make her monochrome designs. Meanwhile, her sweet niece Freddie is neglected and Bob Cratchit dreams in colour amid Ebony’s strictly black and white world (but has a secret soft spot for her nonetheless).Leah Hill’s Ebony is a glam baddie, the sharp edges of her catwalk dancing matching her personality. But of course, the ghosts come for her: ghosts of the present first, who pull off her chic platform heels and make her wear trainers instead – now that’s a nightmare! Back in the past, Scrooge returns to her Caribbean roots, and suddenly a warm glow and new rhythms flood the stage, and Ebony’s backstory of grief and loss comes to the fore.View image in fullscreenFresh, fun and very funky … Ebony Scrooge.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe characters aren’t fully fleshed out. ZooNation shows always have fairly broad strokes but a lot of heart. One minute you’re wondering if you really buy the emotional journey, the next you’ve got a lump in your throat. And the story absolutely does work as a framework for fantastic dancing. The standard is just blistering across the board, the energy effervescent. Lecointe pulls from a wealth of street dance styles – buoyant locking, infectious house dance, slick and sassy vogue – every scene succinct (and clearly narrated through text and songs, with music by award-winning Michael “Mikey J” Asante).Move over Ebenezer! Ebony Scrooge gets Dickens dancing with a hip-hop Christmas Carol – in picturesRead moreThe versatile cast can be joyfully unconstrained or as tight as a vacuum pack. And Malachi Welch as Cratchit, wow, his body makes weightless sweeps through the air, curling like the softest ice-cream scoop; it’s delicious dancing.Lecointe has been a longtime member of ZooNation and assistant to founder Kate Prince, but she is clearly more than ready to take the reins as a director.

He was the perfect match for Phoebe, a lightning rod for her kookiness and providing the solid family she’d never had. It wasn’t just the fact that he was played by Paul Rudd that managed to win over the viewers. His profile was nowhere near what it would later become, so the audience weren’t responding to star power in the same way they had, say, to Bruce Willis, Tom Selleck or Reese Witherspoon. Mike had to play the long game, put in the graft and win Phoebe’s trust, and won ours in the process.AJ, LondonEwan Roy – SuccessionIf it counts as late, with his arrival in episode five of the first season ofSuccession, my vote goes to Ewan Roy, elder brother of Logan, played impeccably by James Cromwell. An agitator to his ruthless younger brother, Ewan with his social and political conscience gave left-leaning viewers someone to root for.Ann, LondonAly – New GirlView image in fullscreenGreat expectations … Aly (Nasim Pedrad) and Winston (Lamorne Morris) in New Girl.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWinston was already a brilliant character, and adding in a love interest for him in season four was such a great decision. Aly was smart, funny and a perfect partner for Winston. On top of all that, she gelled so well with the extremely strong ensemble cast, it made you forget she wasn’t there from the beginning.Aimee, Ulverston, CumbriaThe Mother – How I Met Your MotherI loved the Mother in the final season of How I Met Your Mother. While many people detest the end of the show, her introduction was what really uplifted the final series. After eight series of buildup, nobody thought the show could deliver on their promise of this perfect partner for Ted. However, they over-delivered if anything, bringing in a character who all fans of the show fell in love with.Matt,LondonRiver Song – Doctor WhoAlex Kingston’s character transformedDoctor Who– the series and the Time Lord – as soon as she first uttered the words “Hello, sweetie”. Admittedly, she did later try to kill him, but there was a happy ending. Reader, she married him.Anil Patel, LondonKryten – Red DwarfView image in fullscreenExcellent one-liners … Kryten (Robert Llewellyn) in Red Dwarf.Photograph: Wenn Ltd/AlamyAfter first appearing as a one-off character in season two, Kryten was so great that the writers brought him back as a regular. As an android, Kryten could explain puzzling situations to the other crew members, but also go on away missions. And he was given some excellent lines, one of my favourites being when he meets his future self, now wearing a wig: “What is that you have on your head? I hope you have a quarantine licence for it.”Helen Taylor, Wokingham, BerkshireCastiel – SupernaturalCastiel didn’t arrive in the show until season four. He was the angel who raised the dead Dean Winchester from hell and back to life. Supernatural went on to have 15 seasons, and Castiel became a part of the team. For his actor, Misha Collins, to go from a guest to a primary character was an amazing transition – and it had everything to do with the actor and how he played the character. The first time we see him he’s a man wearing an open trenchcoat over a shirt and tie – with huge wings shadowed on the walls behind him. That image alone made Castiel something new and wonderful that fit right in. Collins won us over without even saying a word.Sarah Bewley, 72,Florida, USLalo Salamanca – Better Call SaulView image in fullscreenGave the show a rush … Lalo Salamanca (Tony Dalton) in Better Call Saul.Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures TelevisionFor me, Better Call Saul was petering out after the first three seasons without much of a way into the Breaking Bad story until Lalo Salamanca arrived. Tuco was involved previously as was Hector and Mike, but Lalo’s arrival gave BCS the rush it needed to persevere.Daniel Coogan, LondonJacqueline ‘Jack’ Sloane – NCISI liked Maria Bello who played Jacqueline “Jack” Sloane in NCIS in seasons 15-18 as a senior special agent and operational psychologist who specialised in profiling. They gave her a backstory as a prisoner of war in Afghanistan who was tortured, which allowed her to connect with people who had similar experiences.Allen Salyer,Michigan, USALane Pryce - Mad MenView image in fullscreenSuperbly nuanced … Jared Harris as Lane Pryce and Christina Hendricks as Joan Holloway in Mad Men.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyLane Pryce inMad Menwas an excellent addition to an already formidable cast. His own brand of 60s Englishness was a jolt in the arm for both the fictional company and the show and his story arc was expertly drawn right until its conclusion. Jared Harris was superbly nuanced, and his office brawl with Pete, sleeves up, Queensbury rules, will live on as one of TV’s most surprising, tame and funniest fight scenes. Just brilliant.Ben,Burgess HillFrank – It’s Always Sunny in PhiladelphiaIt’s hard to remember that series one didn’t have Danny DeVito in it. Getting such a sitcom legend in the show was a total coup – his bromance with room mate and possible son Charlie is heartwarming and disgusting in equal measure. He’s filthy rich (or just plain filthy), kinky and heartless. The show would be poorer without him.Anna,GlasgowLord Flashheart – BlackadderView image in fullscreenFlash by name, flash by nature! … Lord Flashheart (Rik Mayall) and Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) in Blackadder.Photograph: BBCLord Flashheart (Rik Mayall) in Blackadder II: “Flash by name, Flash by nature!

Woof!Rob,LondonMeg – MotherlandMeg (Tanya Moodie), who arrives in season two of Motherland, disrupts the group at the school gates and doesn’t give a shit. I love her because she is funny and outrageous yet vulnerable like all of us.

The impact of his actions affected the show long after his exit. He rattled everyone. But he was the greatest earner of Tony’s crew. Murdered his pregnant mistress. Organised the murder of his partner’s son. Charming, yet charmless. Evil with a smile and the calmest bully, yet distraught and vulnerable at his son’s death. A domineering devotee of toxic masculinity, yet secretly needed to be dominated sexually by big women. A truly unforgettable character who gave The Sopranos a cruel, comical oxygen for two long years.Ronnie, LondonSideshow Bob – The SimpsonsView image in fullscreenJust perfect … Sideshow Bob (voiced by Kelsey Grammer) in The Simpsons.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyI see your Frasier Crane and raise you Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons, another Kelsey Grammer character who first appeared in a non-speaking part in episode eight of season one.

But there is suffering in his art: ‘I kind of enjoy negativity,’ he saysThu 4 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTShareIn the expensive hush of a hotel bar over the road from the RoyalBalletand Opera in Covent Garden, London, Matthew Ball asks for a mint tea. I’m having a white wine; Ball’s body is clearly more of a temple than mine, although you don’t need to know our drinks orders to see that: he has an effortlessly straight-backed posture, muscular arms under a white T-shirt. On stage, ballet dancers can seem like mighty gods and goddesses, but often IRL they are petite. Not so Ball, whose tall stature is part of why he’s much in demand for princely roles and partnering. With the fine features and strong angles of his face, and those piercing eyes, there’s a bit of the Robert Pattinson about him. Is he as brooding and romantic in his roles on stage? Certainly. Tortured? We’ll come to that.At 31, Ball is riding the crest of a career that seems to have gone pretty smoothly so far. Growing up in Liverpool, he didn’t get much stick for being into ballet as a kid (the worst comments came from another girl in his ballet class). Joining the Royal Ballet School at 11, he graduated straight into the Royal Ballet company and was promoted each year, making it to the top rank of principal in 2018. He has loved getting his teeth into meaty dramatic roles, especially the psychological turmoil of Kenneth MacMillan’s ballets: the suicidal Crown Prince Rudolf in Mayerling or the doomed poet Des Grieux in Manon. As a guest star he was smouldering as The Stranger in Matthew Bourne’s popular Swan Lake and made a virtuoso cameo, spinning in a Paul Smith suit, in the recent Quadrophenia ballet. Plus, he dances at galas all over the world, often with his Brazilian girlfriend and fellow Royal Ballet principal Mayara Magri. He would groan at me telling you that Tatler called them “The Posh’n’Becks of ballet”. “They really went to town on that,” he shakes his head bashfully, “Golden Balls!”View image in fullscreenScene setter … Matthew Ball.Photograph: Viktor Erik EmanuelBall’s next starring role is as himself, in an “Evening With…” event from producers Fundamentally Dance, a new live series aiming to give behind-the-scenes insights into the mysteries of a dancer’s craft. Ball will be giving a “walk and talk” through one of his roles, showing how his mind whirs as he’s performing, especially in the intense, emotionally complex roles he prefers. Against type, he recently made his debut as Colas in Frederick Ashton’s La Fille Mal Gardée, a sunny 1960 ballet romcom with a pantomime dame thrown in. Colas leaps about in bright yellow tights. “I was like: I’m so not used to this. Where’s my angst? What am I going to do with my eyebrows?” He furrows and unfurrows his brow.But even the showboating ballets are a mental game, he says. Don Quixote is one of the toughest technically. “Your lungs are burning, your legs get heavy, but it’s really a neural fatigue.” The first entrance is explosive, nought to 60. “It’s like a lightning bolt’s come for you, and then you come off and you’re in the wings and … woah,” he looks stunned. But it’s a sprint start to a marathon. Often the biggest moment of a ballet is in the third act, the climax of the show, so you need to be hitting your peak around 10pm. “And your legs are like: ‘I’m not sure I can do that.’”What about after a show, how does it feel when he’s pulled it off? “It feels pretty good,” he says. “But because I’m trying to squeeze all the juice out of it, and get lost in the character emotionally, quite often I do feel embarrassed afterwards. In the sense of: what did I show? After Mayerling I’m always like: God, what must people think? Wow, you went somewhere that maybe you don’t even reveal to yourself.”Breaking the rules is interesting, but just pretending that they’re not a thing any more – I don’t know how far you can go with thatIn person, Ball is thoughtful, mild-mannered and quick to laugh at himself. But the choreographer Paul Lightfoot once said: “There’s a kind of suffering in him.” Is there? “I’m quite energetic in the studio, and in general, but I do have a dark side, and when I go there I’m quite internal and I just need to process things. I kind of enjoy negativity sometimes. I’ve always felt that negativity has been an instigator for positive change.”As an example, he didn’t do well in competitions at school, he says, “and that made me really, like …” he searches for the word and pops with laughter as he finds it, “vengeful!” It was motivation to prove he could do it. That tenacity must have come from somewhere. “I don’t know. My parents weren’t pushy at all with these things,” says Ball, but they were encouraging: his mum taught dance in secondary schools, his dad did teacher training using drama. “My dad’s a massive showoff. He loves stealing a room from time to time.” Maybe there was a competitive streak, he says, as the youngest of four siblings. “My brother was three years older so I was clawing to try to catch up.”By nine or 10 Ball was pursuing dance seriously. His mum would show him videos of Nureyev and he bought into the “mystique” of such legendary dancers. He remembers having a “weird moment” thinking what would happen if he didn’t get into ballet school. “I remember feeling that I wouldn’t be OK,” he says. But he did get there, the watershed was reading the book Mao’s Last Dancer, about the dancer Li Cunxin, who was chosen from his impoverished village in communist China for intensive training in Beijing. “It flipped a switch, it made me go a bit obsessive.”In the book Li tells how he tied sandbags to his ankles and hopped up and down flights of stairs to improve his strength. “I was not going through any hardship,” Ball says, realising how easy his life has been compared to Li’s, “but people would laugh at me because I’d be running up and down the fire escape while everyone else was sitting on the floor.” There’s no growth without pushing yourself beyond what’s comfortable, he thinks, and he’s up for it. “I really enjoy flirting with that edge.”View image in fullscreenIn step … Matthew Ball with Mayara Magri, his fellow Royal Ballet principal and girlfriend.Photograph: Viktor Erik EmanuelThe next challenge: making his own choreography. It’s common to hear choreographers say they want to push boundaries, reinvent the art form; the dance equivalent of “move fast and break things”. But for Ball, “there’s nothing wrong with organic movement”. “There’s a reason why it’s attractive, in the way nature’s attractive. There’s an inbuilt idea of beauty, and you can play with that. Breaking the rules is interesting, but just pretending that they’re not a thing any more and that we’re not human, I don’t know how far you can go with that.” At the same time, he’s not interested in “waving around making pretty shapes”. “There’s so much ballet like that, the wafting vibe,” he says.He wants his work to be loaded with meaning, and looks to literature, music and painting for inspiration (current faves: Sibelius, Steinbeck). He is influenced by the contemporary choreographer Jiří Kylián, artistic director of the Nederlands Dans Theater, a company where Ball was offered an apprenticeship before choosing the Royal Ballet, in a small sliding doors moment. He would also like to present dance in smaller spaces, having danced for choreographer Kim Brandstrup at Bath’s Ustinov Studio (capacity 126, as opposed to the Royal Opera House’s 2,256).“It was just really thrilling,” he says. “You’re so close to the audience. I felt as if they were thinking: ‘That’s a person, and they’re sweating,’” he inhales the imaginary scent. “‘I can see them breathing.’ There’s a lot of immediacy and it makes it very tangible.” He even mentions staging dance in churches. “I don’t practise a religion, but I find the theatre of religion really interesting. And that it’s a dedicated space for contemplation. Even the idea of raising ourselves to a higher plane, in whatever sense that might mean.”Ball has made duets for himself and Magri, and the level of trust they have in each other is clear. In To and Fro there’s a startling lift when Ball basically tosses Magri up into the air and over his head while she’s in sideways splits. “We tried it out on the beach first, in Bahia in Brazil,” he says. “It was like Dirty Dancing.” He and Magri aren’t usually matched as a couple at the Royal Ballet and perhaps it’s healthy not to be together 24/7 (the pair share a flat off the Holloway Road in north London). “It might be a bit much. We’re both quite strong-willed people, so it’s not always hunky dory. But I think we lend each other a lot of support. If she’s away and not in the wings or watching my show, I feel it a lot. That makes me sound so needy!” he laughs. “I feel like we’re each other’s favourite cheerleader,” he says, which sounds like the definition of a good relationship.You can see them giving masterclasses together on Ball’s Instagram, along with clips from the dance films Ball makes, modelling shoots, and all the usual ballet dancer photos of beautifully sculpted bodies that elicit multiple fire emojis in the comments. Does he mind that what gets traction on social media can be a bit, shall we say, objectifying? Not really. “The body is just what we work with, so I don’t feel very precious about it.” He recalls being bowled over by Michelangelo’s David in Florence and all the different levels on which you could look at it: “It could be sexualised, but also idealised and pure at the same time. The sensitivity of the sculpture, the vein that feels like it’s literally pulsing, the most delicate skin.” It’s a stretch to compare Instagram with the Italian Renaissance but you get what he’s saying.Ball describes himself when he was younger as being “desperate for success”. Has it lived up to his expectations? “I feel very aware of how life is a different reality to the dreams you made as a young person,” he says, quick to add, “I don’t feel disappointed or disenchanted, I enjoy alotof what I do.” He probably has another decade of dancing, but where do you go after you’ve ticked all the boxes on your list? Ball can’t quite picture it. “I was iron-willed about this, when I was nine, and I feel as if I made it happen for myself,” he says.“I suppose in the future, I want to be a bit more gentle with myself.”An Evening With Matthew Ballis at Royal Academy of Music: Susie Sainsbury theatre, London, 14 December.Explore more on these topicsDanceBalletinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Surprisingly – because he was already a hero – Tom agreed to meet.I went to his apartment and we talked about the novel and the idea of love as a form of madness. It was a theme that was quite personal to him. I think he’d lived that a few times, and it became the thesis for the adaptation. Tom very simply went through the book and removed anything that didn’t relate to it.View image in fullscreenStoppard smoking.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverOn that first meeting, it was immediately clear that he liked smoking, a lot – which was something we shared. He also liked wine gums and, like all great smokers, knew the trick of keeping sweets close at hand, to use as palate cleansers between cigarettes. He loved sweets, smoking, words and women – probably in the reverse order.At the time, I was expecting my first son and staying with my then in-laws in Encinitas, north of San Diego. Tom came out there to work on the script with me, which was very gallant of him. He always travelled with a mobile library he’d had made for himself: a wooden case with a top that opened and folded out, full of the latest hardbacks.We tried to book him into the nicest hotel in the area but it didn’t have rooms with balconies and therefore he wouldn’t have been able to smoke, so he ended up somewhere quite grotty instead.Every day, he would come to my in-laws’ garage where we’d work. It was really not fancy. One day we went up to Los Angeles and had lunch with Mick Jagger, whichwasfancy. But Tom was perfectly at home at the most fancy end of the spectrum and the least fancy end. In Encinitas he was never recognised; elsewhere he was, but those people who knew who he was didn’t rush up and bombard him. Rather, they laid themselves gently before him.I tried to subtly coerce him into being a surrogate father. It didn’t workThe entire screenplay was written by hand in blue ink on a foolscap pad, with very little crossing out. The scenes were formed in his head and then he wrote them down. The script was then given to his assistant and typed into screenplay form. He would then annotate it with notes, hand it back, and she would deliver a typed screenplay.He wrote the film as a straight, naturalistic drama. But then, because of budget pressures, we turned it into something quite different, mostly taking place in a theatre. He was incredibly supportive and liked the idea that we were articulating his text in a different form. He came to the set a few times, but didn’t like being there as he didn’t have a role to fill. I think he found it all a bit noisy and busy.And then, around that time, he fell in love with Sabrina Guinness and it was wonderful. I remember a magical long walk in Manhattan with them. It was one of those gorgeous autumnal evenings in the city and they both shared stories from their incredible lives. There was no co-dependency, just a mutual love and admiration – and a connection that allowed them the freedom to be themselves.View image in fullscreenAaron Taylor-Johnson and Keira Knightley in Anna Karenina.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarMy relationship with Tom was easy and clean, with no baggage and no terrible mistakes. My life at the time was a bit of a mess and I think he recognised that and was never judgmental. During the course of our relationship, I tried to subtly coerce him into being a surrogate father – my own father died when I was 18.It didn’t work. I’d ask Tom for personal advice but he’d always resist giving it, saying: “I don’t know anything about that.” But later on, he would sometimes come up with a little story that would relate to the question you’d asked; an anecdote from his life that might help.We made each other laugh. I think he thought I was vaguely ridiculous and I’d treat him with a level of respect, but not too much deference. I liked teasing him, just a little bit, about things like his knighthood. I remember how the porter in his apartment block called him Sir Tom – and Tom didn’t tell him not to. I also asked why he had a Czech accent given that he left the country aged two. “How come you still talk with this sexy eastern European voice? I think you’re putting it on.” He would chuckle at that. There was a mischief about him.View image in fullscreenStoppard and Wright at the Lincoln Center in 2012.Photograph: Slaven Vlašić/Getty ImagesAs someone who had left school at 16 with no qualifications, I was really inspired that a person as smart as Tom hadn’t been to Oxbridge. He never stopped learning. Everything was of interest to him and every person he met was a teacher in some way. There are those clever people who make you feel small; he was one of those very clever people who make you feel much, much bigger than you are.He had this talent for raising you up and making you feel empowered intellectually just by his attention. He listened with an amazing gentleness, which is why I think people – women especially – so loved him. Tom was just a really beautiful human being who liked being loved. And I loved him.As told to Catherine ShoardExplore more on these topicsFilmTom StoppardJoe WrightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The MENA region has historically always been a bridge between east and west.”The power list’s top 10 features several artists and curators from the Middle East andAfrica. Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, one of the most powerful women in Qatar and the chair of Qatar Museums since 2006, is at No 2, in part due to her immense purchasing power.Last year’s No 1, Sheikha Hoor al-Qasimi, the president and director of the Sharjah Art Foundation in the United Arab Emirates, slips two places to No 3, and the Egyptian artist Wael Shawky comes in at No 4.Singapore’sHo Tzu Nyen(5), the AmericansAmy Sherald(6),Kerry James Marshall(7) and Saidiya Hartman (8), the UK-based groupForensic Architecture(9) and Germany’sWolfgang Tillmans(10) round out the top 10.Mahama has had an incredibly busy couple of years. He is represented by the influential Apalazzo Gallery and White Cube galleries and his practice includes using old hospital beds, discarded train carriages and other artefacts that he turns into art objects.Last year at Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery, Mahama’s Songs About Roses, which focused on the rise and fall of the railway that the British government built in Ghana between 1898 and 1923, was described as being “as extraordinary as a great magic-realist novel”.TheGuardian’s Jonathan Jones saidthe work’s reckoning with history’s ghosts “puts Mahama up there with William Kentridge and Anselm Kiefer as one of today’s most important artists”.View image in fullscreenMahama’s work Purple Hibicus at the Barbican in 2023.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianA few months before his Edinburgh show opened, Mahamadraped the Barbicanin 2,000 sq metres of bright pink fabric, which had been stitched together in a football field in Ghana because it was so large.In 2019, Mahama opened the Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art in Tamale, a 900 sq metre site that is an exhibition space, library, residency space, archive and studio.Rappolt said many of the highest-ranking artists ran programmes in their local communities. He said of Mahama: “He’s not acting as this classic idea of the sole artist producing his own the flashes of genius, but also as a person who’s part of a community.”Thirty anonymous experts from around the world compiled the annual power ranking, which has been running for 24 years.Explore more on these topicsArtGhanaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Despite highlighting its own issues in the title, this novel got a rather mixed reception from the more judgmental corners of the internet on account of the age difference between the lovers. The gap between Maya and Conor, her big brother’s best friend, is 15 years – she is 23 to his 38. Depending on your generation and point of view, this is either completely and absolutely fine, or intensely concerning, despite the heroine insisting valiantly on her own agency and a reluctant romantic hero who resists the affair for this very reason. The book itself is typically charming and incredibly enjoyable, full of one-liners and cheek. (Far less controversially, she has followed it up with Mate, about a vampire bride falling in love with a werewolf. Sex with an actual animal is notably less problematic than an age gap in 2025.)Sweet HeatBolu Babalola (Headline)Previously a Reese Witherspoon book club pick for her 2022 novel Honey & Spice, Babalola continues to show why with this gorgeous, lush new book featuring the same characters. Kiki is now running a romance podcast while her own love life is the traditional disaster area, when suddenly her handsome ex Malakai turns up as the best man at a wedding where she is maid of honour … It’s witty, obviously, but there’s a warmth and real depth to the characterisation and the issues affecting the young Londoners it portrays. Will you see what’s coming a mile off? Definitely. Will you enjoy the journey? Every bit of it.View image in fullscreenCover StoryMhairi McFarlane (HarperColins)McFarlane is so funny she was drafted in to the writers’ room for Slow Horses, the wittiest show on television. Fortunately she’s also still working as a novelist, which is excellent news for her avid fans. Cover Story is about two journalists who hate each other having to pretend to be a couple, but really it’s just an excuse for her sharp observations and deep, fundamental sweetness. The world is always a better place with McFarlane’s stories in it.Heart the LoverLily King (Canongate)“You knew I’d write a book about you one day,” begins this intensely brainy, tightly observed love story. From the cover, a homage to the classic Great Gatsby cover image of weeping eyes on a blue background, to the narrator’s adopted name – Jordan – and the two other sides of the triangle, Sam and Yash, calling their dates “Daisies”, you know you’re in proper, wallowing, literary-allusion territory. This is a book that explores youthful passion and its consequences down the decades with charm and precision: a perfect, no-brainer gift for the romantically minded English lit student in your life.To browse all romance books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

The second in the trilogy pits the Brightlanders, who persecute those with “songlight”, against the Aylish, who prize them – and the Teroans, spacefaring telepaths who see ordinary humans as disposable. As multiple finely drawn protagonists – including Elsa, searching desperately for sanctuary, Nightingale, forced to appease a terrifying captor, and Rye, trying to understand an extraordinary discovery – fight to find love, acceptance and safety, the book blazes like its title, consuming the reader more fiercely with every page.

The power of words to wound, but also to tell of authentic living, courage and change, delivered via sit-ins, marches and protests on every scale, is apparent throughout this book, which chronicles queer activism in the UK and US from the 1950s to the early 21st century. Though it contains many stories of violence and suffering, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the ravages of HIV/Aids, the prevalent mood, emphasised by Roberts’s bold, colourful, expressive artwork, is of defiance, joy and proud hope – from Quentin Crisp’s flamboyance to the iterations of the Pride flag, Julian Hows wearing a skirt as a London Underground worker in the 70s to the first same-sex pre-watershed kiss. An outstanding achievement, setting out via individual, accessible narratives the hard-won rights that remain continually under threat.No RefugePatrice Aggs and Joe Brady(DFB)This standalone sequel to the superlative No Country is set in a horribly plausible war-torn Britain, where hostile bureaucracy preys on refugee children. Now that civil war has reached their home, Hannah, Bea and their little brother Dom flee, leaving their father behind; following The Plan, they hope to be reunited, but hiding from Free Kingdom soldiers and keeping themselves safe becomes steadily harder, even before they find themselves trapped in the oppressively policed Green Zone on the way to their rendezvous. Aggs’s dynamic images, muted colours and unsettling perspectives create a pervasive sense of fear in this empathy-honing, finely crafted and compelling graphic novel.View image in fullscreenWhat Happens OnlineNathanael Lessore (Hot Key)Fred’s life is tough. His dad works away, his mum’s struggling to cope, and at school he’s a nonentity with no friends. Online, though, Fred’s alter ego Existor is a gamer and streamer with an off-the-charts follower count – the polar opposite of his unpopular creator. Two worlds collide when Fred is tempted to use Existor’s influence to seed rumours about his bullying classmates – but when his lies spread like wildfire, the eventual consequences are damaging and painful. Who is Fred really, and who is willing to accept his offline self? With his deadpan humorous light touch, the award-winning Lessore investigates self-esteem, identity and on- and offline realities in a standout 13+ story that effortlessly blends the serious and comic, tackling the tough stuff without ever feeling preachy.Feminist History for Every Day of the YearKate Mosse, illustrated by Sophie Bass (Pan Macmillan)Spirited and inspiring, this compendium of “trailblazers through time and space” features a genuinely impressive range of iconic women – anti-apartheid campaigner Lilian Ngoyi and bra-designing Caresse Cosby stand alongside Florence Nightingale, Mary Wollstonecraft and Boudicca – while thought-provoking essays on subjects such as the climate emergency, male feminism, names and fashion introduce each month. Acknowledging that the views of some of her chosen heroes might tempt younger readers to “cancel” them, Mosse argues persuasively for not simply “leav[ing] out those we don’t agree with or don’t like” – since “women, like men, contain contradictions”. A deeply absorbing resource for anyone interested in fairness.To browse all children’s and young adult books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Noël Coward’s comedy of (wishful) female infidelity is one such play, first performed 100 years ago and brought to life now as a period piece that offers insight into the mores of the day – and Coward’s fearlessness in the face of bourgeois morality. Almost banned by the UK censor, it was deeply shocking then, and amusing now, with its two interwar-era “girls behaving badly” on a champagne-fuelled night before and regretful morning after.All of Coward’s preoccupations are here, from disappointment and distance in a pair of marriages to sexual yearning and unfaithfulness – even if the latter is not realised. Except now it is two women plotting it together. The play kicks off at the residence of Julia (Janie Dee) and Fred Steroll (Richard Teverson), over breakfast, when a newspaper notice of a divorce is read out. A sign of things to come?Not quite. Firm friends Julia and Jane (Alexandra Gilbreath) spend the day together while Fred and Jane’s husband, Bill (Christopher Hollis), go on a golfing trip. Little do the men know that their wives are preparing to meet Maurice, a hot moustachioed Frenchman and old flame of both women whose memory reignites all the carnal desire that has lain unspent in their marriages.Directed entertainingly by Christopher Luscombe, it builds to comic drunkenness, crossed-wire phone calls and Restoration comedy-style mayhem until the marital reckoning – and an appearance from Maurice (Graham Vick) himself, who until late in the day is an elusive, Godot-like figure.View image in fullscreenPeriod fun … Fallen Angels.Photograph: Manuel HarlanIt is not as rich as Blithe Spirit or Private Lives, and a little one note, but it is impeccably performed, with shades of 1920s screwball comedy and excellent turns from Dee, who plays Julia as blithely imperious, and Gilbreath, who becomes more cackling and crude as she tips back the bubbles. Both women bring midlife malaise and the plays’ final note of renegade spirit does not quite restore the old marital order.Coward wrote additional material for the play in 1958, expanding the part of the maid, Saunders (Sarah Twomey), which has been included in this production. She is an absolute hoot, turning out to be a proficient dancer, French-speaker, piano player and inveterate raconteur.The handsome set, designed by Simon Higlett, is another highlight, with all its art deco detail intact, along with elegant costumes (silver Mary Jane pumps, beaded, dropped-waist dresses) designed by Fotini Dimou.So a nugget of dramatic history and lesser-known early play by Coward – a bookend to the Orange Tree theatre’s recent, revived trilogy of late works,Suite in Three Keys. And well worth seeing for the sheer period fun of it.AtMenier Chocolate Factory, London, until 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMenier Chocolate FactoryNoel CowardreviewsShareReuse this content"

But if there’s no food for thought, the jokes have to hit big. And tonight, they don’t. By the end, it’s clear even Jones doesn’t think he’s had a good gig, protesting to his audience that we’ve been the most “tepid” of his tour – and musing aloud about how little the Guardian critic will have enjoyed it. In fact, the Guardian critic enjoyed the Mancunian’s company well enough – camp and ebullient, he’d be hard not to like – but wished for a better show: for more substantial content, some structure, or for jokes that developed beyond first (or – credit where it’s due – sometimes second) base.What we get is a seemingly formless meander through the 32-year-old’s life, taking in his family, a stint on Dancing on Ice and the social climb that has taken him from a “bin fire” Manchester suburb to the fringes of well-heeled Cheshire. For that, he has a new relationship to thank, and there’s a fun routine here about the encounter between his “hugger” boyfriend and Josh’s very non-tactile dad. Another choice gag late in the show, about “bumming”, sharply contrasts his postcoital feelings depending on whether he’s played “bummer” or “bummee”.But elsewhere, pickings are slim. Too often, so-called jokes are just vaguely amusing things that have happened to Jones – like being hit on by a woman in Cancún. He makes a great play about his supposedly transgressive “nonce” joke, but the gag itself barely registers as such – it’s just a setup, a situation, with no punchline or incident. Then there’s his digression into the slave trade, with its drive-by ignorance of local context (he ascribes to a Glasgow a history free of colonial guilt) and very underwhelming payoff.Wrapping up in under an hour, this is a vanishingly insubstantial set, then, without the craft or quality of gags that might redeem that flimsiness. Far from being got at for tepidness, I’d say tonight’s audience deserves credit for its discernment.AtMonkey Barrel Edinburgh, on 4 December.Then touringto April.Explore more on these topicsStageComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Gone are the days when David Bowie could seemingly arrive fully formed with Space Oddity and Hunky Dory, with most of the record-buying public unaware of his years of struggle in bands such as the Lower Third; or when Robert Zimmerman could become Bob Dylan and invent a backstory about running away with the circus as a teenager. Today’s artists are so intensely scrutinised once they get even a glimmer of success that there’s always the chance some internet sleuth will blow a performer’s cred by unearthing a terrible video of them caterwauling through Wonderwall in sixth form. Which makes Dove Ellis so thoroughly unusual, because so little is known about him.His debut album arrives with no biography and barely any information at all apart from the track listing and a few minor details. He doesn’t appear to have ever given an interview and in one song here scolds: “Keep their cameras off my face.” His publicist, whose job thus far seems solely to be sending out music, describes Ellis as a “an introverted character”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for BlizzardOne can piece together this: he’s 22 and from Galway but relocated to Manchester. The songs he posted on Bandcamp led to a bidding war, but he rejected the attentions of major labels to go with an independent. He recently opened forGeeseon their US tour dates but otherwise seems to have been playing pubs and small venues in London (including the buzzy Windmill) and Manchester for a couple of years now. As recently as October he was opening the student night at Sheffield’s Sidney & Matilda, where he apparently went down the usual storm. His next London show (at the ICA on 9 December) sold out within an hour, but if his self-produced debut arrives to burgeoning expectations it’s entirely because of the quality of the music.The few reviewers who have seen Ellis so far mostly compare him to Jeff Buckley or his father, Tim Buckley – fair comparisons given how Ellis’s remarkable vocals can settle into a dreamy falsetto so fragile he could be dancing on a pin, and then suddenly perform a handbrake turn into intensity, even anger. The way the arrangements (including saxophone and drums) dart around his voice in ornate little counter-melodies recalls fellow Irishman Van Morrison, and recent single To the Sandals noticeably nods to Joan Armatrading’s Love and Affection. Thom Yorke and Rufus Wainwright have also been mentioned, but none of these comparisons quite pin Ellis down, not least because he shifts shape so frequently.Dove Ellis: Pale Song – videoBeautiful opener Little Left Hope begins as fragile as Nick Drake, but erupts into something much more rousing, the words capturing the rocky road to making music: “Maybe we’ll start a band / With the stranger you have to like / Cos he knows how to play the drums.” Ellis’s lyrics frequently seem to flutter between hope and despair, before building to a purifying conclusion. In the magically warm Pale Song, the past is a trouble which, perhaps, can be shaken off: “The past is like a sign / A sign it never talks / A sign you think you’ve lived / But it’s just stone with a little chalk.” In the singalong-friendly Love Is, he roars, “Love is not the antidote to all your problems,” but concludes, “Love is your last chance.” In Jaundice he uses the unlikely vehicle of rumbustious rock’n’roll infused with an Irish jig to seemingly rail against unfairness: “Sometimes a child is born without any face / At the breast of their own mother right out of place.”Ellis has described To the Sandals – a Bandcamp release now mixed/spruced up by Big Thief producer Andrew Sarlo – as concerning “reflections on a failing shotgun marriage in Cancún”. Not that the unlikely subject of an ill-fated union hastened by pregnancy in Mexico is particularly obvious in lines such as: “From your grace / The sadist fails / Their red blade / A-rallying, tallying.”Trying to unravel the songs’ meanings can become a parlour game, but it’s enough to savour his dazzling use of language or the sheer emotion in heart-swelling songs such as When You Tie Your Hair Up. The 10 tunes are so strong they seem as familiar as old friends, and if Ellis isn’t reinventing the wheel, he’s certainly giving the old thing a caring coat of varnish. His songs sound meticulously crafted but the recordings themselves have a beautifully intimate, unadorned, down-home feel. At times, the picked and strummed guitars, rolling 70s rock piano, wind instruments and clattering percussion are interspersed with random noises and distortion, but somehow everything seems to have fallen perfectly into place on a glorious debut.This week Dave listened toLouis O’Hara – MagpieFrom Pembroke Dock in west Wales, this gently folksy tribute to a longstanding friendship is unusually touching and truly lovely.Alexis Petridis is awayExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

To mark its recent release, she’ll be joining us to answer your questions.After leaving the US midwest and striking out for London in the mid-1970s – where she worked for the NME and Vivienne Westwood’s shop Sex – she shuttled between punk bands and couldn’t get anything off the ground until she formed the Pretenders in 1978.With the No 1 hit Brass in Pocket among their earliest singles, their career trajectory was near-vertical, and as the 80s continued, the lineup shifted but always with Hynde out front, her insouciant style making her a defining frontperson of the era. Hits mounted up – I Go To Sleep, 2000 Miles – and the band released one of the biggest power ballads of the 90s, I’ll Stand By You. They’ve eventually released 12 studio albums, with the latest, 2023’s Relentless, giving them their highest chart placing since the mid-1990s.Along the way, Hynde has been a brilliant vocal foil in a series of collaborations: her cover of I Got You Babe with UB40 was a UK chart-topper, while Frank Sinatra, Cher and INXS’s Michael Hutchence have been some of her other vocal partners. There are 13 more duets on the new album as Chrissie Hynde & Pals, with Lucinda Williams, Shirley Manson, Alan Sparhawk and Cat Power among the other names.Hynde will answer your questions on that star-studded project and anything else in her long career. Post them in the comments below before 10am GMT on Monday 8 December, and we’ll publish her answers in the Friday 12 December edition of the Film & Music section, as well as online.Explore more on these topicsChrissie HyndeFilm & Music reader interviewPop and rockcalloutShareReuse this content"

Among the originators of the quintessentially 90s acid-jazz genre, Jamiroquai are now a legacy act worthy of their own themed dress-up. Tonight, sole founding member and noted headgear enthusiast Jay Kay (hat tally: four) draws from three decades of material, ranging from their 1993 debut Emergency on Planet Earth to new material set for release next year.Because many of these songs rely on flashy production, their strongest elements often get lost when translated to a live setting. The sweeping strings of Little L get buried in the mix, as do the beats on disco-leaning tracks such as Canned Heat. Seven Days in Sunny June is a bit livelier, benefiting from loose arrangements and acoustic instrumentation. Early single Too Young to Die is a showcase for Jay Kay’s impressive vocal range, still intact more than 30 years on.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Roberto Ricciuti/RedfernsThe stage is set up as if for a vintage Vegas act, with a backing band arranged on cascading levels – somewhat to the detriment of their free-flowing frontman. Jay Kay is constantly moving around but never seems to have enough space to do his thing, having to shuffle in place or bounce on the monitors. Every time he has some back and forth with the enthusiastic crowd – including some attempts at Scottish vernacular – it seems as though he wishes he could be getting down alongside them, rather than remaining up on stage.Even when dealing with some sound issues, he and his band are an extremely polished live act, but there’s no thrill in polish. Ultimately, this is a facsimile of music with more substance: Cloud 9 aims for gospel but there’s no depth; Tallulah has funk elements but a lack of sensuality; Disco Stays the Same has none of the essential transcendence of the genre it pays tribute to. However, as with many legacy acts, this doesn’t matter – the audience love these songs and will continue to love them for as long as Jay Kay and co play them competently, so they don’t have to worry about converting nonbelievers.At Co-Op Live, Manchester, 6 December;then touringExplore more on these topicsPop and rockDance musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It includes all three larger chamber works plus the composer’s own two-piano arrangement of his orchestral masterpiece La Valse: Alasdair Beatson and Simon Crawford-Phillips are a polished team in this, sounding wonderfully louche early on and then dispatching fistfuls of notes and long glissandos with seeming ease, all while catching the music’s increasingly sinister nature.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Ravel: Chamber Music.Photograph: OnyxThe 1905 Introduction and Allegro was a commission from a harp manufacturer, intended to make their instrument sound good – which it duly does as played by Lucy Wakeford, although what is most striking is the way the seven instruments coalesce and separate to create kaleidoscopic textural interest. Indeed, as confirmed by their quicksilver, sometimes excitably fierce String Quartet and especially by their vibrant performance of the Piano Trio, it’s the attention to the details of colour and tone that really makes these performances take flight, the instruments combining to catch the dazzling light and intriguing shade that are such intrinsic features of Ravel’s music.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

As bedtime routines go, however, this one involves a novel step – placing my lower legs in a mesh bag and clipping it into seatbelt-style buckles on either side; the bed will be travelling at around 50mph for the next 12 hours and there are safety regulations to consider.Last month Swiss startup Twiliner launched a fleet of futuristic sleeper buses, and I’ve come to Amsterdam to try them out. Running three times a week between Amsterdam and Zurich (a 12-hour journey via Rotterdam, Brussels, Luxembourg and Basel), with a Zurich to Barcelona service (via Berne and Girona) launching on 4 December, the company’s flat-bed overnight sleeper buses are the first such service in Europe.“Flying is one of the main drivers of climate change. We wanted to design an alternative that people would actually want to use,” the company’s co-founder and CEO, Luca Bortolani, told me before Twiliner’s launch. Their solution is a seat that turns into a genuinely comfortable bed. Manufactured by Greater Manchester-based Airline Services Interiors, it’s similar to a business class plane seat.Hoping for more shut-eye than red-eye, I lean into that luxury. While I could shorten my journey by taking a Eurostar from London to Brussels and catching the Twiliner there, I’m going London to Amsterdam, and trialling the full Zurich route. With Eurostar adding a fifth direct weekday service to Amsterdam this month, it’s a good alternative connecting hub for UK travellers venturing further into Europe.View image in fullscreenThe buses run on HVO fuel, considered highly sustainable compared with dieselAs viewers ofRace Across the Worldwill know, flatbed buses are common in Asia and South America, but they have been less successful in Europe. Twiliner hopes to change this by offering a service that’s both comfortable and sustainable. Run mostly on hydrotreated vegetable oil fuel (HVO, also called renewable diesel), the company claims its buses produce less than 10% of the CO2emissions of a comparable flight. Even when running on normal diesel, which sometimes the buses have to, a Twiliner bus is as sustainable as a sleeper train per passenger kilometre, it says.Currently operating three buses – one for each launch route plus a third for private charters – Twiliner hopes to offer 25 routes by 2028, possibly even adding a UK service. Though not exclusively targeting routes without sleeper trains, “our niche will be routes where lots of people travel and you don’t have a night train, or good connections,” said Bortolani.Our niche will be routes where lots of people travel and you don’t have a night train, or good connectionsLuca BortolaniA generous luggage allowance and the efficiency of being able to travel while asleep are pluses. These benefits (plus the novelty factor) aside, the biggest selling point is likely to be the comfort factor.The blip on this journey is boarding at Amsterdam’s outdoor bus station in Sloterdijk, a five-minute train ride from Amsterdam Centraal station. Standing in the dark, a chill wind chasing through the open space, I’m not entirely sure I’m in the right place. But then I spot a flash of violet and the bus arrives, navigating its huge bulk like a cruise liner inching into a small fishing harbour. The doors open and the lights on the Twiliner’s steps glow a soft, spaceship purple as I climb aboard.Downstairs are three seats, a spacious toilet, a changing room and self-service shelves selling eye masks, toothbrushes and snacks; ear plugs, coffee and wifi are free. I’m on the upper deck, in one of 18 seats with lofty views as well as USB ports. As we leave Amsterdam lights flicker in high-rise windows around me like colonies of square glow worms, and I click on the QR code by my seat to find instructions for my bed.View image in fullscreenThe bus reaches Zurich from Amsterdam in 12 hours 15 minutes.Photograph: Olena Serditova/AlamyAround me there is much excitement but the chatter soon dies down. A no-children-under-five policy and strict guidelines on food, drink and noise make for calm travelling. By 10pm I’m fast asleep only waking at 5.30am in high heat (a teething issue Twiliner is ironing out) and lie back, dozing like a very overgrown baby being wheeled along in a cushioned pram, until the sun rises and the temperature drops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rolling into Zurich on a frosty weekday morning, the city is streaked with silver and gold as it begins to stir. By the bus’s Nespresso machine I chat to Adrien, a student from St Gallen university. “It’s not quicker. It’s not cheaper. But it’s another option, and it’s a good one,” he says. “I slept. I feel rested.”Just over 25 hours after leaving my home in Somerset, a good chunk of which I’ve slept through, I arrive at Zurich’s Sihlquai bus station. Soaking up sunshine, I walk the 10 minutes to my hotel via the Christmas market on Europaallee, stopping for a hot, cinnamon-dustedÖpfuchüechli(apple doughnut) at one of its wooden booths.Along the river, the art-lined Helvetia hotel extols the virtues of its hand-stitched Hästens mattresses, designed to ensure its guests a restful night’s sleep. There’s one thing their beds can’t promise, though: to transport me, magic carpet-style, to a new destination the following morning.The trip was provided by Twiliner,Eurostar andZurich Tourism.Twilinertickets between Amsterdam and Zurich cost from150 Swiss francs (£141).

And, after those time-consuming nibbles, the smoked salmon starter and the turkey-with-all-the-trimmings main event, the last thing you want is a pudding that demands even more hands-on time at the culinary coalface. For me, the main requirement of any Christmas dessert is that it can be made well in advance, not least because, by the time the pudding stage comes around, I’ll be completely knackered and more than ready to put up my feet and finally relax (or, more likely, fall asleep on the sofa).Chocolate and hazelnut tart (pictured top)Prep15 minRest3 hr+Cook40 minServes6-8For the sweet pastry500g plain flour, plus extra for dusting150g caster sugar250g cold butter, diced2-3 eggs, lightly beatenFor the filling640g 70%-cocoa dark chocolate, broken into small pieces800ml double cream64g glucose syrup64g cold butter, cubed100g roasted hazelnuts, lightly choppedPut the flour and sugar in a large bowl, stir to combine, then add the diced butter and work it in with your fingertips until the mix takes on the consistency of rough breadcrumbs. Add two of the beaten eggs, then mix until the dough comes together into a ball; if need be, add the third beaten egg, but take great care not to overwork the dough. Wrap the pastry in clingfilm, then put it in the fridge and leave to rest for at least an hour.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the sweet pastry into a roughly 28cm round, then use it to line a lightly greased 24cmtart case with a removable base. Line the pastry with baking paper, fill with baking beans and blind bake for about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven, lift out the paper and beans, and leave tart case to cool in its tin. Once cool, neatly trim off any pastry overhang.Meanwhile, put the broken-up chocolate in a large bowl. Put the cream and glucose in a medium saucepan, bring slowly to a boil, then immediately pour the hot cream over the chocolate and whisk until smooth and emulsified. Finish by beating in the cold butter.Pour the chocolate mix into the cooled tart shell and set aside at room temperature for two to three hours, so it settles and sets.Just before serving, remove the tart from its tin, carefully transfer to a pretty plate, scatter the chopped hazelnuts all over the top, then slice and serve.Christmas zabaglioneView image in fullscreenPrep10 minCook10 minChill4 hr+Serves612 amaretti biscuits, roughly crumbled10 egg yolks250g sugar200mlmarsala50ml whisky50ml brandyBring a large pan of water to a boil. Meanwhile, divide the crumbled amaretti between six serving glasses – I use bog-standard wine glasses, but champagne coupes are a bit fancier.Put the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl that will later sit easily on top of the pan of boiling water without the base touching the water. Whisk until nice and frothy, then add all the alcohol and whisk again.Turn down the heat under the water pan to a simmer, set the bowl over the top and vigorously whisk the boozy egg mix for about five minutes, until it turns thick and creamy – once the whisk leaves a clear trail in the egg mix, the zabaglione is ready.Spoon or pour the zabaglione evenly over the biscuits in the glasses, then chill uncovered for at least four hours, and up to overnight, until set.

The proper kind of pudding, too: all dense but not leaden, heavy with prunes and warm with careful spicing.As December crept in, forgotten cousins and semi-estranged uncles seemed to find reasons to drop by her place. She never advertised the fact, of course, but everyone knew that if you came bearing even a modest offering, you might just leave with a pudding wrapped in waxed paper and still warm with possibility. The exchanges were subtle. One neighbour would “pop by for coffee” and just happen to bring two dozen mince pies; a friend would promise to collect the Christmas turkey from the butcher and bring it round, saving this lady the schlep across town. Nothing was said, no ledger kept, but the pudding always travelled in the right direction.I love this kind of seasonal bartering, not least because these edible interactions manage to bypass the digital world entirely. In an age where every conversation seems to take place on a screen and every relationship is fodder for some Silicon Valley metric, these small, delicious acts feel almost rebellious. We know we can count on the huge annual box of savoury nibbles from our nut suppliers, the one that keeps us and our guests going long after the last table has staggered home. And every year our neighbour’s daughter leaves a carefully wrapped block of Christmas cake by our door, shyly anonymous except for the neat handwriting on the label.View image in fullscreenFor giving and receiving … mince pies.Photograph: Isabella MooreAnother treat we look forward to every year isFuchsia Dunlop’s Christmas email – yes, it’s technically digital, but itfeelsedible. Each year she bakes something extraordinary and sends out a picture, along with a quiet, thoughtful story and her wishes for the season. Even though we can’t exactly eat it, the flavour is all there.We try to do our part, too. Every December, we offer the subscribers on our mailing list something different. Usually, that means some gingerbread tiles orchocolate from Ocelot, both of which are very letterbox-friendly. One year, after service, we made a gingery quince chutney from whatever happened to be lurking in the kitchen, jarred it in a sleepy haze and sent it out into the world. We got more requests for the recipe for that than anything else we’ve ever done, but we couldn’t share it because none of us could remember what we’d put in it.In much the same festive spirit, last weekend our friends atthe Fine Cider Companycame to our Christmas makers’ market with some seriously delicious things to drink – so delicious, in fact, that this year we may well give champagne a miss and take up sparkling cider as our celebratory tipple; we may also take ice cider over the annual obligatory port. For more cider-centric inspiration, check out Thomasina Miers’ feature on cocktails in Feast, free with the Guardian this Saturday and on the Feast app.It’s comforting to think that this kind of tiny ecosystem – this gentle, edible economy of gifts and favours – still exists. A community, I think it’s called: look after yours, and it’ll look after you. To feed your community with edible gifts,here are a few of our tried-and-tested favourites, and some we would absolutelylove to receive.My week in foodView image in fullscreenTruly sumptuous … papaya, persimmon and passion fruit.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverA winter fruit to savour|Persimmon season is always very exciting for us, but we seem to be almost alone in appreciating this glorious fruit. The question people always ask is: “But what do youdowith it?” The simple answer is: just eat it and enjoy its sweet glory! And if you really need something more elaborate, try a simple salad. Mix slices of good winter tomatoes, chopped celery and sliced persimmons with as much chilli as you can take and as much coriander as you have in the house. Season with salt, orange juice and olive oil, and enjoy the best, most joyous winter salad. You can also experiment with Nigel Slater’spersimmon and papaya salador try Rachel Roddy’s warmingapple, pear and persimmon crumble.
