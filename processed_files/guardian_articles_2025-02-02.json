The civil protection ministry said schools would be shut as a precautionary measure on Monday.“Nothing can be ruled out,” Kostas Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at Thessaloniki’s Aristotle University, told the state broadcaster ERT. “And that’s why precautionary measures are being put in place, precisely to limit the impact of a stronger earthquake.”Greece sits on multiple faultlines and is often rattled by earthquakes, but experts described the increased seismic activity over the space of 48 hours, with more than 200 tremors registered, as dramatic, although they emphasised that the tremors had been triggered by tectonic rather than volcanic activity.Papazachos told local media that many of the earthquakes measured 4 to 4.5 on the Richter scale, with the strongest recorded in waters between Santorini and Amorgos.The site of one the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history, Santorini is also Greece’s most popular Aegean isle, attracting an estimated 3.5 million tourists last year.By early evening on Sunday as similar measures were taken on Amorgos and the nearby islets of Ios and Anafi, rescue teams in Santorini pitched tents in elevated areas on basketball courts and in car parks. In the event of a tsunami, people were told to head inland.Ferry companies said there had been an increase in foreign workers leaving the island for the port of Piraeus. A UK government travel advisory referred to guidance issued by the Greek civil protection ministry on earthquakes.Research has shown the crust beneath the seas around Santorini to be replete with faultlines. In 1956 the island sustained extensive damage after being hit by an earthquake in excess of seven on the Richter scale, which caused a tsunami.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This commission is aiming to do just that – to ask the difficult questions, to engage the public and try to come up with a shared vision of how we live well together in modern Britain,” he said. “Having cross-party support and two of the best recent community secretaries co-chair it is a good place to start.”Its organisers say the commission will seek to “answer the foundational questions of how we live well together”.Sunder Katwala, the director of the thinktank British Future, a member of the Together Coalition, said it was a “really important time to do this – six months on from the riots, a shocking scene of racist disorder we haven’t seen in my lifetime”.He said the commission would look at “what are the sources of division and unity and what can we actually do about them”.Katwala said in the past there had been attempts to look at how best to improve community cohesion after major events but it had been “very stop-start and there’s not been the narrative or agenda for building the community cohesion ahead of whatever the next event is”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the paper, she argued that governments had failed for more than a decade to ensure that social integration in the UK kept up with the “unprecedented pace and scale of immigration” and had allowed some local communities to become increasingly divided.In 2018, she sounded the alarm on not enough having been done to improve community cohesion, and suggested the government could set a target date for “everybody in the country” to speak English. She is now the Labour government’s lead non-executive director.Denham, who was communities secretary under Gordon Brown from 2009 to 2010, told an event last year that “social cohesion is not the absence of riots” but should be judged “by whether most people believe they have a stake and a voice that is equal with others – and whether this is a nation with the confidence to handle difference through dialogue”.Javid, who was communities secretary when Casey’s 2016 report was published, said at the time he was drawn to public office holders having to swear a British oath of allegiance. “We can’t expect new arrivals to embrace British values if those of us who are already here don’t do so ourselves, and such an oath would go a long way to making that happen,” he said at the time.Javid said at the time that his aim was not to create a “government-approved one-size-fits-all identity” where everybody listened to the Last Night of the Proms, but “without common building blocks of our society, you’ll struggle to play a positive role in British life”.Explore more on these topicsCommunitiesSajid JavidJohn DenhamConservativesLabourSouthport attackFar rightnewsShareReuse this content"

I was just having the time of my life in my early 20s.”Saffrey’s diagnosis came after she experienced symptoms such as extreme fatigue, to the point where she was falling asleep at work, as well as joint pains, headaches, and mouth ulcers. But fortunately, her GP immediately suspected lupus when Saffrey presented those symptoms and she received her diagnosis relatively quickly. “Having been diagnosed, I remember thinking: how is this going to change my life? I was in shock, thinking one minute I’m invisible and the next minute I’m not. I now have this illness, this shadow over me.”View image in fullscreenJuliet Saffrey describes living with lupus as a constant challenge.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianSaffrey attempted to live her life as normally as she was able to, but at 28, she suddenly began to experience a life-threatening flare-up.“I started to feel ill, and the pain in my legs made it impossible to walk without help, and I suffered from debilitating brain fog and an itchy rash covered my cheeks,” Saffrey says. She then had a seizure while at home in bed, and, having been rushed to hospital in an ambulance, was told that lupus had affected her brain. “My health deteriorated rapidly. I lost my memory, my hair and my weight dropped to just 4½ stone. The team at University College Hospital (UCH) in Euston, London worked tirelessly to stabilise me and, through the grace of God, I slowly began to recover.”Since then, she says living with lupus has been a constant challenge: “I’ve had to adjust my work life, accept my limitations and face the emotional toll of living with a chronic illness. On top of lupus, I’ve developed osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and night blindness, all side-effects of having lupus and the medication I’ll need for the rest of my life.“But despite everything, I’m endlessly grateful for the incredible specialists at UCH who have been by my side every step of the way.“My husband has also been my rock, stepping in as both mum and dad to our daughters when I couldn’t. He’s shown me unwavering love and strength and I couldn’t have done this without him. Our daughters have had to grow up quickly and become self-sufficient, perhaps sooner than I would have liked but their resilience has been remarkable.”Carol Ricketts, 60, from London, was diagnosed with lupus in 1995. But unlike Saffrey, who was fortunate to have a GP who understood the symptoms of lupus, Ricketts had to fight to get her diagnosis. “When I expressed my concerns of my health to one doctor, and that I believed there was something going on with me but I wasn’t sure what it was, he said to me, ‘What is it with you women, when you turn 30 you start falling apart,’” Ricketts says. “I was really angry when he said that.”After Ricketts eventually received her diagnosis, her health took a turn for the worse in 1999 when complications led to her developing a blood clot in her left leg, which led to antiphospholipid syndrome, an immune disorder which causes an increased risk of blood clots. As a result, Ricketts was unable to continue working and hasn’t for the last 25 years.View image in fullscreenCarol Ricketts hasn’t been able to work since 1999.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianTreatment has also been complicated by developing allergies to some of her medication. Ricketts believes that there needs to be more awareness and research into what can be done to treat the disease.“Unfortunately there aren’t many medications out there for lupus, and for some of the medications which are out there, a lot of us can’t take them because of possibly having an allergy to them,” Ricketts says. “Some people understand what lupus is, but lots of other people will stare at you blankly because they don’t know about the condition or it is not of interest. But it definitely needs to be exposed a bit more.”Amaka Ejibe, 42, from south London, was diagnosed with lupus around her 18th birthday, experiencing symptoms including severe fatigue, red eyes and joint pains. At first, her symptoms were dismissed as stress due to her A-level exams.“I was blissfully unaware of the impact my diagnosis would have on my life,” Ejibe says. “I hadn’t heard of lupus … I would say that at a GP level back then, they were very naive to lupus as a [potential] diagnosis and as a condition which warranted intervention.”The symptoms, which were sudden in their onset, progressed to become more serious, resulting in severe anaemia, weight loss, gastric issues and eventually Ejibe’s kidney function deteriorating.“In my 20s, lupus didn’t really impact my life to the point that I needed to change anything. For example, I was working full-time. It was in my mid-30s when my condition started to really affect my day-to-day living and my lifestyle,” Ejibe says. She had periods where she was not able to work, has spent periods of several months in hospital, and was on dialysis for more than three years before having a kidney transplant in 2019.Since her transplant, Ejibe has been able to manage her symptoms better than previously. But she believes there is still a long way to go with treatment for lupus.“I think … it could be better,” Ejibe says. “Treatment-wise lupus is a very complex condition, and developing a treatment where you’re switching off part of an immune system is probably more complex than treating other situations. But I think it’s improving.”She says the lack of treatment options may be due to the fact that nine in 10 people with lupus are women, with women’s health issues often being dismissed due to“medical misogyny”.“I think with women’s issues, it can be dismissed because men don’t have the equivalent, so pain and fatigue can be dismissed as ‘the monthlies’, whereas there isn’t a comparison for men,” Ejibe says.Explore more on these topicsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A little over a decade ago he was working on the chicken station in a branch of McDonald’s. He then set up a burger delivery business in west London, which he and a cofounder would go on to sell for seven figures.A celebratory holiday in the Maldives and a period of research later, in 2019 they launched THIS™, the range of meat-alternative packaged foods, which boomed from zero to more than £20m of revenue, becoming the UK’sfastest-growing food brandin 2023.And now – another sharp pivot. Shovel admits that his move from burgers into the plant-based market was strategic rather than ideological, but in the process he became a true believer – and a committed vegan.Havingstepped backfrom the day-to-day running of THIS™ last year, the one-time burger flipper is now launching an animal welfare organisation that he hopes will do as much for animal rights as his previous venture did for non-meat bacon.It’s calledA Bit Weird. Why? As the organisation’s knowingly sillyjingleputs it, it’s “because some of the stuff we do to animals is a bit weird”.That includes killing 30m male chicks in gas chambers or macerators each year in Britain because they can’t lay eggs, something Shovel has set out to try to ban. The painful method by which male lambs are castrated to improve the flavour of their meat is next in his sights.He’s hoping to achieve this with a mixture of careful research – the stint at McDonald’s was a very strategic attempt to learn about the fast-food business – and fun.THIS may have forced its way into the nation’s freezer cabinets by leaning heavily on product innovation, but it also had an anarchic approach to marketing, such as when the company staged amock funeral procession for baconthrough the streets of central London.Shovel, 37, wants to do something similar for the welfare of animals. Hence the word “weird”, rather than shocking or appalling or indefensible. People have been “repelled” by vegan campaigning in the past, he argues, “because it’s all synonymous with judgment and sanctimony that people don’t enjoy”.For a start, he’s not trying to make you a vegan – at least not yet. “I’m not saying don’t eat animals. I’m not saying don’t eat dairy. It’s all good. A Bit Weird’s attitude is – crack on.”It is an approach that has won him some criticism from longer-established campaigners, he admits, but his plan is “to disarm people through humour and silliness and fun, so that they didn’t see us as another vegan brand lecturing them about their life choices”.Could a tiny organisation, just a month after launching, really hope to trigger large-scale change in the British egg industry? Shovel doesn’t see why not – and his prior experience in food retail at least gets him through doors.Chick cullinghas already been banned in Franceand Germany, and the technology exists to replace it, Shovel argues. Why not do the same in Britain? And why not try to make the campaign fun?He promises research-led engagement with the industry, lobbying of government, public awareness campaigns, legal challenges – and stunts.“I’ve had this itch for years … there’s almost a gap in the market with animal advocacy, if I’m going to be a businessperson about it, for someone to take quite serious messages and market them in a not serious way.“I have a general firm view which is that I don’t want my lunch to have felt fear or anguish or pain. And I think that’s an uncontroversial thing.”Explore more on these topicsAnimal welfareVeganismAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

After two cuts last year, financial markets are expecting three reductions during 2025, to leave the base rate at 4% by the end of the year.Bailey is no stranger to political pressure himself. Former prime minister Liz Trussthreatened to review the central bank’s remitin response to successive interest rate rises as inflation headed above 10%.Truss has subsequently said that she would have sacked Bailey, but his eight-year contract, and the “deep state”, made that impossible.This time, the governor is feeling the heat from a different direction, though not unconnected to the latest drama in Washington.Bailey and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee (MPC) are considering whether a slowdown in economic growth is going to persist – and whether they may be to blame.At the moment, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is taking all the flak for the slowdown as shefights to get business onsidewith her growth plan after a difficult first few months in office. But attention could switch to the central bank should interest rates in the UK, which are the highest in the G7 – made up of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US, UK and Canada – be kept on hold at 4.75%.There are Labour MPs who want to criticise Bailey but are reluctant to go public, fearing a rebuke from Rachel ReevesMost forecasts have shown the economy staggering this year – much as it did in 2024. Official figures released next month are expected to confirm that growth was virtually flat in the second half of last year.The UK should still outpace much of continental Europe in 2025, but as victories go, this could be considered of little value. To most Britons it will rank as another year of stagnation.Bank officials have worried for some time that persistently high wages in the private sector will push inflation up again. More recently, the weakness of the pound against the dollar has caused a headache.Sterling has fallen after financial markets considered how much the new president’s policies would push up inflation and prevent the Fed from making further reductions in rates. The reaction was one of panic after Trump’s return to the White House was cast as inflationary and previous forecasts of rate reductions in the US were reversed.The dollar strengthened and the pound fell on the prospect of higher interest rates than expected in the US. A lower pound makes imports more expensive, pushing up inflation.Some forecasters disagree with the consensus. The International Monetary Fund said in its most recent health check of the UK economy that wage growth was slowing quickly and other inflationary pressures would weaken this year, allowing the MPC to push through four rate cuts to 3.75%.What most economists agree is that interest rates are punishing the economy and are too high. Killing off the remnants of inflation, as some MPC members want to do, comes at too high a price. UK inflation was2.5% in December, easing from 2.6% in November but above the Bank’s 2% target.There are Labour MPs who want to criticise Bailey, but are reluctant to go public, fearing a rebuke from Reeves, who has promised to respect Bailey’s independence.This leaves Bailey and the MPC to reflect on the damage they will do, not to the Labour government, but the economic outlook, if they follow Powell’s hard line.The Fed has a strong economy to manage and keep in check. Meanwhile, the Bank is overseeing a weak UK economy in need of a stimulus.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesObserver business agendaBank of EnglandAndrew BaileyFederal ReserveEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Janeites rejoice (in suitably restrained and quietly sardonic fashion)! Brontë devotees – I suppose you had better go for a long walk across a large moor until it is one of your lot’s time to shine again.Until then, it is all things Austen. Expect genteel celebrations from Bath to Hampshire and screen and print schedules stuffed with tributes to, dramas inspired by and features about the great woman and her works for the next 12 glorious months. First off the televisual blocks is Miss Austen, an adaptation of Gill Hornby’s book of the same name, which tells the story of the just-beginning-to-be-famed Regency novelist through the eyes of the beloved sister who long survived her, Cassandra – played byKeeley Haweswith her customary controlled, unshowy magnificence.Cassandra, of course, was responsible for what some consider to be the greatest act of literary vandalism in history – and certainly one that causes every Janeite to double up in pain when they think of it. She destroyed almost all her vast collection of her sister’s correspondence to protect her and the family’s reputation and privacy. Of an estimated 3,000 letters, about 160 survive – mostly given to other family members as mementoes and therefore probably among the most anodyne examples from what would have been the treasure trove of treasure troves for future fans and scholars.In Miss Austen, we have Cassandra travelling to the home of family friends the Fowles, as the man of the house lies dying, to retrieve any letters between his late wife, Eliza, and Jane before they are found by anyone else, particularly the Austens’ vicious sister-in-law Mary (Jessica Hynes). Mary wants a biography to be written – albeit of her husband, James, with Jane as something of an addendum.The sisters’ lives unfold in a series of extended flashbacks as Cassandra (whose younger version is played by Synnøve Karlsen) reads through the letters she finds in Eliza’s bedroom. The women’s closeness is deftly evoked by a script that manages the astonishing feat of sounding effortlessly Janeish (witty not waspish, appraising not cold), with Patsy Ferran giving a perfect performance as the young author. I suspect that the inescapable charisma and energy (stopping just short of pertness), impeccable timing, light touch and shining intelligence she brings to the part will be greeted with cheers and no little relief.Back in the present, as it were (about 1830), Cassandra becomes embroiled in the fate of Eliza’s daughter Isabella (Rose Leslie), whose position as an unmarried woman is used to evoke many of the concerns that infused Austen’s work. Her father – a terrible bully, we are told – was the local vicar and on his death she is unceremoniously commanded to leave within a fortnight by the new incumbent (a mansplainer with an unctuous touch of Mr Collins thrown in, delightfully and delightedly played by Thomas Coombes). Isabella faces life as an impecunious and unwanted guest of one of her sisters, unless Cassandra can find an alternative – or the obstacles to a relationship between Isabella and the doctor who cared for her father (Alfred Enoch) can be removed.Everything about Miss Austen is masterly, from the individual performances to the interweaving of narrative strands past and present. And it manages to keep Jane as the presiding spirit without selling any of the other characters short. Mary is a masterpiece of natural malevolence further curdled by time and experience; Isabella is a finely drawn portrait of frustration; and Cassandra is a fully realised woman, shaped by grief and by love and sacrifice for her sister, and sharing the family fondness for oblique put-down.Bonnets, brittleness and any form of simpering are conspicuous by their absence, and the four-part series becomes ever more of a treat as it goes on – warm, intelligent, clear-eyed, confident and thought-provoking. How much is established fact and how much is the work of imagination, I am not equipped to know, but the beauty is that it all feels true; to the age, to the books and to what we know – or feel we know – about their author. We may never truly forgive Cassandra for her bonfire, but Miss Austen goes a long way to easing the pain.Miss Austen aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewKeeley HawesJane AustenPeriod drama (TV)reviewsShareReuse this content"

I blame my Smash Hits-influenced recollections of a more wholesome boyband than most – but still, I question what this documentary could possibly have to expose about them. The pain of performing shirtless, even though you’re still wearing a waistcoat and tie?Very quickly, any scepticism disappears. This three-parter is another addition to the increasingly popular “bad tabloids” genre of film-making, in which celebrities of the recent past reveal how much behind-the-scenes manipulation they had to deal with and the extent to which it ruined their lives. Like many showbiz-pages fixtures of the time, Boyzone’s members were put through the public ringer. Here, they tell all about their rise to success and their inevitable spectacular implosion, while discussing how the strings were being pulled – and who they think was pulling them.If you wondered why there wasn’t a lot of Boyzone in the recent BBC seriesBoybands Forever, maybe it is because they were saving it all up for this. It is gripping from start to finish. You know it is going to be juicy, because within moments, Ronan Keating has accused his and the band’s former manager Louis Walsh of saying “vicious, bitching” things about him to the press. Walsh, meanwhile, responds tartly: “They believed their own publicity. They forgot I wrote it.”View image in fullscreenRuthless … Louis Walsh, who put the band together.Photograph: Jonathan Hession/Sky UKSome relationships in the Boyzone camp have disintegrated, and been painstakingly rebuilt over the years; others were simply smashed to smithereens. Every member of the band gets to say how they remember it.Stephen Gately, who died of a heart condition aged 33, in 2009, speaks here in voiceover from archive interviews, while his sister Michelle rounds out his story with love and dignity.It starts in the early 1990s, with ambitious teenage boys in Dublin auditioning for an Irish boyband to rival Take That. Walsh put seven members together, then immediately – as in, the very next day – had them performing on TV on The Late Late Show, which was a huge deal in Ireland at the time. The clip frequently does the rounds online, as they dance goofily to a thumping backing track. Even after 30 years, it is clear that some of them still find it excruciating.Shortly after this hasty debut, Walsh cut the lineup to five, with all the ruthlessness of a Traitors opening episode twist. It left the remaining boys in a state of managed insecurity: even as their success became certain, it seems the competitiveness never quite abated, and the jostling for centre stage became a trigger-point in their relationships. At times, Keating seems almost as ruthless as Walsh. At others, he is self-aware and insightful about how certain events came to play out as they did.Ronan Keating | interviewRead moreIt wasn’t too long before Boyzone became one of the biggest boybands in the world. Walsh worked with the tabloids to keep them in the limelight, even if the stories were exaggerated or completely made up. Anyone who has seen a documentary like this will be able to hum along to its familiar tune, from the extensive world tours and complete exhaustion to the band member who makes a break for a solo career and the toxicity of tabloid intrusion.When he was 23, Gately came out as a gay man in the pages of the Sun – a massive deal, at that time, for a pop star who was adored and lusted after by millions of female fans. There is a sense that it was not his choice, and one of the most poignant, and telling, scenes in the whole documentary sees Keating, Walsh and Michelle Gately look at the front page splash that revealed the “news”. Even now, Keating is angry and upset about what happened, while Gately’s sister is clearly distressed. And Walsh? “I love it,” he says. “He got the front page.” The tabloids’ coverage of Gately’s death, meanwhile, just 15 years ago, was soaked in homophobic assumptions. It remains disgraceful today.Keating’s decision to go solo, in 1999, effectively ended the group for many years. The episodes follow their on-off relationship as a band, right through to their final split in 2019. If Mikey Graham was always “the quiet one”, this gives him a voice, as he justifies his decision to stay away from what he says had become a “toxic environment”. Their accounts of the last five shows as Boyzone sound bleak and joyless.This has a confessional feel to it, and there is a sense that some of those here are still working out their issues. Their troubles certainly make for compelling television, however, and offer a revealing peek behind the curtains of fame in the 1990s.Boyzone: No Matter What aired on Sky Documentaries and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionBoyzonePop and rockLouis WalshStephen GatelyreviewsShareReuse this content"

With over a billion monthly users and a For You Page (#FYP) brimming with relationship trends, it’s where people turn to for advice on everything from their sexuality to launching a relationship like it is a PR campaign.Welcome to the digital age, where TikTok doubles as Cupid … and sometimes, Dr Phil.Welcome to the femosphere, the latest dark, toxic corner of the internet… for womenRead moreLike anything else, TikTok isn’t inherently good or bad when it comes to relationship advice – it’s a digital stage where people navigate, explore and even contest relationships, intimacy and sexuality. However, it’s also a complex and often contradictory space where the boundary between authentic experiences and curated performance becomes blurred.My research on dating apps and intimacy, conducted in 2020, revealed how profoundly online spaces influence people navigating their romantic lives. Participants spoke about adopting trends like “soft launching” relationships (posting vague hints of a new partner) or “hard launching” them (a full-blown reveal) directly from platforms like Instagram and TikTok.What emerged was a startling realisation:people increasingly see relationships as stories in which they must be the protagonist. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as having “main character energy”, invites individuals to centre their romantic lives in a way that’s public, performative and shaped by the need for external validation. TikTok plays into this trend perfectly, offering bite-size content that encourages users to frame their love lives as compelling narratives for an audience.This can be empowering, offering people tools to navigate intimacy, reflect on their experiences, and connect with others. However, it can also become a trap.When we start comparing our unscripted, messy, and very real relationships to the highly edited, sensationalised versions we see online, the gap between expectation and reality widens.TikTok, the short-form video platform originally launched as “Douyin” in China before its global expansion in 2018, has seen mass controversy and bans in many countries, including, most recently, the US (albeit for a short period of time). It offers everything from silly skits and dance challenges to deep dives into news, as well as more niche genres like relationship advice.Trends like #DatingStoryTime and #BeigeFlags are just the tip of the iceberg, offering humour and insight that draw millions of viewers into the relationship narrative world.At its core, TikTok thrives on relatability and entertainment. Whether through cringe-worthy first-date stories or exaggerated red-flag analysis, TikTok presents relationships as a form of personal and cultural storytelling. The structure often mirrors what literary scholars call the “romantic master plot”: a white, Westernised narrative framework popularised by romcoms in which love is the ultimate goal, providing life’s meaning and shape.Humour plays a significant role in these narratives. What I call the “jolly absurdism” or “merry nihilism” of TikTok trends allows users to laugh at the quirks and failures of modern romance.Yet this humour masks deeper issues. It perpetuates unrealistic expectations and invites us to compare our love lives with highly curated and often fictionalised digital personas.A growing genre on TikTok involves relationship influencers who claim to provide the blueprint for love and intimacy. These influencers often present saccharine “couple goals” content.On the surface, this might seem harmless. But it’s anything but.Because TikTok is a social media platform rather than a polished TV show or movie, its content feels more authentic. Users assume they’re getting glimpses into “real lives”, not realising how scripted and curated much of the content is. This sets impossibly high standards for relationships, making people wonder, “What’s wrong with me?” or “Why doesn’t my relationship look like that?”Alongside the relationship influencers are the dating gurus – a new breed of influencers who’ve swapped self-help books for bite-size videos packed with sensationalist advice. Their content often leans heavily on clickbait tactics, promising viewers surefire ways to “make them obsessed with you” or “manipulate someone into falling in love”.It’s the kind of toxic game-playing we thought we’d ditched along with shoulder pads in the 1980s. But these so-called experts thrive on controversy, crafting advice that’s equal parts absurd and unhealthy. Whether it’s “playing hard to get” on steroids or emotional tactics dressed up as empowerment, their approach often feels like a giant step backward for modern dating dynamics.66 days to rediscover boredom: ‘The way I’d been thinking about time was wrong’Read moreAnd while TikTok can be a space to explore identity – its algorithm famously tailors content so well that many users joked it could predict their sexuality (you might remember the trendTikTok knew I was gay before I did)– it can also be dangerously reductive.TikTok’s dual nature is where its real complexity lies. On one hand, it provides an unprecedented space for people to negotiate and navigate cultural norms around love, intimacy and identity. It amplifies voices, showcases diversity, and offers humour and relatability that can help normalise experiences once considered taboo.On the other hand, TikTok’s structure – its reliance on sensationalist trends and viral content – means it’s also a powerful force in reinforcing norms and setting unrealistic expectations. People become hostages to these norms, comparing their love lives with the glossy, choreographed snippets they see online.The narratives that dominate TikTok, especially around romance, often adhere to traditional norms that fail to account for the diversity and complexity of modern relationships.Dr Lisa Portolan is an academic.

It does not take an intelligence operative to spot the number of spy thrillers that have infiltratedTV streamingservices, in what has been hailed as a golden age for the genre.This week,season two of The Night Agentclimbed to the top of Netflix’s chart, whilePrime Target, an espionage thriller starring Leo Woodall, became Apple TV’s most watched show. Other series such as Black Doves, The Diplomat (both Netflix), Slow Horses (Apple TV+), The Day of the Jackal (Sky Atlantic) and The Agency (Paramount Plus) have also been huge hits.Their popularity speaks to our times, experts say. In an age of fraying relations between nations, the rise of big tech (and disinformation), and increasing public distrust in governments and institutions, people are looking to TV shows to help make sense of an unstable world.“The world feels very uncertain to a lot of people right now, and if there’s one thing human beings really can’t stand, it’s uncertainty,” said Joe Barton, the writer and creator ofBlack Doves, a tale of a spies-for-hire organisation starring Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw.“What these shows do is let us in on secrets and peek behind the curtain. There is no Black Doves, MI5 isn’t like it is inSlow Horses, the CIA isn’t likeThe Agency. All of it is fictitious, but it gives the illusion that we might occasionally understand how the world works.”Robert Dover, a professor of intelligence and national security at the University of Hull, said audiences wanted to understand how the “deep state” might operate “because political and media narratives about it have ramped up since 2016”.For all their plot variations, the current slate of spy shows have one thing in common: they interrogate binary notions of good versus evil. Their protagonists are flawed and the shadowy threat they face often comes from within their own ranks.Barton said his inspiration for Knightley’s character, Helen, was derived from the spy cops scandal and “trying to imagine what kind of a person could build a whole family out of a lie”.But even when Helen and her partner Sam are killing people, he wanted viewers to love them. Though they are bad, they are not the baddies. “I wanted the audience to see elements of their own friendships in them,” said Barton.“I suppose they’re not really the good guys, but they’re better than some of the bad guys.”Dr Luca Trenta, an expert in intelligence and covert action at Swansea University, said the shows featured “some interesting dynamics as to who the main villains are”.After the second world war, and during the cold war and the US “war on terror”, the villains were often Nazis, Soviets or terrorists. But now many come from within the government.“‘Enemy within’ narratives often coincide with times of low-level trust in governments or their intelligence agencies,” Trenta said.In the 1970s, at the time of scandals such as Watergate, paranoid thrillers like Sydney Pollack’s Three Days of the Condor and Alan Pakula’s The Parallax View were popular.Now, he said, “once again deep state and anti-establishment rhetoric has been prominent in the news, from Trump’s rhetoric to the mistrust of experts surrounding Brexit”.Research last yearfound that a record 45% of people in the UK said they “almost never” trust governments to place the nation’s needs above their own interests. In the US,just 8% of the publicsaid they had a great deal of confidence in Congress.Prime Target, which follows a Cambridge mathematics student who becomes an enemy of the deep state, is a perfect reflection of this. “Part of the reason I wanted to do this job was my love of the Pakula films and those 70s thrillers,” the series director Brady Hood hassaid.Ronan Bennett, the creator and writer of The Day of the Jackal, an adaptation of the Frederick Forsyth novel about a ruthless freelance assassin, said he wanted the show to reflect “the things that concerned me about the modern world”.“For example, there was a true case of a young woman in Ireland recruited by the British state, used and then abandoned to her death by the state. That story was in my mind as I was writing the character of [MI6 agent] Bianca,” Bennett said.It’s a framing that’s seductive. In the final episode, when the Jackal (Eddie Redmayne) and Bianca (Lashana Lynch) finally come face to face, it is Redmayne’s character we subliminally root for.Another of Bennett’s adaptations was to make his target a tech entrepreneur whose software tracks rich people’s money – a strikingly contemporary theme. “One thing that people with lots of money don’t want others to know is what they’re doing with it and who they’re buying with it,” he said.Dr Joseph Oldham, the author ofParanoid Visions, emphasised that many of the new spy dramas are, or feel like, novel adaptations, with a strong narrative thread.In that sense they have less in common with turn-of-the-century procedurals such as Spooks and 24 than with the BBC’s 1970s and 80s John le Carré adaptations such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley’s People.“You could argue the current wave was partly ushered in by the revival of Le Carré on TV with The Night Manager [2016] and The Little Drummer Girl [2018],” he said. “Streaming services have hit upon the spy thriller as a must-have genre.”For Bennett, the reason behind the surge is simple: dramatists enjoy writing about treachery and betrayal, and audiences long for a search for truth. “When things are murky and unclear, there’s resonance,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDramaNetflixApple TV+TV streamingTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

So how do you create the Thatcher persona?Rachael HealySun 2 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareHarriet Walter has become the ­latest in a line of actors, from Meryl Streep and Gillian Anderson to Fenella Woolgar and Jennifer Saunders, to accept the challenge of becomingMargaret Thatcheron screen. How do you play a woman who, 45 years on from her ascension, exists almost as a national caricature?Walter plays the part inBrian and Maggie, Channel 4’s two-part drama tracing Thatcher’s relationship with Labour MP turned journalist Brian Walden, which culminated in a fraught TV interview in October 1989, as Thatcher’s fortune began to fail. The series, written bySherwoodcreator James Graham, directed by Stephen Frears and co-starring Steve Coogan, digs into the former prime minister’s private persona.View image in fullscreenMeryl Streep as Thatcher in Phyllida Lloyd’s 2011 film The Iron Lady.Photograph: Film4/Sportsphoto/AllstarThatcher’s public image, and the way it was satirised in shows likeSpitting Image, looms large over dramatic portrayals. Artists have often had fun with it, depicting her as a vampire in 2023’s black comedyEl Conde, played by Saunders as a theatrical grande dame in 2011’s Comic Strip episodeThe Hunt For Tony Blair, and becoming a drag queen inMargaret Thatcher Queen of Soho, created by Matt Tedford and Jon Brittain.In dramas, likeThe CrownandThe Iron Lady, the on-screen Thatchers hem closer to her public persona. AsZoe Williams noted of Anderson’s performanceinThe Crown: “Anderson plays Thatcher with such close attention to her mode of being that it’s like seeing the corpse of the baddie reanimated.” Here, and inThe Iron Lady, Thatcher’s ­infamous voice, shaped by ­elocution lessons in childhood and then ­deliberately ­deepened as leader of the ­opposition, is ­impersonated ­precisely, while her ­appearance leans on touchstones like the famously ­bouffant hairstyle.Walter’s portrayal has been praised by critics as more subtle. “Is Harriet Walter the best screen Thatcher yet?” askedtheTimes. It’s a “staggering Maggie” saidtheStandard, “Walter and Coogan go beyond impersonation to draw out deeper, emotional interpretations,” saidtheFT.View image in fullscreenThe real Margaret Thatcher in 1987 returning to No. 10 Downing Street after a meeting with visit with Queen Elizabeth II.Photograph: John Redman/AP“We’ve seen a lot of portrayals of Thatcher, and as years have gone by, the ­different portrayals started to become more caricature – the hair was getting bigger,” said Delyth Scudamore, executive producer onBrian and Maggie. “I wanted to get rid of that sense she was putting her lipstick on in the mirror before she could go and flirt with the men. Because that was nonsense. She was a powerhouse in a different way, so we wanted to reflect that in how she looked, to look more real.”Walterhas saidshe prepared for the role by watching ­videos of Thatcher, but also ­revisited ­previous portrayals. She went into the role “deciding that I’m not going to try and compete with those ­brilliant people. I’m going to just tell a ­different story about her that nobody else quite told. I wanted to try and get under her skin”.Her voice is recognisably Thatcher, but with so many scenes taking place in private, it isn’t a ­replica of the one heard in political ­broadcasts. Walter said she explored “a bit more wit, a bit more candour in the way she spoke”.Vanessa White, hair and makeup designer on the show, aimed for “realism”. She’d also studied other screen iterations but envisioned a different direction. This was partly practical – “Meryl Streep was a very different thing because she wore prosthetics,” White said, and had the edges of her wig touched out in ­visual effects – but mainly artistic.“We weren’t doing a sketch show, we were doing a serious drama,” White said. She knew many shots would be tight on Walter’s face, so the hair and makeup had to be meticulous. Wigs sometimes look too fake, she said, so Walter agreed to bleach her hair, to blend more seamlessly with the hairpiece.Walter’s brown eyes were ­transformed with blue lenses, and her olive complexion was altered with makeup inspired by contemporaneous images. White had done hair and makeup for the real Thatcher while working at the BBC in the 80s, so had insight into her favoured shades of lipstick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We pared it down so you just looked at the face and saw the emotion.” Once transformed: “She looked like a formidable woman and right for the period in time.”Brian and Maggieis set across 12 years. We first see Thatcher as leader of the opposition, then ­during the height of her powers as PM, and finally in 1989 when her ­authority is threatened. White and team, ­working closely with Gabriela Yiaxis in costume, decided to ­emphasise these three eras with subtle shifts in Thatcher’s look. At first, “We wanted her to look like a 1950s ­housewife, like someone who didn’t have any power.” Later, she becomes ­“glamorous … sophisticated”.There were three wigs: natural blonde, then dyed golden and brown. Her lipstick evolved from peaches to a bolder burgundy, and her eyes became greyer. Walter wore false teeth for her No 10 years too. “Her teeth did change in real life, she got them done when she became prime minister,” said Scudamore. “She was human, she did want to look good on camera.”While Walter is 74, the on-screen Thatcher ages from her early 50s to mid-60s. White used tape to change the shape of Walter’s face and neck, ageing her down for the earlier era. White said: “Most people wouldn’t notice what we’ve done, but Harriet knows and she could feel that change.”“There is a degree of separation,” Scudamore said. “You can tell it’s not Thatcher, James [Graham] had written this script looking for who the real Margaret was.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe ObserverDramaMargaret ThatcherHarriet WalterJames GrahamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No delivery lorries. Just pure, blissful silence. My ears could barely believe what they weren’t hearing when I opened the door, stepped into the garden and listened. It was autumn last year and I had just moved 600 miles north, from south-east England to Abernethy Forest in the Scottish Highlands. Occasionally, the wind shushed through the tree tops, like a slow wave breaking on the shore. Then it was quiet again. I lay in bed that night, letting my ears explore the faint thrum of silence, and for the first time in ages I didn’t reach for my earplugs.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In the ensuing months, my ears let go, by degrees, of a tension that I hadn’t been aware I was holding. I almost expected to look in the mirror and find them drooping, like those of a drowsy puppy. “Isn’t it a bit quiet for you there?” people asked – either mystified by our move, or concerned that we wouldn’t hack it. But I can’t get enough of it.A2006 study from the University of Paviaon music unexpectedly revealed how much the body and brain appreciate silence. The researchers were investigating how different types of music – from classical to techno, ragga to rap – affected markers of stress, including blood pressure, heart rate and breathing frequency. A two-minute silence was randomly inserted between the tracks as a control measure; but it turned out that listening to this silence elicited the lowest readings of all. “This relaxation effect was even greater than that seen at the end of five minutes of quiet rest [prior to the study beginning],” the authors wrote.Spending time in silence – through meditation, prayer or going solo in the wilderness – has been integral to spiritual and religious practices for millennia: a path to self-discipline, knowledge and self-actualisation and a way to get closer to the god or gods you choose to worship. “The fact that it arose as a central feature, across different continents and eras, speaks to its importance,” says Gordon Hempton, anacoustic ecologistand campaigner for thepreservation of quiet places.But in today’s noisy world, silence is often seen as an emptiness to be filled.When author Sarah Anderson was researching her recent book, The Lost Art of Silence: Reconnecting to the Power and Beauty of Quiet, she was surprised to discover that many people regard silence negatively. “They find it boring, uncomfortable or even confronting,” she says. Anderson herself relishes quiet, but admits that on a silent retreat she attended, she couldn’t help wondering whether there were things she could, or should, be doing with all that unfilled time; as if spending it in silence was wasteful.“Ever since the Industrial Revolution, noise has been synonymous with productivity and progress,” says Hempton. “In all the clamour, we have forgotten the value of quiet.”I did not move to the Highlands in search of silence. But having found it (or at least, more of it), I’ve realised the truth of Hempton’s assertion: “Silence is not the absence of something but the presence of everything.” Immersing myself in silence, I’ve found not less, but more. I am more aware of the soft sounds that are normally drowned out, of textures and colours, movement and patterns. It is as if my senses have been dialled up a notch.View image in fullscreen‘In silence I can unpack the contents of my mind’ … Sam Pyrah with her terrier Morris.Photograph: Sarah M Lee/The GuardianEmbracing the silence of the world around me has made me quieter, too. I talk less. I move more quietly. I ease the field gates shut, close the wheelie bin lid gently, whereas before I’d have thought nothing of banging and slamming around. Why would I, in a world already filled with noise?Lowering the decibel level outside my skull has also turned up the volume of the noise within. I can finally hear myself think. Or, as novelistPico Iyer wisely observed, hear myselfnotthink, giving rise to something deeper than thought.In silence, I can unpack the contents of my mind – thoughts, feelings, memories and opinions – and sort through them with greater clarity. I might notice an uneasiness about a decision I’ve made, or stumble upon a new insight, for example. I’ve become more contemplative, less quick to rush to conclusions. Hempton isn’t surprised. “In a quiet place, the mind falls quiet, because we tend to echo where we are,” he says.The notion of silence as a presence, rather than an absence, isn’t just airy-fairy. Our brains perceive it that way. A2023 study from Johns Hopkins Universityfound that the brain processes silence in the same way as it processes sounds – as an “event”. Silence is not just inferred from a lack of auditory input, but actuallyperceived. As Ian Phillips, professor of philosophy and brain science and co-author of the study, puts it: “We really do hear silence.”There is alsoevidence that attending to silencecan promote neurogenesis – the creation of new brain cells – in the hippocampus. Researchers placed mice in an anechoic chamber (a soundproof space) and exposed them to various auditory stimuli, including total silence, for two hours a day. All sound scenarios, ranging from a Mozart piano concerto to the cries of baby mice, stimulated the proliferation of precursor cells in the hippocampus. This is the first stage of neurogenesis. However, after a week, these new cells had become functioning neurons only in the mice that received the silent treatment. This was a surprise to the researchers, but they theorised that because complete silence is so rarely experienced in mouse world, it prompted a level of attention that “might stimulate neurogenesis as preparation for future cognitive challenges”.A completely silent environment would have been just as remarkable to our forebears. “It would have been a cause for concern, indicating the presence of a predator or an absence of biodiversity, meaning there’s nothing to eat,” says Hempton. That may explain why,in a 2013 studyfrom the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences that used virtual reality to investigate the effect of looking at natural landscapes on mental health, viewing forested landscapes without sound was found to be not relaxing, but unsettling.The term “soundscape” refers to the combination of sounds that are present in a particular environment, and how we perceive it. This includes natural sounds – those made by animals, plants and weather – and human ones, from conversation and music to vehicle and industry noise. “We can distinguish between different aspects of a soundscape – pleasantness, for example, as well as eventfulness [how much or little acoustic activity is present], predictability [is the noise expected?] and meaning, or importance,” says Joshua M Smyth, a professor of health psychology at Ohio State University. If you were listening to the dawn chorus, you might rate the soundscape as eventful, predictable and pleasant, while the house renovations going on next door might be rated as eventful but unpleasant. “Noise is never neutral,” says Smyth. “One’s perception of it is a major factor in how stress-inducing it is.”People have become afraid of silence; it’s why the TV is on constantly, not to mention the endless scroll of the screenThis was cleverly demonstrated by a 2016study from the University of Gävlethat exposed people to a single indistinct sound, telling some that it was the roar of a waterfall, and others that it was the noise of industrial machinery. The former found the sound more mentally restorative.Here in the Cairngorms, where the writerNan Shepherd “bent her ear to silence”, the pine forest muffles sound, while the surrounding hills act as a wind break. Among the trees, it can feel as if you’ve stepped into a landscape painting. But Hempton is right: it’snottruly silent. There are goldcrests peeping high up in the canopy, the trickle of a burn, snow flumping to the ground in winter.Natural soundscapes are beneficial to the human brain – in part, at least – because unlike construction-site noise, planes and the attention-grabbing notifications on our phones, they form part of our auditory heritage. “Our brains evolved over aeons hearing the sounds of nature and often, for long stretches, nothing else at all,” says Richard Cytowic, professor of neurology at George Washington University and author of Your Stone Age Brain: Coping with Digital Distraction and Sensory Overload.“Silence is an essential nutrient. It is necessary for us to think.”But with the world getting ever louder, it is increasingly hard to come by.View image in fullscreen‘In a quiet place the mind falls quiet … we echo where we are’.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesTheaverage level of noise in urban environmentshas risen by 0.5-1 decibels per year over the past three decades. As well as being a pain in the drum, chronic excessive noise has been directly linked tocardiovascular disease,anxiety and depression,hearing lossand, in schoolchildren, impairedcognitive development. One in five people in Europe are now exposed to levels of noise pollution deemed harmful to health, according toa 2020 report.It isn’t just humans who are suffering, says Hempton. “Noise pollution prevents birds from hearing predators and requires them to sing louder or at a higher pitch, which consumes more energy.” In a2013 study for the Royal Society, researchers erected rows of loudspeakers in a designated wilderness area and played transportation noise; bird abundance declined by a quarter.We do get used to the level and type of noise we experience. For example, people who live amid the cacophony ofNew Delhi show greater tolerance to noise– especially honking vehicles – than people living in London. When Anderson moved from one part of London to another, she discovered she was living beneath a flight path. “At first, it was a nightmare, but now I hardly notice it,” she says.But the reverse is also true. It took a trip to the capital – where I grew up, and spent more than half my life – for me to realise how much I had adapted to the quiet of my new home.One Sunday evening, I stepped on to the sleeper train at a dimly lit and almost deserted station. On Monday morning, I disembarked at London Euston and was immediately assaulted by an onslaught of noise. Loudspeaker announcements, the ringing and pinging of phones, shouty conversations, the roar of traffic, sirens blasting … Then the banshee screech and rattle of the tube and the straining engine and bleeping doors of the bus as it crashed across potholes on suburban streets. It felt like being pulled from the silence of the womb into the clamour of the world. Like everyone else, I clamped headphones over my ears. But I wasn’t listening to anything. I was just trying to escape the racket.For Hempton, headphones, ear defenders and earplugs are not the answer. “Our auditory sense is all about connection, to people and place, and these cut us off from the world,” he says.It is perfectly understandable to want to swap the din of city life for music or a podcast, but there is a risk that the non-stop soundtrack playing in our ears makes our experience of silence so rarefied that when wedochance upon it, we do everything we can to fill it immediately. “People have become afraid of silence,” says Cytowic. “It’s why the TV is on constantly, for ‘background’ noise – not to mention the endless scroll of the screen. Our brains never evolved to cope with this level of non-stop stimulation.”View image in fullscreen‘If we never step away from the hubub, we’ll never give ourselves the opportunity to listen to silence and find out what it holds’.Photograph: FG Trade/Getty ImagesWhat does he advise? “Switch off the TV. Go for a walk. Leave your phone at home. Look up at the trees, at the sky.”Smyth makes an effort to embed at least brief moments of “acoustic tranquillity” into his daily life. “It might be near-silence, or a sound that is soothing to me,” he says. “If I’m in a noise-filled context, I’ll take ‘sound snacks’, where I’ll leave that environment for a brief period, or create a new one.”My efforts to share my enthusiasm for silence with my husband have had mixed results. Inevitably, extolling the wonders of sitting in quiet contemplation of a morning seems like a criticism of him eating breakfast while scrolling through his phone – with the radio on. We had words when I was experimenting with the yogic practice ofmouna vratha, a daily period of silence (the words translate roughly as “vow” and “not speaking” – an hour a day is usually recommended), and he stood in my eyeline, miming questions, which, though not audible, still felt like interruptions. It was a reminder that silence, like noise, has different flavours. A stony silence, thick with resentment, isn’t calming the way a companionable one is, when you’re reading or walking or looking at the night sky together and no words are needed.I abandoned my formal practice of silence after a few days. There seems to be a shift towards selling silence as (yet another) tool for self-improvement,for increased productivityand creativity – a means to an end, rather than an experience in itself.Silent walkinghas even become a TikTok trend. I still seek out quiet, distraction-free time each day. But I prefer not to expect anything from these periods of silence and stillness, nor set a timer.As I write, the house is quiet. There is the soft whirr of the computer, the occasional sleep whimper from the dog, the sound of my own inhalations and exhalations. These are all sounds that would slip below the radar amid everyday noise. Would it matter if they did?Hempton argues that faint sounds are the most important for our wellbeing. “We evolved to have incredible auditory sensitivity,” he says. “Sound was the news feed, signalling what was present, the time of day, the time of year. It was our direct connection to the world around us.”With so many other sources of information, that may not be as vital as it once was. But if we never step away from the hubbub, we’ll never give ourselves the opportunity to listen to silence and find out what it holds.“To listen, you have to be quiet,” says Hempton. “What I enjoy most about listening is that I disappear.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingResearch publishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Think againJohn HarrisIn the shadow of a defunct Amazon warehouse in Staffordshire, I spoke to people who felt the appeal of a strongman leader who ‘does what he says’Sun 2 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 11.46 ESTShareThe first time I clapped eyes on Rugeley, in Staffordshire, my mind boggled. Right in front of me were vivid symbols of two successive eras, sitting beside each other like layers in rock.A disused coal-fired power station still dominated the skyline, but what now sat around its old cooling towers could not have been more different: branches of KFC, Burger King and Subway, a new-looking McDonald’s, a Premier Inn with an adjoining faux-traditional pub (named The Colliers, in limp tribute to the town’s history of coalmining), and a gargantuan construction that stretched into the distance. This was anAmazon fulfilment centre, opened in 2011 and said to be the size of nine football pitches. I spent a long afternoon outside its gates, watching people from the GMB union trying to recruit new members, while coaches full of workers came and went.In 2023, two years after the power stationhad been demolished, Amazon announced that itsRugeley operation was closing down, and I resolved to return there with my Guardian colleague John Domokos to make another episode of our video seriesAnywhere But Westminster. And on 20 January, we finally found a reason to go back.As strange as it may sound, Rugeley felt like a good place to feel the global shock waves from the inauguration of Donald Trump – dutifully attended, let’s not forget, bythe Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos– and to find out what people thought about his style of politics. Last summer, the result in the localconstituency of Cannock Chasesaw the first stirrings of a change that has since gripped national politics: Labour and the Tories finished on 36% and 29% of the vote respectively, while the Anglo-Trumpers of Reform UK took a very impressive 27%.As this shift has played out, there have been recent suggestions that any British appetite for Trump-style politics is bound to be limited. According to a recent poll by Ipsos, almost two-thirds of Britonshold a negative viewof the returning president. Other surveys have suggested that we now think our ties with Europe shouldtake priority over the US, and have thereby boosted a set of assumptions, old and new: the idea that Britons tend to find high-profile Americans brash and vulgar, an understanding that this president will surely shred any lingering delusions about the supposed special relationship – and, perhaps, an enduring belief in what George Orwell called “the gentleness of English civilisation”.In Rugeley, it did not feel like that. Our first stop was a bustling community centre, where a parent and toddler group was happening next to a weekly lunch for pensioners – and we got a sharp sense of how the quiet privations and disappointments of 21st-century English lives have opened people to the specious promises of hard-right populism.We had a long conversation with Emma and Cian, a couple who had come with their baby. “This is a very, very quiet town – it always has been,” she said. “Not a lot goes on around here … and nothing lasts long.” To most people, Cian told me, the arrival and eventual winding-down of the Amazon warehouse had barely registered. He didn’t know anyone who had worked there. “It’s just a big blue building at the end of the town that’ll be gone soon.”I wondered: when the government changed last year, did it make them feel any different about the future? “No,” said Emma, wearily. “We don’t expect anything out of what we’re told.”What if a Trump-type figure promised to make Britain great again? She laughed, and glanced at her partner. “We’ve got different opinions on that,” she said. “I kind of like what he’s doing. I wish more would be put into the UK. I think we need someone with a bit more of … anoomphabout them.”Nearby, we met Kenan, a Turkish-born Just Eat driver – forced into the world of endless delivery shifts, he said, when his IT business went bust during the pandemic. When I mentioned Trump, his face lit up. “He’s the man,” he said. “He’s the man.”“He’s reckless,” he told me, and he was not using that word as a pejorative. “He does what he says, not like other politicians. They say they’re going to do something with the economy, and they don’t do it. ButDonald Trumpdoes.” Did it feel strange to be bigging up someone so set against immigration? “As a foreigner,” he said, “I’ve seen people only using the system. And I’m working 12 or 13 hours a day.”As darkness fell, we sat in a car park, listening to the first Trump speech of inauguration day with one of the car windows down. A white transit van pulled up next to us: inside was a father and his three kids. He began telling us the details of his life before we even asked about them.“My dad was in world war two,” he said. “When he left the navy, he had three cement wagons, and he put the concrete in Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham.” His daily existence, by contrast, was a mess of financial hardship, the impossibility of combining childcare with work, a dire shortage of mental health provision and the impossibilities of the benefits system. Four days a week, he said, he hardly ate.He was now 50: he had voted only once in his life, and it was forReform UK. “Some of the things Trump says, some of the things Elon Musk says, some of the things Reform UK say – they sound good,” he said. “But it’s action you want in this country.”A week after I returned home, the Daily Telegraph published a piece by aBritish opinion pollsterwhose speciality is the qualitative stuff of focus groups. “Many British voters admire Trump’s approach – on policy but, more importantly, on what amounts to his sheer determination,” he wrote. Boris Johnson’sbrief spell as an ersatz Trumphadn’t dulled many of his participants’ appetites for a figure much more like the real thing, and there were a run of quotes to prove it: “I would like to see a British version of Trump”; “I could sit here and have a conversation with him and listen to him and believe him. Whereas our politicians, I don’t trust them one bit.”On the radio that morning, I had heard Rachel Reeves extolling the theoretical benefits of anew runway at London’s main airport, and the abstract wonders of higher growth figures. She sounded panicked: if this was our only bulwark against the illiberalism and nastiness now swirling around the world, it did not sound like it was going to hold. Not for the first time, I thought of Rugeley: its empty blue box, its atmosphere of sadness laced with an increasing sense of resentment, and a realisation that had hit me almost as soon as I got there, which was only confirmed by apoll published over the weekendpredicting scores of gains for Reform UK. Unless there is a deep change in how people feel about their lives and the future of the places where they live, a British iteration of Trumpism – maybe led by Nigel Farage, or perhaps in the form of someone or something that could supersede him and his party – may well rise to the top, much sooner than some people seem to think.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionEconomic growth (GDP)Reform UKLabourEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Why do they not know that authoritarianism is worse?Sun 2 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 10.07 ESTShareThe phrase “shocking findings” is hugely overused in the media, which is strange because it’s so clumsy. The word endings nearly rhyme, but not quite, and there’s something infantile about the word “finding” for something you’ve found. Is your lunch your eatings? Did you do any pooings this morning? Always go for a weeing before leaving the house – or building.Most “shocking findings” don’t turn out to be that shocking. The phrase gets deployed to dupe you into reading on and then it’s just some study that’s come out with something predictably depressing. Not this time. Last week, there were some genuinely shocking findings. I’d go so far as simply to call them shockings. Never mind that they were found – that’s not their key characteristic at all. They’re shockings, infuriatings and frankly frightenings.They were in a poll that forms part of a Channel 4 report called Gen Z: Trends, Truth and Trust. It must have been an act of colossal corporate self-loathing to commission that, because one of the things it’s bound to say is that gen Z, which is 13- to 27-year-olds, watches less TV than any bunch of youngsters since before the late queen’s coronation first got everyone into it. That’s bad news for all television broadcasters but it threatens to condemn a youth-skewed one such as Channel 4 to the fate of a youth-skewed retailer of tartan shopping trolleys.But the horrifyings weren’t about viewing habits: they were about politics. The polling company Craft said that 52% of gen Z-ers think “the UK would be a better placeif a strong leader was in charge who does not have to bother with parliament or elections”. I know what you’re thinking: it should be “if a strong leaderwerein charge”. And also: yes, that is more than half of them basically saying “screw democracy, it doesn’t work”. Another worrying: a third of them think the army should be in charge.I was properly shocked. I thought the intellectual argument in favour of democracy had been won. The majority of the global population doesn’t live in functioning democracies, but most regimes at leastclaimto be a bit democratic. Until last week, I found that contemptibly hypocritical: now I think it’s heartwarming. Those lying dictators are still, like I was, taking it as a given that everyone thinks democracy is the fairest system of government. You can withhold people’s right to self-determination, but you can’t persuade them not to want it. If it’s not a democracy, it’s at least got to pretend it is.Not for much longer, it seems. The coming generation can’t see the point of all those time-wasting elections and parliaments. They want neither the reality nor the pretence of being involved. In a sense, they’ve brilliantly proved their own argument against democracy. If they are so wrongheaded, maybe itisbetter not to consult them? In a way they’re making a very clever satirical point, except they’re obviously fucking morons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Did nobody tell them about Stalin?Having said that, it’s clear what they’re getting at. A brilliant, dedicated and compassionate person with absolute power, making sensible decisions in the long-term national interest – not being troubled by the grubbiness of political rivalry, the wilful misinterpretation of their beneficent policy by those who wish to grab power for themselves – would be a wonderful thing. Its only downside is that it’s impossible to achieve. No dictator or monarch in history has ever stuck to that approach for more than a week and most of them never tried it.But I can understand why the chaos and disappointment of contemporary politics might make a naive person yearn for a clear-eyed nutter knocking people’s heads together. Just last week, Rachel Reeves, supposedly part of a grownup, responsible and progressive government,backed a third runway for Heathrow airport in the name of economic growth. That’s the number one priority now and the government wants everyone to know it. I’m not against economic growth but it’s definitely not the most important issue. Averting climate catastrophe should take precedence. I mean, shouldn’t it? Or is that just woke? I thoughtLA had basically burned down. Is this really the time for us to make a massive airport massiver?Am I missing something? Is this not the overt prioritising of a government’s short-term political survival over the biggest crisis humanity is facing? With any broader perspective at all, opening a new runway at Heathrow is stupid. And I think our current government are, in political terms, the good guys. Yet here they are doing wrong because of the exigencies of staying in power under the current democratic system. The working of democracy and the electoral cycle routinely condemn us to this kind of poor decision. In many ways, it is pretty repellent.Nevertheless, the problems with dictatorship are far more savage. Why do 52% of young people not realise that? Screw falling literacy rates, this is the most horrendous betrayal our education system has ever perpetrated. What happened? Did nobody tell them about Stalin? Have they not heard about Kim Jong-un?Or perhaps it’s the opposite! Is this where fatuous positivity has got us? Has someone tried to feed young people the bullshit that democracy isn’t flawed, and they’ve noticed that it is, and think that means it’s failed? Politics in a free country is dirty, complicated, and often driven by fear, vanity and corruption. Democracy is, as Winston Churchill said, the worst system except for all the other ones. Did no one explain that to them? Or are their phone-addled attention spans so short that they couldn’t stay focused for the second half of the phrase?Let’s make it shorter for them: nobody’s perfect. Which means: we don’t give anyone total power. Everyone makes mistakes, takes cowardly self-serving decisions now and again, worries about some people more than others. Democracy or not, that’s true of all governments. The advantage that democracy gives us, and it is sumptuous compensation for the problems it causes, is the power to sack them.Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionRachel ReevesLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet somehow many very clever people convinced themselves that, because of the sheer economic irrationality of the idea, the US president would not go through with it.Financial markets must now reckon with this new, erratic reality – with potentially grim knock-on effects for the UK, and Labour’s tax and spending plans.There is still scope for the sledgehammer of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be mitigated in the coming days; but as it stands, the free trade area that stretched across North America since Nafta came into force in 1994 is no more.Whatever economic theory tells us about the benefits of free trade for growth and prosperity, voters in the world’s economic superpower felt sufficiently disillusioned with the status quo to risk smashing it up.Trump tariffs: markets brace for falls as Mexico and Canada hit backRead moreChina, which faces an extra 10% on top of existing tariffs, had already been engaged in a simmering trade war with America. But the Canadian and Mexican economies are closely knitted into the US after decades of frictionless trade.As the Peterson Institute for International Economics saidin a recent paper, Mexican exports are worth 40% of the country’s GDP, and about 80% of those go to the US.Parts can travel back and forth across the border several times in the course of manufacturing a final product. “The imposition of tariffs at each stage of fabrication would be disastrous,” the PIIE said.It predicted weaker growth and higher inflation across all three countries as a result of the policy – with the proportional impact far worse for Mexico.For the moment, UK policymakers are watching anxiously from the sidelines, as are their counterparts in the EU. But that may not last for long.In Davos last month, where there was a dizzy vibe of optimism about Trump 2.0, the trade secretary,Jonathan Reynolds, repeatedly stressed that he did not see the UK as first in the new president’s line of fire.“The intellectual basis for the kind of advocacy of tariffs comes from arguments on the US side about large US deficits in manufactured goods, which obviously the US has with China and with the EU. We don’t have that between the US and the UK,” he told reporters.He is right that, so far at least, the UK does not appear to be directly in Trump’s sights: the president has not expressed the same sense of grievance against the UK as he has against the EU, for example, which has “treated us so terribly”.But even if the UK can avoid being slapped with tariffs directly, the fact that we are a very open economy makes us vulnerable to a significant slowdown in international trade flows – a point Reynolds also made.The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessed the risks to the UK of rising global geopolitical tensions in its fiscal risks report in 2022.It suggested an all-out global trade war would depress UK GDP by 5%, though the damage would build up gradually, over more than a decade.And Trump may yet levy tariffs across the board. He suggested repeatedly throughout his campaign – and again in the speech that was beamed into Davos – that he planned to tax all imports to the US.“If you don’t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply, you will have to pay a tariff – differing amounts, but a tariff,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A weaker pound would then feed into higher import prices, and a resurgence of inflation.While the effects of shifts in global trade patterns can play out over months and even years, as firms and consumers readjust to a new reality, the sharper and more immediate impact for the UK is likely to be felt in government borrowing costs.There must be a high risk that after the weekend’s drama, with Canada and Mexico hitting back hard against Trump’s tariffs, the markets once again reassess the prospects for US inflation.If that is their verdict, US bond yields would rise – and as the lurching bond selloff in the early days of 2025 showed, where US Treasuries go, gilts (UK government bonds) tend to follow.That would push up the cost of borrowing forRachel Reeves, once again jeopardising the slim margin of error she left herself in the budget, to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules.If there is indeed a rewed gilts selloff as a result of Trump’s shenanigans, it would be much harder for rightwing commentators to portray it as a devastating personal verdict on the chancellor (though they will certainly try).But the impact on the OBR’s spreadsheets would be just the same, with a jump in yields potentially putting Reeves on course to bust her fiscal rules.If she responds with spending cuts, as the Treasury has hinted heavily, Labour’s governing project of fixing public services and delivering the “change” voters demanded, would look even more fragile than it does already.With Trump already considering his next targets for tariffs, a nerve-shredding few weeks lie ahead on both sides of the Atlantic.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomics viewpointEconomic growth (GDP)Economic policyRachel ReevesJonathan ReynoldsTrade policyTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Why do arms keep flowing in Israel’s direction?Sun 2 Feb 2025 07.26 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 08.04 ESTShareIhad never imagined, when working as a professor of transplant surgery at a large teaching hospital in London, that one day I would find myself operating on an eight-year-old child who was bleeding to death, only to be told by the scrub nurse that there were no more gauze swabs available. But I found myself in that situation last August while operating atNasser hospital in Gazaas a volunteer withMedical Aid for Palestinians(Map). Reduced to scooping out the blood with my hands, I felt an overwhelming wave of nausea – I was anxious that the child would not survive. Luckily she did, although many others did not.Having retired from the NHS, I decided to go toGazabecause it had become clear that there was a desperate need for surgical help, and I had the skills to contribute. Life as a transplant surgeon in London had been tough but hugely rewarding, and as a senior member of the transplant community I had enjoyed a certain status. This was going to be a different experience – but nothing prepared me for what I found when I arrived.From the moment we crossed into the territory and Sven, a large Swedish man in an incongruous flowery shirt leading the convoy of armoured UN Land Cruisers, exhorted us to “try not to get killed”, life became a bizarre, disorienting experience of extremes. Indeed, the same vehicles werefired on by the Israeli armya fortnight after we arrived. Gaza is the most dangerous place to work in the world, with more than300 aid workersand1,000 healthcare workerskilled since the start of the war.The journey across southern Gaza to our base evoked grainy photographs of Hiroshima. All buildings, for many miles around, had been literally flattened into the dusty landscape, and barring a few armed looters, people were conspicuously absent. Arriving at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, we found unimaginable, medieval chaos.Wards were overflowing, with beds rammed against each other in rooms and corridors, and spilling on to the open balconies, many surrounded by filthy mattresses on the floor where relatives slept in order to help the nurses care for the sick. Hygiene was nonexistent. Soap, shampoo and cleansing gel were oftennot allowed into Gaza, and medical supplies, which are also subject to import restrictions, were limited. On several occasions I inspected wound infections and found crawling maggots, and my Map colleague in intensive care had to remove maggots from a child’s throat when he found them clogging their ventilator. At various points we ran out of sterile gloves, gowns and drapes.The hospital regularly shuddered from nearby bombs. Like most other hospitals, it had already been attacked, in February last year, with many staff and patients killed. Every day we received one or two mass casualty incidents that transformed the emergency department into a Dantean maelstrom of dead bodies, blood, tissue and screaming children, many of them missing limbs. Usually this would mean 10 to 15 dead, and 20 to 40 seriously injured.We could receive casualties at any time, day or night, and sometimes operated continuously for more than 24 hours. There was a constant concern that the regular bombing close to the hospital would one day target us, and sleep was difficult. The exhausted local staff humbled us with their dedication and hard work since, apart from the conditions in the hospital, they also had to contend with living in “tents”, which are often pieces of carpet tacked on to wooden posts, with no water or sanitation. I also never saw any evidence of Hamas, either inside or outside the hospital, where we had no restrictions on movement.Looking back, it is the images of injured children that will never leave me. One evening, I operated on seven-year-old Amer, who had been shot by one of the drones that descend immediately after a bombing to pick off those who are running away, all civilians. He had sustained injuries to his liver, spleen and bowel, and had part of his stomach protruding through his chest. I was so glad to see him survive. But we saw patients like him every day, and most were not so lucky.Most of the cases we treated were women and children, and particularly disturbing were the children with a single injury, a bullet to the head, which was clearly the result of deliberate sniper fire. Indeed,30 UK doctors and nurseswho had worked in Gaza last year wrote to Keir Starmer in August stating that they had regularly seen evidence of the deliberate targeting of children (as did 99 US health workers whowrote a similar letterto President Joe Biden in October). The Palestinians feel that they are undergoing a genocide, andUN human rights experts, Amnesty International and many other organisations have concluded that Israel’s actions may plausibly amount to genocide. It is difficult to argue with them.I have worked in a number of conflict zones but have never seen so much civilian death and destruction. This was undoubtedly qualitatively different from any other war, currently or in the last two decades.Even ifthe ceasefireholds, which looks increasingly doubtful given Donald Trump’s recent actions, it will take years to reconstruct Gaza, both physically and as a society. My profound hope is that young Amer, and others like him, are given the opportunity of a decent, humane future.‘I had to evacuate five times’: a year in the life of a Gaza doctor battling to help victimsRead moreWhen our convoy rolled back out last September, I was left with an overwhelming sense of guilt that I could go back to an easy life while millions of others went to bed hungry, wondering if they would be blown to pieces overnight. This has been replaced by a deep sense of shame and embarrassment that the UK government, aLabourgovernment that I campaigned for, has refused to actively condemn Israel for the war crimes it has committed and continues to supply it with arms.Political power may require compromise and behind-the-scenes trade-offs, but there are some moral red lines that should never be crossed, whatever the political cost. In my view, the genocide in Gaza is the quintessential test of the moral courage of leaders in the 21st century – and so far, ours have failed. The bombing may have stopped for now, but the necessity to hold those who have committed crimes to account is no less urgent.Nizam Mamode is a humanitarian surgeon and retired professor of transplant surgery.

But still we hear nothing about the most obvious solution…Sun 2 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareIn 1935, Sinclair Lewis wrote a satirical book,It Can’t Happen Here, about a lying demagogue, Buzz Windrip, who rises to power and transforms the American scene for the worse within months.There were fears of parallels with the plot of the book when Trump first became president. This time, the fears are far more serious, as Trump’sbarrage of executive orderschallenges the constitutional checks and balances designed by the founding fathers to inhibit the autocratic desires of a future wrong’un becoming president.Well, within days, the implications have become apparent. Trump meant what he said about disrupting both the US and “abroad”. I don’t know about you, dear reader, but when I heard the 47th president claim to have been sent by the almighty to restore law and order, I laughed heartily and repaired to the pub.Now, the UK is an important part of the rest of the world, but when I hear members of our government, and their US ambassadorial candidate Peter Mandelson,kowtowing to Trump, I start counting the spoons. There is a difference between diplomacy and kowtowing. During the cold war, British governments did not like having to deal with the Soviet Union’s leaders, but they conducted themselves diplomatically; they never kowtowed.The unfortunate thing is that our government is unlikely to get anywhere with Trump. Trump’s idea of a deal is akin to that of a card sharp’s. Our future continues to lie in, and with,Europe. And so does any hope of a serious growth strategy.Which brings me to my (almost) friend the chancellor of the exchequer. I may have missed something, but I thinkRachel Reeves managed to give an hour-long speechon economic growth last week without referring to Europe. There was a time when chancellorial speeches were confined largely to fiscal and monetary policy – that is, “tax and spend” and interest rates (which latter are even now not entirely the concern of the Bank of England, because the inflation target is still set by the chancellor). Last week, all the attention was on long-term infrastructure projects, many of which are worthy, but which are unlikely to do much for the animal spirits of the entrepreneurs I meet. These are very concerned about the here and now, and the threat of recession.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brexit has made the country poorerI know you are waiting for this, but the potential – and, I trust, prospective – spur to a revival of economic growth lies with re-establishing our former links with our obvious trading partner, namely continental Europe. Peace overtures on this front were made a few weeks ago by the European Commission, and at first dismissed. However, warmer words have emerged from Downing Street recently. And on a separate occasion from last week’s “growth” speech, the chancellor evenacknowledged the damage that had been wreaked by Brexit.Labour needs to get its European act together. Time is running out. When they won the election amid a fund of goodwill, ministers were claiming that they needed two terms to “fix the foundations”. However, recent opinion polls are terrifying them, and with the appalling Reform party capitalising on the electorate’s frustrations, a second term forLabourcan no longer be assumed.Moreover, it (almost) goes without saying that neither the Conservatives nor Reform would even dream of re-entering the EU in any form. We are told that Labour’s pusillanimity over Europe is due to fear of Reform claiming that the public would regard this as a “betrayal” ofBrexit. Hang on a minute! The word “betrayal” is more pertinent to the gang of Brexiters who campaigned on a false prospectus. Far from regaining sovereignty, we have lost it. Brexit has made the country poorer. It is time for Labour to cease being scared of Nigel Farage and his gang and attack them for what they are: snake-oil salesmen!By the way: on a lighter note, I cannot surely have been the only listener to one of the radio interviews with the chancellor last week to have been surprised that thedistant prospect of a third runway at Heathrowairport seemed to be regarded as a key aspect of economic policy. It is a safe bet that a character in some new play in 2040 will ask: have they built the third runway yet?Finally, can’tKeir Starmerand Reeves desist from offending their natural supporters? After theirsoi-disant“tough decisions” with cuts to the winter fuel allowance, and the refusal to relax the two-child limit on benefits, we now find that the prime minister is invoking the spirit of Margaret Thatcher with a “bonfire of red tape”. Perhaps he could start with all the Brexit red tape?Explore more on these topicsEconomicsWilliam Keegan's in my viewBrexitDonald TrumpEuropean UnionForeign policyRachel ReevesKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

It’s not just for the hot drinksEmma BeddingtonStarbucks wants people to stop hanging out in its US branches without buying anything. But sometimes we all need somewhere to sit that isn’t homeSun 2 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 16.33 ESTShareThere has been a kerfuffle about cafes recently. In the US, Starbucks’ new “Coffeehouse Code of Conduct” is making peoplebuy something or leave, reversing its previous laid-back attitude. Meanwhile, in Paris, cultural barricades are being raised between trad cafes and the kind that sell €5 almond milk cortados. The New York Times last month set out the “zinc bar v barista” philosophical divide between classic community hubs and hipster roasteries in the city, while aParisienne on TikTokhas posted a video pointing out three new-gen coffee shops within 50 metres of each other in the Marais, explaining that French people “take our time to have a coffee … we sit on a terrace”, but now “les Américains” are demanding takeaway americanos.This is about what cafes arefor– and the answer has always been more than coffee.Seventeenth-century coffee housesoffered a democratic meeting space (well, unless you were a woman). Revolution brewed in US and French ones in the 18th century. They were also, historically, a refuge. In one of her memoirs, Simone de Beauvoir described spending whole days in the Café de Flore through the freezing winter of 1942-43, arriving early to get the hottest spot, next to the stovepipe. “We always had a shock of pleasure, emerging from the cold darkness, coming into this warm, bright den,” she wrote. She and others who did the same became a “family” of regulars. “We felt at home, safe.”That gets to the heart of what good cafes are: third places, the term coined by the sociologist Ray Oldenburg to designate spaces that are neither home nor work. Third spaces are also, Oldenburg explained, accessible and inclusive; allow visitors to keep a low profile, but welcome regulars; and provide room for conversation and playfulness.I cherish a third place. At various points in my life, department stores, museums, libraries and stations have been vital third places. Perhaps they didn’t all fit the “playful” criterion, but they met a need. Cafes, too. Viscerally unhappy inParis, I eked out endless small black coffees, benignly ignored, reassuringly surrounded by others doing the same.There has been protest, rightly, at the loss ofthese kinds of spaces, killed by Covid, spluttering economies and the web. “The internet has become our third space,” wrotethe Atlantic’s Ellen Cushinglast month in an elegy for the lost convenience of the Starbucks toilet. But the internet can’t be everything a third place is: safety when home is not a haven; a breath of air for anyone who just needs to be elsewhere.There is precious value to neutral, welcoming spaces, but not on the balance sheet. I suppose it’s unrealistic to expect the free market to provide.Francehas lost 160,000 cafes since the 1960s and now Starbucks is saying “Pay up or get out” (although maybe collective shaming for this mean-spiritedness will eventually affect its bottom line).There is an amazing third place near me, although it’s not (just) a cafe. York Community Stadium Complex opened in 2020, but I discovered it with my own shock of pleasure when I joined the gym last year. There is a pool, a sports hall and a climbing wall, plus a library, a cafe anda drop-in support centrefor people with cancer. Mostly, though, it’s a space to hang out unbothered, used by people of all ages. It feels miraculous, like something from a more optimistic era in which people in power said this stuff mattered and did something about it. It’s welcoming, accessible, inclusive and, yes, even playful.OK, it cost more than £44m. But what about the savings generated by having healthier, happier communities? The negative impact of social isolation is well documented: theWorld Health Organization has declaredloneliness a “global public health concern”. Anyway, third places don’t need to be so elaborate. Our high streets are empty, another casualty of the internet:37 shops a dayclosed in the UK in 2024. Couldn’t at least some of those spaces become – say, with rates exemptions and public subsidies – a new wave of third places – community hubs, repair cafes,libraries of thingsand low-key places for groups to meet? It would be nice to chat about it somewhere – maybe over coffee, maybe not.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not only have Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves run into severe turbulence over Heathrow, the flight deck deliberately steered the Labour plane into storm clouds. That’s an interesting choice for a government that was already buffeted byserious unpopularityand it’s a choice that a lot of their own party are struggling to explain to themselves. Anger about the chancellor’snew commitmentto back the expansion of the London airport and others is mingled with bewilderment. A lot of Labour people are scratching their heads trying to work out why she wants to burn political capital on a hugely contentious project that couldn’t possibly be complete until long after she’s done at the Treasury and Sir Keir is gone from Number 10.It was her choice and his. She didn’t have to make airport expansion the centrepiece of her keynote speech about growth. The prime minister, if his title means anything, could have stopped his chancellor had he wanted to. One consequence of the fury about the subject is that it diverts attention fromher more welcome thoughtsabout how to boost Britain’s growth-starved economy.No one is talking much about building new reservoirs or other features of her growth plan because airport expansion has blotted out everything else. Hostile fire was instant, will be continuous for years ahead and comes from several camps with which Labour has wanted to be friendly. For theincandescent environmentalists, Heathrow is a litmus test of whether or not the government is authentically committed to addressing the climate crisis. Backing expansion is a total fail. They kind of wanted to believe Ms Reeves back in the day when she told the Labour conference that she would be as proud to be “Britain’s first green chancellor” as she would to be its first female one. I would advise her against repeating that line, and especially not in front of green audiences, unless she enjoys being scorned.Crystal balls are darkening with a dystopian vista of years of protest and resistance to Heathrow expansion in inquiry roomsAnother group expressing disappointment are those who wanted to trust the chancellor and prime minister when they sought to contrast themselves with previous governments by saying they wouldn’t be fixated on the south-east of England and would instead seek to spread opportunity and prosperity across the country. Ms Reeves did touch on regeneration in the north and the Midlands, but her greatest emphasis was on Heathrow and reviving the push to create an Oxford-Cambridge “growth corridor”. That left the impression that she is shovelling the bulk of her chips on big-ticket projects in southern England. Labour mayors in the north are disappointed that, while she gave a nod to the desperate need to create new rail connections and upgrade existing ones between northern cities, there were no promises of cash that they could take to the bank. She declares she’s backing a majorredevelopment of Manchester United’s Old Traffordstadium and the surrounding area, but again declines to say exactly how.To these unhappy groups, we can add a third. These are the Labour MPs and ministers whose crystal balls are darkening with a dystopian vista of years of protest and resistance to Heathrow expansion in inquiry rooms, the law courts and parliament, and from antagonistic Londoners and environmental activists. The airport’s owners first started pushing for itmore than 20 years ago, but it has repeatedly stalled before takeoff over the many years since. Under successive governments going back to that of Tony Blair, it has been floated, approved, then unapproved, mooted again, approved again and then cancelled again.There’s good reason why hot flushes of enthusiasm have been followed by cold feet. On top of the additional levels of noise and air pollution that it would inflict on a very densely populated part of the country, there’s the non-trivial matter of demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting several waterways and rerouting a long stretch of the M25, Britain’s busiest motorway, anddropping it into a tunnel. “This has many years of difficult politics ahead of it,” groans one Labour strategist, pointing to the London mayoral elections in 2028 as one cause for concern.The government can pray in aid a few supportive voices, but that side of the ledger looks thin. Some business groups welcomed the announcement, before quickly returning to their gripes about the higher taxes that the chancellor is levying on them. A cluster of go-for-growth Labour MPs are rallying to her, but you can also find a lot who are either belligerent towards the idea or befuddled by it. With a massive majority, Sir Keir and Ms Reeves can likely bulldoze it through parliament if they are determined enough, but the effort will cause a lot of trouble and strife in their party.Is the chancellor discombobulated by the anger and consternation that she has generated? Her people give the impression that she no more cares about being unloved than the typical supporter of Millwall football club. The drama around the Heathrow announcement was no accident, they say. It was deliberately designed to “shift the dial” with international investors by persuading them that Ms Reeves has the grit to prioritise growth over any other consideration. One of her allies puts it this way: “Rachel’s brand as a chancellor is that she doesn’t duck the tough stuff and this is another decision which strengthens the brand.” She is treating opposition as a compliment to her steely determination to implement her new doctrine of growth-at-any-cost.Where is the cabinet in all this? Allies of the chancellor claim that “we thought we’d have a bit more of a cabinet problem than we’ve actually had”. Half of the cabinet – including Darren Jones, the number two at the Treasury, andSir Keirhimself – voted against a third runway the last time the idea was put to parliament. Another opponent then is still a dissenter now. I’m talking about Ed Miliband, the government’s most committed advocate of net zero, who took his opposition to the chancellor to the cabinet table. He’s telling his friends two things. One that he’s cross; the other that he has no intention of resigning. If he vacated his seat at the top table, Sir Keir would probably fill it with someone less committed to addressing the climate crisis, depriving the cause of a champion at the heart of government and strengthening the hand of the Treasury. And then there’s this. I suspect that the Net Zero Secretary thinks that resignation would be a pointless gesture of opposition to something that may well not happen and certainly not anytime soon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can already hear the lip-smacking among lawyers who will get rich on the legal wrangling that will accompany a marathon inquiry. The chief executive of Heathrow, Thomas Woldbye, has already conceded that getting the green light for a third runway by the end of this parliament will be “ambitious”. It is not at all clear how the government can reconcile expansion with its legally binding net zero targets.Many think it simply can’t. Some research suggests that airport expansions willeffectively nix all the carbon savingsfrom the government’s clean power programme. Ms Reeves talks breezily about flying becoming “cleaner and greener” thanks to advances in “sustainable aviation fuels”. People with more expertise in the subject point out that sustainable fuel is far pricier than traditional jet juice and only available in minuscule quantities at the moment. There are fierce arguments about whether Heathrow expansion would make a meaningful contribution to growth anyway and wildly varying estimates about how much it would cost. Heathrow’s previous plans werepriced at about £14bnwhen an estimate was produced in 2014. At least double that number, probably triple it. If investors can be found to stump up that kind of cash, they will want a return. This will meanhigher landing charges, which will most likely be passed on to customers in increased ticket prices. The chancellor asserts, but can’t possibly be confident, thatplanes will be landingon a third runway by 2035. That sounds worryingly similar to thevainglorious delivery timetableonce claimed during the sorry saga called HS2.Turning the Oxford-Cambridge arc into “Europe’s Silicon Valley” is aiming high and has its own controversies, but at least that is an ambition with plausible claims to be good for growth. Betting on Heathrow expansion looks like an excursion into political Death Valley.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayOpinionLondonTravel and transportRachel ReevesKeir StarmerEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

Mr Trump’s proposal takes its name from Israel’s air defence system, but it is cast in more ambitious terms for the US: a space-based interception system designed to counter nuclear, hypersonic and cruise missile threats.It is also the latest turn of the wheel in a cycle of escalation. Moves by Washington to “increase security” have repeatedly ended up making the world more volatile and unsafe. The historic chance to eliminate nuclear weapons in1986slipped away over Ronald Reagan’s insistence on America’s unproven “Star Wars” missile defence system. In 2002, George W Bush – citing the threat from North Korea – ditched the anti-ballistic missile treaty, which was built on the idea that mutual vulnerability cools the nuclear arms race while unchecked defences fuel it. In The New Nuclear Age, Ankit Panda points out that Russia and China responded with countermeasures to ensure “their nuclear forces would have the ability to penetrate a sophisticated US system”.The upshot of such policies has been that Russia and China can deliver devastating nuclear attacks against which the US has no real hope of defence, while North Korea has intercontinental ballistic missiles that can hit the US mainland. Proverbially, insanity is repeating the same action and expecting a different outcome. Yet Mr Trump is launching Star Wars II. Given the technological hurdles and prohibitive costs involved, the odds are that itsvisionwill never be realised. The rhetorical effect, however, is likely to be to scare other countries into building more nukes.Mr Trump’s executive order also represents a shift in US policy. Rather than missile defence centring on “rogue states” such as North Korea and Iran, it is being refocused on Russia and China. Its logic is that a new system would be such a strong deterrent that it would reduce the temptation for enemies to attack in the first place. Whether it does misses the point that it risks triggering an uncontrolledarms race.InJanuary2022, a month before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the five recognised nuclear powers reaffirmed the “taboo” that using nuclear weapons is morally unacceptable. But their continued strategic value shows that nukes have not been truly stigmatised – because if they were, no one would be discussing them as useful military tools. Indeed, the dangerous rhetoric from MrTrump, Russia’s VladimirPutinand even India’s NarendraModisuggests a worrying normalisation of a nuclear exchange.This is particularly concerning when detente, eventually pursued by the US and the Soviet Union in the cold war, “appears elusive in this new three‑player great power nuclear contest” between Washington, Moscow and Beijing, as Mr Panda writes. The use of just a fraction of the trio’s nuclear arsenals would lead to mass destruction on an unprecedented scale. Unless there is a major shift, the last remaining US-Russia arms control treaty,New Start, which limits strategic nuclear warheads and restricts missile launcher numbers, will expire in 2026. US, Chinese and Russian officials must sit down together and rebuild nuclear stability. The world’s survival rests on them reviving an adversarial cooperation. True security comes fromarms controland reductions and creative nuclear diplomacy, not trying to build an impenetrable shield.Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionForeign policyDonald TrumpNorth KoreaRussiaChinaeditorialsShareReuse this content"

More than 50 years later, it is still relevantSun 2 Feb 2025 12.25 ESTShareIn 1987, just under half the population – 48% –still believedthat a man’s main job was to earn money, and a woman’s to look after the home, according to the British Social Attitudes survey. By 2022 that had plummeted to 9%. Yet while the proportion of women in full-time jobs hassoared, the burden of domestic labour still falls unfairly on their shoulders in heterosexual households – whereas same-sex couples tend to divide it more equally. Men are doing more than they did, but women still do most – even when they are the main breadwinners, US researchhas shown. Beliefs have been transformed, but behaviour has proved more stubborn.Globally, the UN hasreportedthat women do at least two-and-a-half times more household and care work than men, equivalent to 10%-39% of the gross domestic product of member states. In the US, analysis suggests that women – who make up half of the paid workforce – account for almost 80% of the unpaid domestic work: worth around $3.6tn a year. Yet this labour isnot included in GDPand in many countries is ignored or insufficiently recognised when it comes to divorce.So a new book on a half-century-old campaign –Wages for Housework: The Story of a Movement, an Idea, a Promise– offers food for thought today. Prof Emily Callaci traces the history and impact of the polarising feminist Marxist movement.“They say it’s love – we say it’s unwaged work,”wroteSilvia Federici, one of its founders. It was not just that women’s labour was going unrecognised and unrewarded, and that women lacked autonomy as a result. It was also about recognising that unpaid work is integral to capitalism, sustaining the souls and bodies needed for paid work with smiles as well as hot suppers. The campaign argued, too, that women’s paid labour is least valued when it mirrors the unpaid work they already do.The movement was international and intersectional, with the groups Wages Due Lesbians and Black Women for Wages for Housework soon emerging. But it was always a small strand insecond-wave feminismand it remains controversial. Its key figures split. Manysaw itas inviting capitalism into the home, encouraging women’s relegation to that sphere, or cementing the unequal domestic burden. In response, Selma James, another of its founders,accusedmiddle-class feminists of idealising the workplace: “I had waitressed, packed sweets, and wired and soldered TVs on an assembly line. Liberation didn’t look like that!” she wrote.Some activists demanded wages as a practical solution, while others saw the idea as a tool for challenging deeper systemic issues. In Prof Callaci’swords, it was “the starting point for a more fundamental transformation of our political imagination: the conjuring of a world organized around care rather than capitalist growth, the destruction of the environment, and pointless productivity”.That might mean, for example, paying farmers to support nature rather than produce food. The movement has inspired prison abolitionists, members of Argentina’s Ni Una Menos campaign against male violence, organisers of paid domestic workers, and proponents of a universal basic income. It now calls for an incomefor all caring work, whether that be of people or the planet. It is not just a question of whether we value what we do not pay for – but of the cost when we do not value what matters.Explore more on these topicsWomenOpinionWork & careersFeminismInequalityUnited NationsDomestic workerseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Starmer doesn’t have the guts, saysStan Collins.AndRob Harrisdoesn’t want to see capital gains tax applied to his homeSun 2 Feb 2025 11.46 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 11.48 ESTShareGeorge Monbiot (Home truths: the only thing Labour is building is a bigger, more dysfunctional housing market, 26 January) hits several nails on the head, but the most pivotal is his hunch that ministers “are intelligent people pretending not to be for political reasons”.In a housing market bloated by financialisation after a decade and a half of interest rates close to zero, ownership prospects have been increasingly confined to those inheriting property wealth, and the only way that will change within the mortgageable years of the current unendowed cohort will be through the puncturing of this Ponzi scheme by government intervention.There are several options, including a revaluation of the stock with revision of the council tax banding system, which Monbiot mentions but whichLabourhas ruled out for reasons unexplained, and revision of the wider property tax and planning regimes to favour full-time dwellings more forcefully.But improved affordability means the value of property coming down. That means negative equity and grief for the banks, whose profligacy spawned the financial crisis at the root of this housing crisis.And so the default position is to defend the haves against the have-nots and, in the meantime, hand out more planning consents for developers to take their time with in the hope that enough people still swallow the myth that something useful is being done. Unintelligent indeed, but it buys political time.John WorrallCromer, NorfolkGeorge Monbiot’s excellent piece on housing, planning and government policy had one serious omission. He didn’t mention that developers already have planning consent formore than 1m homes. Why aren’t they being built, and how do we make sure that they are?These unused permissions not only represent a missed opportunity; they are an obstacle to the allocation of other land in the local plan. If the government wants to see some building, not just more paperwork, then it should make some minor changes to planning law.Make all planning consents lapse after five years without any automatic right of renewal and apply this to all existing planning approvals. Allow planning authorities to de-designate the site in the local plan if development has not taken place. Get rid of the rule that sticking a spade in the ground with a witness constitutes the start of development and void all such token starts. Introduce a rule that all “on completion of development” conditions should apply from five years after the start of a development whether finished or not.All of these could be incorporated in a short bill that could be sped into law to get things moving. It’s what Attlee or Roosevelt would have done, but I doubt that Starmer and his government have the guts.The potential impact on the balance sheets of big developers should be enough to get quite a bit of activity going, whether by actually building or by forcing the sale of land with permission to other developers who can.Stan CollinsKendal, CumbriaGeorge Monbiot makes a very cogent analysis, but his proposal that capital gains tax be applied to property increasing in value does not find favour in this house. When I sell and move, my next home will also have increased in value and I will therefore need to use all my selling price to buy it. And the same situation applies to all people moving home.Rob HarrisWestbury-on-Severn, GloucestershireDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

However, men should think very carefully and consider the evidence before asking their GP for a PSA test.In 2018, areview of the available evidenceconcluded that 1,000 men would have to be PSA-screened to prevent one man from dying of prostate cancer over 10 years, and screening probably did not improve men’s chances of being alive after 10 years. In 2019, a review of the results of theEuropean Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancerreported that, after 16 years, 570 men had to be invited for screening to prevent one prostate cancer death. The results of these scientific studies are the reason why the UK does not have a prostate screening programme.For men who decide to have a PSA test and are diagnosed with cancer, there is then the difficult choice of treatment. Surgery (radical prostatectomy) and radiotherapy are options but so, too, is to be monitored regularly with PSA tests and have no immediate treatment. The only reliable evidence to help a man choose comes from the results of theBritish ProtecT studythat compared these three options in 1,610 men who had been diagnosed by screening. After 15 years, 356 had died, 45 from prostate cancer.There was no significant difference in the risk of dying, or dying of prostate cancer, between the three treatment options. Three‑quarters of the men in the active-monitoring group experienced growth or spread of the cancer and needed subsequent treatment, but a quarter of the men were alive without having received any form of treatment.Reginald HallRetired urologist,Newcastle upon TyneHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It came, of course, from the prodigiously talented Myles Lewis‑Skelly. Although it wasn’t perhaps the obvious one.With 62 minutes gone at the Emirates Stadium, Lewis‑Skelly took a sharp pass from Declan Rice and twirled inside with an easy kind of grace, one of those players who just seems to have that naturally intimate relationship with the ball.Guardiola admits City’s confidence is ‘fragile’ as Arsenal breaks title defenceRead moreLewis-Skelly is an interesting footballer in lots of ways. He isn’t actually a full-back, or wasn’t before he came into the first team. Then again, full-back is a mutable thing now, the whizziest, most postmodern position on the pitch, engine of tactical reinvention, new lines and angles. We’re all inverted false-flank innovators these days.It says a lot about Lewis-Skelly’s intelligence and range of technical skills that he has been able to pick up that evolving role on the hoof. And not least to play as he did here, as a shield, cutting edge and overload in midfield against the coach who brought that innovation into the English league, as first glimpsed in the strange, loitering manoeuvres of Pablo Zabaleta, back when the world was still young, tackles were a thing and goalkeepers didn’t do stepovers.Here Pep Guardiola cut an increasingly gloomy figure as the afternoon wore on, watching the game from deep within his thick grey woollen robes, and sat slumped on his bench looking like a sad dying Jedi by the time Ethan Nwaneri curled in an outrageous stoppage‑time goal to make it5-1 to Arsenal.That wasn’t the best moment, though. Neither was what Lewis‑Skelly did next, although this was a genuinely high‑end piece of skill, carrying the ball forward, switching the angle of his hips mid‑stride, then curling a shot on the run into the far corner of the City net.The best moment was Lewis‑Skelly’s celebration. This was The Haaland, the lotus position plus deep-thought pose, Yoga‑Haaland, an outrageous piece of craphousery given the ongoing needle between his teammates and City’s superstar striker. Best of all it was a really good version of The Haaland, suggestive of someone who has actually planned and practised this, an 18-year-old full-back making a contingency for when he scores against the champions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And here Lewis-Skelly was excellent all game, flooding into midfield alongside the excellent Rice and Thomas Partey. At one point he bodied Haaland out of the arc of the ball under a high cross (Lewis‑Skelly is six inches shorter, but there’s power in those bulging thighs). Here’s an interesting thing.Arsenalare yet to lose a league or Champions League game in which he has played.By the end Arsenal’s fans were doing the Poznan (a sarcastic Poznan, which is still, sadly, a Poznan all the same). At which point, with teenagers scoring goals, revenge-banter arcs, and a total destruction of your rivals of the past two years, a sense of reality must intrude just a little.View image in fullscreenArsenal fans perform the Poznan while a glum Pep Guardiola looks on.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesThere was always a slight air of escapism about all this, of a lost weekend playing the old tunes. If you’d told Arsenal’s fans after the 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium that they would win the return 5-1 to go nine points clear of City the assumption would have been, OK, someone book the giant cake with an Arsène Wenger lookalike inside. We’re into the victory lap here.In reality this game always had a slight Joshua versus Fury vibe, a champion clash without any obvious belt on the line. And even here there was evidence of exactly why Arsenal aren’t running away with the league.The Emirates Stadium was crisp and clear at kick-off, the sky a lovely powder-blue wash above the lip of the stand. And Arsenal took the lead in the second minute through Martin Ødegaard after a low-comedy attempt to play out from the back. At which point there was a notable dropping of the revs.For a while in that first half Ødegaard seemed to be playing a different game to his teammates, haring about with genuine urgency, like the last man standing in a zombie apocalypse movie. Arsenal didn’t have another shot for 23 minutes. They missed the odd glaring chance. Kai Havertz had some Kai Havertz moments in front of goal. This team have a ruthless manager, a ruthless setup, a ruthless on-field style. But somehow they still aren’t a ruthless team. At least, not when it comes to the final gloss.Haaland equalised early in the second half. Thomas Partey made it 2-1. City duly collapsed. For Arsenal, the gap to Liverpool is six points. There really is nothing wrong with this team that a little more in the way of edge, an actual goal scorer couldn’t solve. Here they had an afternoon of catharsis. Shot through, perhaps, with a vague sense of regret.Explore more on these topicsArsenalManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

His return will be a fillip given Borthwick bemoaned England’s inexperience after another capitulation in Dublin, extending their unwanted run to seven defeats in nine matches.George has 97 caps and, though Luke Cowan-Dickie could keep his place at hooker on Saturday, the Saracens veteran’s presence in the squad will be a boost. Borthwick is unlikely to make wholesale changes to his side, who built a 10-5 half-time lead against Ireland only to concede 22 unanswered points, but he will be tempted to experiment with Marcus Smith at full-back and Fin Smith at fly-half from the start given the counterattacking opportunities France offer.“There is always that balance,” Borthwick said. “This group of players is building and is going to be a very, very good team. I trust this group of players. You can see just how hard they are working for each other and I thought that was a step forward [against Ireland]. Look at how hard they ran and the effort – I can see a team starting to develop among this group.”France have won their past three matches against England including a53-10 victoryon their last visit to Twickenham. They began their Six Nations campaign with a43-0 win against Waleson Friday and will arrive in south-west London as heavy favourites. But the back-rower Ben Earl is adamant that, despite England’s miserable run of results, they can turn the corner against Fabien Galthié’s side.“This group is still amazingly tight,” Earl said. “We’ve played a lot together. We’ve been through a lot of hurt together. We spoke about this week, we’ve been through a lot of hurt. There’s no denying that we’re trying to give our all. It’s never been for a lack of effort.“I trust in Steve, I trust in the players that we’ve got, that the dam will break and we’ll start getting momentum. TheSix Nationsis about momentum, winning Test matches is about momentum. We just need to get one. We’ll wait until that, and we’ll keep turning up. We’re not disheartened. I know I keep saying this – the dam will break and we’ll start winning them.

France are a very, very good defensive team, we know that and it was clear on Friday night. But we want to go out there next weekend and challenge them.

It was the visitors, Arsenal, who came out on top to surely confine the remainder of Manchester City’s Women’s Super League campaign to merely a battle for European qualification.City’s fourth defeat in their past six WSL games was another engrossing but mistake filled match that will be hugely damaging for their hopes of domestic success. On the overall share of the chances, Arsenal probably deserved to edge an end-to-end contest.Quick GuideWSL roundup: Blues battle past Villa, Everton climb tableShowChelseaextended their unbeaten streak to 21 games with a narrow 1-0 win away atAston Villa. The reigning WSL champions were far from their best at Villa Park but super-sub Mayra Ramírez ignited a much-needed spark in the 82nd minute. Receiving the ball just inside Aston Villa’s half, the forward made a powerful run down the right before cutting in and sending a low cross towards the six-yard box. Sarah Mayling attempted to make the clearance but instead tapped it into her own net. Despite the loss, it was a positive performance from Aston Villa who showed clear signs of improvement under new manager Natalia Arroyo after just one week in charge. Kirsty Hanson came closest for the hosts when her long-range effort hit the crossbar.Manchester Unitedreturned to second in the table with a 1-0 win over Tottenham. Elisabeth Terland’s sixth-minute strike proved to be decisive as Marc Skinner’s side moved seven points behind Chelsea. After receiving the ball from Ella Toone on the right, full-back Jayde Riviere found Terland in the box with a pinpoint cross. The striker then wrapped her foot around it to fire her shot into the bottom-left corner. That result takes United to five successive WSL victories.Evertonbounced back from last weekend’s defeat to West Ham with a crucial 4-1 win against fellow strugglersLeicester City. Shannon O’Brien cancelled out Kelly Gago’s early opener with a 16th-minute strike, but the hosts regained their lead just after half-time through Katja Snoeijs before Honoka Hayashi and another strike from Gago sealed the victory at Walton Hall Park. The result saw Everton leapfrog both West Ham and Aston Villa up to eighth in the table.Across Merseyside,Liverpoolgot back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory overWest Ham. Ceri Holland was the instigator of the decisive strike, weaving around two opposition players before firing a dangerous pass through to Leanne Kiernan, who flicked the ball past Kinga Szemik with the outside of her right boot. 'I think it was just important to get three points and also another clean sheet, which is really positive,' said the Liverpool manager, Matt Beard.Finally, relegation candidatesCrystal Palacetook a crucial point fromBrightonthanks to a late equaliser from My Cato at the Broadfield Stadium. The hosts took the lead through a Lily Woodham own goal in the 18th minute before Brighton's Maisie Symonds saw red for a late challenge on Aimee Everett. The result left Palace 12th in the table, three points adrift of safety.Emillia HawkinsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The errors were littered throughout almost every big moment in the match and began inside the first minute when Laia Aleixandri was dispossessed while trying to control a short pass from goalkeeper Khiara Keating and Mariona Caldentey put Arsenal in front. The away side were 2-0 up just seven minutes later when Keating attempted to punch clear Kyra Cooney-Cross’s free-kick but was beaten to the ball in the air by Lotte Wubben-Moy, who headed in.Gareth Taylor defended 20-year-old Keating, who also made errors in their4-2 defeatagainst Manchester United in January, saying: “We have to be really careful with these young players that we don’t just jump on the bandwagon straight away and lay all of the blame with them.“If you want to blame someone, then blame me. Blame me. I pick the team. I back my players all of the time. But for us to all of a sudden just look at the game, see the four goals and point to Khiara straight away, I think that is a little bit tough, because we know that there’s a very good goalkeeper in there, but who at the moment is suffering. Our job is to help her and support her as best we possibly can. If that support looks like me pushing back on questions from yourself, then I will do.”Taylor’s team were the stronger for the remainder of the first half, though, and halved the deficit when Mary Fowler nodded in Aoba Fujino’s right-wing cross, which perhaps the Arsenal goalkeeper, Daphne van Domselaar, will feel she could have done better with. The mistakes from both teams continued after half-time, with Caldentey giving away possession on the edge of her own penalty area to allow the former Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema to score her fifth goal in her past four appearances in all competitions.View image in fullscreenVivianne Miedema’s goal against her former club proved to be in vain.Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty ImagesIt was also the second time this season that Miedema had scored against her old club, since her summer switch from north London to the east side of Manchester. A minute later, Arsenal went 3-2 up as they sliced through the home side’s defence to see Frida Maanum score in front of their travelling fans.The next mistake to lead to a goal appeared to come from the officials, as a penalty was awarded for a foul on Fujino by Steph Catley that appeared to have occurred just outside the box, rather than inside it. Fowler did not care and dutifully dispatched the equaliser from the spot.More momentary lapses followed, with Keating running 30 yards out of her goal to try to intercept a long pass but timing it badly, allowing Stina Blackstenius to go around her and appear certain to score – but the Sweden striker had run too wide and was too hesitant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was hurt of course after the loss against Chelsea. We analysed it. I asked: ‘Who are we? What is the Arsenal way? What is our identity? How will we win games against top opposition?’ The girls were all with us.“It wasn’t the end of the world from a performance perspective against Chelsea but the loss of the three points meant a lot. I think the group is so strong from game to game and also within the games that we can show resilience and come back – which is what we did today.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballManchester City WomenArsenal Womenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The former prime minister was among the spectators in Mumbai as India’s Abhishek Sharma struck a ridiculous 54-ball 135 to set up a 150‑run win against England in the fifth and finalTwenty20international.Sharma’s hands flew on the way to 13 sixes, his final return the highest score by an India batter in T20 internationals. Forget the English, none of his teammates could match him either; Shivam Dube’s 13-ball 30 was the next best contribution as India put together a total of 247 for nine.India thrash England in fifth men’s T20 match to win series 4-1 – as it happenedRead moreEngland had to go at it immediately and while Phil Salt provided a 23-ball 55, Jacob Bethell was the only other batter to reach double figures. Sharma snuck in a couple of wickets at the back-end too. The tourists perished for just 97, this their biggest T20 defeat in terms of runs, India on the right end of a 4-1 series scoreline.“I’ve played quite a lot of cricket and credit to Abhishek Sharma, that’s as clean a ball-striking as I’ve seen, he played fantastically well,” the England captain, Jos Buttler, said. “Looking back at the last IPL, him and Travis Head were the same at the top of the order for Sunrisers [Hyderabad] and he’s brought that into India.”Replaced midway through Friday’s match by a concussion replacement, Dube was deemed fit enough to play by India just two days later, a decision that mocked the seriousness of such an injury. At the toss Buttler pointedly named those not in England’s XI for the match as “our four impact subs”, the controversy of the previous game lingering on.But history was soon forgotten by the kid from the future. Sharma had begun the series with a 34-ball 79 but this was a more pulverising knock, the carnage beginning after Sanju Samson’s early pull shot found a fielder, a familiar sight in the past fortnight. Sharma welcomed Jofra Archer and Mark Wood’s pace and any width they gave in the powerplay. The opener was lethal on the cut and when both quicks went full, he drove over the ropes and along the carpet.The 24-year-old went to a 17-ball half-century, dominating a second‑wicket stand of 115 with Tilak Varma, who contributed 24 from 15 balls. Spin did not cause Sharma much trouble either, mis‑hits still clearing the boundary and Liam Livingstone on the end of a one‑handed six over extra cover. The left-hander’s century arrived at the start of the 11th over, 37 balls taken to get there, the second-fastest for India. A historic total of 300 could not be ruled out.View image in fullscreenAbhishek Sharma goes on the attack against England.Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/MB Media/Getty ImagesEngland, to their credit, did not wilt with the ball. Brydon Carse impressed with three wickets, his short stuff cramping Varma and Dube. Sharma was kept off strike for much of the second half of the innings amid regular breakthroughs but did still manage a pair of sixes off Adil Rashid before his demise at the end of the 18th over. England players offered Sharma their handshakes, the rest of the Wankhede their adulation.Ultra-aggression was required in the chase and Salt peppered away, driving Mohammed Shami for a couple of fours before thumping the third ball of the innings over deep midwicket for six. Ben Duckett and Buttler fell quickly, the responsibility falling on Salt, England’s top-order bruiser, to play the long game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Livingstone came in for a five-ball nine, swinging hard but eventually into the hands of Rinku Singh off Chakravarthy, the player of the series.No one could connect with the ball quite like Salt, who had struggled for runs heading into this, his half-century taking 21 balls. But Dube, the man in focus, nicked off Salt in the eighth over as the tumble continued, the innings done halfway through the 11th. “With the bat, I’ve played in a few games like this and it generally goes one of two ways,” Buttler said. “You either get somewhere near or you fall in a heap and today was that day.”Sharma’s left-arm spin was called upon for one over, dismissing Carse and Jamie Overton while conceding three runs.

McIlroy made an eagle and five birdies in a superb final round of 66 to finish 21 under par, a shot outside the tournament record set by Brandt Snedeker in 2015.Playing partner Shane Lowry birdied the 18th to secure outright second on 19 under, with Justin Rose making an eagle on the same hole to share third place with American Lucas Glover. “Some people would argue the golf courses I have won on are not up to a Pebble Beach or an Augusta, but to win at one of the cathedrals of golf is really, really cool,” McIlroy told CBS.“I knew today was going to be tough, it was going to be exciting, there were so many guys around the lead and I guess with it being Pebble Beach I had to put that to the back of my mind and go out there and try to shoot a score, which I was able to. Really cool to have that walk up 18 and take it all in.Tyrrell Hatton’s victory in Dubai catapults him back into world top 10Read more“I said to Harry [Diamond, his caddie] walking up the last, start as you mean to go on. I’m just as determined this year in any of the years I’ve been out here on the PGA Tour and to get this win this early it means a great deal and hopefully just keep the momentum going into Torrey Pines in a couple of weeks’ time.”Starting the day a shot behind Ryder Cup teammate Sepp Straka, McIlroy birdied the 2nd and 7th to take the outright lead, but bogeyed the next to fall back into a three-way tie on 16 under par.A birdie on the 10th edged McIlroy back in front and he doubled his lead with another on the 12th before striking the decisive blow on the par-five 14th. He took an aggressive line over the corner of the dogleg and followed a 339-yard drive with a mid-iron on to the green, before holing from 25 feet for eagle.“I’ve hit three really good tee shots up 14, the previous two times this week I didn’t take advantage of them and I was determined to take advantage today,” McIlroy added. “I hit a perfect seven iron after that drive and to hole a putt like that across the green is a bit of a bonus, but it really gave me a cushion to play the last four holes.“I was really proud of myself, I made that bogey on the 8th hole and to play the next few the way I did that gave me the cushion for it to be pretty comfortable coming down the last few.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The result was made all the worse when Lisandro Martínez was taken off on a stretcher in the second half with Amorim describing the injury as a “serious situation”.United have scored just 28 times in the top flight – only the bottom three clubs plus Everton have scored fewer. With Amorim’s team struggling to find the net he was asked if it would be humiliating for United if Rashford scores many times for Villa.The 40-year-old Portuguese said: “Humiliating? It’s not embarrassing. When you loan a player – and I don’t think it’s official – you expect him to play and to improve, so there is nothing humiliating there. I understand the question but I am just focused on my players, that’s all. When the window closes, I will be really focused on just our team and to improve our team.”Rashford said: “I would like to thank Manchester United and Aston Villa for making this loan deal happen. I was lucky to have a few clubs approach me but Aston Villa was an easy decision - I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager’s ambitions.“I just want to play football and am excited to get started. I wish everyone at Manchester United all the best for the rest of the season.”Men’s transfer window January 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreUnited are targeting the Bayern Munich forwardMathys Tel as a loan replacement,although it is thought the deal is in the balance after United had two bids rejected. Amorim was asked about his potential arrival. “When the window closes we will see the players. I’m focused on improving the team as a group, we need to win more games and we will try to do that, this season is like that. We need small improvements, try to win points, win the momentum, then we had setbacks and we go again.“But it’s clear we need to improve. We’ll see – there is one more day [of the market], let’s wait until the window closes. We have to improve as a team to score goals and we are trying the best to improve the team. This market is really hard on the clubs to make some deals here. It’s hard.”Arsenal are also in the running to loan Tel, who rejected a permanent move to Tottenham after they agreed a £50m fee with Bayern last week.Meanwhile, Amorim admitted real concern over the Martínez injury. “We are going to see in the next few days but I think it is a serious situation,” said the head coach. “He is not only a great player but a strong character in the dressing room. He felt it and when you are a player, you know when it is something serious. We are here to help him in this difficult moment like he has helped us.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMarcus RashfordRuben AmorimTransfer windowCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

And he was smiling with him. Pep Guardiola does that. Cole, you’re being played.”However Maresca saw nothing inappropriate about Palmer’s behaviour. “I don’t think Pep is playing a game, especially after the game is finished,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “I don’t know what kind of game you are playing when the game is finished.“But you probably have to ask him the reason why he [Neville] said that. Sometimes we finish the game and I go on the pitch and find an opposition player I know. I have a chat with him. If we say something we laugh.“Even the Fulham game we lost, I had [Timothy] Castagne at Leicester, I had a chat with him on the pitch, we were saying something and I was laughing. But it was not because I was happy to lose the game. It was just a moment.”There was amusement at the idea that Guardiola was getting in Palmer’s head. “OK!” Maresca said. “If you ask Cole if you remember what he said, I don’t think so.”Maresca, who said it is not ideal that his side host West Ham on deadline day, addressed the uncertainty around one of his top earners, Ben Chilwell. The left-back has interest from Crystal Palace before the window shuts on Monday night and is unlikely to feature for Chelsea if he does not leave. Maresca was dismissive when asked if Chilwell, who has not played in the Premier League this season, has shown signs of adapting to his tactical approach in trainings“One thing I can say about ‘Chilly’ is he has been a top professional, working every day,” he said. “But because of the situation and because of my choice he has struggled to get minutes. The decision is he can leave.

With us he was playing midfielder, attacking midfielder, full-back in some moments, a central defender in some games.

January broughtStorm ​​Éowyn, which broke wind speed records and caused significant damage, particularly in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland.The Met Office predicts that winters by 2070 will be as much as 4.5C warmer and 30% wetter than they were in 1990, while summers may be up to 6C warmer and 60% drier. The south of England is projected to face temperatures reaching 40C (104F) and rainfall is expected to increase by a quarter.The NFCC chair, Mark Hardingham, said: “Watching the devastation caused by the wildfires in Los Angeles and the number of recent flooding incidents we have seen in the UK, it is impossible not to be concerned about the very real and immediate threat climate change poses to our planet and what that will mean for our communities in the future.“Fire and rescue services are on the frontline of responding to extreme weather events and we see firefighters, control officers and other emergency service partners repeatedly going above and beyond to protect their communities. But we are seeing the risks around extreme weather increasing and, without adequate investment and further action from government, our capacity to keep communities safe and protect infrastructure is at risk.”As well as responding to emergencies, fire crews form a key part of local resilience forums, multiagency partnerships made up of representatives from local public services including emergency services, local authorities, the NHS, the Environment Agency and others.These groups, of which there are 38 in England and four in Wales – Scotland and Northern Ireland have a different but similar system – help with planning, preparing and recovering from emergencies.Ben Brook, the chief fire officer for Warwickshire and the NFCC lead on environment and climate change, said: “Fire and rescue services form part of local resilience forums and work collaboratively with partners to plan for and respond to extreme weather events.“However, we are concerned that fire and rescue services and local resilience forums do not have access to accurate data analysis mechanisms and the expertise to use this for predictive modelling which would allow for longer-term forecasting and risk management planning. We have also found that local resilience forums are under-resourced and lack clarity when it comes to their climate change resilience role.”The NFCC called for a review of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and/or the UK government resilience framework, both of which deal with national emergency planning and prevention, to reflect the threat posed by the climate crisis.In 2022, London firefighters faced their busiest day since the second world war as a result of a heatwave, declaring a major incident alongside Leicestershire and South Yorkshire services, which also battled fires as a result of prolonged hot, dry weather during July.That year there were 983 wildfires recorded in England and Wales, a rise of 315% from 2021 and 573% compared with 2020.Explore more on these topicsFirefightersGreen politicsClimate crisisExtreme weatherFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

The cost to councils could be more than £1bn a year.A significant chunk of the waste that many householders carefully sort for recycling ends up being burned.Councils now face the prospect of millions of pounds of pollution charges for burning waste. The energy-from-waste incinerators have been described as the dirtiest way the UK now generates power, with campaigners warning that plants in England emit about 12m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.England is already burning about half its waste. Environmental groups say councils should focus on encouraging more recycling and a “circular economy”.Shlomo Dowen, from the UK WithoutIncinerationNetwork, said the UK’s network of incinerators had undermined recycling efforts and contributed to carbon emissions.He said: “Operators have been given a free ride for far too long on damage caused to the climate by waste incineration.” He said too many councils had entered into contracts with the operators of incinerators that were “bad for the environment and bad for council tax payers”. He said new fiscal measures should also be brought in to ensure higher rates of recycling.View image in fullscreenAn incineration plant in London; 40 more such plants are planned.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesUnder the proposals to extend the ETS to incinerators, there will be a reporting and verification period from 2026, with the scheme due to start in 2028. The government consulted on the extended scheme in the summer and has made clear it will go ahead.A response to the government proposals by waste and bioenergy experts Tolvik Consulting warns new waste incineration fees under the scheme “will exceed the cost of landfill and probably the cost of exports” – it would cost in the range of £135 to £193 a tonne to burn rubbish, compared with £146 to £156 a tonne to send it to landfill, or £111 to £124 a tonne to send it overseas. Tolvik’s response warns of a “significant risk” that more waste would be sent to landfill in England or exported for burning in European plants, with increased road and sea transport emissions. It proposes a ban on sending any waste to landfill that is bio­degradable or combustible in an energy plant.Chris Jonas at Tolvik Consulting said: “Real care is needed to ensure the incentives for reducing emissions do not lead to worse environmental outcomes, such as more residual waste being sent to landfill sites or an increase in illegal disposal activity. If this happens, then a well-intended policy will have failed very badly indeed.”Councils have already warned the new tax could load billions of pounds of extra costs on local authorities. The Local Government Association said in September that costs faced by councils could rise to £1.1bn a year by 2036. The operators of the incinerators will pay the new tax, but will recoup the costs from additional fees for burning rubbish, which will fall on the councils.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government published a note in December on waste infrastructure and stated it would only back new projects if they met strict local and environmental conditions.A government spokesperson said: “We are reducing waste by moving to a circular economy and will pursue near elimination of biodegradable waste from landfill to support net zero, by ‘turning off the tap’ of future methane emissions.“Expanding the UK emissions trading scheme to include energy from waste facilities will cut emissions and drive investment in cleaner supply chains. We continue to engage with industry on the details of this scheme, including how costs will be passed through to reflect emissions reductions and recycling efforts, and will provide further updates in due course.”The Environmental Services Association, the trade association for the recycling and waste treatment sector, said it supported the new charges to help the industry reach net zero. It said the new charges should be accompanied by a ban on biodegradable waste to landfill and a “carbon border adjustment mechanism” to ensure the waste will not be sent overseas.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe ObserverWasteIncinerationLandfillnewsShareReuse this content"

Grannell said he was “furious” the Metropolitan police did not release the CCTV sooner and that the force’s handling of the case smacked of homophobia.“I think it’s caused them to not prioritise it at all and just ignore it. We’re just not important enough to get their attention,” the artist said.“They’re inept, and now I am very comfortable saying it’s impossible for me to not cry homophobia at this point, which I was reluctant to do for so long, giving them the benefit of the doubt … How can they not tell us how it is she died for this period of time?”View image in fullscreenPolice have released CCTV of three men they wish to speak to.Photograph: Metropolitan policeGrygelko, who was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, cofounded the legendary San Francisco drag night Trannyshack in 1996 and performed around the world.Grygelko and Grannell had been in London in April 2023 to perform in Mommie Queerest, a parody of the 1981 film Mommie Dearest, which was set for a two-week run at Soho theatre.Grannell suspected something was wrong after returning to their rented flat in Soho Square on the morning of 3 April to find their front door was unlocked and a noisy fan connected to the bathroom light was on.Grannell found Grygelko in the living room, recalling: “She’s in full drag on the floor, in a very unusual position, so unusual that it’s one of the images that haunts me the most. She’s on her knees. Her face is on the floor and her hands are on either side of her head.”Typically drag artists use female pronouns for their drag persona.Grygelko’s death is being treated as unexpected and remains under investigation while officers liaise with the coroner, the Met said last Friday.Grannell said the past 21 months had been “nightmarish” as he continued trying to seek answers about what happened to Grygelko, with his emails to the Met sometimes going unanswered for months. He also provided a pen portrait about Grygelko to Westminster coroner’s court but has no idea when an inquest will take place.Grannell said: “The first few months after it happened, I couldn’t even push up my eyes without seeing her dead face and I had to go to therapy. And all of this is very kind of retraumatising, I feel like I’m living back in that nightmare yet again and I don’t know how they [the police] expect the nightmare for any of us to go away.“She had fans. She had close friends. Your job is to give us answers. You’ve given us nothing, and to find out all this time later there’s something like CCTV footage is both frustrating as hell, but also gratifying, because it’s like, well, of course there is and you’re just completely being wilfully inept.”Nancy French, a friend of Grygelko and the executor of the artist’s estate, echoed Grannell’s concerns. “I am Heklina’s next of kin with the London police but have never received a cause of death, autopsy report, or final death certificate.“This CCTV footage should have been released 21 months ago. Releasing it now just proves their ineptitude and mismanagement that we’ve been dealing with for almost two years,” she said in a statement from California.A Met police spokesperson said detectives carried out a number of inquiries and continued to work closely with the coroner to establish what happened on the night of Grygelko’s death.“This lengthy investigation has been unable to identify who was at the flat at the time, and detectives are now appealing for the public’s help, while also asking that the three men who were captured in the CCTV to come forward to assist the investigation,” they said.“Due to the ongoing investigative work into the circumstances of Steven’s death, we are not disclosing publicly the cause of death at this time.”Explore more on these topicsLondonDragMetropolitan policeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been referred to as Racists Across the World andcriticised by Amnesty Internationaland some charities.However, one of the producers, Liam Humphreys of Minnow Films, said: “It’s really important to engage with people who have different opinions [and ask] why do they think like that?”In the first episode, a contributor called Dave suggests putting landmines off Dover beaches to stop small boats: “It’s like rats, you leave food out they’ll keep coming.”The joint executive producer, Emma Young, acknowledged there had been a lot of comments about platforming racists with extreme views. “But these voices that you hear within the series are the voices we were hearing up and down the country as we were casting and they are a vocal voice that is shaping our political landscape,” she said.“People might find it uncomfortable to hear the things they hear but you … have to understand why they feel like that. I did not want it to be preachy at all.”Humphreys said the show is about empathy and “understanding other people’s points of view; not saying you have to agree with them but … take the debate off Twitter … and try to have a discussion where you can understand someone’s point of view”.Channel 4’s head of documentaries and factual entertainment, Alisa Pomeroy, said that “difficult opinions [are] expressed in the series that will make uncomfortable viewing for some”.But, she added, it was important that the series unflinchingly and accurately represented the range of strong views on immigration in the UK. In order to “be able to challenge – and wrestle with – these views, we need to be able to air them,” she said. “Otherwise, we simply drive them online, where they metastasise and we end up with combustible events like last summer’s race riots.”The series isbased on an Australian formatand Pomeroy said it was worth noting that none of the charities criticising the show had seen the programme. There was a similar level of outcry about the show in Australia pre-transmission, she said, but it went on to win awards and become part of the school curriculum.The series gives what Humphreys called “information by stealth” because it is “entertaining, but you’re also dealing with complex issues”. It includes potted histories of regional conflicts and first-hand accounts from refugees as the contributors trek across mountainous border crossings, through the African desert and experience small boat crossings.Pomeroy said Channel 4 had never done a show with such risk and ambitionwhich involved immersing ordinary people in hugely dangerous places. Minnow had seven safety assessors, two psychologists monitoring participants, security and legal teams and the heads of Channel 4 signing off risk assessments nightly during filming.Shifting geopolitics changed plans last-minute and, Pomeroy said, they wouldn’t have been able to make the series a few weeks later as some countries became too dangerous.The participants were dramatically pulled from a market by security after kidnapping fears and the Tunisian government revoked permission at the last minute to film the contributors making a boat crossing.“Within the constraints of health and safety and hostile filming protocols, we had to provide the most authentic experience for them,” said Humphreys, so the participants were not told the crossing was choreographed. Producers cut the engine on the boat halfway across and hired a local Lebanese coastguard to rescue them.The participants were terrified, thinking they were about to be arrested. When they discovered the truth they were initially angry but then understood it needed to be as immersive as possible so they could empathise fully.All of them had seen the show and were happy with their portrayal, Minnow said.Young said they had all “gone on a journey … to varying degrees” and “minds have been changed, or at least educated”.Humphreys added it had affected them all and had a lasting impact on how they viewed the world.Go Backto Where You Came From begins on Channel 4 on Monday 3 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevisionChannel 4Television industryImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s not a lot of time for me to establish myself.”She has a huge job ahead.Labour has been the party of power in Walesfor more than a century, a mighty election-winning machine, but in the 2026 Senedd elections faces an unprecedented squeeze fromReform UKon the right andPlaid Cymru on the left.View image in fullscreenEluned Morgan drops in at the Pink Nails salon in Blackwood to talk about ‘bread and butter issues’.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianPolling suggests Labour is very unlikely to win a majority– and one possibility is it may end up ruling with Plaid – but it is not unfeasible that next summer a union between the Tories and Reform UK could be running Wales.“Reform is definitely a challenge,” Morgan said. “We’ve got to take the threat seriously. It’s five years since Brexit and the disillusionment that people felt then, the disconnectedness, still needs to be addressed.”Morgan, a vicar’s daughter, grew up on a council housing estate in Cardiff. “I want to demonstrate that I’m not disconnected,” she said. “I know what you’re talking about. I’m from your community.”Want to know the future of British politics? Look to Wales for a grim warning | Will HaywardRead moreThe first minister is “nervous” that changes to the voting system and an increase in the size of the Senedd may mean the Welsh parliament ends up with a large number ofReform UKmembers.“But inWaleswe believe in community. We believe we’re better off when we pool our resources, when we look after each other. Reform is about creating divisions. People will have to think very seriously about what potentially they could lose,” said Morgan.Plaid is also a problem for Morgan. Plaid has long worked with Labour but says it will not support its budget in March. Morgan cautions that if the budget is not passed, Wales riskslosing money allocated by the UK Treasury.“Plaid could be voting down the potential of a billion and a half extra money for Wales. I think people of Wales will be very unforgiving if they realise there was money there to fix the NHS and it wasn’t picked up.”View image in fullscreenEluned Morgan, on a ‘listening exercise’, talks to Jan and Richard about their concerns that Cardiff University is closing its nursing school.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianDuring the visit to Blackwood (the home town of the indie rock band Manic Street Preachers), Morgan received a warm welcome inthe miners’ institute, which has just benefited from £210,00 of government “resilience fund” money and is preparing for sellout performances of the adult pantomimeSleeping With Beauty.Morgan pounced on Richard, 87, and Jan, 86, as they exited a travel agency, having booked a holiday to Tenerife. They told her it was easy to get a GP’s appointment but expressed concern thatCardiff University is proposing to shut its nursing school amid swingeing cuts.Though this feels like an election campaign visit, Morgan bills it as one of her “listening exercises” that she does on Thursdays and Fridays. She does not set up anything in advance but simply drops in. “The first time I did it, the security guys freaked. They’re used to it now.”View image in fullscreenEluned Morgan in Blackwood miners’ institute theatre, which recently received £210,000 in government funding.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianFrom what she has been told so far, she is focusing on four areas:health, connectivity, opportunities for all and the economy. “I’m trying to get back to the bread and butter issues.”Nicholas Davies, the owner of the Q Studio hair salon in Blackwood, was unconvinced. His customers were discussing headlinesin UK tabloids claiming antisocial behaviourfrom young people was making the town “worse than the Bronx” when Morgan walked in.Davies said he employed 40 people before Covid – six now. “I’m born and bred Blackwood. I used to be proud to say I was from here. It used to be a thriving place. Not now. I’m voting Reform all day long.”No matter what happens next summer, Morgan is a history-maker, the firstLabourfemale leader in the UK. “It is about time, isn’t it? I don’t know why it’s taken so long. I’m just really pleased that we’ve got there.” In an ideal world, the next UK Labour leader should be a woman, she said.View image in fullscreenNicholas Davies, the owner of Q Studio hair salon in Blackwood, tells Eluned Morgan he will be voting for Reform.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianAs a radical young woman,Morgan picked coffee in Nicaragua alongside the Sandinistas. “Asked where she would go now if she was that young woman, Morgan said: “I definitely wouldn’t go picking coffee with the Sandinistas today because it’s all very sour out there.“I’d probably want to go and help reconstruct Palestine. They’ve been pulverised and I worry about that.” She said the 7 October attack was “disgraceful” but the response “massively disproportionate”.But her focus is Wales. “What I’m interested in is making sure that everybody gets a chance to make the best of themselves.

However, ultimately a deal on security cooperation and getting smoother customs arrangements will be a priority for the UK.Sandeels vs the EU: how the puffin’s favourite food sparked first post-Brexit courtroom trade battleRead moreThe working dinner on Monday at the Palais d’Egmont in central Brussels will be the first time a UK prime minister has met all 27 EU leaders since Britain’s formal exit from the union five years ago. Starmer will also meet theNatosecretary general, Mark Rutte, who is seen as one of Europe’s most skilful communicators with Donald Trump.In October Starmer met the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, when the two sides agreed tostrengthen cooperation “at pace”including in security.More than three months later, little has advanced. The EU has drawn up guidelines for the reset that stressan early deal on fishing rightsis necessary for moving forward in other areas.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said on Sunday that Starmer would seek to improve customs arrangements with Europe without returning to a full union with the bloc.Pressed on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme on what different customs arrangements could mean, she said the government wanted to “get rid of some of the bureaucracy” across borders. Cooper ruled out joining the customs union as a “red line” but left the door open to the possibility of another type of customs deal.She described a youth mobility scheme sought by the EU as “not the right starting point for us at all” but the government has been careful not to rule it out as part of an overall deal.Three EU diplomatic sources said that a package approach applied to any EU-UK security pact, with a large majority of member states supporting this approach.One senior EU diplomat said the relationship with the UK had “many different buckets”, listing security, energy, fisheries, migration, youth mobility and a veterinary agreement, and said all were interlinked.“We share security interests with the UK and the UK shares it with us,” the diplomat said. “But at the same time, and there is no beating around the bush, that the future relationship on fisheries is also very important.”They added that there was “no direct tradeoff” between fish and security, but that the commission, which will lead negotiations, would have to keep the different issues in parallel.The EU would like to roll over the current post-Brexit agreement on fishing rights, which expires in June 2026, but Starmer will be under pressure from Reform UK to get bigger quotas for British fishing fleets.The conflict over sequencing is reminiscent of the Brexit negotiations, when the EU said“nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”in order to maximise leverage.The talks at the dinner are not expected to discuss such details, nor reach any formal conclusions. Costa, a former Portuguese prime minister, who took over chairing European Council meetings in December, wants informal discussions without any final text.In a letter ahead of the event, Costa said the EU27 needed to discuss “goals and priorities with non-EU partners” and went on to describe the UK as “a key partner”.Before the 27 leaders meet Starmer, they will have daylong talks between themselves that are likely to be less consensual. France, Italy, Spain, Poland and Estonia would like to see common EU funds for defence – raised by common borrowing. Germany’s government, which is facing elections this month, backed by its frugal ally the Netherlands, is deeply opposed to moreshared debt.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyForeign policyKeir StarmerBrexitEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionNatoShareReuse this content"

Thousands of people are able to register their businesses properly, but it looks beyond the Tories. What a complete shambles.“Kemi Badenoch should quickly explain whether the Conservative party may have committed a criminal offence by not taking the proper action. The Tories have learned nothing and it appears they can’t even get their own house in order.”The law on notification of persons of significant control was brought in by the Conservatives in 2016 and toughened in 2017 to require declarations to be made within 14 days.Late filings are unlikely to result in enforcement action but anyone who does not respond to reminders or does not provide accurate information commits a criminal offence that could bring a two-year prison sentence, a fine or both.Badenoch had updated her entry in the register of MPs’ interests to say she was in control of C&UCO Management Ltd, C&UCO Services Ltd, C&UCO Properties Ltd and the Conservative Party Foundation from 2 November onwards but this was not reflected on the official company register.Badenoch has previously said she does not make gaffes, telling the Chopper’s Politics podcast last September: “I never have gaffes, or apologising for something that I said, [saying] ‘oh that’s not what I meant’, I never have to clarify, because I think very carefully about what I say.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to the newspaper, McSweeney voiced fears in private that the prime minister might be too timid.A government source denied that McSweeney had described him as such and suggested anonymous briefings about Starmer should not be taken seriously.The book also carried quotes from an unnamed member of Starmer’s inner circle referring to the driverless Docklands Light Railway (DLR), saying: “Keir’s not driving the train. He thinks he’s driving the train, but we’ve sat him at the front of the DLR.”Cooper told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “I think what you see withKeir Starmeris a real determination to change the country.“It’s why he set out the plan for change with clear action, clear things that he’s determined to change across the country.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is actually about respect and hard work, and making the country work for working people.”McSweeney was brought back in to be Starmer’s chief of staff after the ousting of the former senior civil servant Sue Gray, who had taken on the role for only a year. He had previously been chief of staff, before becoming campaign director at the election, when he was widely credited with masterminding a victory in which the party accrued enough votes in crucial marginal seats to win a decisive landslide.The book also claimed that Starmer employed an actor, Leonie Mellinger, to be a voice coach during the pandemic. The Conservatives wrote to Starmer on Sunday claiming that Mellinger should not have got a designated “key worker” status at the time, arguing it was reserved for essential delivery of the Covid public response.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerMorgan McSweeneyYvette CooperLabournewsShareReuse this content"

We’re doing the same, for example, on tackling the dangerous small boat crossings.“We need that stronger cooperation with France, with Germany, so, of course, we need to strengthen that cooperation and also look for stronger trading relationships with the US and other countries.”Pressed on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme on what different customs arrangements could mean, she said the government wanted to “get rid of some of the bureaucracy” across borders. Cooper ruled out joining the customs union as a “red line” but left the door open to the possibility of another type of customs deal.Cooper also said the US president’s tariffs could have a “really damaging impact” on the global economy, telling the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “I don’t think it’s what anybody wants to see.”Brussels is looking for a youth mobility scheme and concessions on fishing rights and following EU laws, while Starmer’s priorities are a defence and security pact, as well as smoother trade.Cooper described a youth mobility scheme as “not the right starting point for us at all” but the government has been careful not to rule it out as part of an overall deal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there’s a solution right under her nose: a new UK-EU customs union deal that boosts trade for British businesses and raises vital tax revenue for our public services,” Davey said.“It’s a no-brainer.

The farmer shot at them – killing Barras.The case sparked a nationwide public debate about whether his actions were proportionate. Martin became a cause célèbre for homeowners worried about their rights to protect themselves and their property.Martin claimed he had previously been the target of burglaries, and said he was acting in self-defence.A friend, Malcolm Starr, told the BBC Martin had died shortly before 3pm on Sunday at Wisbech hospital in Cambridgeshire. He said Martin had a stroke a few months ago.Barras and Fearon had travelled from Newark in Nottinghamshire to steal from his semi-derelict farm home, called Bleak House, where Martin stored antiques.Martin fired his shotgun three times towards the intruders. Barras was killed, while Fearon was treated for his injuries in hospital.He was initially found guilty of murder, but this was reduced to manslaughter on appeal.The high-profile nature of the case led to the production of a Channel 4 drama, The Interrogation of Tony Martin, with the League of Gentlemen actor Steve Pemberton playing Martin.Months after his release in 2003, hewas invited to speak at the Oxford Union.He said he did not have any regrets, a sentiment he repeated in interviews in the 25 years since.But when Martin was asked if Barras had deserved to die, he had a one-word answer. “No.”Explore more on these topicsTony Martin murder caseNorfolkCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It found that 71% of people would travel more by train if fares were cut.Although advance tickets can reduce the cost of using many services, the CBT argues that the fare system penalises passengers who are unable to book ahead or require a more flexible ticket.UK rail firms urged to issue ‘yellow card’ warnings instead of penaltyRead moreA standard single on the intercity route from London to Edinburgh is likely to pass £200 next month when railfares rise by another 4.6%.Train operators have argued that cheaper fares are available, even on the day of travel, but a snapshot of fares on Sunday afternoon showed the cost of a single for any train from Edinburgh to London King’s Cross was £199.60, while the next London Euston to Glasgow train cost £150.60.A Birmingham New Street to Glasgow Queen Street ticket cost £154, while taking the next direct train from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston cost £184.70. Cheaper off-peak return fares on many popular routes areno longer available.The report by CBT said: “The climate emergency underlines that a significant shift from less sustainable modes to rail travel is essential, and fair fares are fundamental to this.”The current “complicated and unwieldy” system and high pricing for popular services “particularly affects people on low incomes who can least afford high fares when they need to travel at short notice”, it said.It suggested one option could be a “reasonable cap on fares” to reduce the difference between the lowest and highest prices, eliminating the “cliff edge when advance fares go off sale”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While some of our fare types are among the cheapest in Europe, particularly when booked in advance, we know the labyrinth of fares and prices can be confusing, which is why we want to simplify fares so it’s easier for passengers to find the right ticket for their journey.”Explore more on these topicsRail faresRail industryRail transportTransportTransport policyConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

DNA testing later confirmed the identity of the mother of three, who had been living in the north of England at the time of her death.Detectives initially believed she had died of natural causes but in 2018 a cold case team for North Yorkshire police revealed that Lamduan was murdered.“A 61-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Lamduan Armitage in 2004. He remains in police custody for questioning,” a statement from North Yorkshire police said.The force urged the public and media to “refrain from speculation” about the case and respect the privacy of family members and people connected to the case.Cold case detectives and family liaison officers visited Thailand in February 2023, conducting interviews with witnesses in Udon Thani, Bangkok and Kanchanaburi, and meeting Lamduan’s parents, Buasa and Joomsri Seekanya.Lamduan moved to the UK in 1991 and had lived in Portsmouth, Rugby and Preston.On their visit to Thailand, family liaison officers handed a memorial book to her parents, which included photographs of the funeral service held in Horton in Ribblesdale in 2007, arranged and paid for by local people.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

China will also have 10% tariffs, with the new impositions scheduled to start on Tuesday.While the trio of affected countries are preparing retaliatory moves, with China saying it willlodge a lawsuitwith the World Trade Organization against the US, Democratic leaders are flagging potentially devastating consequences domestically for American workers.Ken Martin, who was chosen to be the next chair of theDemocratic National Committeeon Saturday, said that blanket tariffs would cost working families while Trump would ensure that corporations get a pass.“He’s using American workers as pawns in his petty political games. If a president promised that they’d help my family get by, and then they did this, I’d be pretty pissed off. So, you should be pissed off,” Martin said in a statement.Trump made a rare concession to his detractors on Sunday, admitting that their could be negative consequences of his hostile act. On his Truth Social feed,he said: “WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.”Lest anyone confuse his statement with contrition or change of heart, Trump put out a separate post repeating his trolling invitation toCanadato join the union. “Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada – AND NO TARIFFS!”In a largely symbolic gesture, given Republican control of both chambers of Congress, two Democratic senators haveintroduced a billto force Trump to seek congressional approval for implementing any tariffs on trading partners. The bill, crafted by Chris Coons from Delaware and Tim Kaine from Virginia, would require the president to explain his plan and its impact on the US economy and foreign policy.“If the president is going abuse this power to bully and coerce our allies, Congress should take this authority back,” Coons said in a statement.Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Kaine said that he was struck by the “irony” that Trump issued an emergency order on energy then days later slapped 10% tariffs on Canadian energy. “He is increasing prices at the pump, and you will start to see it in the next couple of days. At the same time he is saying there’s an energy emergency – the emergency is self created.”Deep anxiety about the prudence of Trump’s aggressive move is also being expressed by parties who are normally allied with the president.The US Chamber of Commerce, a powerful force in conservative politics, said that Trump was making a mistake in thinking that tariffs could solve the problem of immigration across US borders and fentanyl flowing into the country.“The imposition of tariffs is unprecedented, won’t solve these problems and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains,” the chamber’s John Murphytold CNN.European figures reacted with dismay to the turmoil. On Sunday, asked about Trump’s weekend moves, European Central Bank policymaker Klaas Knot said he expects new tariffs will lead to higher inflation and interest rates in the US that will likely weaken the euro.The German opposition leader and frontrunner to become the next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Sunday expressed his concern. “Tariffs have never been a good idea for resolving trade policy conflicts,” he said at his CDU conservative party convention.In Britain senior cabinet minister Yvette Cooper said that Trump’s tariff plans could have a “really damaging impact” on the global economy and growth. The top Labour figure said the UK wanted to break down trade barriers, not put them up. “Tariff increases really right across the world can have a really damaging impact on global growth and trade, so I don’t think it’s what anybody wants to see,” she said.Other experts also warned about the potential impact.“It’s only a matter of time before the EU is targeted,” said Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at Saltmarsh Economics in London. “The fact thatCanadais responding and putting up tariffs against US goods is a sign of things to come and demonstrates the risks to global trade.”At the same time Canada said it will stand firm in the trade war.“I think the Canadian people are going to expect that our government stands firm and stands up for itself,” Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the US told ABC News.She added: “We’re not at all interested in escalating, but I think that there will be a very strong demand on our government to make sure that we stand up for the deal that we have struck with the United States.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUS politicsCanadaMexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Reversing the extension was a blow that affected more than 600,000 Venezuelans living in the US.Now Trump has targeted a subset of that Venezuelan immigrant community who entered the TPS program in 2023, obtaining the right to remain in the US until at least April. Having revoked their protections, the Trump administration is giving that group of more than 300,000 Venezuelans just 60 days before they become vulnerable to deportation.A further 250,000 Venezuelans who arrived in 2021 have TPS protections until September. Their position beyond that date must now be considered to be in severe jeopardy.TPS is a federal program designed to offer temporary shelter to those fleeing natural disasters or armed conflict. It offers a right to live in the US but without a longer term path to citizenship.In the case of Venezuela, the program offered a lifeline for hundreds of thousands escaping political and economic hardship under the dictatorship ofNicolás Maduro.The double blow of two successive cuts to the TPS program for Venezuelans has prompted cries of dismay from both Venezuela and the US. The Venezuelan opposition website El Pitazo said that the revoking of the Biden administration’s 18-month extension “fell like an atomic bomb over this migrant community”.Andres Oppenheimer, writing in theMiami Herald, noted that Trump’s move against Venezuelans targeted “some of his most ardent supporters in the US – both voters and TPS-holders. Buoyed by Trump and Florida legislators’ hard-line rhetoric against Venezuela’s dictatorship, Venezuela’s exile community had overwhelmingly supported Trump in the 2024 US elections.”Trump has long had TPS in his sights. In his first presidential term, he scrapped its protections for immigrants from El Salvador and Haiti.Homeland security chief declines to say whether women, children to be held at GuantánamoRead moreOn Sunday, the homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, sporting a cowboy hat, appeared on NBC News’s Meet the Press to justify rescinding the protections. Misreferencing the program as “TPP”, she said it no longer had credibility.Noem parroted a line frequently used by Trump on the campaign trail, that the Venezuelan government had opened its prisons and mental health institutions and sent the occupants to the US.She also said that “folks from Venezuela who have come into this country are members of TDA”. Tren de Aragua is a Venezuelan crime network.The Department of Homeland Security has identified600 migrantsin the US who may have connections to the gang – a tiny fraction of the 600,000 with TPS status.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationDonald TrumpUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The demands led to a tense standoff during which a senior deputy to Musk threatened to call the US marshals in to grant access to the building.The confrontation and Voorhees’ suspension wasfirst reported by CNNand confirmed by the USAid officials. The Doge officials gained control over the access control system, which would allow them to lock out employees and read emails. They also sought personnel files and turnstile data, two people said.Musk’s deputies may also have sought access to Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, or SCIFs, and servers used to access sensitive cables with top-secret classifications. Four members of Doge have been granted regular access to USAid as the administration has suspended dozens of senior staff and furloughed hundreds more at the bureau for humanitarian assistance who help the agency respond to urgent crises around the world.Katie Miller, who serves on the advisory board for Doge and is married to Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, wrote on X that “no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances”, following an AP report that Doge officials did manage to access the materials, which included intelligence reports.The Doge crew lacked high enough security clearance to access that information, the newswire reported.USAid continued to abruptly suspend career staffers through Sunday, with the majority of staff in the legislative and public affairs bureaus cut off from their email. More than 100 career staffers at USAid have now been put on administrative leave,according to reportsconfirmed to the Guardian by one current and one former USAid official.“We’re literally coming to work each day waiting to get the email that we’re supposed to go,” said one current USAid official who has not been suspended. “It is very much a terror feeling in that building right now.”Musk has said that USAid should be shut down as theTrump administrationis said to be mulling various strategies to downsize the agency or potentially fold it into the state department. CBS News reported that JD Vance has been put in charge of figuring out next steps for USAid reform.“USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote on X, the social network that he owns. “Time for it to die.” In another post, he referred to the agency in the past tense, saying it “was a viper’s nest of radical left-marxists who hate America”.After the confrontation, Matt Hopson, USAid’s new chief of staff, resigned from his position, according to two of the officials. Hopson was one of eight Trump administration political appointees who have taken over the leadership of USAid and have sequestered themselves at the agency’s headquarters at the Ronald Reagan Building. They have rarely interacted with career staff. Hopson’s resignation wasfirst reported by Reuters.The efforts resemble those at other agencies such as the treasury department and the office of personnel and management where Doge officials have sought direct access to sensitive servers with data on millions of Americans, often over the protests of serving staff and leadership.Wired on Sunday reported that Musk’s Doge had detailed six young engineers between the ages of 18-24 to carry out the agency’s takeover of USAid’s computer systems. Several of those individuals have regularly accessed USAid headquarters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has also placed campaign allyPete Maroccoin a senior position at the state department’s office of foreign assistance, where he hasoverseen the ruinous freezeon foreign aid that has paralysed the organisation.Around the time of the confrontation at USAid, the organisation’s website, including decades of grant records and financial reports, suddenly went offline. For a brief period, it redirected to the White House’s website, a Guardian reporter confirmed on Saturday evening. Now it is simply inaccessible.On Friday evening, senior Senate Democrats warned that the Trump administration’s decisions to place senior USAid officials on leave and freeze foreign assistance without engaging with Congress “have created a maelstrom of problems that have put our nation at risk and undermined American credibility around the globe”.They warned Trump away from reported plans to downsize or even subsume the agency into the state department. “It is imperative that we maintain an independent development voice and capability within the US government,” wrote the senators. “USAid is, by statute, an independent establishment outside of the State Department.

Mulino suggested a possible expansion of an existing agreement with the US from last July that could pave the way for direct deportations of non-Panamanian migrants who cross the Darien Gap jungle on Panama’s southern border with Colombia.After the meeting, Mulino said: “We had a very respectable and cordial meeting,” but that the canal “is operated by our country and will continue to be”.Mulino noted an expanded deal could potentially allow for the deportation of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. “We spoke extensively about the problem of migration, with the understanding that Panama is a transit point,” said Mulino, after his meeting.Mulino also said he would not renew Panama’sbelt and road initiativewith China and invited the state department to promote US investment in the country.Rubio is touring Central America and the Caribbean on his first foray in the post as he seeks to refocus US diplomacy on the western hemisphere – in part to recruit help in stemming migration toward the US southern border.Even before Trump’s election, Mulino had signed agreements with the US aimed at controlling irregular migration via the Darién Gap through increased surveillance and the introduction of deportation flights. In the first three weeks of January, migration through the gapfell 94% comparedwith the same period in 2023.A day after Trump announced he was imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting retaliation from those countries, Rubio was perhaps taking a less confrontational and more diplomatic approach. He was pictured cordially greeting Panama’s foreign minister, though neither he nor Mulino spoke publicly at their meeting. Rubio is also scheduled to tour an energy facility and the canal during his visit.View image in fullscreenProtesters against Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama City on 2 February.Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty ImagesAbout 200 people marched in Panama City, carrying Panamanian flags and shouting “Marco Rubio out of Panama”, “Long live national sovereignty” and “One territory, one flag” while the meeting was taking place. Some burned a banner with images of Trump and Rubio after being stopped short of the presidential palace by riot police.“To the imperial messenger,” union leader Saul Mendez said of Rubio, “we reiterate that there is absolutely nothing here for Trump. Panama is a free and sovereign nation.”Who owns the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?Read moreUpon returning to office Trump threatened to take control of the Panama canal, built by the US in the early 20th century and handed over to Panama under a 1977 treaty, claiming the canal is beingoperated by China. The comments were followed by a public backlash, and Panama rebuked Trump’s threats.China has said it plays no part in operating the canal and that it respects Panama’s sovereignty and independence over the waterway. The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.Following Trump’s threats, Mulino ordered Panama’s comptroller general to audit the key ports at either end of the canal. Rubio, a longtime China hawk during his Senate career, said last week that China could use ports to shut down the canal, a vital route for US shipping, in the event of a conflict between Beijing and Washington.Last week a Senate commerce committee audience accused Panama of mismanagement of the canal. In recent years drought has reduced the number of transits and auctions for limited spots have fetched figures of up to $4m. A solid Panamanian commitment to resolve this problem – the most likely solution is a dam of the Rio Indio, an environmentally and socially complex project – could appease Rubio’s concerns.However, US administration of the canal or a significant reduction of its fees – which form an important part of the national budget – would be unacceptable to the Panamanian government and its people. Mulino has said the ownership of the canal wasnot on the table in the talkswith Rubio.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the audit concession was not enough and that Panama had “totally violated” the understanding when the US handed back the canal.“They’ve already offered to do many things,” Trump said of Panama, “but we think it’s appropriate that we take it back.”Explore more on these topicsPanamaMarco RubioTrump administrationUS foreign policyAmericasDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Organisers put the turnout at 200,000.Hundreds of protesters temporarily blocked offices of the CDU in different cities. In Cologne, people protested on 350 boats on the Rhine, the German news agency dpa reported. The boats lined up in front of the city’s skyline with protesters holding banners with slogans such as “No racism” and “For democracy and diversity”.Merz on Wednesday proposed a nonbinding motion in parliament calling for Germany to turn back many more people at its borders.The measure squeaked throughthanks to the AfD’s support.Merz was determined to show the commitment of his centre-right alliance, which also includes the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union, to cutting irregular migration after a deadly knife attack last month in which the suspect is a rejected asylum seeker.However, on Friday, the German parliamentnarrowly rejected a bill calling for tougher rules on migrationthat risked becoming the first draft legislation to pass thanks to a far-right party. Nonetheless, it has become a focus of a controversy about the attitude toward the far right of the frontrunner in this month’s federal election.View image in fullscreenA protester holds a banner with an AI image depicting the AfD co-chair, Alice Weidel, and Friedrich Merz kissing.Photograph: Omer Messinger/Getty ImagesMerz has been accused by protesters and politicians on the left of breaking a taboo and endangering mainstream parties’ “firewall” against the AfD. He has said his position is unchanged and that he did not and will not work with the party.Polls show the CDU/CSU alliance, which put forward the migration proposal and bill, leading election polling with about 30% support, with the AfD second on about 20% and the Social Democrats and Greens further back.Merz appears to hope that he will gain support by making the alliance look decisive in forcing a tougher approach to migration, while blunting the appeal of the anti-immigration AfD and making the governing parties – which say they have already done much to tackle the issue – look out of touch with Germans’ concerns.The 12-year-old AfD first entered the national parliament in 2017, benefiting from the then chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision two years earlier to allow large numbers of people into the country.A year ago, hundreds of thousands also protested in weeks-long rallies across Germany against the rise of the far right and purported plans to deport millions of asylum seekers, including some who hold German passports.Explore more on these topicsGermanyMigrationAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropeShareReuse this content"

His White House border czar, Tom Homan, has said he hopes to start moving migrants there within 30 days.Asked repeatedly on NBC News whether women, children and families would be among those held at the detention center, homeland security secretaryKristi Noemdeclined to directly answer.“We’re going to use the facilities that we have,” she told NBC’s Meet the Press program. “We have other detention facilities, other places in the country. So, we will utilize what we have according to what’s appropriate for the individuals.”In separate Sunday interviews, Noem and Homan both reiterated that the administration was targeting “the worst of the worst” with its sweeps to detain people who are in the United States illegally, noting that a recent enforcement action in New York City focused on individuals with criminal arrest warrants.“The worst of the worst need to go to Guantánamo Bay,” Homan told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures program. “We’ve had a migrant processing center there for decades … We’re going to expand it a lot.”Noem said that the plan was not to hold people at Guantánamo indefinitely and that the administration would follow US law.“The plan is to have a process that we follow that’s laid out in law and make sure that we’re dealing with these individuals appropriately,” she said. “But it is an asset that we have that we fully intend to utilize.”Noem reiterated that the homeland security department would work with Congress on the facility but gave no other details.‘America’s gulag’: Trump’s Guantánamo ploy tars migrants as terroristsRead moreDemocratic senator Mark Kelly told NBC the decision to expand migrant detention at Guantánamo “just sounds very frightening to a lot of folk”.The administration has not said how much it would cost to expand Guantánamo, which was established in 2002 to detain foreign militants after the September 11 attacks on the United States. Its high-security US prison was criticized in 2023 by a United Nations expert, who said the US government treatment of Guantánamo Bay prisoners was cruel, inhuman and degrading under international law.The base also includes a migrant facility that has been used to detain Haitians and Cubans picked up at sea as they processed their asylum cases during the Clinton administration.Recent Democratic presidents have sought to close the base, which has long been condemned by human rights groups for indefinite detention and reports of abuse and torture. Migrant and refugee advocacy groups have also called on Congress to investigate alleged abuses. Trump, who took office on 20 January, has vowed to keep the aging military base open.Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also received US military approval to detain migrants at other installations, including Buckley space force base in Colorado.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationKristi NoemTrump administrationCubaGuantánamo BayDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The Army Corps of Engineers is surveying and preparing to begin significant salvage operations on Monday to remove the wreckage from the river.The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, toured the morning TV shows and said federal aviation investigators needed space to conduct their inquiry.“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on CNN.The American Airlines flight, with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged to the Potomac River after colliding.The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 US figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.Army staff sgt Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; chief warrant officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt Rebecca M Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter. Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325ft (99 meters), plus or minus 25ft (7.6 meters), when the crash happened, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200ft (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.The discrepancy has yet to be explained.Investigators hope to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.According to an FAA report obtained by the Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9.30pm, once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called “not normal”.“Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,” Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump’s administration would address shortages with “bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace”.Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the US since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashWashington DCAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Should those talks fail,Israelcould resume its offensive in early March.Netanyahu has made a show of portraying the meeting as “a testimony to the strength of our personal friendship”. On Sunday, as he boarded his plane for Washington, he listed a series of familiar talking points, including “victory over Hamas”, reshaping the Middle East and countering the threat posed by Iran.However, the messaging from the White House is that Netanyahu is seen as a junior partner, and the few details that have emerged from Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff’s visit to the region last week suggest Trump is pushing for adherence to a Gaza ceasefire plan that will pose political problems for Netanyahu.Netanyahu will arrive in Washington in the midst of a disruptive new US trade war with Mexico, Canada and China and mounting chaos over the Trump administration’s efforts to downscale and purge sections of the federal government.The New York-basedSoufan Centersaid Trump officials had warned that “renewed fighting in the Middle East would distract the new Trump team from addressing what Trump defines as more pressing priorities”. These include “securing the southern US border from illegal migration and settling the Russia-Ukraine war”, the thinktank said.The uncertainties overshadowing the meeting are being driven by two competing agendas.On Trump’s side is the apparent desire to have quiet in the Middle East to pursue his policy of widening the 2020 Abraham accords – in which Israel established relations with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during his first term – to include Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia has made clear that any progress depends on an end to the conflict in Gaza or the establishment of a path towards Palestinian statehood.On Netanyahu’s side, the objective – according to Israeli officials who briefed the Axios news website – is to understand where Trump stands on the planned start of negotiations for the second phase of a Gaza ceasefire deal, which Netanyahu was reluctantly pushed into by Trump.Those talks are supposed to begin on Monday, the 16th day of phase one of the ceasefire. But it now looks unlikely they will start until after the Trump-Netanyahu meeting, which has been characterised as an attempt to find a joint US-Israeli position going into the talks.Other key issues likely to dominate the meeting are a “day after” plan for Gaza, not least how it will be run and by whom, and what position to take on Iran.Complicating Netanyahu’s position is the fact that he has been facing mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war in Gaza after the end of the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which appears at odds with Trump’s outlook.The Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to quit the government if the war does not restart, potentially stripping Netanyahu of his majority.For its part Hamas, which has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, has said it will not release the hostages slated to go free in the second phase without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.Negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire have already been complicated by Trump’s repeated demand that Egypt and Jordan absorb 1.5 million residents of the Gaza Strip – a demand forcefully rejected by the two countries and other Arab nations including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.In his previous term, Trump handed Netanyahu a series of successes, including relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and thesigning of the Abraham accords.But while the new Trump administration includes several pro-Israel figures expected to endorse expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and resist international pressure over the war in Gaza, Trump’s ambitions appear less focused on Israel than on the Gulf countries.Eldad Shavit, a former intelligence official who worked in the prime minister’s office, said Netanyahu appeared to be balancing pressure from Trump to stick to the ceasefire and domestic opposition to the deal.“He wants to make sure Trump is on his side, but he also wants to make sure his government doesn’t collapse,” he said.Agencies contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza warIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Saudi Arabia has played a leading role in that effort, hosting Syria’s new foreign and defence ministers in early January and a meeting of Syrian, Arab and western officials later that month.Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, was the first head of state to visit the Syrian capital after Assad was ousted in December.The warming ties with Arab leaders represent a major shift away from the situation under Assad, whose brutal crackdown on protests against him in 2011 led to the Arab League suspending Syria’s membership for more than a decade.Saudi Arabia tried to end Assad’s isolation by welcoming him back into the Arab League in 2023, hoping his reintegration would encourage him to address their concerns, chiefly the need to curb thetrade in Captagon, an amphetamine-like drug used in the Gulf by partygoers and labourers alike.Syria had become the region’s main producer of the drug, according to regional security sources, but Assad always denied his government played a role in its production and sale and Arab countries saw little progress to address the issue under him.Syria’s new administration has repeatedly promised to clamp down on the production and trade of the drug.Explore more on these topicsSyriaSaudi ArabiaMohammed bin SalmanMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Here he recalls his first encounters with activismSteve McQueenSun 2 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareMy first encounter with resistance was unbeknownst to me, and I was annoyed by it. At nine years old, I found myself attending Saturday school, missingFootball Focusand not being with my friends playing in the local park. First my sister and I went to the Marcus Garvey Saturday school in Hammersmith. Later we went to the Saturday school in Acton, organised by Mr Carter. He was a light-skinned Black man with slightly ginger hair and freckles, bearing a strange resemblance to Jimmy Carter, who was the president of the United States.The sole purpose of the Saturday school was to help Black children who were underachieving or being failed by the education system. At that time, I didn’t know that these facilities were organised throughout the United Kingdom by Black parents, teachers and academics. In 1971, a London schoolteacher, Bernard Coard, wrote a pamphlet calledHow the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System: The Scandal of the Black Child in Schools in Britain. Although there had been efforts to support Black children prior to this, this was the launching pad for a nationwide and organised act of self-determination.View image in fullscreenOutriders head the Africa Liberation Day rally, Rookery Road, Handsworth, June 1977.Photograph: Vanley BurkeGeorgie was an elderly white woman who taught painting and drawing at the Saturday school in Acton. She wore a blue artists’ smock and had short grey hair and glasses. I still remember her knobbly hands and how she held her pencil, drawing horses with fluid lines. I gravitated towards this, and she took a shine to me. I imitated her and fell in love with drawing. She was strict with her gravelly voice but encouraging. Mr Carter, being more academically minded, would put his head around the door to call me for maths lessons, which I hated.[As a] Black child … you are always alert … a part of your brain is constantly aware of the possibility of an attack, micro-aggressions or whateverMy sister and I were driven there every Saturday in a red Volvo estate by a white guy called Steve who had three daughters, one of whom was Black. There was solidarity and camaraderie, and people helped out wherever they could. This was my first understanding of community and group organisation. The thing about being a Black child and understanding that your environment is not equal is a strange one. You process it in a way that you are always alert, that a part of your brain is constantly aware of the possibility of an attack, micro-aggressions or whatever. You’re not really conscious of it; it’s just part of your makeup, like putting one foot in front of the other.View image in fullscreenA demonstrator is taken away by police as they try to stop fighting between anti-fascists and Oswald Mosley’s blackshirts during the battle of Cable Street in October 1936.Photograph: Associated Press/Eddie Worth/AlamyIt’s only now, looking back 45 years later, that I see certain situations in a more conscious light. By constantly campaigning and organising and demonstrating and resisting a system that failed their children, Black parents and teachers helped to eradicate subnormal schools, which undoubtedly I would have attended if this had not occurred. They liberated all children, Black and white, from being tainted with this ugly brush.My second introduction to resistance was from my neighbour, Milton, who would always post various newspaper cuttings in an envelope with my name on it through our door. These clippings included articles about the miners’ strike and Maurice Bishop, the prime minister of Grenada who had overthrown the previous government in a revolution in 1979. The first time I was introduced to Paul Robeson, the renowned Black American actor, singer and activist, was through a pamphlet from Milton about a memorial service in Wales. I looked at the cover with this Black man’s face and didn’t understand why he was celebrated there. Milton would often ambush me and engage me in conversation across the front garden fence, talking about politics and resistance.View image in fullscreenAnti-racists gather to block the route of a National Front march in New Cross Road, London, August 1977.Photograph: Paul TrevorMilton didn’t have children; he lived on his own. I feel part of his job in some ways was to enlighten me to the realities of our surroundings. I would often try to avoid him, knowing that one conversation could take up to an hour. He was an aeronautical engineer and eventually succumbed to asbestos poisoning due to his working environment. But he left his mark. He was the person who helped me ask the questions who?, how?, why? and what? I still have some of these cherished articles, kept in envelopes.My first demonstration was marching in central London against the introduction of student loans in 1988. I remember the exhilaration of being in the crowd and chantingEDUCATION IS A RIGHT, IS A RIGHT, IS A RIGHT,IS A RIGHT,EDUCATION IS A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE!I was fortunate enough to grow up at a time when education was free for everyone. I know I could not have gone to art school if I had had to pay to attend. My own resistance started with me loving myself. I had to start by seeing myself as brilliant because no one else did, and to have my ability match my ambitions. This might sound like a tall order, but the only direction for me was down. There were police to arrest me, judges to sentence me and prisons to hold me – that was my reality. My only way out at that time was my ability to draw, which flourished under Georgie’s guidance. It is where I felt myself. It’s where I felt challenged, and it’s where I thought I could strive. My resistance was my courage to dare and push my ability. Through art, my interest in history, geography and literature grew in my later teens in a way that they didn’t at school.View image in fullscreenDarcus Howe addressing anti-racist demonstrators in Lewisham, August 1977.Photograph: © Syd SheltonMy good fortune was that my family moved to the suburb of Ealing when I was six years old. There I was surrounded by green space to play and imagine. I remember long summer days with my friends in Lammas Park, lying on my back, smelling the fresh grass and looking at the sky. This environment allowed me to dream.Resistance has been my life, and it continues to be.These words and pictures are extracted fromResistanceby Steve McQueen and Turner Contemporary, edited by Clarrie Wallis and Sarah Harrison, published by Monument Books on 13 February 2025 (£25).

An artistic director leaves a theatre; another steps up or down or sideways to take the position; a third follows. Within months a sweeping change has occurred and the theatrical landscape looks entirely different.Afterthe last spin of the wheel in 2019the crucial changes were immediately evident. They marked the beginning of the end of a particular hegemony: that of the white British male. This time the alterations are inspiriting in a different way. The talent and the zeal, the raring-to-go of the directors taking up new positions, have survived one of the bleakest of arts eras. In lockdown the stage was shredded: the National Theatre in London was wrapped up in barrier tape saying “Missing Live Theatre”; freelance performers, designers and directors were stripped of all income, often forced to leave their professions. In the social distancing that followed, auditoriums looked like crime scenes, with seats sealed off.Meanwhile the arts have slipped off the school curriculum: treated as merely decorative; assumed in the case of theatre to be the domain of kids who go to fee-paying schools equipped with their own stages. When the actor Michael Sheen launched – and funded – the Welsh National Theatrelast month, he talked of a “climate of fear” surrounding funding in the country.Sheen took Laurence Olivier, founder of the National Theatre, as his figurehead. In 2009 another inspirational head of that theatre, Richard Eyre, gave a wonderful account of what it is to be an artistic director in his bookNational Service. Eyre detailed the thrilling, onerous components of the job – the programming, the fundraising, the rows, the bombardment from performers, audiences, writers, designers, engineers – and the emotional toll and excitement the post entails. He did not offer a prescription for success. There is no such thing, any more than there is for a sellout show: who would have predicted thatOedipuswould have people fighting for tickets last year?There are other barriers artistic directors need to bash down. Crossing the threshold of a theatre can be like entering sacred ground – and then being kettledVitality is in difference and independence: it can be fuelled by responding to a particular place and time, or by conjuring up an imaginative, wide-ranging project. It is invigorating to hear Elizabeth Newman’s very particular plans for Sheffield Theatres, which continue the tradition – seen most recently inStanding at the Sky’s Edge– of responding to the city. Actor Alan Cumming, who has just taken over as the self-styled “Pied Piper of Pitlochry”, has yet to announce his programming atthe Highland theatre, but is also looking to give it both local roots and a long reach.Equally,David Byrne’s more general plan for the Royal Court – Starmer-like in its long-termism – has the authoritative sound of a carefully considered vision. And I am betting that Indhu Rubasingham – the woman behind bothThe Wife of WillesdenandThe Father and the Assassin– will make the National Theatre’s three stages distinctive, not allow them to be scaled-down versions of each other: the National is best when, like London, it is a series of interlinked settlements with separate identities. I hope Rubasingham also puts some Kiln-like fire into the cafes.One show may put a theatre on the map – look whatOperation Mincemeatdid for Byrne at theNew Diorama. Yet an artistic director must provide a glimmer of expectation that persists, surrounding a theatre even after a less buoyant – or rotten – production. The Almeida has had that glimmerunder Rupert Goold, who next year takes over the Old Vic. He has generated a sense of necessity – the equivalent of building a library – that is not dependent on any one claim to authority (new writing, musicals, visual flair) but which continually trips you up with surprise: you have to keep attending.The emphasis on ticket prices here is right. It is not only that ridiculously high charges keep people out. Unless audiences feel able to be more casual about theatregoing and take a chance on a new play, new plays will not be programmed. There are other barriers that artistic directors need to bash down. Historically one of these has been the buildings themselves: crossing the threshold has often been like entering sacred ground – and then like being kettled. That is slowly changing: at theredesigned Nationaland atthe Bridge(both taken in hand by the firm ofHaworth Tompkins), spectators are eased from exterior to interior. The West End – and Old Vic – might take note.Meanwhile: let’s also have some bans. On putting versions of movies on to the stage. On jetting in celebrities to suck the energy out of a production. When Sheen was asked if he would be approaching Catherine Zeta-Jones and other Welsh exiles to act in his theatre, he said they would face stiff competition from actors who actually lived in Wales. Hwre!Susannah ClappIndhu Rubasingham: ‘Every audience likes a good story, well told’National Theatre, London SE1; takes up her new post on 1 April“It’s a little mad, but it’s OK,” laughs Indhu Rubasingham, who is still coming to terms with landing the top job in British theatre.It was announced in December 2023 that she would be taking over as artistic director at the National – the first woman and person of colour to be appointed to the role. Previously, Rubasingham was at theKiln theatrein north London, where, in 11 and a half years, she oversaw a major renovation and rebrand while delivering crossover hits such asRed VelvetandThe Father. The biggest difference in her new job – she takes over officially from Rufus Norris in April but has spent the past eight months prepping for it – is scale. “There are about 900 full-time staff and over 1,500 freelancers at the National, compared to a staff of 35 to 40 [at the Kiln],” she says. “But the principles are basically the same.”Rubasingham, 54, grew up in the East Midlands and dreamed of becoming a doctor before falling for theatre in her mid-teens (“I like diagnosing,” she says). She did a drama degree at Hull and made a splash as a director in her 20s, but for a long time felt “utterly intimidated” in a predominantly white industry. Taking charge of an institution was another “really big leap”, and the biggest lesson she took from it was building “resilience at every level: how you keep going, how you programme, how you deal with critics, how you deal with your staff, how you lead… Every moment has been a learning curve.”She’s keeping the details of her vision for the National under wraps until March, but mainly, she says, “it’s to try and appeal to as many people as possible. Audiences like a good story, well told, and that’s true whether you’re at the Kiln or the National.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte Lucas and Adrian Lester in Red Velvet at the Tricycle theatre, directed by Indhu Rubasingham, 2012.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianWho or what first got you into theatre?I did work experience at Nottingham Playhouse when I was 16 and that ignited the bug, being backstage and getting obsessed with it. The same year, I sawThe Normal Heartby Larry Kramer. It was the first contemporary play I’d been taken to see. I didn’t realise theatre could be so relevant and in the moment. The political was really emotional – that was the jolt.Dream person to work with – dead or alive?Alive,Viola Davis, because she’s a powerhouse and has theatre in her bones. I’d love to see her rip up the National Theatre stage. And the person who’s passed away would be [Malian-Burkinabé actor]Sotigui Kouyaté. He was one of Peter Brook’s actors, an amazing presence.What’s the hardest part of your job?Finding enough time.What can’t you live without at work?Comfortable shoes. There’s a lot of walking to be done at the National. I had boots on yesterday and my feet were knackered! Everyone is telling me to look after myself, to not get burned out. I’m still trying to work out how. I could give you an answer – regular massages, peppermint tea instead of caffeine – but it wouldn’t be true.David Byrne: ‘Anything is possible if you plan enough for it’Royal Court, London SW1;in the job since January 2024“I see this as a 10-year project,” David Byrne says of his new job at the Royal Court, adding, with no small degree of ambition: “I see it as 10 years to fundamentally change the culture of playwriting in this country.”Byrne, 41, took over from Vicky Featherstone last January, leaving behindNew Diorama, the theatre he founded 10 years earlier. His tenure there, in a small building near Regent’s Park, was distinguished by a risk-taking approach and several successful transfers, includingOperation Mincemeat. “We also did a big lockdown project where we built 25 rehearsal rooms in the City and gave them away free for a year,” says Byrne. At New Diorama, he learned “that anything is possible if you plan enough for it, with the right team behind you – and I think I brought some of that energy with me here”.His first year at the Royal Court backs him up. He began with an adaptation of Maggie Nelson’sBluets, making extensive use of screens and live cameras, and struck gold with Mark Rosenblatt’sGiant, starring John Lithgow as Roald Dahl, which tackled antisemitism andtransfers to the West End in April. His team launched an initiative calledthe Writers’ Card“to bring together the playwriting community to work out how we best support writers”, and has speeded up the response time for open submissions. “There is [an unsolicited] script sitting on my desk as we talk. We had the writer in last week who was absolutely stunned to hear from us.”When he speaks about transforming the UK’s playwriting culture, Byrne acknowledges that “people might think I’m going power mad. But ultimately, we are at risk of a very censorious artistic culture where writers feel unable to take risks and theatres are afraid of taking those bigger swings. And I think, historically, when the Royal Court has been brave, it has made the entire culture braver.”View image in fullscreenGiant, starring John Lithgow (in blue) as Roald Dahl, at the Royal Court in 2024, part of David Byrne’s first season.Photograph: Manuel HarlanWhat three words sum up your theatre?Provocative, contemporary and dissonant.What are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Open-heartedness: the worst thing in theatre is to come across as hard to please – you’ve got to want to celebrate the work of others. Curiosity: you’ve got to be always wanting to find the new, and always interested in what’s coming up in the culture. And the ability to create space: in a time of polarisation, where there are a lot of conflicting views, you’ve got to be able to allow space for equilibrium and for working together.Dream person to work with – dead or alive?I’ve been reading about Lilian Baylis, who was at the Old Vic and who, among her eccentric behaviour, used to cook sausages in an oven she put into the wings… I was thinking: however irritating I must be sometimes, at least I’ve never sprayed fat on the props table. So I think she’d have been quite fun to work with, if only to get my eccentricities in context.What can’t you live without at work?I’ve eaten a huge amount of fruit pastilles this year. I don’t know why. I don’t drink, really, and I don’t smoke or do drugs. But I’ve had a real hunger for fruit pastilles. I think it’s partly about stress relief. (I say I don’t drink: I have actually started drinking since taking up this job.)Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatregoing type.I think it’s OK not to enjoy going to the theatre. I come from a family who don’t enjoy it, and me working in theatre has not convinced them otherwise. I think it is fundamentally part of the human experience, coming together to experience stuff, but I don’t necessarily think it’s for everybody, and that’s all right. There are other forms of culture which are equally enriching.Are ticket prices too high?I think it depends on which ticket prices. At the Court we’re still very cheap. Over half of our tickets downstairs last year were £22.50 or lower – that’s really affordable – but obviously elsewhere they are more expensive. I still think there are affordable tickets out there for people wanting to go and see shows.Elizabeth Newman: ‘It’s like being a vicar. I’m in service to this city’Sheffield Theatres;in post since December 2024Elizabeth Newman has only just moved to Sheffield when we speak and hasn’t yet started her new job atSheffield Theatres, but already she’s fizzing with ideas. Within minutes, the 38-year-old is brainstorming a play about an ice-creamery she has just visited, and another about the city’s workers banding together to set up Sheffield University. “For me, being an artistic director is being a public servant, or a vicar,” she says. “I’m in service to this city. It’s about how we share its story with the world.”For the previous six and a half years, Newman was in charge of thePitlochry Festival theatre, where she was known for her community engagement as well as the work she brought to the stage – including her own award-winning production of Brian Friel’sFaith Healer. Before that, she was artistic director of Bolton’s Octagon theatre, and over her career she has directed more than 100 productions around the UK. It’s all the more impressive given that, aged 13 and growing up in Croydon, she developed a neurological condition that left her unable to move from the neck down. She gave up her dream of becoming a ballet dancer and switched to directing, training at Rose Bruford College while relearning how to walk.At Sheffield Theatres – which comprises the Playhouse, the Crucible, the Lyceum and now the Montgomery – Newman wants to create a supportive environment so that actors and others can be free to take risks. She acknowledges how difficult the climate is for UK theatres at the moment but says that it’s an artistic director’s job to weather it. “That is the job – you face the challenge,” she says.“It’s a bit like learning how to walk again. You can either sit down and go ‘Oh, well, I’ve been told it’s not possible.’ Or you can go ‘I’m going to give it a bloody good try, and use all of myself to do it.’ Our role as artistic directors is to have vision, to lead the vision, to inspire people to achieve things that they never thought were possible.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Costigan in Faith Healer, directed by Elizabeth Newman, at the Pitlochry Festival theatre, 2019.Photograph: Douglas McBrideWhat are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Empathy, the ability to hold many things at once, and a deep love of place and people.What’s your favourite theatre in the world (not your own)?The National Theatre. It serves the nation, because it’s new and old. I decided I wanted to be a director for two reasons. The first was seeingAngels in Americaon the telly, which changed my life. The other thing was, at 17, school took us to see the revival ofSimon McBurney’sMeasure for Measureat the National, and three people made a helicopter land on stage just by moving their arms and bodies. I was just thinking, this is amazing, and it was mixed together with the most beautiful language and extraordinary acting. After that, the National became the place that I felt really welcome because of what Nick Hytner did with the Travelex £10 tickets, so I could afford to go as I got older. I saw all these amazing things that I could only dream of.What can’t you live without at work?Diet Coke and a bag of salt and vinegar crisps.Amit Sharma: ‘We can’t shy away from the political issues we’re facing’The Kiln, London NW6;in post since December 2023For Amit Sharma, a key part of his job as artistic director ofthe Kiln, which he took over in December 2023 from Indhu Rubasingham, is embracing complexity. “The best type of theatre isn’t saying ‘We’re in this one camp’. Actually, it’s exploring all the camps,” he says. “We’re living in such a complex world and we can’t shy away from all the political issues we’re facing.”Sharma, who was previously the Kiln’s associate director, is also acutely aware of his audiences and their needs. “We serve a local community,” he says. “The current audience is really diverse, it’s reflective of London and the international flavour of people that live here, and our ticket prices have to reflect the local audiences – and through community engagement we’re trying to bring in that next generation [of actors and theatre-makers].”Born in India and raised in Southall, west London, Sharma fell in love with theatre at school and worked as an actor for 10 years before the strain of touring – he has a physical impairment – prompted him to switch to directing. He worked atGraeae, Manchester Royal Exchange and Birmingham Rep before joining the Kiln.Getting the top job left him “speechless”, Sharma says, and he feels the pressure to match up. “On a personal level, because so few disabled people have been in these positions, I feel it’s really important to go ‘Disabled peoplecando this job equally if not better than their non-disabled counterparts.’ I’ve got a point to prove – not just for myself but for the next generation.”View image in fullscreenGraeae’s Cosmic Scallies at the Edinburgh international festival fringe, 2017, directed by Amit Sharma.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/the GuardianWhat’s the hardest part of your job?[Finding] family time.What can’t you live without at work?Sense of humour. If you ask people, sometimes they’ll say the sense of humour wasn’t needed, but I just put it in, because we’re not doctors or whatever, we’re making theatre. We should really just chill out a bit.Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatregoing type.Do you like stories? Do you like stories being told to you live? Then theatre is for you, because that’s essentially what it’s about.Are ticket prices too high?It’s so hard, because making theatre is expensive, right? So some of [the high pricing] is for good reasons. But it has to be accessible. I grew up on a council estate, and if I didn’t have the under-26 offers or whatever, I wouldn’t have been able to engage. And then it does become elitist. So it’s for us to strive to make theatre prices accessible by working harder to get people who might have a bit more money to support those that can’t access theatre like they can.Kate Wasserberg: ‘It’s been like coming home’Theatr Clwyd, Mold, Flintshire;in post since September 2024If having faith in Wales and its creative talent was a key requirement forTheatr Clwyd’s board when appointing their new artistic director, they found the ideal candidate in Kate Wasserberg. The 44-year-old from Stafford “fell hook, line and sinker for Wales” when she first worked at the Flintshire theatre in 2007, rising to associate director underTerry Hands. She went on to set upthe Other Room theatrein Cardiff, run new writing company Stockroom and direct James Graham’sBoys from the Blackstuff, but returning to Mold for her “dream job” has felt “in every way like coming home”.Beyond its theatrical offerings, one of the things Wasserberg loves about Theatr Clwyd is its work with communities. She aims to create a world-class workplace for her staff, with on-site counselling services, and has conducted a review of freelancer pay, adding up all the time and effort it takes to make a show. “As a result, freelancer fees have gone right up.”Covering these costs “will means that we make slightly fewer shows,” she says. The theatre is also diversifying. When Clwyd’s brand-new premises open this summer, at the cost of £50m, there will be event spaces and a restaurant in partnership with chef Bryn Williams. “So they all help [financially]. They are all part of the picture.”Wasserberg sees UK theatre as “an incredible community that is hanging on by its fingernails… People often say ‘Theatre or the NHS?’ But if you’re running a programme for at-risk children where you’re engaging with them using the arts, you might be part of the picture that reduces the burden on the NHS. So I think theatre is doing its bit.”View image in fullscreenBoys from the Blackstuff, directed by Kate Wasserberg, at the Royal Court, Liverpool, 2023.Photograph: Jason Roberts photographyWhat are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Candour, empathy and curiosity.Dream person to work with – dead or alive?I would make a musical with Joni Mitchell.

Sometimes, you love the work but it’s just not right for your building.Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatregoing type.Have a night out and let us tell you a brilliant story. You’ll feel better. I really do think that. In an increasingly atomised society, people are genuinely craving those moments of togetherness and community.Nadia Fall: ‘Theatre is the greatest deep therapy you’ll get’Young Vic, London SE1; in post since January“It is a bloody privilege to do it,” says Nadia Fall, who takes over from Kwame Kwei-Armah as artistic director at theYoung Victhis month, “but it is your life, seven days a week, and it does become who you are. The theatre becomes as much your family as your real family.” That, she thinks, is why there’s been an exodus of artistic directors from British theatres lately. “It takes some stamina, and lots of people, once they’ve done one stint, they don’t want to do another. Also, post-Brexit and Covid, it’s more full-on than it ever was.”Fall, who grew up in south London not far from the Young Vic, as well as in the Middle East, took up her first artistic director position at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 2017 and had a terrific run, putting on varied productions such as August Wilson’sKing Hedley II, which she directed, and an Olivier-winning version of Britten’sNoye’s Fluddewith the ENO featuring local schoolchildren. “I absolutely loved it,” she says of her seven-and-a-half-year tenure, but Covid struck midway through “and I don’t think things have been the same since. It’s costing more and more to make a show, and we’re getting less and less [money]. And loads of talented people have left the industry because it wasn’t viable.”Nonetheless, she’s thrilled to be starting at the Young Vic. “It’s got a similar spirit to Stratford East: it’s still a bit of a mischievous child. It likes stories that provoke and ask questions. What’s exciting to me artistically is that the audiences really want to be challenged there.”View image in fullscreenKibong Tanji in The Sun, the Moon and the Stars, directed by Nadia Fall, at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, 2021.Photograph: The Other RichardWhat three words sum up your theatre?Rebellious, global, event.What one show should we come and see there?James Graham’sPunch.

There’s nothing she can’t do, and I can’t believe we haven’t worked together. We must correct that. If you put it in the paper she’ll feel guilty and she’ll have to do it.What’s your favourite theatre in the world (not your own)?Epidaurus outside Athens. It’s thousands of years old, and you can imagine people thousands of years ago sitting there watching the ancient plays. We tookPhèdrewith Helen Mirrenthere when I was an associate at the National and there were howling wolves and bats flying across the set. It was a proper spiritual experience. It’s electric.What’s the hardest part of your job?I always wish I could give birth to time.Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatregoing type.It’s like saying you don’t like music. You just need the right song for the right mood that fits you. People who say that just haven’t found their jam yet, just need to be matchmade with the right show. And do you know what? It’s the cheapest form of group therapy that you’ll ever get. It sounds a bit frivolous to say that, but it’s actually proven.Life is hard: the climate catastrophe is unfolding, there’s war blazing around the globe, and it’s really tough for people – and where do we congregate? We congregate in a theatre and we practise the act of empathy by watching plays. And that is group therapy. That’s what the Greeks got their citizens to do, to practise the act of empathy. Put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Physiologically, our bodies change when we’re watching a play. Our heartbeats sync with the actors on stage, with each other. That stuff is real. So I think it’s good for your health.Nathan Powell: ‘The rehearsal room is my happy place’Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse; in post full-time since December 2024It takes several tries to pin Nathan Powell down for an interview. That’s because, although he started part-time as creative director atLiverpool’s Everyman and Playhouse theatresin August, he’s been dashing around fulfilling prior commitments, directingThe Mountaintopat Curve in Leicester and thenAlice in Wonderlandat Shakespeare North.When we finally speak, the London-born writer-director tells me that for many years, his “bread and butter has been in community arts or working with young people”. He moved to Liverpool seven years ago to work with youth theatre company20 Stories Highand stayed to start a family, though freelance gigs have taken him all over the country. One of his concerns at Everyman and Playhouse is making the spaces accessible to all. “I haven’t always felt comfortable in theatres,” says Powell, “and I think that’s cultural.” But he believes attitudes are shifting. “It feels like theatres want to be more open spaces that when I was younger.”Unlike others here, Powell’s title is creative director rather than artistic director. The differences, he says, are fairly minimal. “It’s partly about broadening the scope of who could apply. They were very specific that you didn’t need that sort of artistic background [as a writer or director] to be in the role.” There’s less of an emphasis on staging work himself and more on facilitating others. To this end, Powell is keen to programme shows that are about or by local people while making room for risk-taking. His first season opens in April with his own playTakeaway, about a family-run Caribbean shop during riots in Liverpool, and also includes an experimental piece by Wirral-born playwright Billie Collins entitledThe Walrus Has a Right to Adventure.View image in fullscreenRay Strasser-King and Justina Kehinde in The Mountaintop at the Curve, Leicester, 2024, directed by Nathan Powell.Photograph: Ellie KurttzWhat are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Kindness, patience and a thick skin.Who or what first got you into theatre?I remember my auntie took me, my sister and our cousins to seeThe Lion Kingin the West End when we were really little. I don’t actually remember the show very much, I just remember being wowed and like, “Oh my gosh, this is insane.” I didn’t expect to walk into such an inconspicuous building and see all of this on stage.Best production you’ve seenrecently?I Am Steven Gerrardat the Liverpool Royal Court. I remember being in the audience with lots of people that thought they were coming to see a show about Steven Gerrard, who were all very excited, and then one of the first lines of the play is something like, “I fucking hate Jürgen Klopp,” and the whole audience gasped. [It was a] story in beautiful verse about this young man trying to find his identity because he couldn’t care less about football, and the audience were with him the whole way through. It was a beautiful piece of theatre.What can’t you live without at work?Laughter and silliness. The rehearsal room is my happy place. I’m not much of an “organised fun” person, but that’s the only place where I like organised fun, which is really just having a place where we can just laugh and enjoy what we’re doing.Are ticket prices too high?What surveys of ticket prices often leave off are regional theatres – the focus is on the West End. We work pretty hard to make sure that our ticket prices stay accessible. If you’re under 26 you can sign up toYEP[the theatres’ free youth membership programme] to get £5 tickets. But of course, it’s still a barrier to lots of people, isn’t it? All of your tickets could be £5, and still some people might decide they don’t want to spend that £5 – they’ve got lots of other things to pay for and everything is very expensive.Interviews by Killian FoxExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe ObserverNational TheatreRoyal Court theatreSheffield TheatresKiln theatreTheatr ClwydYoung VicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Waiving her right to anonymity, the 72-year-old made her ordeal public so that, in her words, “shame must change sides”. For nearly 10 years, her husband of 50 years Dominique had invited dozens of men via an online site (now closed) to rape her while she lay comatose in bed in their home near Avignon. Each time, he had sedated her with a mix of anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills slipped into her food and glasses of wine. He filmed the rapes and stored the videos neatly in his computer under the title “abuse”.Dominique Pelicot may never have been arrested had it not been for the perseverance of supermarket security guards who noticed him making upskirt videos of female shoppers. They convinced three of them to file a complaint to the police in September 2020. A young police officer then seized Pelicot’s computer and electronic equipment to investigate further. Police technicians unearthed more than 20,000 pornographic videos and pictures documenting his crimes against his wife. In just a few weeks, the police established that Gisèle Pelicot had been raped at least 200 times, the equivalent of once a fortnight for almost 10 years. Convinced that she was in mortal danger because of the repeated sedation, they worked night and day until they could gather enough evidence and arrest Dominique Pelicot. On 2 November 2020, Gisèle accompanied her husband to the police station in Carpentras, near where they lived. He had admitted to upskirting and had cried for her forgiveness. While police officers dealt with her husband (he would never walk free again), Gisèle Pelicot was invited into a room by the young investigative officer, who started revealing the torture she had endured unknowingly. She now understood why she had suffered from severe memory losses, fainting and gynaecological problemss. She did not have Alzheimer’s, as she had feared.Caroline sets herself a mission: she ‘won’t let her father’s perversity become this family’s curse’Gisèle and Dominique Pelicot have three children, David, Caroline and Florian. They were the next to be informed of their father’s crimes, after their mother . Caroline Darian’sIWill Never Call Him Dad Againstarts then and runs for 13 months after finding out her father’s crimes. It offers a compelling perspective on what sexual abuse does to a family, its far-reaching repercussions within it, and how victims cope and can fight back. It is a story of resilience, lucidity and courage, told with force and aptly served by the brisk translation of Stephen Brown.“I bear a crushing double burden: I am the child of both the victim and her tormentor,” writes Darian in the preface written a few days before the trial began. “For four years now, I’ve been trying to find a new way to exist.” One way she has coped has been to raise awareness about chemical submission. “Everyone has heard of GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate), the ‘date-rape drug’, but who is aware of the risk of being chemically subjugated by a spouse, lover, relative or friend with the contents of the family medicine cabinet?” she asks. A French study found that in 56% of chemical submission cases, the perpetrator used an over-the-counter medicine: antihistamines, anti-anxiety medication, sleeping pills and cough medicines, all “prized by abusers for their sedative and muscle-relaxing properties.”However, it took her some months to find the cause that would give Darian’s life a new meaning. While her mother, this “medieval queen”, whose dignity and magnanimity has so awed the world, insisted on remembering all the past’s good moments, Darian chose never to forgive or forget what the man who raised her inflicted on them all.View image in fullscreenCaroline Darian: ‘Crime will not infect us, will not be transmitted from generation to generation.’Photograph: Olivier RollerHer world sunk even deeper when the officer in charge of the investigation showed Darian pictures of her sleeping in her underwear. At first, she didn’t recognise herself, then she fainted. “How did he manage to take my photo in the middle of night without waking me up? Where did the underwear come from, as I’m sure it’s not mine? Did he drug me? Go beyond the photos? Did he – I can’t keep the unthinkable at bay – abuse me?” As more evidence piled up Darian became convinced that her father had drugged and raped her too, a crime he always denied.As she and her brothers helped their mother pack her things as quickly as possible from the family home, they found files full of unpaid bills and outstanding debts hidden away in plastic folders. “The debts are huge … Substantial loans were taken out, almost all of them in Mum’s name.” Betrayed, tortured and bankrupted by her husband of 50 years.After packing her entire life in a few boxes, Pelicot went first to live with Darian and her husband and six-year-old son. Soon after, Darian found herself in a psychiatric ward, where she was given a treatment used for schizophrenia. The idea of being drugged and sedated was intolerable for her. “I want out. I know I need help, but I don’t need this.” Darian starts writing a diary as a means of therapy. “It provides distance, helping to keep me from drowning.” She also sets herself a mission: she “won’t let her father’s perversity become this family’s curse.” She addresses him in her diary: “Crime will not infect us, will not be transmitted from generation to generation. None of us will be like you – not my son, not my brothers. We are all stronger than you were. You made no attempt to extract yourself from the mud your father wallowed in. He was a piece of work – tall, intimidating, had nothing but contempt for women, and seized every opportunity to put them down.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has danced leading roles in all the great classical ballets includingSwan LakeandThe Sleeping Beauty, has performed in works by Kenneth MacMillan and Frederick Ashton, and created many new ballets, particularly those by Christopher Wheeldon, who cast her as Alice in his three-actAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and as Hermione inThe Winter’s Tale. She has recently become principal guest artist at the Royal Ballet and is taking a teaching diploma. She lives in west London with her boyfriend and their two daughters, aged four and two.You’re about to make your debut asTatianainJohn Cranko’sOnegin, based on Pushkin’s classic verse-novel. How are you feeling?It’s a funny sensation making such a significant debut so late in my career: it made me feel quite vulnerable, but also it was very thrilling. It’s been a lovely journey but it’s surprisingly physical. I did my first run through on stage at an 11am rehearsal and when I went to tear up Onegin’s letter at the end [as Tatiana sends him away], I had no strength in my arms. I hadn’t anticipated that. Mind you, an early call is always weird – it’s hard to eat properly. You might have a bit of breakfast, but suddenly you finish the rehearsal, and it’s 2pm. You can’t eat a sandwich in the middle of a three-act ballet.Do you do background reading as well as just learning the steps?I’ve been completely consumed with it. I bought a first edition of the Pushkin and then another copy from Waterstones that could get ruined in my handbag. Tatiana is an amazing character.You can’t plan your life because who knows what opportunities there are out thereShe ages on stage from a young girl to a mature woman. Every ballerina is always the wrong age for some of it…There are some ballets where I think about age, but if you feel you can transmit the essence of the character, that transcends age. And yet I’m not doingRomeo and Julietthis season, not because I don’t love it, but because I felt it might be someone else’s opportunity now. I feel genuinely fulfilled.And inAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland, you’ve stopped playing Alice and now play the wickedRed Queen?Oh,that was a trip! You don’t know if it’s good until you’ve got an audience and they laugh. It had been such a whirlwindcreating Alicewhen I was younger and coming back to it and being the Queen was like flipping a coin. I thoroughly loved all eight shows, apart from the performance when I went to collect the plate of tarts – and there were no tarts! I wanted the stage to open up. I had to carry on. But I was as cross as the Red Queen could be.View image in fullscreenWith William Bracewell in Swan Lake at the Royal Opera House, 2020.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDancers, like sports people, know their career ends young. How do you navigate that knowledge?You can’t plan your life because who knows what opportunities there are out there. My daughter Peggy doesn’t want me to stop dancing. But I don’t see gradually stopping performing as a sad thing, perhaps because I am still dancing. There’s a saying that dancers die twice, the first time when they stop dancing. But if you look at it with the glass half full, it means dancers get two lives.Why did you decide to take a teaching diploma at theRoyal Ballet School?I felt like I needed some foundations. I might not be a teacher my whole life, but I think in some capacity I might be a coach. I didn’t want to miss out that step in terms of the classwork and the pedagogy of learning. As dancers, you don’t ever get to really learn for the sake of learning. We don’t go to university. I had my contract with theRoyal Balletwhen I was 17. So now, I wanted just to learn things.You’re one of the few female principals who have children. How do you manage that?When I met Matt, my boyfriend, I got pregnant quite quickly. It completely changed my life – my children are lovely. I have a Norland nanny [trained at the prestigious Norland College], and I have benefited from that peace of mind. But sometimes at weekends I’ll take a child with me to work. I love the fact that my daughters will grow up understanding the theatre. And I always try to make sure they understand everything that goes on behind the scenes as opposed to just focusing on the ballet.How would you feel if the girls wanted to dance?If they want to, then that’s fine, but if they want to retire when they’re seven, that’s even better. They do love doing ballet but perhaps that’s because they see me doing it. They’ve both got some artistic qualities, but maybe I’m just imagining that!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Apparently on my first lesson it was like watching a duck take to water. I just never looked back. It was never a question of, “do you still want to do it?” It was always just, what’s next? It felt like my destiny. I’ve been on stage since the age of four.Do you think the ballet world has changed since you started?There’s definitely a focus on the whole person now. There is a lot of support for any sort of issues that you might be having and people around who can spot them as they arise. It feels like a safe space. Also, individuals and individuality are celebrated. And the more that happens, the more ballet will broaden.Is thereanythingyou think you would’ve liked to do if you weren’t a dancer?When I was at school, you had to write down the things you would want to be if you weren’t a dancer and I wrote: interior designer, tennis player, detective. Matt and I share a passion for interior design, and we’ve done a couple of projects together. Would I do it full time?

That’s howRob Autondescribes his life’s work – half- (or less) jokingly – in his new hour The Eyes Open and Shut Show. So whatishe doing? At points tonight, the Yorkshireman self-identifies as a comedian, and as a poet. You might throw in philosopher too, or indeed aphorist – with reference to the pithy principles Auton hews from his inquiry into life and how to live it, and which, fashioned into homespun artworks, he touts as merch at the end of the show.If that sounds like a commercial instinct at play – well, I think the 42-year-old can be forgiven a rearguard effort to make his eccentric brand of performance pay. Tonight’s set takes as its soft focus the subject of eyes. What’s the difference between whale-watching and whale-seeing? If we sneezed with our eyes open, would they pop out of our head? And “can you imagine if you loved blinking?” Auton worries away at these half-banal, half-profound inquiries, sends up his own kooky interest in them, and gets meta on the jokes he constructs thereof. The upshot is a meandering monologue piloted by Auton’s curiosity about graveyards, the teachings of Eckhart Tolle, or the key to Mick Jagger’s success.It may be stronger on sideways observation and wonderment (“I’m always trying to bring my life to life”), but it’s not without laughs: I relished his account of how acquiring a telescope gave him the confidence to talk to bus drivers. And there are satisfying callbacks and circularities that give Auton’s ruminations a semblance of structure. At points, you might find the material too (faux?) naive for its own good, or that Auton’s sentimentality isn’t quite sufficient as a substitute for big laughs. But the show reeled me in, with the freshness of our host’s way of seeing and being. Then won me over in its heartfelt final moments, which comprise a hymn to the preciousness of life, for all that it’s never quite as good as you want it to be.Rob Auton is at the Glee Club, Birmingham, on Wednesday, then touring.Explore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

That said, the wildly uneven wedding clash comedyYou’re Cordially Invitedis certainly in the vicinity of terrible on numerous occasions. Ferrell plays Jim, the smothering, widowed dad of Jenni (Geraldine Viswanathan); Witherspoon is Margot, the overprotective older sister of Neve, played by Meredith Hagner. When, due to an administrative snafu, Jenni’s and Neve’s weddings are double booked at the same venue, Jim and Margot are determined that their loved ones will still get their day to remember, no matter the cost to the rival party or to personal dignity. Wedding catastrophe cliches abound (cakes, hair and frocks take the brunt of the physical comedy).

After breakfast, spending 45 minutes washing up, then 90 minutes doingsamu(work): chopping, shredding and peeling vegetables as preparation for the rest of the day’s meals.I briefly contemplated asking the taxi to turn around. But my former therapist,Manu Bazzano, a Zen priest, had invited me to join him on the retreat, which he was leading. The two of us have had conversations about Zen published on mySubstackpages, but I had never dived in and walked the walk, so to speak – I had only talked the talk. I didn’t want Manu to think I was faint-hearted about his vocation. So I had accepted, but not because I had a particular outcome in mind (though I was certainly curious about Zen). I went because of Manu himself. With his shaved head, warm, wide smile and perpetually amused eyes, he has the sort of magnetism that can drag you out of your comfort zone.Since signing up for the retreat, I had begun to suffer painful bouts of depression, for which I could not identify a trigger. So, as it turned out, what began as an act of simple curiosity had ended up with a more urgent purpose – to bring me out of my low mood and stop the cycle of self-punishing thoughts.Getting lost on our daily walks was a metaphor for my state of mindDepression affects yourcognitive abilities. I had a difficult time getting the ritual aspects of the retreat correct. There was much bowing, recitation of chants and ritual parading, as well as prayers of gratitude for each meal we sat down to. I couldn’t get the bowing right. There was a lot of it – to your cushion, to the altar, to one another, to the teacher – and I couldn’t quite remember who to bow to and when. Also, after each session of meditation – there were six half-hour sessions a day – we were instructed to walk very slowly around the room, then very fast, always as a single body. I became impatient at the fast part and started to try to force the pace by jogging, for which I was gently reprimanded. And my breathing was too loud. I know this because the man next to me told me so, several times.During the long hours of meditation, I covertly studied the at-rest expressions of those on the cushions opposite me; I sensed that there was a lot of pain in the room. Silence was suspended during the afternoon Dharma talks (Dharmais simply the teachings of the Buddha), during which Manu told tales of a Buddhist monk, Dogen, who travelled from Japan to China to learn about Zen. Dogen founded the school of Soto,a down-to-earth version of Buddhism, which can otherwise be a very esoteric creed. Dogen insisted that chores and ordinary life were as important as zazen, hence the samu.Afterwards, we shared our own stories. People often fell to weeping as they talked of the traumas that had drawn them to the retreat. One complained of his own arrogance, another of the guilt he felt about the way he had brought up his children. Still another spoke of how he hated the bowing part of the retreat, as he felt that it made him subservient.After our silent lunch, we went on collective walks, during which we were allowed to talk. There was a mixture of both men and women, many under 30, with many professionals, including lawyers, civil servants and therapists. The relief of the daily walks was compromised by the fact that I kept being separated from the group and getting lost – a suitable metaphor for my state of mind. On the first two occasions this was simply embarrassing, but on the third day, along with a man and woman, both about my age (late 60s), we separated from the group during a walk to a local lake. It was getting dark and the mist was coming in. We could have rejoined the group, but the man – an ex-policeman, as it turned out, as well as a seasoned hillwalker – announced he knew the way back.Twenty minutes later, the dark and the mist coming in fast, we appeared to be completely lost. We were stuck on boggy, difficult terrain. The woman kept falling over and seemed in danger of breaking an ankle. It was at this point I realised how far I was from achieving a state of Zen calm, at least judging from the invective that was coming out of my mouth aimed towards our putative navigator.With about 30 minutes of daylight left (we had no torches and no signal on our phones), our guide stumbled across a path, which eventually led back to safety. By the time we got back to thezendo(meditation hall)I had calmed down, ready to practisebutoh,originally an avant-garde dance that focused on existential despair.Prior to the retreat, I had seen aYouTube videoaboutbutoh in which a naked man covered in white chalk performed a series of agonising contortions. After my own despairing experience on the moors, I felt well primed for the practice.Manu’s version was less dramatic. We were simply asked to walk from one side of the zendo to the other, very slowly, in pairs. One of us was the observer, the other the participant. We were invited to imagine a rope through the middle of our bodies on which we were pinioned. Then the observer was told to touch the participant on various parts of the body as they walked. The participant had to react, in any way they felt right. This usually involved contortions and awkward positions that sometimes sent people ignominiously tumbling on to their backs. Whenever I was touched by my partner, my limbs twisted and bent in all directions.As Manu put it, ‘The accomplished Zen practitioner is on his way to becoming a complete idiot’The butoh was repeated the next day, during which half of us were asked to walk in tiny steps towards the other half (who observed, as an audience). Then we walked backwards, very slowly. As we retreated, we were required to visualise the past spread out in front of us and the future hidden behind us. This exercise was oddly powerful, not least because I realised how much of the past, as well as the future, was hidden. Given the flaws in memory and its radical selectiveness, it was like gazing through tiny pinholes at a landscapefar too vast to ever take in.After the butoh we did some group dancing to rock music – Lou Reed and David Bowie. This was to relax us and get us moving, after the stillness of zazen. I found this awkward – I am a rotten dancer – but more fun than I expected. Then there was “dreamwork”, which simply involved people recounting their dreams. The idea was not analysis, but to see if any common patterns emerged that linked the dreams. And there were, rather as you would expect, worries about loss and getting lost. This didn’t seem particularly enlightening to me.At the end of the week,I found myself with one overwhelming question. What is the point of Zen? It’s not about self-improvement. It’s not about achieving anything. It’s not about mindfulness. It’s about sitting there. As Manu puts it in one of his essays, “The accomplished Zen practitioner is on his way to becoming a complete idiot. For it takes an idiot to commit to Dharma practice – a practice that has no purpose and offers no gain.” The goal of Dharma practice is liberation from the painful illusions of everyday life. As one Chinese Zen teacher, Lin Chi, remarked, his job was to “beat the ghosts out of you”.By the time we said goodbye, with lots of hugs and sincere farewells, I remained puzzled about Zen practice. There aren’t really any words to describe it, which is inconvenient for a writer. But the experience was both positive and grounding. The life anxiety I was suffering before I attended had evaporated by the time I departed.I am far from being liberated. But if and when I do fully understand this strange, seemingly inexplicable practice – and I have continued it, faithfully, performing an hour of zazen every day – I will perhaps have awakened, and no longer want to shout obscenities at bewildered ex-policemen. One can only bow respectfully to the Buddha and dedicate oneself to that slender hope.Tim Lott and Manu Bazzano present 15-Minute Philosophy attimlott.substack.comExplore more on these topicsMeditationSelf and wellbeingHealth & wellbeingPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It expanded to a nationwide network of 10,000 groups and Slimming World magazine became a referral option for NHS GPs.She based Slimming World’s headquarters in Somercotes, also in Derbyshire, where today it employs about 400 people.Speaking about its foundation in 2009, Miles-Bramwell said: “There was a little bit of help around at the time for slimmers. But I suppose that sort of help, group therapy help, had only been around for a few years then.“So my dream was to have a club that really did help people achieve what they wanted to do, achieve their dreams – not my dream, their dreams. So my dream was to have a slimming club that was light years ahead of anything else that was around at the time.”Miles-Bramwell died on Sunday morning at her home in Mallorca, surrounded by family, Slimming World said. It paid tribute to a “a much-loved mum, grandmother and great-grandmother”.The company’s managing director, Lisa Salmon, said: “Margaret steered her ship in the way she lived her life – with a generous spirit, passionate conviction, a wicked (and rebellious!) sense of humour and a fierce belief in doing the right thing. Our job now is to continue to keep her legacy alive by doing the very same thing.”Miles-Bramwell was born to an unmarried nurse in London in 1948 and was adopted by a couple in South Normanton, Derbyshire. She wrote in her autobiography, Wild Women Do, that they shunned her when she became pregnant as a teenager.She was awarded an OBE in 2009 for services to the health of the British public.As well as founding Slimming World, she owned the boat-building company Pearl Yachts and a Mallorca entertainment venue, Son Amar.She is survived by her children from her first husband, Roy Miles, a daughter, Claire, and two sons, Dominic and Benjamin. Her second husband, Tony Whittaker, died in 2021.Explore more on these topicsDiets and dietingDerbyshireEnglandMagazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Saltburn is classed as a town, but it feels more like a village, and it’s getting more interesting all the time, with new places to eat and get coffee,” says Daisy.Back then, the décor couldn’t have been more different; think authentic Victorian with lots of William Morris wallpaper. “It felt soulful and homely from the start, though,” recalls Daisy, while Neil adds: “With all its Victorian features, it was like a blank canvas with character and that has made it easier and more exciting to do. Our main idea was that the interiors should be fun.”View image in fullscreen‘Our main idea was that the interiors should be fun’: bold, colourful artworks sit alongside the Selfridges-yellow staircase.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The ObserverThe couple started with the kitchen, which was looking distinctly battered. They turned to Daisy’s step-mum, Natalie Fry, who has her own interior design showroom,Grid Thirteen, in Leeds. “It felt really good to be able to delegate such a big chunk of this project to Natalie, knowing that she got us and our style and would handle the whole thing,” says Neil.Despite their colourful, offbeat taste, the couple opted for the simplest of kitchens, to serve as a gallery-like backdrop, complete with display shelves for their ever-expanding collections. The cabinetry is matt-lacquered in a carefully chosen “lotus white” from SieMatic, neither warm nor cool in tone, for maximum versatility. A quartz-wrapped kitchen island has had its veining painstakingly aligned so that it appears to flow, waterfall style, from the horizontal countertop to the vertical side panel. “It’s timeless and easy on the eye,” says Daisy.View image in fullscreen‘Timeless and easy on the eye:’ The more minimalist kitchen, with quartz-wrapped island and Wedgewood blue ceiling.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The ObserverTo play off all the white, the ceiling has been painted a breezy Wedgwood blue, while the hall and kitchen floors have been covered in graphic black-and-white rubber tiles, with the original Victorian tiling carefully preserved underneath. “We might change it in the future, but it’s warm and perfect for Solo’s early years,” says Daisy.The same sense of warmth and comfort permeates the two living rooms, one more family-friendly, the other a more grownup space. Both have deep-grey walls with a matching carpet for a colour-blocking effect, while the ceilings are variously crimson red and Germolene pink. “When you have high ceilings, there’s something comforting about creating a darker room,” says Neil. “I get stressed out seeing white ceilings, why do people not do something interesting with them?”View image in fullscreen‘When you have high ceilings, there’s something comforting about creating a darker room’: the more ‘grownup’ living space with its vivid, crimson red ceiling.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The ObserverUpstairs, the couple’s bedroom suite is a calmer mix of soft white, moody grey and drunk-tank pink. Solo’s room is full of vintage toys, from a Palitoy treehouse to Daisy’s collection of Ty Beanie Babies. But opinions are divided on whether Solo can play with the highly collectible “toys” that feature throughout the rest of the house, in particular, the couple’s collection of Japanese Bearbrick figures. “No, he cannot,” says Neil in the most emphatic of tones, while Daisy quietly adds that she lets Solo play with them when Neil is away for work.“I got introduced to Bearbrick through their many collaborations with artists and designers,” says Neil. “They’re very pop art and once you start exploring what they’re all about, you can never have enough. We love the childlike nature of them, they’re like toys for adults and each one brings us a bit of joy.” Similarly, Supreme skateboard decks are displayed as artworks around the house (“We’re not skaters, but they’re an affordable way to buy into the artists we love”) and the pop art also extends to branding – “I’m a sucker for McDonald’s iconography,I could have a whole room dedicated to it,” says Neil.View image in fullscreenDream space: Neil and Daisy’s bedroom, skateboard-deck artworks and a Kartell Bourgie lamp beside the bed.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The ObserverFurniture favourites include pieces by Kartell and Seletti, both Italian designer brands with a seriously playful streak. “We love the way Kartell uses traditional furniture shapes in modern materials, like its plastic Bourgie lamp, which we have by the bed.” Seletti’s distinctive black-and-white Cut ’N Paste collection can be seen throughout the house, from mirrors to ceiling lights, to wall shelves.The house is constantly changing and evolving, with plans for a dining room extension, and Daisy rearranging the space whenever the mood strikes. “We’re both creative, flamboyant people,” says Neil, “and we always want the house to feel like us.” says Neil.Explore more on these topicsInteriorsThe ObserverHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trousers, let alone ski pants, were not really a thing for so much of human existence that we have developed some sort of resistance. I’ve worked out that my body is OK in shorts to about -10C. This could also come from my Scandinavian heritage.As with many things, I could also just blame my mom. She had this snooty Hyacinth Bucket vision of me as some sort of prince in waiting and would send me in a blazer, tie and shorts to my normal primary school, even in the snow. Because, hey kids, people still used to go to school in the snow!What is weird is that the winter sports football and rugby are played in shorts. The summer sport, cricket? Trousers.catchytitledA neighbour of ours used to wear shorts all year round. My wife remarked that he must be very hardy. I disagreed, because I had visited his flat and it was like a sauna; the only time we saw him go outside was to walk to and from his massive car, which presumably had a good heating system. It’s not as if he was working outside in all weathers or even doing outdoor sports.JohnIIt seems to be compulsory for postal workers. A popular combination seems to be a heavy anorak, with hood, and shorts. Could it be that wet trousers would be an encumbrance when frequently getting in and out of a van? Wouldn’t waterproof trousers cure that? A mystery.seedysolipsistSkin dries quickly; wet fabric doesn’t – and makes you feel colder. I have postie friends. The waterproofs aren’t the best.MisterVimezIn the winter of 1962/63, in primary school in Yorkshire, with compulsory play outside, the milk in the school bottles froze inside the classroom; the cream would push the tops off. There was one stove at the front of the classroom (next to the teacher). Seating was alphabetical, beginning at the front; my surname begins with a W, so I was sat at the back, where the milk was kept. We used to drink it through a straw when it had defrosted. Near ice-cold milk through a straw would hit the roof of your mouth and give you a headache that could send waves of pain right around your skull. The teachers would insist you drank your milk quickly (agony) before you were forced outside to “play” (taking it outside was forbidden in case you broke the bottle).If it rained or snowed, we had a sort of brick barn to shelter in, but one side was open to the elements. The playground and the barn had a cobbled surface. I know it reads likethe Four Yorkshiremen sketch, but it’s totally true. Teachers stayed inside in a warm staff room.I don’t wear shorts in winter, but today where I live (400 metres from the beach in Brittany) it is 6C outside and wet and windy. I’ve just been outside to get firewood wearing trousers and a short-sleeved T-shirt. A bit nippy, but OK if you are moving about (I’m 68). Maybe that Yorkshire school experience helped, or maybe it was child cruelty; personally, I think it was the latter. Geordies would probably be wearing shorts and no T-shirts here, or bikinis. You can spot the British tourists at Christmas – they are the ones who wear shorts …jetemmerdeBeing a person of a certain age, I was more than 13 years old before my mother would permit me to wear long trousers. Only a few of my classmates wore long trousers before me. Snow was the least of my worries! I hated heavy rain, because my school trenchcoat came down to the back of my knees and it rubbed against my legs and caused chafe marks, which were miserably painful. Grey flannels were wonderful in comparison, once I was allowed to wear them. Mind you, I had to wear shorts after school until I was 15, because denims were not permitted by my mother.BigAlHereMost people in northerly latitudes suffer fromvitamin D deficiencyin the darker months. Feeling the need to wear shorts, or indeed short sleeves, is possibly an instinctive response to maximise the skin’s exposure to natural light.upnorthkidFive ways to avoid a vitamin D deficiency in the dark of winterRead moreI sometimes wear shorts in the winter, usually with boots. Honestly, the main thing is keeping head, core and feet warm.oldguynewuserIt’s pretty simple: if the top half is warm enough, the bottom half is usually pretty happy just in shorts, especially if you are being active. Insight gained from years tramping in the mountains of New Zealand.JonahsWailIn my town, it has seemed to be the way for many years that young men exhibit their masculinity by going out in just a T-shirt and shorts in freezing weather: hands stuffed in pockets, pretending not to be cold. It is a bizarre spectacle. I wonder if it goes on in other towns.foolishboyEnglish winters are very mild. Still, seeing a man in shorts stomping over the dirty roadside snow towards the bus stop this morning made me cringe. I am from a much colder country originally and I know cold can kill.

This month is viewed as galaxy season in the northern hemisphere, offering the chance to see the Andromeda galaxy, our nearest galactic neighbour, just 2.5m light years away, with the naked eye.Cambrian MountainsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyWhere better to see it than the Cambrian Mountains, stretching from Snowdonia to the Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons), with nine official Dark Sky Discovery Sites, an International Dark Sky Park and an astro-tourism trail. In daylight the views are breathtaking, but once the sun goes down it is the vast vista above that inspires. The trail can be completed over a few nights and stargazers can glimpse Orion, the Great Plough and the North Star. During my nocturnal walk, the cloudy vein of the Milky Way poured down from the heavens along with Pleiades, a cluster of bright young stars in the constellation of Taurus. Their presence is far more visible during the winter months in the northern hemisphere, despite being 440 light years from Earth.Darkness is measured by the Bortle scale, with 1 being the darkest skies on earth, generally found in remote deserts or the Arctic, and 9 the most light-polluted areas, typically the centre of vast, seething cityscapes. Hitting around number 2 on the scale, the Cambrian Mountains, with no human-made pollution, enjoy some of the darkest skies in Europe and make the perfect location to tune out of the noise of daily life and tune into the cosmos.The Hafod Hotel, next to the famous waterfalls at Devils Bridge and on the edge of the Cambrian Mountains, is the ideal jumping-off point to discover the astro trail.

Meze £7, large dishes £15-£21.95, desserts £6-£9, wines from £23Some restaurants are just a nice place to go for dinner. Yemen Heaven in York is obviously that. You will eat well there. The black seeded flatbreads, the breadth of over-sized dinner plates, are soft and crisp. There’s a pleasing creaminess to the spice-dusted, oil-dribbled, tahini-rich hummus that comes topped with a single shiny black olive, the savoury equivalent of a cherry on top. But the restaurant is more than that. Much likeArabic Flavourin Aberystwyth, which I visited last year, it is both the story of exile and an act of memory. It is the product of one woman’s determination to maintain her family’s traditions; to free the country of her birth from a single narrative of war and hardship, however overwhelming that narrative might seem right now.Muna Al-Maflehi was born in Taiz, a brown stone city in the highlands of southwestern Yemen, known before the current civil war for its quality coffee production and for the abundant citrus fields with which it is surrounded. When she was seven, Muna moved with her family to Saudi Arabia, where her father taught her the dishes his father had cooked for him. It was a way of keeping alive a connection to the country and culture they had left behind. In 2013, looking for a better life, she moved with her five children to live near Salzburg. There she started her first food-delivery business before, in 2017, following close relatives to York.The plan was always to open a restaurant, but it’s never easy; harder still for those who are newly arrived. It began with a couple of well-received pop-ups in the city from 2019 onwards, but like so many projects it was delayed by Covid. Eventually, they found an old pub, the Spread Eagle on Walmgate, in need of custodians and love. The wood-panelling and parquet are still there, and so is the bar, though beaten copper teapots now stand upon it. Otherwise, the space has been carefully papered and polished, and rubber plants strategically placed. According to the blackboard on the pavement by the front door, there is now a “secret Mediterranean garden” for smoking shisha out back.View image in fullscreen‘It is just a plate of chicken and rice, but it is the best chicken and rice’: chicken mandi.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverShortly before they were due to open, at the end of 2021, the newly decorated restaurant was broken into and ripped apart byvandalswho splattered the walls with paint. “It was like a bomb had just hit it,” Muna told theYork Pressat the time, despairingly. “It was like being in the war in Yemen. I couldn’t believe that this had happened in the UK.” But the community wanted the restaurant. A crowdfunder was launched. More than £21,000 was raised. Yemen Heaven opened and it remains very much a family affair. It was her daughter Zay who wrote me an email spun through with gentle pride about her mother’s achievements. It was her son Moe who served us, guiding us through the menu to the Yemeni specialities. Because there is a lot here that will look familiar: hummus andbaba ganoush,fattoush,tabboulehandfalafel, a quintet of those Middle Eastern bangers. Try them by all means. But as ever, it makes more sense to order the things you don’t recognise.View image in fullscreen‘An unapologetic chilli heat’: hummus and bisbas’.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverTo go with the oven-hot flat bread, we get a bowl of bisbas, a sharp vinegary dip of blended tomatoes, coriander and garlic with an unapologetic chilli heat that comes in a few moments after you’ve nodded appreciatively at the freshness and vibrancy of the rest of it. Try the spicy shafoot which, by comparison, isn’t very. It’s a salad of cucumber and finely sliced radish, the green of a woodland clearing in spring, mixed in with pieces of crustless wholemeal bread that have soaked up the spiced mint yoghurt dressing. Pomegranate seeds and a sprinkle of sumac shine out from amid the additional layers of rocket and baby chard.View image in fullscreen‘Soft and crisp’: homemade flatbreads.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverIt is very hard not to like Yemen Heaven; just the idea of it, the very bones of it. The temptation with such a place is to hype it as some gastronomic temple, where a kind of kitchen alchemy turns humble ingredients into something highborn. There is indeed a form of alchemy at play here, but it is not that. It is more about comfort and care; a feeling of being properly looked after with cooking that draws on the domestic. Chickenmandiis an exotic name for something very simple. It’s a quarter piece of chicken on the bone with a timbale of rice. That long grain has the buttery separation familiar from the region. But the wonder is the chicken that looks roasted, but instead has been slow-cooked, so that it’s now falling apart. Usually, a bird like this is cotton-wool dry and cloying; this is anything but and the aromatics have penetrated every fibre. It is just a plate of chicken and rice, but it is the best chicken and rice.View image in fullscreen‘The green of a woodland clearing in spring’: spicy shafoot salad.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverThere is something similar at play with the fah’sa, which is a lamb stew. There is nothing else to it other than shredded lamb and a deep, generous broth, fragrant with fenugreek. It is delivered to the table in a Yemeni stone pot, which is so hot that the broth is boiling fiercely on arrival. Think of it as the floor show. It tastes as you hope every meaty broth will, but too often doesn’t. It tastes of long cooking; of the lamb giving its all to the liquor in which it swims. It is the kind of dish that you know will improve a day, from bad to good, or from good to better.View image in fullscreen‘Creamy’: um Ali.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverThere is a short wine list, which is three versions of “Would you like red or white?”, all priced in the mid-20s and then, at £55, a bottle of Lebanon’s Chateau Musar described as “Moe’s Wine Pick”. He’s got taste, that boy. Desserts are for those who like their sweet things very sweet indeed. Um Ali (or “Ali’s mother”) is a creamy pudding of coconut and nuts, topped with the green of pistachio and the pink of dried rose petals. Areeka is a darker, spiced bread pudding mashed together with dates and sesame oil. They are the light and dark versions of each other, and are both served so hot we have to sit and observe them for a while before digging in. At the end, we are brought glass beakers of sweet, milky Yemeni tea, heavy with black cardamom. It is very cold out there in York tonight, but like everything else at Yemen Heaven, the tea will see us right.News bitesRejoice! The long wait is over. After two decades, the motorway services operator Welcome Break is opening a new outpost. Welcome Break Rotherham, which has created 230 jobs, is located at junction 33 of the M1 and includes concessions from Pret a Manger, Burger King, KFC and Chopstix. And all of this inside a site which has been designed to look like a Yorkshire village. They spoil us, they really do (welcomebreak.co.uk).The Caribbean-inspired restaurant brand Turtle Bay has announced it is going upmarket with an ‘elevated dining concept’ boasting a menu of ‘refined’ dishes drawing on the culture of the islands alongside ‘warm and welcoming venue design’, all of which honours ‘the roots of being a joyful and carefree place to connect with people’. The new Turtle Bay is being trialled at a branch in Chelmsford, which is currently shut until March while it undergoes an ‘inspired transformation that will see the restaurant elevated entirely from its current standing’. And so on (turtlebay.co.uk).Husband and wife team Luke and Stacey Sherwood French have finally opened the much-delayed new version of their umlaut-rich Sheffield restaurant JÖRO. The original was located in a shipping container on Kelham Island; this is very much a bricks and mortar affair at the city’s Oughtibridge Paper Mill development. It will serve both an express £45 tasting menu and much longer versions priced at £125. There are seven rooms up above as well as space for SHÖP by JÖRO, selling various deli products and store cupboard staples – although there is no sign of the word ‘grocerant’ to describe this part of the business, first floated when the move was announced in 2022 (jororestaurant.co.uk).Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Instagram@jayrayner1Explore more on these topicsMiddle Eastern food and drinkJay Rayner on restaurantsRestaurants (Food)FoodRestaurants (Travel)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Marcus and Shawna felt lucky that a friend was able to offer them a guesthouse for six months in Corona del Mar, almost 50 miles from their former home.They said their overwhelming feeling now was of uncertainty as they faced the reality of loss and dislocation from the fires.View image in fullscreenMarcus Beer said visiting his old street felt like a graveyard.Photograph: Marcus Beer/Guardian CommunityMarcus, a 54-year-old video games consultant, said he had been disgusted to receive cold calls from companies trying to buy their land in Altadena. The stress is compounded by the fact that Marcus has stage 4 prostate cancer. He said chest pains forced him to attend the ER, where medical professionals said he was exhausted, stressed and had inhaled too many fumes, adding to a sense of disorientation.Paul Kewley, a 54-year-old British expat and feature film animation producer who had been renting a house on Lachman Lane in Pacific Palisades with his wife and teenage son, said his neighbourhood was “a scene of utter devastation”.“The fires ravaged the area we lived in but our house remains standing,” he said. “Next door has burned down, as have many houses above and below that.”View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of homes destroyed in the Palisades fire.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesAs the family has found shelter at a friend’s house in the LA neighbourhood of Westchester for a few weeks, Kewley said the full scale of the fallout from this catastrophe was still coming into focus.They had been given conflicting advice, he said, about whether to take the first rental property offered to them or apply more caution in order not to fall victim torampant rent inflation.“My best friend bought [a house] in the Palisades and lost everything. We won’t be able to return to ours. Everything inside smells of smoke, much will have to be thrown away,” he said. “The long-term financial consequences are most likely to be felt as we attempt to find a new home, as so many others. In their desperation, people are paying way over asking prices, price gouging is everywhere.“The most traumatic thing, however, is losing our community. We’ve talked about leaving the city, and whether we’d want to live in the area again. We love this city, and our son wants to stay, but there’s just so many unknowns.”Ed Stokes, 80, a retired radio broadcaster, was at a doctor’s appointment downtown when his wife was told to rapidly leave the couple’s Pacific Palisades condo, a second home they spend parts of the year in to be closer to their children and grandchildren.“My wife witnessed dramatic, apocalyptic scenes,” Stokes said. “People evacuating got stuck in traffic, panicked as the fire came closer, abandoned their cars and ran. Bulldozers then had to manhandle these cars off the road, to let the firefighters through. Parents ran up the hill to pull their children out of Calvary Christian elementary school, then fled downhill again carrying them. It was horrendous.”The couple checked into a hotel with only their passports, toothbrushes and their most important medications. “For three days, we watched our homes and community on fire,” Stokes said. “My son’s home, where he is raising his children, burned down, it’s all gone. Our condominium is structurally intact but access is still restricted, I’ve seen pictures of it on YouTube. We have not yet been allowed in to assess smoke damage. We’re in shock, but among the fortunate.”View image in fullscreenA sign in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, informing people that tap water in the area is unsafe to consume due to possible contamination after the wildfires.Photograph: Simon de Veer/Guardian CommunityStokes and his wife left the city and are staying with family in Montana with no plans to return yet, while many of their LA friends and neighbours are scattered in various other places. “One friend who lived in the Palisades all his life has lost everything, and it’s a similar story with another friend,” Stokes said. “Some are now in the desert, some are up in the mountains, they’ve all gone wherever they could find some sort of refuge. The community is devastated.”Simon de Veer, a personal trainer in his 40s who primarily served clients in Pacific Palisades, was among many who struggled to predict how they were going to be affected by the fires.“At least 10 people I know have lost their homes,” he said. “[Monday] was my first day back [at work] since the Palisades fire broke out. I commuted into the burned area to train with clients whose home has survived.” De Veer spent a week evacuating family and friends from other fires in LA, while most of his customers were displaced. Some of his clients ended up staying at his house, and at one point he was bedridden for 24 hours due to smoke inhalation.View image in fullscreenGraffiti in Los Angeles expressing gratitude for firefighters who have been battling the flames.Photograph: Simon de Veer/Guardian Community“We’re coming together, but no one really knows what we’re doing besides that,” he said. “Until the fires, there was this thrust of gardeners, nannies, cleaners and so on who commuted into the Palisades from other parts of the city. There’s a guy who used to have a taco truck there. I don’t know what he will do next.“I don’t know what I’m going to do, I’m unsure if I’ll be able to bring my training business back to what it was. Many of my clients are leaving for an unknown amount of time. Food is still expensive, I have a daughter. I have been working on a new business [in real estate] to make myself a bit more resilient.”De Veer said about 80% of his clients had either lost their home or lived in an area they would not want to return to due to the scale of the devastation.“It hurts, but most of us are committed to rebuilding,” said De Veer, whose wife is a casting director. “I will not abandon my clients, the people who have believed in me and my little fitness classes for so long. I genuinely care about them all. I have no idea what [my life] will look like in a year’s time, I just want to bring the city back.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaLos AngelesWest CoastWildfiresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an often-heard sentiment these days, but is it really true? Historical comparisons are of limited help.Last week’s 80th anniversary of theliberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenauconcentration camp, where 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were murdered by the Nazis between 1940 and 1945, offered a grim reminder of how indescribably brutal life can be when war reigns unchecked. Could things get any worse?The latest readings from the “Doomsday Clock”, which notionally measures proximity to global catastrophe, suggest they could. A panel of international scientists saysthe clockis now at 89 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been to the theoretical point of annihilation.The reasons are familiar: the risk of nuclear war, climate change, pandemics, disinformation, new technologies. The point is, such threats are poorly managed – and are growing inexorably.Perceptions that the world is spinning out of controlare heightened by environmental and health disasters like the recent Los Angeles wildfires,drought in the Saheland outbreaks of ebola and other lethal, infectious diseases.The disruptive, destructive behaviour of governments also plays a central destabilising role, through their growing tendency to flout the UN Charter, international borders, basic human rights and the International Criminal Court.When the US president, traditionally the foremost guardian of the post-1945 rules-based order, threatens, unprovoked, to militarily attack a west European ally to seize its sovereign territory, little wonder everyone feels more insecure. Yet that is exactly what Donald Trump is doing in trying to bully Denmark intosurrendering Greenland. Trump’s near neighbours in Panama, Mexico, Colombia and Canada face similar intimidation.The independent, non-profit organisation known asAcled(Armed Conflict Location & Event Data) compiles information and analysis to help track and reduce violent conflict.It estimates global conflict has doubled over the past five years, that incidents of political violence in 2024 were 25% up on 2023, and that one in eight people worldwide were exposed to conflict. By these measures, the belief that the world is becoming more dangerous is thoroughly justified.While some wars, such as Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine, rightly receive huge media attention, they are exceptions. Most current conflicts, whether they involve wars and invasions in Sudan and Congo, gross human rights abuses inAfghanistanand Tibet, gang warfare in Haiti and Colombia, mass starvation in Yemen and Somalia, or political repression in Nicaragua, Belarus and Serbia, are under-reported, forgotten or ignored.Developing conflicts, such as China-Taiwan and Iran-US-Israel, require closer attention.Taken together, they present a terrifying picture of a world addicted to war.Snapshots of a world at warView image in fullscreenLeader of Alliance Fleuve Congo, Corneille Nangaa, waves as he joins the clean-up of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo after the city’s seizure by the M23 rebel group.Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPACongo-RwandaA long-festering conflict along the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hitglobal headlinesafter the city of Goma was captured by a rebel group known as M23. Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, is accused by the UN of arming and directing M23, and sending troops across the border, which he denies.The area, though generally poor, is rich in metallic ore such as coltan that contains minerals much in demand in the west. Thousands have been displaced in the fighting amid sexual violence and a looming public health emergency.This sudden crisis prompted a UN security council meeting, at which the UK and France condemned Rwanda’s behaviour. The US says it supports the DRC’s sovereignty. Germany has suspended aid talks with Kigali. But this may have little effect. One problem is the EU signed astrategic minerals dealwith Rwanda last year, even though it knows some minerals are smuggled from Congo. Another is that Britain’s previous government lauded Kagame as a model African leader when it wanted somewhere to send asylum-seekers. More broadly, conflictin and around the DRChas continued, on and off, for decades. Millions have died. When this latest crisis subsides, it will probably be left to fester again.MyanmarThe past year saw growing armed resistance to themilitary juntathat overthrew the elected government of Nobel peace prizewinnerAung San Suu Kyiin 2021. In response, the generals are resorting to whatHuman Rights Watchcalls “scorched earth” tactics. These include indiscriminate airstrikes against civilians, murder, rape, torture and arson “amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity”.The UN says Myanmar is in “free-fall”; 20 million people will need help in 2025, yet humanitarian aid is often blocked. Involuntary conscription of young adults and children is enforced using abductions and detention.Aung San Suu Kyi remains under arrest, one of 21,000 political prisoners. Muslim minorityRohingyacivilians continue to be targeted in Rakhine state.View image in fullscreenResidents of Kyauk Ni Maw village in the west of Myanmar after an airstrike by the ruling military.Photograph: APThe wider context of Myanmar’s nightmare is the lamentable failure of its neighbours, grouped in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to take effective action against the junta, and China’s connivance in and tolerance for its many abuses.Russia supplies the junta’s weapons. And the west, having imposed sanctions, mostly looks on. Now the generals, hoping somehow to legitimise their position, are talking aboutholding electionsthis year. Any poll is likely to be the focus of intensifying violence – and an obscene mockery of the democratic process.HaitiDescribed as the poorest country in the western hemisphere, Haiti has a reputation for ungovernability. A series of US-backedinternational interventionshas failed to achieve longterm stability.The country was effectively occupied by the US from 1915 to 1934. In Washington’s last big intervention, Bill Clinton sent 20,000 troops in 1994 to restore order. Any improvement was temporary. UN missions have also come and gone. Haiti’s latest descent into chaos followed the assassination in 2021 of its last elected president, Jovenel Moïse. Ubiquitous armed gangs, living off violence, extortion and kidnappings, rule the roost. Analysts say Haiti is now a failed state.View image in fullscreenArmoured vehicles patrol Port-au-Prince in Haiti.Photograph: Johnson Sabin/EPAThe most recent outside attempt to help the interim government regain control – a “multinational security support mission” led by Kenyan troops – is under-funded and struggling after a spate of gang massacres killed more than 350 people. These horrors included a Christmas Eve attack on the country’s largest hospital.More than 5,300 people were killed last year while 700,000 are displaced, according to US media. Nearly five million people – half the population – face food insecurity. Yet Haiti’s misery continues largely unremarked. Trump’s threatened foreign aid cuts will hit very hard here.Ethiopia-SomaliaEthiopia’s standing as a poster child for international aid and development efforts has undergone sharp re-evaluation in recent years, coinciding with the rise to power in 2018 of its prime minister, Abiy Ahmed.There has still been no full, public accounting for Abiy’s devastating military campaign in northern Tigray province that ended with a truce in November, 2022. The conflict became notorious forgross human rights violationsby all sides, but principally by Ethiopian government and allied Eritrean forces.View image in fullscreenInternal refugees uprooted by the war between Ethiopian federal forces and Tigrayan rebels unload aid in Tigray.Photograph: Michele Spatari/AFP/Getty ImagesThese abuses reportedly continue. Abiy’s rule has been marked by democratic backsliding, including internet shutdowns and media censorship, and by tensions with neighbouringSomaliaover sea access via Somaliland.Concern now surrounds Ethiopia’s Amhara region, where escalating repression and large-scale arrests of government opponents are occurring amid ongoing conflict with armed groups.Amnesty Internationalsays the world is turning a blind eye: “The international silence over the mass and arbitrary detention of thousands of people in Amhara region is beyond shameful.” It called on Ethiopia’s development partners to demand a return to “the rule of law”. The worry is that, like Tigray in 2020, Amhara could explode into all-out secessionist rebellion in 2025.IranIran’s theocratic regime took a severe beating in 2024, coming off worse in direct clashes with Israel and looking on helplessly as key regional allies in Lebanon, Palestine andSyriawere degraded, toppled and killed.The regime also faces multiple domestic challenges, not least from a restive, youthful urban population increasingly enraged by official corruption, repressive violence and incompetence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or will all-out war with Israel come first?Mindless repression, particularly of women, is a regime trademark which could prove its undoing. The imposition of a death sentence on Pakhshan Azizi, a Kurdish-Iranian civic activist, on trumped-up charges of “armed rebellion against the state” has prompted aninternational campaignto save her. Azizi’s case follows the death in custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini, accused of violating Islamicdress codes.Her murder, which prompted the “Woman Life Freedom” revolt, reflects a long, disgraceful history of persecution by misogynistic mullahs – persecution which continues in 2025. Many other men and women face the death penalty. Overall, Iranexecutedmore than 900 people last year, the UN says.Syria-TurkeyWearing a western-style lounge suit in preference to combat fatigues,Ahmed al-Sharaa, leader of the Islamist rebel group that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December, was named transitional president of Syria. In a series of sweeping changes, an appointed legislative council replaced the former parliament and all armed groups were told to disband and join a new national army. For those who hope Syria will become a “normal” country, it sounded positive. But democratic elections are three or four years away, Sharaa says, and a lot could go wrong.View image in fullscreenAn oilfield burns in northeast Syria after a Turkish airstrike.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesWhile welcoming Assad’s overthrow, the US, EU and Gulf states have beenslow to take concrete stepsto help, such as lifting sanctions and releasing funds. About 6.7 million vulnerable people need urgent assistance, the UN says. Health services, schools and housing are inadequate. Much of the countryside is seeded with landmines.Meanwhile, Syria’s internal security situation remains fraught amid a national quest for justice,revenge killings, limited targeting of religious minorities and clashes between Syrian Kurdish forces and Turkish proxies along the northern border, where652,000 people are newly displaced. Syria’s rebirth could be stillborn in 2025. Without better international engagement and support, war may yet return.SudanMedia commentators like to refer to the security and humanitarian catastrophe that is present-day Sudan as a “forgotten” conflict. The truth is worse. It’s not forgotten. It’s ignored, and mostly has been since mayhem erupted in 2023.Millions have been displaced and hundreds of thousands face famine conditions as a result of a struggle for control between Sudan’s army and renegade paramilitary forces, known as the RSF. The latter are accused of genocide in western Darfur region through the targeting of non-Arab communities, wherekilling and sexual violence are rife.View image in fullscreenSoldiers celebrate the liberation of an oil refinery in Sudan.Photograph: El Tayeb Siddig/ReutersInternational neglect of Sudan may slowly be coming to an end in 2025. Karim Khan, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has said he wouldseek the arrestof those suspected of committing war crimes and other atrocities in Darfur – assuming they can be caught.In a sense, history is repeating itself. In 2003 Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes perpetrated by Janjaweed militia, forerunners of the RSF. Halting the wider war throughout Sudan is more challenging still.Crisis Groupis calling on outside mediators to redouble efforts to agree a ceasefire. At present, that prospect looks remote.Afghanistan-PakistanAmerica’sabandonmentof Afghanistan to Taliban extremists in 2021 was shameful – and politically costly. Former president Joe Biden’s domestic approval ratings plunged and never recovered. But the biggest losers were Afghan women and girls, who were again subjected to harshly interpreted Islamist rules denying them personalfreedoms, the right to education and meaningful careers.Last week the International Criminal Court took steps to remedy that abuse, announcing it wouldseek the arrestof senior Taliban leaders Haibatullah Akhundzada and Abdul Hakim Haqqani for the crime against humanity of persecution on grounds of gender – a global first.View image in fullscreenA Taliban guard watches as Afghan men wait to receive winter aid packages.Photograph: Sanaullah Seiam/AFP/Getty ImagesAfghanistan’s overall stability is in doubt as 2025 opens, with the misgoverned country mired in poverty and prey to outside extremist factions such as Islamic State Khorasan Province.Neighbouring Pakistan also looks deeply unstable following a year ofpolitical upheavalthat left popular former prime minister Imran Khan in jail and an army-backed politician, Shehbaz Sharif, in charge.Analystssay 2024 brought rising levels of violent militancy involving Baloch separatists and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. “The contentious domestic political situation will likely create more opportunities for militants to make gains by exploiting local angerin 2025,”Acled warns.YemenYemen has been called the world’s worst humanitarian emergency, and perhaps it still is, despite the mounting horrors in Sudan. But since the 7 October 2023 Hamas assault on Israel, global attention has shifted away from Yemen’s domestic crisis and on to its Houthi rebels. Their missile attacks on western shipping in the Red Sea, and on Israel, in support of the people of Gaza, provoked military reprisals by the US, the UK and others.View image in fullscreenA giant fire after Israeli airstrikes on the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida in Yemen.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesFollowing the ceasefire in Gaza, Houthi shipping attacks have largely ceased. But the wider civil war continues to causehuge problems, with about 150,000 people killed and 18 million facing food shortages. UN special envoyHans Grundberg told the UNsecurity council in January that regional stability depended in part on ending the conflict in Yemen, where the war against a Saudi-backed government-in-exile has raged since 2015. Necessary first steps were a nationwide ceasefire, the release of detainees, new focus on repairing ports and economic and financial infrastructure, and the launching of an inclusive political process, Grundberg said. Two-thirds of Yemen’s food is imported and 90% of medical supplies. The need is great. But as in the past, political will may be lacking.Mexico-USAs if Mexico did not already have enough problems, US president Donald Trump’s militarisation of the US-Mexico border, and his puerile demand that the Gulf of Mexico be re-named the Gulf of America, are bound to make them worse.“Trump’s revival of his punitive immigration playbook will overwhelm Mexico’s overburdened state, sandbag regional economic growth and enrich criminal cartels,” the US Council on Foreign Relationswarned last week– rendering both countries less safe and less wealthy.View image in fullscreenUS marines patrol the border in California with Mexico.Photograph: US Marine Corps/EPATrump’s anti-migrant “Remain in Mexico” policy could critically destabilise the country, just as its newly elected president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is pledging a fresh start.Sheinbaum’s biggest domestic challenge iswarring gangsters. “[Her] election took place against a backdrop of emerging and intensifying gang disputes, evidenced by an 18% increase in lethal clashes between non-state armed groups compared to 2023,” Acled said.Sheinbaum pledged to address the social causes of cartel-related violence – a policy dubbed “hugs not bullets” – but recently took a tougher line, sending thousands of troops to violence-riven Sinaloa state. Trump should be helping. Instead, as usual, he ismaking the situation worse.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThe ObserverDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaMyanmarHaitiEthiopiaSomaliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The order is still being implemented, but in the days since, the state department’s Foreign Service Institutesuspended accessto thousands of pages of training materials related to DEIA, and the Internal Revenue Servicedeleted any mentionof the words “diversity”, “equity” and “inclusion” from its procedural handbook, including from anodyne passages on taxes and finance.The most immediate impact of the order was on the employees who had worked on the programs and were ordered put on leave – even if they had already moved on to different jobs.“This is not comparable to anything we have seen in decades,” said Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. Though the order does not appear to have affected his union’s members, several non-members have made contact about organizing since it was handed down.“In any recent administration, even Trump’s first administration, we did not see civil servants be taken out in this kind of manner. This is unprecedented and, frankly, a scary action being taken,” Erwin said.Those swept up by the order defended their work, saying they helped the civil service become more representative of America’s diverse population.“You want to really build trust and make sure these agencies are able to reflect the communities that they’re working with,” said an employee put on leave by Trump’s order. Speaking on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation, they said they worry the broad firings will undermine the ability of their agency to do its job.“The role of the government employees is to be that unwavering force through administration changes. We are supposed to be the constant and to continue that continuity of services for people,” they said.“Obviously, a new administration comes in, visions change, but to just kind of track us down like this, it feels very retaliatory.”The purge of civil servants who worked on DEIA initiatives comes as theTrump administrationmoves to dramatically shrink the federal workforce writ large, using tactics unusual for its bureaucratic culture.The president put Elon Musk in charge of what he is calling the “department of government efficiency”, an effort to downsize the federal government that the multibillionaire Tesla CEOhas saidwill involve “mass head-count reductions”. That effort appeared to begin in earnest this week, when the office of personnel management (OPM), which functions as the government’s human resources department, offered deferred resignations to much of its 3 million-strong workforce, and said employees who accepted would get paid for eight months and wouldn’t have to work – an unheard-of deal for civil servants.For former staffers of DEIA programs, the Trump administration simply ordered them out. The OPM’s acting director, Charles Ezell, told agency heads anyone who worked on such programs up to 5 November – the day of the presidential election that Trump won – should be targeted.The OPM also circulated an email template for federal employees that encouraged them to report colleagues who were continuing to do DEIA-related work. “These programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination,” the message read.Jenny Mattingley, vice-president of government affairs at the Partnership for Public Service, which advocates for civil servants, acknowledged that reassigning employees is a new administration’s prerogative, but objected to Trump’s blanket approach.“Each administration has priorities around various policy issues, and DEI is one of those,” Mattingley said.“What is concerning is holding non-partisan career employees accountable for implementing the policy choices of the last administration, which is the role they play in every administration, including this current one.”Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees National, the largest federal union, said the DEIA ban undermines programs that had shown results.“Over half of the 642,000 veterans serving in our federal government have service-connected disabilities. One important role diversity, equity and inclusion programs perform is ensuring the workplace is welcoming and accessible to these veterans so a diverse workforce can harness its collective strengths to better serve the public. Eliminating these programs will unfairly harm veterans wearing their second uniform in service of their country,” Kelley said.“Ultimately, these attacks on DEIA are just a smokescreen for firing civil servants, undermining the apolitical civil service and turning the federal government into an army of yes men loyal only to the president, not the constitution.”Those put on leave await a reduction in force, the procedure for letting federal employees go.“There’s a lot of hope that this still can be salvaged in a way that those of us that have dedicated our careers and livelihoods to supporting the American public will have a chance to continue to do that,” said another federal employee who was on leave, speaking on condition of anonymity.“For now, we’re just waiting, hoping, praying that there’s some type of resolution that continues to allow us to do what we love, and that’s supporting the American people.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpRaceGenderDisabilityLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Then Jackie and her eight-year-old brother, Michael, calmly cooked a ­second batch.“This is much more fun than other playgrounds,” said Michael. “You can catch fish, you can go in the water and build huts. Sometimes, my mum is drawing and you can really run free!”Their mother, Marlien Kulsdom, 44, an early-years teacher and artist, called theWoeste Westen(“Wild West”) play ­forest in Amsterdam-West heaven for them all.“I’m a teacher at a school where they encourage risk-taking play,” she said. “It’s learning about boundaries.”It is also the kind of risky play that local councillors want to spread across Amsterdam, replacing the rubber tiles and boring playgrounds they say have been built in recent years. A new policy from the D66 liberal democrats proposes giving all children in the Dutch capital access to outdoor play areas to climb, play with water and fire, sword-fight with sticks, build with hammers, rope or knives, wrestle and fall. “Rufty-tufty playing means that children might get a bump or a cut,” according to the policy – but it’s an acceptable risk, they say.More and more kids are losing the ability to deal with risks and be happy when the situation gets a bit more stressfulMascha van Werven, charity director“The inspiration, and it really is a huge problem, is that children are hardly moving,” said Rob Hofland, head of the local D66 and proud uncle of tree-climbing children. “All kinds of problems stem from just sitting behind a screen. We see increasing numbers of burnouts and we are learning ever more about how unhealthy it is that the Dutch –the sitting champions of Europe– are so sedentary. Things need to change, and it starts young.”Although the number of overweight children is relatively stable in theNetherlands, at 17%, the figure rises to a 25% for 18- to 24-year-olds. There has been an “alarming” increase in childhood diabetes, according to the Diabetes Fonds, while motor skills have declined so much that many children can no longer catch a ball.A survey last year from Jantje Beton, which campaigns for outdoor play space, suggested the number of Dutch children playing alone outside without adult supervision plummeted from 25% in 2022 to 13% last year. Almost half play more indoors, compared with a third before the Covid pandemic.Mascha van Werven, executive director, is concerned. “More and more kids are losing the ability to make social contact, to learn to deal with risks and also to be happy when the situation gets a little bit more stressful,” she said. “If they learn to still play in those [riskier] areas, they are starting at a very young age to deal with risks, to maybe ask someone for help … to take a step back and try again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it is far from alone in being concerned about the increase in helicopter parenting, stifling the ability of young people to anticipate, avoid and deal with potential hazards themselves. In an article inNaturein January, Canadian and Norwegian researchers pointed out the benefits of risky – but not outright dangerous – play, particularly outside, in helping children build transferable risk-management skills.Challenging activity is vital for cognitive capacity, according to Erik Scherder, professor in clinical neuro­psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and a member of the Netherlands Sports Council, which has called for more government focus on playing outside. “What you can do outside involves motor function but also cognitive functions: the interplay between the two is challenging – and challenge is exactly what you need when you have a developing brain,” he said. “Neurons should be stimulated each time in a different way, not just repeating the same thing.”While nobody encourages putting children in danger, Martin Hup, a biology teacher and founder of the non-profitWoeste Westen, believes parents should step back more. “Every playground, council, parent and school has to weigh up risk versus benefit,” he said. “There is a risk, but my child learns from it mentally and physically. If you are always saying: ‘Don’t do that, be careful, watch out!’, you are taking away a lot of chances for development.”Back at the play forest, Jackie recalled landing fully clothed in the water, to her brother’s delight. “A float flipped over and I went under it,” she said. “It doesn’t stop me, in any case!”Explore more on these topicsChildrenThe ObserverHealth & wellbeingEuropeNetherlandsHealthHealth policyObesityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But some experts believe standard testing misses the ways an antisocial personality manifests itself in womenMiriam FrankelSun 2 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTSharePicture a psychopath. Who do you see in your mind’s eye? Chances are it’s a man. And chances are your answer would be similar if you were asked to picture a narcissist. From Charles Manson and Ted Bundy to Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump, most famous people we consider psychopathic or narcissistic are male. That’s even the case for fiction – thinkHannibal Lecter,Patrick BatemanorNorman Bates.Scientists long assumed that women were simply too wonderful to be significantly psychopathic or narcissistic, anddidn’t bother to study the possibility much, according to Ava Green from City St George’s, University of London. But research over the past few decades is increasinglychallenging this stereotype, suggesting women can have a dark streak, too. Much like in autism or ADHD, such traits just express themselves slightly differently in women – making them harder to spot with diagnostic tests that were essentially developed for men.Most of us have some level of the dark personality traits. These are often combined into what scientists call the “dark triad” of psychopathy, narcissism and machiavellianism (that is, striving for control and power by being manipulative and unethical). While only about 1-5% and 1% of people have clinical levels of narcissism and psychopathy respectively – and many of them are in prison – people with sub-clinical levels can cause damage too. You’ve probably come across a few, given that abouta third of the populationhave above-average levels of dark traits. Such people have a hunger for power and control and are often selfish, unempathetic, manipulative, deceptive and remorseless to some degree.View image in fullscreenThe classic psycho? Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman in the 2000 film version of American Psycho.Photograph: AllstarRecent research by Antonella Somma at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan and her colleagues investigated dark traits and other personality features in nearly 1,000 Italian women. They found that women with elevated levels of such traitswere more likely to have high levels of aggression. The way they express it, however, may be different from men.“You get more rumour-spreading and backstabbing among females and more direct aggression among males,” says Somma.Narcissism, for example, is often seen as a rather male trait – think the scarf-wearing cad in Carly Simon’s song You’re So Vain. But “the core of narcissism is the same in men and women: they express entitled expectations, grandiose fantasies and a lack of empathy,” says Green.Narcissistic women are abusing in ways that society allows. They often leverage their femininity, present themselves as soft-spoken, but it is cunning; it’s premeditatedResearchers have discovered thatnarcissism can come in two types: grandiose and vulnerable. And Green has shown that while men are more likely to have grandiose narcissism, boasting high self-esteem and extroversion, women more commonly display the vulnerable form, involvingintroversion, defensiveness and low self-esteem. They may be more brittle and less boastful.Green believes this is because bragging and chest-thumping simply aren’t socially acceptable for women. “Narcissistic women are abusing in ways that society allows,” she argues. “They often leverage their femininity, present themselves as soft-spoken, but it is cunning; it’s premeditated.” They may still lie, cheat and control others.In Somma’s study, women with high levels of psychopathy, machiavellianism and grandiose narcissism scored low on agreeableness (how friendly you are) and high on social deviance (breaking rules or norms).Womenwith vulnerable narcissism, however, were less socially deviant and more agreeable than women with other dark traits. They also had more paranoid thoughts and the worst mental health of all. This is potentially because they are more insecure and eager to fit in. “They’re often better at faking empathy,” says Green.But we may fail to recognise these traits as narcissistic. “Female leaders with narcissistic traits can cause as much reputational damage, staff turnover, bullying, as male ones – they just go about it in a more sneaky way,” says Green. “Male leaders can be more aggressive and socially dominant to establish authority. But female leaders may blame the higher-ups for why they had to fire you – even if they orchestrated it.”There’s certainly aggression beneath the surface. Vulnerable narcissismis more strongly linked to aggressionin relationships, as well as physical and verbalbullying, than the grandiose type. “These are uncomfortable truths, painting women in the same light as men,” says Green.When taking into account the vulnerable features of narcissism, Green found subclinical levels of the traitto be as common, if not more prevalent, in women. But many diagnostic protocols, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), are skewed towards men, focusing on grandiose narcissism. Female narcissism is thereforeoften misdiagnosedas borderline personality disorder, according to Green. The European diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases 11 (ICD-11), she says, is actuallymore likely to capture female narcissistsas it includes vulnerable traits.This matters because high levels of narcissismare linked to crime. Green is planning a new study in British prisons to assess how the system fails to capture female inmates’ vulnerable narcissistic traits.PsychopathsMen typicallyscore higherthan women on machiavellianism and its more severe cousin, psychopathy. These traits are similar, but machiavellian people tend to have better impulse control and ability to play the long game compared with their psychopathic peers.However, some researchers believestandard testsmay be underestimating machiavellianism in women. After all, the entire psychological construct was inspired by the ideas of a man – the Italian diplomat and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli. Research shows that while machiavellian men and women are equally cynical, machiavellian men tend to be moreconfident, assertive and selfish, while machiavellian women are more conscientious,anxiousand more likely todoubt and cheat on their partner. Recent studies have therefore put forwardnew teststhat are less skewed towards men.The same could be true for psychopathy. Psychopaths, after all, have high levels of charm and charisma. “One of the key things they want is power and control. And they gain that control however they can,” says Clive Boddy from Anglia Ruskin University. “For a man it may be more physical, such as through violent intimidation, whereas for a woman it may be more through manipulating people’s feelings.” He adds that women with psychopathic traits often use their sexuality to gain power and control, highlighting Ghislaine Maxwell and the fraudulent entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes as possible examples.Dr Antonella Somma at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan has investigated dark traits and other personality features in nearly 1,000 Italian women.Photograph: IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital“They ultimately tend to weaponise anything that society allows them to use,”says Green. This means they may be more successful using their children against their partner, or making false accusations of abuse, than physically threatening someone.Common assessment tools such as thePsychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), which is often used in prisons, were developed based on male offenders. Even measures to assess subclinical levels of psychopathy in the general population, such as theLevenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale, are “loosely based on the PCL-R”, according to Boddy.Both test what is called “primary psychopathy”, which includes traits such as callousness, remorselessness and manipulation, along with “secondary psychopathy”, which is more about impulsivity and antisocial behaviour. As women are less likely to be violent or criminal, they often score lower on secondary psychopathy, which can reduce their overall scores. Boddy therefore thinks primary psychopathy should be emphasised when assessing women.In 1995, Michael Leveson, creator of the Leveson scale, suggested that a whopping23% of men, but only 6% of women, had high enough levels of psychopathy to cause trouble for others. Boddy, however, has long been sceptical of such numbers. Based on three of his previous studies of 913 people (including 570 women) in the US, UK and Australia, he found,in analysis yet to be published, that 28% of men and 19% of women had high enough scores on primary psychopathy to be toxic.Biases among assessors may also play a role. “Male clinicians and psychopathy researchers may be relatively unwilling to give a diagnosis of psychopathy to the nice, charming woman in front of them,” suggests Boddy.This is a problem. Women with such traits may create havoc in workplaces, relationships, families and society at large. According to Boddy, CV fraud is common among those who make it to the top in companies, as is a lack of moral consideration about things such as sustainability, equality or diversity.We know that poor parenting is linked to psychopathy in women, but there are no questions about it in the PCL-RPsychopathyhas not been studied muchin female offenders either. One 2015 study suggested thatonly 11-17% of female criminals are psychopathic, compared with 31% of male ones. In a recent series of studies of female murderers in Italy, Prof Felice Carabellese from the University of Bari and colleagues discovered that most suffered from some sort of psychosis, and had no or reduced criminal responsibility. But in the small group that had full criminal responsibility,about 40% had clinically relevant levels of psychopathy.In anotherrecent studyon murderers, he showed female killers were likely to score higher on primary traits such as manipulation than male ones, while male psychopaths scored higher on antisocial behaviour. “In women, the psychopathic component can be underestimated or undervalued because the diagnostic tools are not as refined as those for men,” says Carabellese. All this suggests that we might be better off using a slightly lower cut-off score for criminal women, or a test with less emphasis on antisocial behaviour.Female psychopaths may also be such brilliant manipulators that assessors fail to even spot their psychopathic tendencies. And we know that poor parentingis linked to psychopathy in women, but there are no questions about it in the PCL-R.If we are to rehabilitate those who commit crimes, male or female, we need to get the psychological profiling right. People with psychopathy are much harder to treat and more likely to reoffend than others.Many people feel uncomfortable hearing negative things about women. “I often get a bit anxious when I present to the public about whether women will walk out in the middle of my talk,” says Green. “When these negative traits are being shone on women, it’s almost like we’re taking a step back. But I personally think that by shying away from depicting women as having this breadth of behaviour – that they can also be cruel, selfish and deeply flawed – we’re actually doing a disservice to the very notion of equality.”What’s more, if we insist that women are just hardwired to be soft and nurturing, we may subconsciously assume they are unsuitable for roles such as leadership, policing or politics. Ultimately, all human beings have the capacity for good and bad. And if women have learned to rein in some of their aggression as a result of societal pressures, the chances are that men could too.Explore more on these topicsPsychologyThe ObserverWomenMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The EU gets access to raw material sources that include tin, tungsten, gold, niobium and potential lithium and rare earth elements. Rwanda is the world’s largest extractor of the rare earth metal tantalum, which is used in chemical equipment. The EU is giving Kigali €900m (£750m) to develop its infrastructure in raw materials extraction, health and climate resilience.The money comes from the global gateway,the EU’s €300bn answer to China’s belt and road initiative, which funds infrastructure projects around the world.After the deal was signed, the infuriated Congolese president, Félix Tshisekedi, described it as“a provocation in very bad taste”.Tshisekedi accuses Rwanda of plundering the DRC’s resources, and several UN reports say Rwanda uses the M23 group as a means to extract and then export minerals. Rwanda denies this and says its primary interest in eastern DRC is to eradicate fighters linked to the 1994 genocide.The US government has also raised concerns that armed groups are benefiting from illegal trade in Congolese minerals, including gold and tantalum. “Significant quantities” of Congolese minerals are being moved by traders, supported by armed groups and security services, to Rwanda and Uganda, where they are sold on to international buyers, the US embassy in DRChas said. “In many cases, these mineralsdirectly or indirectly benefit armed groups,” it said.The UN has saidRwanda has “de facto control” over the M23 rebels, who are well-equipped and well-trained.Hilde Vautmans, a Belgian liberal MEP who leads the European parliament’s EU Africa delegation, has backed calls to suspend the agreement. “Given the overwhelming evidence that Rwanda is involved in supporting the M23 rebels in eastern Congo, it is imperative that the EU takes urgent action,” she said, listing targeted sanctions, a freeze on EU development aid and the immediate suspension of the MoU.A further 15 MEPs – Greens, liberals and leftwingers – have made the same demand for a suspension of the EU agreement. The MoU, they wrote in a recent letter, failed to take into account Rwanda’s role in eastern DRC and “unjustifiably grants international legitimacy to the Rwandan regime”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The current rush for minerals has the potential to embolden violent and bad-faith actors. To counter this, agreements and plans going forward for mining for transition minerals should be made in tandem with communities.”The UK has suggestedsuspending aid to Rwanda, while Germany has cancelled meetings and said it was intalks with other donors about “further measures”.The European Commission has so far brushed aside criticism of the 2024 deal with Rwanda: a spokesperson last Tuesday said critical materials were “essential to achieve the green and digital transition both within the EU and across the world”.They said: “One of the main objectives of the partnership MoU with Rwanda is precisely to support the sustainable and responsible sourcing, production and processing of raw materials, and we will increase now in our work this traceability and transparency.”Explore more on these topicsRwandaEuropean UnionDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Researchers warned that the impact of the abrupt halt on other programmes could fuel the spread of drug-resistant HIV, and put medical progress back by years.The MVDP’s aim is “to reduce the impact of malaria on children living in malaria-endemic areas of the world”. In sub-Saharan Africa, approximately450,000 under-5sarekilled by malariaeach year.While theintroduction of two malaria vaccinesin 2024 was hailed as transformative, MVDP-funded research aims to make them much more effective and longer-lasting.A senior academic who has been involved with the programme for a number of years said the sudden halt would set back research, and was likely to include ongoing trials in humans and animals.They said MVDP-funded projects were often testing a new vaccine in humans for the first time, meaning “huge safety implications of suddenly shutting down – you are absolutely obliged to follow [participants] up and make sure they stay safe.”The USAid funding freeze and stop or suspend work orders cover an initial period of90 dayswhile a review is carried out, according to official statements.However, multiple sources in the health research field said they were unclear who would have the expertise to carry out such a review, with many senior officials at US health bodies having been fired.Tom Drake, senior policy analyst at the Center for Global Development, said that the impact of cuts to research funding were less visible and less immediate than theimplications for the provision of life-saving programmesaround the world “but is no less real”.“The advent of malaria vaccines is one of the greatest global health achievements of our time, and is a direct result of funding by the MVDP and many others,” he said.“Even if other funders step in to plug the gaps in malaria vaccine funding, there is always an opportunity cost, and so some other development research issue will be neglected as a result.”ProfKelly Chibaleof the H3D research centre at the University of Cape Town said a project working to create a platform to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients necessary for antiretrovirals in South Africa was at risk.“We are urgently looking for alternative funding mechanisms to continue this important work, retain the team members and ensure the sustainability of the platform,” he said. “The project will also suffer if our collaborators in the US lose staff in this period of uncertainty.”Prof Kenneth Ngure of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Kenya and president-elect of the International Aids Society, said researchers on projects testing HIV prevention options such as injectable drugs and vaginal rings globally had received stop work orders.Even if projects are reinstated after a 90-day pause, there will still be “a lot of damage”, he said.“It’s like you’re having a car speeding on a highway. Then you apply emergency brakes. There are so many things that can go wrong,” he said.“I’ve been doing HIV prevention research for the last 20 years; nothing like this has happened. The thing that came closest to this was Covid, and when Covid came, we were able to [find] other ways of continuing with our programmes.”Some products, such as injectable HIV prevention drugs, are not yet available outside research settings, he said, leaving participants with no alternative source to continue treatment.Charities reeling from USAid freeze warn of ‘life or death’ effectsRead moreIf the level of drugs in a participant’s body falls to nonprotective levels, it not only puts them at risk of infection, but means their infection is more likely todevelop drug resistance. That makes their treatment more complicated, and if they then infect someone else, the resistance will spread.Projects that had recently been completed and were ready for data analysis had been affected, Ngure said. “Human beings have given their time. It’s also an ethical obligation for you. When you have done a study, you need to finish that study and you need to share the findings.”He said: “There’s need for reconsideration of this decision. We’ve had huge support from the US government, many infections have been averted, and we are now starting to talk about controlling the HIV pandemic in the coming years. But when you’ve done all this, if you then stop, we start going backwards. And we can go backwards for many years, if not decades.”Approached for comment, a state department spokesperson referred to awaiverissued on Wednesday for life-saving humanitarian assistance.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentMalariaAidVaccines and immunisationGlobal healthHealthAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Those games came hours after Donald Trump made his threat of import tariffs on Canada a reality.After Raptors fans initially cheered the 15-year-old girl singing the anthems, they booed throughout her performance of The Star-Spangled Banner. At the end, mixed boos and cheers could be heard before the crowd erupted in applause for the Canadian anthem, O Canada. Three of the five starters on the Raptors are American and they glanced at each other as the boos rang out. Sportsnet reporter Michael Grange, who was at the game,wrote on Xthat fans emphasised the word“free” in the Canadian anthem. The game ended in a 115-108 victory for the Raptors.Raptors forward Garrett Temple, who is American, said the players were well aware of the booing.“Yeah, of course I noticed it,” he said. “The reaction [was], ‘Wow.’ And then you just think about why they’re booing. A lot of things bigger than basketball going on in the world right now. At the end of the day, we play in an arena that’s inCanadaand they’re Canadian citizens, so they have a certain feeling about the trade situation going on, the tariffs. The people that booed let their thoughts be known.”One of the Raptors’ Canadian players, Kelly Olynyk, said he had had sympathy for the anthem singer.“Obviously [the tariffs have] an impact on a lot of people in this country and in this stadium,” he said. “I felt bad for the girl singing but they cheered her at the end, so I was happy for that.”On Saturday,Trump placed tariffson goods from Canada, Mexico and China after claiming the three countries allow immigrants and illegal drugs into the US. In addition, energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a 10% rate.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico’s president have ordered retaliatory tariffs on goods from America in response.The booing of The Star-Spangled Banner in Canada is rare, but not unheard of especially when tied to world events. In the early 2000s, fans at games in Canada booed to show their disapproval of the US-led war in Iraq.Trump has been the subject of booing himself at sports events. During his first term as president he was jeered and greeted with “lock him up” chants by Washington Nationals fansduring the 2019 World Series. He has alsobeen cheered loudlyat college football games.Explore more on these topicsNBAToronto RaptorsUS sportsBasketballTrump administrationCanadaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The tariffs against Canada tax oil and energy products at 10%.Trump said on his own Truth Social social media platform that he had used emergency powers to issue the tariffs, due to come into effect on Tuesday, “because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl”.The Journal said the moves “reminds us of the old Bernard Lewis joke that it’s risky to be America’s enemy but it can be fatal to be its friend”, adding that with the exception of China “Mr Trump’s justification for this economic assault on the neighbors makes no sense.”It added: “Drugs may be an excuse since Mr Trump has made clear he likes tariffs for their own sake, pointing to Trump’s comments on Thursday that the US doesn’t need oil or lumber from its neighbors.Top Democrats warn Trump tariffs will ‘hit Americans in their wallets’Read more“Mr Trump sometimes sounds as if the US shouldn’t import anything at all, that America can be a perfectly closed economy making everything at home,” the editorial continued. “This is called autarky, and it isn’t the world we live in, or one that we should want to live in, as Mr Trump may soon find out.”Trump reacted strongly to the outlet’s editorial position, posting on Truth Social that “a ‘Tariff Lobby’, headed by the Globalist, and always wrong, Wall Street Journal, is working hard to justify Countries like Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA.“THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!”, Trump continues in the screed. “The USA has major deficits with Canada,Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we’re not going to be the “Stupid Country” any longer.”Larry Summers, treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, called the impending tariffs “a self-inflicted supply shock.“It means less supply because we’re taxing foreign suppliers. And that will mean higher prices and lower quantities,” Summers told CNN. “This is a self-inflicted wound to the American economy. I’d expect inflation over the next three or four months to be higher as a consequence, because the price level has to go up when you put a levy on goods that people are buying.”Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the US, told ABC’s This Week that Trump’s tariff move “is disrupting to an incredibly successful trading relationship.“We’re really disappointed and we’re hopeful that they don’t come into effect on Tuesday,” Hillman added. “We’re ready to continue to talk to theTrump administrationabout that.”Hillman said Canada was eager to build on its trading relationship with the US but acknowledged “it’s hard to maintain that sense of common purpose and moving forward if we get into this kind of a dynamic on tariffs”.The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, ordered retaliatory tariffs in response to the US decision to slap tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico, saying her government sought dialogue rather than confrontation with its trade partner to the north.Sheinbaum pointed to her government’s action against fentanyl production in Mexico since she took office in October, saying it had seized 20m doses of the synthetic opioid and detained 10,000 individuals tied to drug trafficking.Mexico has ordered retaliatory tariffs and Canada’s prime minister said the country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155bn in US imports. China’s Ministry of Commerce said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for the “wrongful practices of the US”.But some US business leaders have reacted neutrally to Trump’s tariffs that the Budget Lab at Yale University estimates would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power.Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates the tariffs would increase inflation, currently running at 2.9%, by 0.4% and cut US GDP by 1.5% this year.Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, the world’s largest bank, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week that tariff threats can be used effectively to “bring people to the table” to negotiate more favorable trade terms.Tariffs are “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon”, depending on how they’re used, Dimon remarked to CNBC. “I would put in perspective: if it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it.”William Reinsch, a former US trade official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said many companies had stocked up on imported goods ahead of time to avoid the tariffs and would be able to draw on existing inventories.That may be an effective strategy for non-perishable goods, like construction materials, but less so for perishable goods that are not afforded the ability to stockpile. “You don’t stockpile avocados,’’ Reinsch said. “You don’t stockpile cut flowers. You don’t stockpile bananas.’’The US Chamber of Commerce business group warned that the tariff policy was wrong-headed and would cause economic harm to Americans.The group’s senior vice-president John Murphy said: “The President is right to focus on major problems like our broken border and the scourge of fentanyl, but the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won’t solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.”He added: “The Chamber will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.”Democratic politicians were not impressed. “Donald Trump got hired … saying he was going to lower grocery prices. Two weeks in, he’s doing something that’s going to do the opposite,” senator Mark Warner told CBS’s Face the Nation.The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar summed up her thoughts on the early days on the second Trump administration on MSNBC: “Chaos up, corruption up, and, sadly, prices of eggs up … This is not what American economy needs right now … He is not using a chisel, he is using a sledgehammer.”This story was amended on 2 February 2025 to clarify that Canada’s oil and energy products would be under a 10% tariff.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUS politicsCanadaMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Mulino suggested a possible expansion of an existing agreement with the US from last July that could pave the way for direct deportations of non-Panamanian migrants who cross the Darien Gap jungle on Panama’s southern border with Colombia.After the meeting, Mulino said: “We had a very respectable and cordial meeting,” but that the canal “is operated by our country and will continue to be”.Mulino noted an expanded deal could potentially allow for the deportation of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. “We spoke extensively about the problem of migration, with the understanding that Panama is a transit point,” said Mulino, after his meeting.Mulino also said he would not renew Panama’sbelt and road initiativewith China and invited the state department to promote US investment in the country.Rubio is touring Central America and the Caribbean on his first foray in the post as he seeks to refocus US diplomacy on the western hemisphere – in part to recruit help in stemming migration toward the US southern border.Even before Trump’s election, Mulino had signed agreements with the US aimed at controlling irregular migration via the Darién Gap through increased surveillance and the introduction of deportation flights. In the first three weeks of January, migration through the gapfell 94% comparedwith the same period in 2023.A day after Trump announced he was imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting retaliation from those countries, Rubio was perhaps taking a less confrontational and more diplomatic approach. He was pictured cordially greeting Panama’s foreign minister, though neither he nor Mulino spoke publicly at their meeting. Rubio is also scheduled to tour an energy facility and the canal during his visit.View image in fullscreenProtesters against Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama City on 2 February.Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty ImagesAbout 200 people marched in Panama City, carrying Panamanian flags and shouting “Marco Rubio out of Panama”, “Long live national sovereignty” and “One territory, one flag” while the meeting was taking place. Some burned a banner with images of Trump and Rubio after being stopped short of the presidential palace by riot police.“To the imperial messenger,” union leader Saul Mendez said of Rubio, “we reiterate that there is absolutely nothing here for Trump. Panama is a free and sovereign nation.”Who owns the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?Read moreUpon returning to office Trump threatened to take control of the Panama canal, built by the US in the early 20th century and handed over to Panama under a 1977 treaty, claiming the canal is beingoperated by China. The comments were followed by a public backlash, and Panama rebuked Trump’s threats.China has said it plays no part in operating the canal and that it respects Panama’s sovereignty and independence over the waterway. The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.Following Trump’s threats, Mulino ordered Panama’s comptroller general to audit the key ports at either end of the canal. Rubio, a longtime China hawk during his Senate career, said last week that China could use ports to shut down the canal, a vital route for US shipping, in the event of a conflict between Beijing and Washington.Last week a Senate commerce committee audience accused Panama of mismanagement of the canal. In recent years drought has reduced the number of transits and auctions for limited spots have fetched figures of up to $4m. A solid Panamanian commitment to resolve this problem – the most likely solution is a dam of the Rio Indio, an environmentally and socially complex project – could appease Rubio’s concerns.However, US administration of the canal or a significant reduction of its fees – which form an important part of the national budget – would be unacceptable to the Panamanian government and its people. Mulino has said the ownership of the canal wasnot on the table in the talkswith Rubio.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the audit concession was not enough and that Panama had “totally violated” the understanding when the US handed back the canal.“They’ve already offered to do many things,” Trump said of Panama, “but we think it’s appropriate that we take it back.”Explore more on these topicsPanamaMarco RubioTrump administrationUS foreign policyAmericasDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Reversing the extension was a blow that affected more than 600,000 Venezuelans living in the US.Now Trump has targeted a subset of that Venezuelan immigrant community who entered the TPS program in 2023, obtaining the right to remain in the US until at least April. Having revoked their protections, the Trump administration is giving that group of more than 300,000 Venezuelans just 60 days before they become vulnerable to deportation.A further 250,000 Venezuelans who arrived in 2021 have TPS protections until September. Their position beyond that date must now be considered to be in severe jeopardy.TPS is a federal program designed to offer temporary shelter to those fleeing natural disasters or armed conflict. It offers a right to live in the US but without a longer term path to citizenship.In the case of Venezuela, the program offered a lifeline for hundreds of thousands escaping political and economic hardship under the dictatorship ofNicolás Maduro.The double blow of two successive cuts to the TPS program for Venezuelans has prompted cries of dismay from both Venezuela and the US. The Venezuelan opposition website El Pitazo said that the revoking of the Biden administration’s 18-month extension “fell like an atomic bomb over this migrant community”.Andres Oppenheimer, writing in theMiami Herald, noted that Trump’s move against Venezuelans targeted “some of his most ardent supporters in the US – both voters and TPS-holders. Buoyed by Trump and Florida legislators’ hard-line rhetoric against Venezuela’s dictatorship, Venezuela’s exile community had overwhelmingly supported Trump in the 2024 US elections.”Trump has long had TPS in his sights. In his first presidential term, he scrapped its protections for immigrants from El Salvador and Haiti.Homeland security chief declines to say whether women, children to be held at GuantánamoRead moreOn Sunday, the homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, sporting a cowboy hat, appeared on NBC News’s Meet the Press to justify rescinding the protections. Misreferencing the program as “TPP”, she said it no longer had credibility.Noem parroted a line frequently used by Trump on the campaign trail, that the Venezuelan government had opened its prisons and mental health institutions and sent the occupants to the US.She also said that “folks from Venezuela who have come into this country are members of TDA”. Tren de Aragua is a Venezuelan crime network.The Department of Homeland Security has identified600 migrantsin the US who may have connections to the gang – a tiny fraction of the 600,000 with TPS status.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationDonald TrumpUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the US’s explicit claim that Mexico’s government had allied itself with narco-trafficking groups – which one pundit called “Trump’s missile” – appeared to have blindsided officials. “What had appeared to be a commercial and economic crisis has become an eminently political issue,” the newspaper El Universal said.Mexican front pages were covered with references to Trump’s “narco-government” claim on Sunday. An indignant headline in the leftwing paper La Jornada said: “Mexico demands RESPECT! after Trump attack”. A cartoon depicted Trump as a caveman clutching a cudgel emblazoned with the word “tariffs”.Mexico’s economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said on social media that Trump was “shooting himself in the foot”. He wrote: “Accusing the Mexican government of being an ally of narco [traffickers] is – apart from an insult to our country – a pretext to distract US public opinion from the tremendous mistake of imposing disruptive tariffs on Mexico and North American companies that operate here.”Top Democrats warn Trump tariffs will ‘hit Americans in their wallets’Read moreEbrard retweeted a post by Lawrence Summers in which the former US treasury secretary called Trump’s tariffs “inexplicable and dangerous”.Summers wrote: “It is hard to imagine a better way to increase migration on our southern border than by destabilizing the Mexican economy, as these tariffs set out to do.” He said the tariffs would “force our allies to retaliate. And I presume they will retaliate in ways that are designed to maximize our economic pain.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUS economyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But having won an election mandate to do not much else, how does the Crisafulli government justify doing anything?Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe new strategy seems to be to run everything else through the same Labor Crisis (TM) cycle as youth crime.Having promised to fully implement Labor’s budget, the LNP has spent its first few months leaking out stories about newly discovered budget blowouts.This creates a supposed justification for ditching commitments,scrapping worker conditionson government construction projects and whatever else the LNP might decide to do in the next budget.Kyle Sandilands to undergo urgent brain surgery to treat aneurysmRead moreThe University of Queensland professor of economics John Quiggin said last week’sbudget update– and warnings about spiralling debt – had echoes of the strategy used by the former LNP premier Campbell Newman.Newman held a “commission of audit” into the state’s finances that warned about spiralling debt. He then sacked public servants, cut government programs and turned Australia’s largest parliamentary majority yet into a one-term government.“You could pretty much have cut and pasted their report from 2012 to what we’re seeing [last week], and the same warnings of disaster and so forth and obviously we haven’t seen any sign of that disaster,” Quiggin said.Newman’s government proved so unpopular that, even a decade after he was voted out, the spectre of those cuts and his abrasive crash-through personality still hampers LNP campaigns. It is the reason Crisafulli was forced to promise there would be no public sector cuts.On the subject of promises, the government’s own publicity machine would have us believe that the first 100 days have been a process of ticking off election commitments. Just not all of them.Crisafulli had promised to appoint himself as the tourism minister in the new government but did not. He promised to set key performance indicators for his ministers but the documents are vague withno measurable outcomesthat might be used to hold them to account.2:34‘Extraordinary’: Queensland parliament bans debate on abortion for four years - videoThe premier’s personal promise – that crime victim numbers would decrease – is also off to a rocky start. A serious incident this month has already highlighted the government’s claim that “adult time” laws would deter children from committing serious offences may not be the panacea it had hoped for. Crisafulli says the laws will get even tougher.And regional communities who voted for the LNP are alreadybeginning to questionwhy the punitive youth crime laws – which experts overwhelmingly warned would not prevent and decrease crime – have not, in fact, prevented or decreased crime.And promises to bring transparency back to governmentseem to have been forgottenalmost immediately.The LNP’s ideological war withinThe Crisafulli government’s key to re-election in 2028 is to show the public – especially Brisbane voters who have been wary of the LNP since Newman – a different sort of conservative government.Alongside the public sector cuts, Newman was also hampered by a party grassroots and parliamentary caucus that veered to the conservative right.Crisafulli has attempted to assert some authority here, telling party members last year they did not “exist for culture wars” and that they wouldn’t “get everything” they wanted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Doctors say the decision puts those young people at heightened risk of self-harm.Before the 2024 election the LNPrepeatedly refused to answer questionsabout its positions on gender-affirming care and puberty blockers. Guardian Australia asked repeatedly and got no acknowledgment or response.Having gone to an election refusing to talk about the issue, how does the new government justify acting now?By using the same create-a-crisis template, and leaking information to a news outlet about a “scandal”.The health minister, Tim Nicholls, went public with “allegations of non-compliance with clinical guidelines” at one gender clinic in Cairns. He said these raise “concerns about paediatric gender therapies state-wide” but could not point to any specific concerns.To understand why the decision is so disproportionate, you need to know two things. The first is that the issues in Cairns are process issues (which does not mean they’re not important) but do not involve any allegation of patient harm.The second is that the Australian Medical Association says the government reaction places young people at actual risk of harm.“Doctors, particularly psychiatrists, general practitioners and paediatricians fear the decision will cause significant distress and harms to this already-vulnerable patient cohort, their families and treating clinicians,” AMA Queensland said this week.Wall Street Journal editorial calls Trump tariffs ‘dumbest trade war in history’Read moreThere are more than subtle hints that the decision is grounded in ideology. In his statement, Nicholls said there was “contested evidence” about the benefits of hormone therapies for children.And these views were not formed overnight. Nichollsmade similar comments to parliament in 2023. So did several of his colleagues.In fact, in 2023 Nicholls argued against medical interventions for children with gender dysphoria by comparing their decisions to the actions of young people in the youth justice system.He said it was “pushed forward” that children were less responsible for their actions because they “do not understand the consequences of their actions”.“It is well documented that the brains of young people do not fully develop until they are well into their 20s,” said Nicholls, who voted in December, along with the rest of his party, to treat 10-year-olds who commit serious crimes like adults.Explore more on these topicsQueensland politicsLiberal National partyDavid CrisafulliQueenslandYouth justiceAbortionCampbell NewmananalysisShareReuse this content"

We know that he’s worried about the state of the Russian economy,” Starmer said.“I’m here to work with our European partners on keeping up the pressure, targeting the energy revenues and the companies supplying his missile factories to crush Putin’s war machine. Because ultimately, alongside our military support, that is what will bring peace closer.”Trump said last month he would impose high tariffs and further sanctions on Russia if Putin failed to end the war in Ukraine. He had claimed before the election that he would negotiate an end to the war in just one day.Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, he said that by pushing to settle the war he was doing Russia and its president a “very big favour”.The UK believes Putin is facing mounting domestic pressure from inflation and high interest rates as a result of the struggling economy, having ploughed billions into bankrolling the war in Ukraine.The UK has imposed sanctions on 2,100 Russian individuals and entities, the majority of these since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Sanctions on more than 100 ships for transporting Russian energy, including 93 oil tankers, have had an impact on Russia’s oil industry and damaged its economy.Starmer is to meet the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Monday before his attendance at an informal European defence cooperation meeting.Rutte has previously said the west is not ready to deal with the threat of war from Russia, and declared it is “time to shift to a wartime mindset and turbocharge our defence production”.Starmer has been under pressure to set out a timeline for the UK to meet its target of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence, up from just above 2%, but a number of other Nato countries are also not at this level of spending.The prime minister discussed Ukraine at a meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Chequers on Sunday. A spokesperson said Starmer had stressed that it was “important to ensure [Ukraine] was in the strongest possible position in the coming months, so that peace could be achieved through strength”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said that “right now Putin shows no signs of wanting to stop” his “unrelenting aggression”.The UK-Ukraine agreement includes £3bn of British support a year, to be continued indefinitely. Starmer said the UK would increase training for Ukrainian soldiers, provide mobile air defence systems and send 150 artillery barrels made by Sheffield Forgemasters – the first to be produced in 20 years.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyDefence policyKeir StarmerUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The civil protection ministry said schools would be shut as a precautionary measure on Monday.“Nothing can be ruled out,” Kostas Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at Thessaloniki’s Aristotle University, told the state broadcaster ERT. “And that’s why precautionary measures are being put in place, precisely to limit the impact of a stronger earthquake.”Greece sits on multiple faultlines and is often rattled by earthquakes, but experts described the increased seismic activity over the space of 48 hours, with more than 200 tremors registered, as dramatic, although they emphasised that the tremors had been triggered by tectonic rather than volcanic activity.Papazachos told local media that many of the earthquakes measured 4 to 4.5 on the Richter scale, with the strongest recorded in waters between Santorini and Amorgos.The site of one the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history, Santorini is also Greece’s most popular Aegean isle, attracting an estimated 3.5 million tourists last year.By early evening on Sunday as similar measures were taken on Amorgos and the nearby islets of Ios and Anafi, rescue teams in Santorini pitched tents in elevated areas on basketball courts and in car parks. In the event of a tsunami, people were told to head inland.Ferry companies said there had been an increase in foreign workers leaving the island for the port of Piraeus. A UK government travel advisory referred to guidance issued by the Greek civil protection ministry on earthquakes.Research has shown the crust beneath the seas around Santorini to be replete with faultlines. In 1956 the island sustained extensive damage after being hit by an earthquake in excess of seven on the Richter scale, which caused a tsunami.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU stands with the people of Georgia in their fight for freedom and democracy.”Georgia’s rights ombudsman, Levan Ioseliani, warned of “instances of mistreatment and excessive use of force by the police against citizens, journalists, and politicians”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A video of the incident swiftly went viral.Hermoso’s first reaction, according to changing-room footage, was to tell teammates: “Hey, I didn’t like it.”In a later statement, she said the incident had left her feeling “vulnerable and a victim of aggression”. She described the kiss as an “impulsive act, sexist, out of place and without any type of consent from my part”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the kiss was “without bad faith at a time of maximum effusiveness” and has cast himself as a victim of a campaign by “false feminists”.Prosecutors will argue that Rubiales coerced Hermoso after pulling her aside on the bus to the airport and asking her to approve a statement downplaying the incident, which she refused to do.Vilda is then alleged to have approached Hermoso’s brother, Rafael, on the flight back to Madrid and warned him her career would suffer unless she agreed to record a video supporting Rubiales’ claim that the kiss was consensual.Rubiales has called on his daughters to testify, while several of Hermoso’s teammates will also provide evidence.Amid the protests triggered by the incident, Rubiales’ mother, Ángeles Béjar, was admitted to hospital for a few days after locking herself in a church and going on hunger strike in support of her son, protesting against the “inhumane and bloodthirsty” persecution against him.Explore more on these topicsSpainSpain women's football teamWomen's footballWomen's World Cup 2023EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The buyer was not immediately named.The costliest car ever sold at auction was a 1955 Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé that changed hands for €135m in May 2022.View image in fullscreenThe car was driven to victory by five times world champion Fangio at the non-championship Buenos Aires.Photograph: Christine Uyanik/ReutersThe most expensive grand prix car previously sold at auction was another ex-Fangio Mercedes W196 from 1954, which fetched $29.6m at Goodwood, England, in 2013.The IMS car was the first W196 R to become available for private ownership with the streamlined body fitted.The car was driven to victory by the five times world champion Fangio at the non-championship Buenos Aires grand prix in 1955, but with a more conventional cigar-shaped body on the same chassis, and fully open wheels.His team-mate Moss then raced it with the wider, streamlined body extending over the wheels at the season-ending Italian grand prix at Monza, retiring after setting the fastest lap at an average speed of 134mph.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re doing the same, for example, on tackling the dangerous small boat crossings.“We need that stronger cooperation with France, with Germany, so, of course, we need to strengthen that cooperation and also look for stronger trading relationships with the US and other countries.”Pressed on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme on what different customs arrangements could mean, she said the government wanted to “get rid of some of the bureaucracy” across borders. Cooper ruled out joining the customs union as a “red line” but left the door open to the possibility of another type of customs deal.Cooper also said the US president’s tariffs could have a “really damaging impact” on the global economy, telling the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “I don’t think it’s what anybody wants to see.”Brussels is looking for a youth mobility scheme and concessions on fishing rights and following EU laws, while Starmer’s priorities are a defence and security pact, as well as smoother trade.Cooper described a youth mobility scheme as “not the right starting point for us at all” but the government has been careful not to rule it out as part of an overall deal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saudi Arabia has played a leading role in that effort, hosting Syria’s new foreign and defence ministers in early January and a meeting of Syrian, Arab and western officials later that month.Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, was the first head of state to visit the Syrian capital after Assad was ousted in December.The warming ties with Arab leaders represent a major shift away from the situation under Assad, whose brutal crackdown on protests against him in 2011 led to the Arab League suspending Syria’s membership for more than a decade.Saudi Arabia tried to end Assad’s isolation by welcoming him back into the Arab League in 2023, hoping his reintegration would encourage him to address their concerns, chiefly the need to curb thetrade in Captagon, an amphetamine-like drug used in the Gulf by partygoers and labourers alike.Syria had become the region’s main producer of the drug, according to regional security sources, but Assad always denied his government played a role in its production and sale and Arab countries saw little progress to address the issue under him.Syria’s new administration has repeatedly promised to clamp down on the production and trade of the drug.Explore more on these topicsSyriaSaudi ArabiaMohammed bin SalmanMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Should those talks fail,Israelcould resume its offensive in early March.Netanyahu has made a show of portraying the meeting as “a testimony to the strength of our personal friendship”. On Sunday, as he boarded his plane for Washington, he listed a series of familiar talking points, including “victory over Hamas”, reshaping the Middle East and countering the threat posed by Iran.However, the messaging from the White House is that Netanyahu is seen as a junior partner, and the few details that have emerged from Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff’s visit to the region last week suggest Trump is pushing for adherence to a Gaza ceasefire plan that will pose political problems for Netanyahu.Netanyahu will arrive in Washington in the midst of a disruptive new US trade war with Mexico, Canada and China and mounting chaos over the Trump administration’s efforts to downscale and purge sections of the federal government.The New York-basedSoufan Centersaid Trump officials had warned that “renewed fighting in the Middle East would distract the new Trump team from addressing what Trump defines as more pressing priorities”. These include “securing the southern US border from illegal migration and settling the Russia-Ukraine war”, the thinktank said.The uncertainties overshadowing the meeting are being driven by two competing agendas.On Trump’s side is the apparent desire to have quiet in the Middle East to pursue his policy of widening the 2020 Abraham accords – in which Israel established relations with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during his first term – to include Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia has made clear that any progress depends on an end to the conflict in Gaza or the establishment of a path towards Palestinian statehood.On Netanyahu’s side, the objective – according to Israeli officials who briefed the Axios news website – is to understand where Trump stands on the planned start of negotiations for the second phase of a Gaza ceasefire deal, which Netanyahu was reluctantly pushed into by Trump.Those talks are supposed to begin on Monday, the 16th day of phase one of the ceasefire. But it now looks unlikely they will start until after the Trump-Netanyahu meeting, which has been characterised as an attempt to find a joint US-Israeli position going into the talks.Other key issues likely to dominate the meeting are a “day after” plan for Gaza, not least how it will be run and by whom, and what position to take on Iran.Complicating Netanyahu’s position is the fact that he has been facing mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war in Gaza after the end of the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which appears at odds with Trump’s outlook.The Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to quit the government if the war does not restart, potentially stripping Netanyahu of his majority.For its part Hamas, which has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, has said it will not release the hostages slated to go free in the second phase without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.Negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire have already been complicated by Trump’s repeated demand that Egypt and Jordan absorb 1.5 million residents of the Gaza Strip – a demand forcefully rejected by the two countries and other Arab nations including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.In his previous term, Trump handed Netanyahu a series of successes, including relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and thesigning of the Abraham accords.But while the new Trump administration includes several pro-Israel figures expected to endorse expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and resist international pressure over the war in Gaza, Trump’s ambitions appear less focused on Israel than on the Gulf countries.Eldad Shavit, a former intelligence official who worked in the prime minister’s office, said Netanyahu appeared to be balancing pressure from Trump to stick to the ceasefire and domestic opposition to the deal.“He wants to make sure Trump is on his side, but he also wants to make sure his government doesn’t collapse,” he said.Agencies contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza warIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”Although the executive order itself does not call directly for deportations, the idea of cracking down on student protesters involved with pro-Palestine efforts became a Trump 2024campaign promiseand a prominenttalking pointon the right in the US. Republicans have broadly sought to portray protests againstIsrael’s offensive in Gazaas expressions of support for Hamas, and havecalled to punish universitiesthat don’t quash them.Trump likely to use antisemitism claims to launch crackdown on US universitiesRead moreThe approach dovetails closely with Project Esther, a rightwing blueprint to target the pro-Palestinian movement, along with other calls from the right. Days after Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack that sparked Israel’s retaliatory campaign in Gaza, Marco Rubio – then a US senator, now the secretary of state – urged former secretary of state Antony Blinken to revoke the visas of students who protestedIsrael.In aletterto Blinken, Rubio characterized pro-Palestine protesters as “pro-Hamas” and urged the federal government to “perform a full review and coordination effort to revoke the visas of those who have endorsed or espoused Hamas’ terrorist activity”.Critics argued that the reference to deportations in the fact sheet could violate the US constitution if implemented.“Immigration enforcement that is predicated on protected speech is unconstitutional,” said Ben Wizner, director of the speech, privacy and technology project at the American Civil Liberties Union. “We think the order potentially will invite overreaching illegal law enforcement and immigration actions, but we’ll just have to see.”The executive order calls for agencies to identify “all civil and criminal authorities or actions within the jurisdiction of that agency” that could possibly be deployed to combat “campus antisemitism”.Project Esther, which was published in October by the conservative Heritage Foundation, lays out a strategy for cracking down on civil society groups that support Palestinian rights – and has sparked fears of wider repression. The fact sheet published on Wednesday aligns closely with language found in the document.Neither the Heritage Foundation nor a White House spokesperson immediately responded to a request for comment on any connection between Project Esther and the executive order.But there are numerouslinksbetweenTrump and the Heritage Foundation, including James Carafano, a senior counselor to Trump who co-chairs the Heritage Foundation’s antisemitism taskforce and has praised Project Esther.“Project Esther is a blueprint to save the US from those utilizing antisemitism to destroy it,” wrote Carafano in a 30 December 2024 op-ed in theWashington Examiner. “The key to combatting today’s antisemitism is recognizing the ecosystem in which it thrives: Politically and financially powerful funders support a network of organizations that recruit activist followers that commit the antisemitic activities we see every day, including marches, campus protests, vandalism, riots and violence.”Under the auspices of combatting antisemitism, Project Esther lays out a wishlist of policies to root out groups and activists it claims without evidence to be providing support for Hamas. Among others, it identifies as targets the non-profit organizations Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of the groups identified by the Heritage Foundation as partner organizations havedistanced themselvesfrom the project.Republicans threaten to punish colleges that allow pro-Palestinian protestsRead moreProject Esther’s other aims include the purging of curricula, the firing of teachers and professors, and the denial of permits for protests and demonstrations coordinated by such organizations. The document, which calls for a “public–private partnership when a willing administration occupies the White House”, also calls for the use of racketeering charges – historically used to prosecute organized crime networks – to “exploit” these groups’ “vulnerabilities”.Advocates for Palestinian rights are also bracing themselves for the resurrection oflegislation passedin the House of Representatives last year which would give the secretary of the treasury the discretion to strip non-profits it deems to support terrorism of their tax-exempt status. It received widespread condemnation from the non-profit sector, which raised alarms that it could be used to punish Trump’s political opponents.The bill, which passed with the support of 15 Democratic Congress members, stalled in the Senate.

A little over a decade ago he was working on the chicken station in a branch of McDonald’s. He then set up a burger delivery business in west London, which he and a cofounder would go on to sell for seven figures.A celebratory holiday in the Maldives and a period of research later, in 2019 they launched THIS™, the range of meat-alternative packaged foods, which boomed from zero to more than £20m of revenue, becoming the UK’sfastest-growing food brandin 2023.And now – another sharp pivot. Shovel admits that his move from burgers into the plant-based market was strategic rather than ideological, but in the process he became a true believer – and a committed vegan.Havingstepped backfrom the day-to-day running of THIS™ last year, the one-time burger flipper is now launching an animal welfare organisation that he hopes will do as much for animal rights as his previous venture did for non-meat bacon.It’s calledA Bit Weird. Why? As the organisation’s knowingly sillyjingleputs it, it’s “because some of the stuff we do to animals is a bit weird”.That includes killing 30m male chicks in gas chambers or macerators each year in Britain because they can’t lay eggs, something Shovel has set out to try to ban. The painful method by which male lambs are castrated to improve the flavour of their meat is next in his sights.He’s hoping to achieve this with a mixture of careful research – the stint at McDonald’s was a very strategic attempt to learn about the fast-food business – and fun.THIS may have forced its way into the nation’s freezer cabinets by leaning heavily on product innovation, but it also had an anarchic approach to marketing, such as when the company staged amock funeral procession for baconthrough the streets of central London.Shovel, 37, wants to do something similar for the welfare of animals. Hence the word “weird”, rather than shocking or appalling or indefensible. People have been “repelled” by vegan campaigning in the past, he argues, “because it’s all synonymous with judgment and sanctimony that people don’t enjoy”.For a start, he’s not trying to make you a vegan – at least not yet. “I’m not saying don’t eat animals. I’m not saying don’t eat dairy. It’s all good. A Bit Weird’s attitude is – crack on.”It is an approach that has won him some criticism from longer-established campaigners, he admits, but his plan is “to disarm people through humour and silliness and fun, so that they didn’t see us as another vegan brand lecturing them about their life choices”.Could a tiny organisation, just a month after launching, really hope to trigger large-scale change in the British egg industry? Shovel doesn’t see why not – and his prior experience in food retail at least gets him through doors.Chick cullinghas already been banned in Franceand Germany, and the technology exists to replace it, Shovel argues. Why not do the same in Britain? And why not try to make the campaign fun?He promises research-led engagement with the industry, lobbying of government, public awareness campaigns, legal challenges – and stunts.“I’ve had this itch for years … there’s almost a gap in the market with animal advocacy, if I’m going to be a businessperson about it, for someone to take quite serious messages and market them in a not serious way.“I have a general firm view which is that I don’t want my lunch to have felt fear or anguish or pain. And I think that’s an uncontroversial thing.”Explore more on these topicsAnimal welfareVeganismAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

This commission is aiming to do just that – to ask the difficult questions, to engage the public and try to come up with a shared vision of how we live well together in modern Britain,” he said. “Having cross-party support and two of the best recent community secretaries co-chair it is a good place to start.”Its organisers say the commission will seek to “answer the foundational questions of how we live well together”.Sunder Katwala, the director of the thinktank British Future, a member of the Together Coalition, said it was a “really important time to do this – six months on from the riots, a shocking scene of racist disorder we haven’t seen in my lifetime”.He said the commission would look at “what are the sources of division and unity and what can we actually do about them”.Katwala said in the past there had been attempts to look at how best to improve community cohesion after major events but it had been “very stop-start and there’s not been the narrative or agenda for building the community cohesion ahead of whatever the next event is”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the paper, she argued that governments had failed for more than a decade to ensure that social integration in the UK kept up with the “unprecedented pace and scale of immigration” and had allowed some local communities to become increasingly divided.In 2018, she sounded the alarm on not enough having been done to improve community cohesion, and suggested the government could set a target date for “everybody in the country” to speak English. She is now the Labour government’s lead non-executive director.Denham, who was communities secretary under Gordon Brown from 2009 to 2010, told an event last year that “social cohesion is not the absence of riots” but should be judged “by whether most people believe they have a stake and a voice that is equal with others – and whether this is a nation with the confidence to handle difference through dialogue”.Javid, who was communities secretary when Casey’s 2016 report was published, said at the time he was drawn to public office holders having to swear a British oath of allegiance. “We can’t expect new arrivals to embrace British values if those of us who are already here don’t do so ourselves, and such an oath would go a long way to making that happen,” he said at the time.Javid said at the time that his aim was not to create a “government-approved one-size-fits-all identity” where everybody listened to the Last Night of the Proms, but “without common building blocks of our society, you’ll struggle to play a positive role in British life”.Explore more on these topicsCommunitiesSajid JavidJohn DenhamConservativesLabourSouthport attackFar rightnewsShareReuse this content"

The demands led to a tense standoff during which a senior deputy to Musk threatened to call the US marshals in to grant access to the building.The confrontation and Voorhees’ suspension wasfirst reported by CNNand confirmed by the USAid officials. The Doge officials gained control over the access control system, which would allow them to lock out employees and read emails. They also sought personnel files and turnstile data, two people said.Musk’s deputies may also have sought access to Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, or SCIFs, and servers used to access sensitive cables with top-secret classifications. Four members of Doge have been granted regular access to USAid as the administration has suspended dozens of senior staff and furloughed hundreds more at the bureau for humanitarian assistance who help the agency respond to urgent crises around the world.Katie Miller, who serves on the advisory board for Doge and is married to Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, wrote on X that “no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances”, following an AP report that Doge officials did manage to access the materials, which included intelligence reports.The Doge crew lacked high enough security clearance to access that information, the newswire reported.USAid continued to abruptly suspend career staffers through Sunday, with the majority of staff in the legislative and public affairs bureaus cut off from their email. More than 100 career staffers at USAid have now been put on administrative leave,according to reportsconfirmed to the Guardian by one current and one former USAid official.“We’re literally coming to work each day waiting to get the email that we’re supposed to go,” said one current USAid official who has not been suspended. “It is very much a terror feeling in that building right now.”Musk has said that USAid should be shut down as theTrump administrationis said to be mulling various strategies to downsize the agency or potentially fold it into the state department. CBS News reported that JD Vance has been put in charge of figuring out next steps for USAid reform.“USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote on X, the social network that he owns. “Time for it to die.” In another post, he referred to the agency in the past tense, saying it “was a viper’s nest of radical left-marxists who hate America”.After the confrontation, Matt Hopson, USAid’s new chief of staff, resigned from his position, according to two of the officials. Hopson was one of eight Trump administration political appointees who have taken over the leadership of USAid and have sequestered themselves at the agency’s headquarters at the Ronald Reagan Building. They have rarely interacted with career staff. Hopson’s resignation wasfirst reported by Reuters.The efforts resemble those at other agencies such as the treasury department and the office of personnel and management where Doge officials have sought direct access to sensitive servers with data on millions of Americans, often over the protests of serving staff and leadership.Wired on Sunday reported that Musk’s Doge had detailed six young engineers between the ages of 18-24 to carry out the agency’s takeover of USAid’s computer systems. Several of those individuals have regularly accessed USAid headquarters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has also placed campaign allyPete Maroccoin a senior position at the state department’s office of foreign assistance, where he hasoverseen the ruinous freezeon foreign aid that has paralysed the organisation.Around the time of the confrontation at USAid, the organisation’s website, including decades of grant records and financial reports, suddenly went offline. For a brief period, it redirected to the White House’s website, a Guardian reporter confirmed on Saturday evening. Now it is simply inaccessible.On Friday evening, senior Senate Democrats warned that the Trump administration’s decisions to place senior USAid officials on leave and freeze foreign assistance without engaging with Congress “have created a maelstrom of problems that have put our nation at risk and undermined American credibility around the globe”.They warned Trump away from reported plans to downsize or even subsume the agency into the state department. “It is imperative that we maintain an independent development voice and capability within the US government,” wrote the senators. “USAid is, by statute, an independent establishment outside of the State Department. Any proposal to modify that structure would require an Act of Congress.”This story was amended on 2 February 2025 to correct Katie Miller’s title.

The Army Corps of Engineers is surveying and preparing to begin significant salvage operations on Monday to remove the wreckage from the river.The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, toured the morning TV shows and said federal aviation investigators needed space to conduct their inquiry.“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on CNN.The American Airlines flight, with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged to the Potomac River after colliding.The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 US figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.Army staff sgt Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; chief warrant officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt Rebecca M Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter. Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325ft (99 meters), plus or minus 25ft (7.6 meters), when the crash happened, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200ft (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.The discrepancy has yet to be explained.Investigators hope to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.According to an FAA report obtained by the Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9.30pm, once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called “not normal”.“Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,” Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump’s administration would address shortages with “bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace”.Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the US since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashWashington DCAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

And especially at a time where any president is supposed to be the consoler in chief.”As investigators work to establish the sequence of events that led to the mid-air collision, Kelly said: “It’s often not one thing that causes a major aviation accident like this.” Trump, he added, did not have “the appropriate information. And he clearly does not have the information in this case.”JD Vance said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday Morning Futures, stood by Trump’s remarks linking DEI hiring practices to the crash. He said Trump was not “blaming anybody” in particular but that DEI practices had led to air traffic controller shortages.“The president made very clear that he wasn’t blaming anybody, but he was being very explicit about the fact that DEI policies have led our air traffic controllers to be short-staffed. That is a scandal. Thankfully, it’s a scandal that the president has stopped,” Vance told Fox News’s Maria Bartiromo.Vance said it was important to “investigate everything”, adding: “But let’s just say the person at the controls didn’t have enough staffing around him or her because we were turning people away because of DEI reasons.”“There is a very direct connection between the policies of the last administration and short-staffed air traffic controllers,” he added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t care about any of that.

His White House border czar, Tom Homan, has said he hopes to start moving migrants there within 30 days.Asked repeatedly on NBC News whether women, children and families would be among those held at the detention center, homeland security secretaryKristi Noemdeclined to directly answer.“We’re going to use the facilities that we have,” she told NBC’s Meet the Press program. “We have other detention facilities, other places in the country. So, we will utilize what we have according to what’s appropriate for the individuals.”In separate Sunday interviews, Noem and Homan both reiterated that the administration was targeting “the worst of the worst” with its sweeps to detain people who are in the United States illegally, noting that a recent enforcement action in New York City focused on individuals with criminal arrest warrants.“The worst of the worst need to go to Guantánamo Bay,” Homan told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures program. “We’ve had a migrant processing center there for decades … We’re going to expand it a lot.”Noem said that the plan was not to hold people at Guantánamo indefinitely and that the administration would follow US law.“The plan is to have a process that we follow that’s laid out in law and make sure that we’re dealing with these individuals appropriately,” she said. “But it is an asset that we have that we fully intend to utilize.”Noem reiterated that the homeland security department would work with Congress on the facility but gave no other details.‘America’s gulag’: Trump’s Guantánamo ploy tars migrants as terroristsRead moreDemocratic senator Mark Kelly told NBC the decision to expand migrant detention at Guantánamo “just sounds very frightening to a lot of folk”.The administration has not said how much it would cost to expand Guantánamo, which was established in 2002 to detain foreign militants after the September 11 attacks on the United States. Its high-security US prison was criticized in 2023 by a United Nations expert, who said the US government treatment of Guantánamo Bay prisoners was cruel, inhuman and degrading under international law.The base also includes a migrant facility that has been used to detain Haitians and Cubans picked up at sea as they processed their asylum cases during the Clinton administration.Recent Democratic presidents have sought to close the base, which has long been condemned by human rights groups for indefinite detention and reports of abuse and torture. Migrant and refugee advocacy groups have also called on Congress to investigate alleged abuses. Trump, who took office on 20 January, has vowed to keep the aging military base open.Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also received US military approval to detain migrants at other installations, including Buckley space force base in Colorado.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationKristi NoemTrump administrationCubaGuantánamo BayDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The official futures market opens on Sunday evening.TheDow Jonesindex of 30 large US companies looked likely to fall by 0.8%, while the UK’s FTSE 100, which ended last week at a record high, was on track for a 0.7% drop.Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China: will they spark a trade war?Read moreThe IG analyst Tony Sycamore said: “The surprise for markets today isn’t so much Trump’s tariff announcements – largely as flagged. It’s thatCanadaand Mexico retaliated immediately and that others, ie China and the EU, may follow their lead, resulting in a sharp contraction in global trade.”Canadian and Mexican exports to the US will face a 25% tariff starting on Tuesday, and there will be a 10% levy on energy resources from Canada.Trump said the move was in response to a “major threat” from illegal immigration and drugs, and demanded both countries staunch the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants.Imports fromChinawill face a 10% tariff on top of existing US charges.Trump also told reporters he would “absolutely” put tariffs on goods from theEuropean Union, claiming the EU had treated the US “terribly”.Economists fear that the trade war could push Canada andMexicointo recession.Deutsche Bank’s top currency strategist, George Saravelos, said if Trump’s tariffs went ahead, they would be the “largest shock” in global trade policy since the end ofthe Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rateshalf a century ago.“We see immediate recessionary consequences for some of the economies involved and broad-based negative read-across to the world economy,” Saravelos added.Paul Ashworth, the chief North America economist at CapitalEconomics, warned that Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China was “just the first strike in what could become a very destructive global trade war”.“Imports from the European Union will be hit within the next month or two and a universal tariff is coming in April. Since exports to the US account for around 20% of their GDP, today’s tariffs could plunge both the Canadian and Mexican economies into recession later this year,” Ashworth added.Canada was swift to respond. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced a tit-for-tat 25% tariff phased in across C$155bn (£86bn) worth of American products.2:41Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on US products in retaliation against Trump – videoMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, ordered her economy minister to implement tariff and non-tariff measures in response, while China’s commerce ministry pledged to file a “lawsuit” against the US at the World Trade Organization.Trump’s tariffs include a retaliation clause to ratchet them up if Mexico, Canada or China try to impose their own tariffs in response.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cars move back and forth across the border between five and 10 times during assembly. This makes the whole of North America much less competitive, relative to Europe and Japan,” Summers posted on X.Klaas Knot, a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council, predicted Trump’s tariffs would lead to higher inflation and interest rates in the US that are likely to weaken the euro.Knot, who is also the Netherlands’ central bank president, told the Dutch television programme Buitenhof that trade wars harm all sides.“Europe will not want to be pushed around. We are also a powerful trade bloc with 400 million consumers,” Knot said.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeGlobal economyStock marketsEconomicsNasdaqDow JonesFTSEnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts say they are likely to climb further as an avian flu outbreak decimates flocks across the country.Though the avian flu has been in the US since 2022, the largest outbreak started in October and is still affecting millions of hens. About 14.7 million egg-producing chickens have been affected by the avian flu since the start of January, surpassing the number of hens affected in all of 2023, according todatafrom the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).“Based on the amount of birds that we have lost in the last few months, and the hen population, there just isn’t enough production to support the amount of demand that we have,” said Karyn Rispoli, managing director of eggs at the price-tracking firm Expana. “We’re at a point now where we’re truly in a shortage.”InDecemberthe number of table eggs produced fell 4.5% compared with thesame periodlast year, according to the USDA. With more hens infected with the avian flu in January, the number of eggs will probably continue to drop.How will the bird flu affect the Trump presidency? | Katrina vanden HeuvelRead moreThe avian flu is specifically affecting hens that produce table eggs as they are kept alive longer than broiler chickens, which are used for meat, making them more susceptible to infection during their lifetime. The US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsaysthat human infections of the avian flu are rare.Thewholesale priceof a dozen large eggs has been climbing as much as 40 cents a week as farmers struggle to produce enough eggs to keep up with demand. As of 24 January, the wholesale price of a dozen large eggs was $7.24 in New York, $6.84 in the midwest and $8.35 in California.But consumers often end up paying a different price at the store. Many grocery stores sell eggs at prices lower than their wholesale cost, taking a loss to ensure customers come back to the store for other items. Though average wholesale prices in mid-January were around $5.80, theaverage priceof eggs in stores was just above $4 – up from around $2.50 a year ago.Still, people are starting to see prices increase in some stores. Videos on social media show people shocked at seeing $15 cartons of eggs. “I’m going to have to start reselling,” one TikTok user jokes in avideo.Higher egg prices especially affect restaurants and bakeries, which often have to buy eggs wholesale.Line chart showing the average price of a dozen eggs in the US between 2014-2024“We’re known for our French macarons … and also these big stuffed cookies that are filled with cheesecake or Nutella – all items that are egg-heavy,” said Henry Crawford, co-owner of Sugar Bakery, which he runs with his wife, Ela, in Santa Cruz, California. The bakery uses about 800 eggs a week for its desserts. Sixty eggs used to cost about $13 for the business, but over the last several weeks the price has shot up to $19.“It’s making the margins a lot smaller,” Crawford said, adding that it’s difficult to raise prices for customers. “People become accustomed to paying a certain price.”Many Americans might feel a sense of deja vu as they read the price labels on egg shelves at the grocery store. Egg prices shot up in December 2022, after an earlier outbreak of avian flu, but eventually came back down after demand cooled following the holiday season.But this year, prices have yet to fall. “Retail demand in January hasn’t really let up all that much,” Rispoli said. People have “gotten used to higher egg prices, so it’s not really acting as a deterrent”.Ending the current avian flu outbreak will be tough. Egg producers have beenlobbyingthe federal government to help fund vaccine research and biosecurity to address the outbreak. The virus can spread from wild birds to domestic hens, and while the disease is known to spread from bird-to-bird contact, scientists are still unsure whether infections are airborne.If a single chicken in a flock is infected, the whole flock becomes at risk of infection. Orders for new chicks can take up to a year and a half to be fulfilled, meaning it is unclear when the number of egg-producing hens will get back to normal levels.Egg prices may become a sticky political point as Donald Trump and a Republican majority return to Washington. When a reporter asked the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, about the rising cost of eggs on Wednesday, Leavitt blamed the Biden administration for high prices.“This is an example of why it’s so incredibly important that the Senate moves swiftly to confirm all of President Trump’s nominees,” shesaid.Explore more on these topicsUS newsEggsBird fluTrump administrationFarmingFarm animalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Those games came hours after Donald Trump made his threat of import tariffs on Canada a reality.After Raptors fans initially cheered the 15-year-old girl singing the anthems, they booed throughout her performance of The Star-Spangled Banner. At the end, mixed boos and cheers could be heard before the crowd erupted in applause for the Canadian anthem, O Canada. Three of the five starters on the Raptors are American and they glanced at each other as the boos rang out. Sportsnet reporter Michael Grange, who was at the game,wrote on Xthat fans emphasised the word“free” in the Canadian anthem. The game ended in a 115-108 victory for the Raptors.Raptors forward Garrett Temple, who is American, said the players were well aware of the booing.“Yeah, of course I noticed it,” he said. “The reaction [was], ‘Wow.’ And then you just think about why they’re booing. A lot of things bigger than basketball going on in the world right now. At the end of the day, we play in an arena that’s inCanadaand they’re Canadian citizens, so they have a certain feeling about the trade situation going on, the tariffs. The people that booed let their thoughts be known.”One of the Raptors’ Canadian players, Kelly Olynyk, said he had had sympathy for the anthem singer.“Obviously [the tariffs have] an impact on a lot of people in this country and in this stadium,” he said. “I felt bad for the girl singing but they cheered her at the end, so I was happy for that.”On Saturday,Trump placed tariffson goods from Canada, Mexico and China after claiming the three countries allow immigrants and illegal drugs into the US. In addition, energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a 10% rate.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico’s president have ordered retaliatory tariffs on goods from America in response.The booing of The Star-Spangled Banner in Canada is rare, but not unheard of especially when tied to world events. In the early 2000s, fans at games in Canada booed to show their disapproval of the US-led war in Iraq.Trump has been the subject of booing himself at sports events. During his first term as president he was jeered and greeted with “lock him up” chants by Washington Nationals fansduring the 2019 World Series. He has alsobeen cheered loudlyat college football games.Explore more on these topicsNBAToronto RaptorsUS sportsBasketballTrump administrationCanadaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The Mavericks could benefit this year but the Lakers look winners in the long-termClaire de LuneSun 2 Feb 2025 11.08 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 19.26 ESTShareEvery lifetime, you get to experience a few “where were you when?” moments. Finding out Michael Jackson died. The American presidency being called for Donald Trump in 2016. And any true NBA fan will remember where they were on the evening of 1 February 2025. I was waiting in line for a drink at a bar in Los Angeles when a friend tapped me on the shoulder and asked: “Have you seen this fakeShams tweet?”The tweet, as it turns out,was real, as unbelievable as it still may be. The Dallas Mavericks have, indeed,traded Luka Dončić, the 25-year-old who was supposed to be the face of the franchise for years to come, to the Los Angeles Lakers. In return, they will get the man who was supposed to lead the Lakers for the next five years or so, 31-year-old Anthony Davis. There are a few more players involved in the trade (who will be discussed below), and even a third team in the Utah Jazz to help facilitate the deal. But for all intents and purposes, this was the most dramatic case possible of bona fide top 10-superstar musical chairs.Mavs’ Luka Dončić headed to Lakers in blockbuster trade for Anthony DavisRead moreNow, to attempt to make early sense of what this trade means in what will most likely go down as the most shocking trade inNBAhistory. We should also note that at the time of publication, the trade has not been officially confirmed.The nitty grittyThe Mavericks receive:Davis, Max Christie, the Lakers’ 2029 first-round pick, $55,000 in cash from Utah.The Lakers receive:Dončić, Maxi Kleber, Markieff Morris, $55,000 in cash from Utah.The Jazz receive:Jalen Hood-Schifino, the Clippers’ 2025 second-round pick (via the Lakers), the Mavericks’ 2025 second-round pick. (We won’t delve into how this trade affects the Jazz, as it’s mostly inconsequential asset shuffling.)View image in fullscreenLuka Dončić is one of the best players in the league … and entering his prime years.Photograph: LM Otero/APHow this affects the Dallas MavericksPerhaps the most shocking element of this trade is that the Mavericks decided to cut bait with a supposedly untouchable franchise cornerstone at the beginning of his prime – it was less than a year ago thathe led Dallas to the NBA finals. Whilereports have emergedthat Dallas had concerns about Dončić’s defense and his commitment to “conditioning”, (fancy GM language for fitness), it’s reasonable to wonder if there’s more to the story than is being let on. Dončić, a five-time All-Star and one of the best players of his generation, was eligible fora supermax contractthis year, and it’s fascinating that, instead of giving it to him, Dallas decided to get out of the Luka business altogether. To add to the mystery, early reporting indicates that Dončić wasn’t really shopped to teams other than the Lakers, so there wasn’t a chance to find out if the Mavericks could have received a bigger haul for him. Very curious indeed.In the meantime, Dallas are left with a formidable roster to attempt a championship run this year, assuming the team’s other superstar, Kyrie Irving, and Davis can shrug off nagging injuries. They also picked up Christie, a 21-year-old three-and-D wing, in the deal. He has impressed in a starting role for the Lakers this year with his increasingly reliable jump shooting and ability to guard the opposing team’s best player most nights. The Mavericks kept ascending star center Dereck Lively II, and important additional depth players such asPJ Washington, Daniel Gafford and Klay Thompson. This version of the Mavericks is huge, defensively gifted and skilled. If Davis can continue playing to his ceiling, as he has done for much of this season, Dallas aren’t out of the championship huntthis year, even without Dončić.The future is where things start to get a little murky. Sure, a six-year age gap between Davis and Dončić isn’t a big deal among us mere mortals, but in the competitive lifespan of an NBA player, it’s eons – the Mavs have swapped a player coming into his prime for one who is approaching the end of his. And if the Mavericks were really motivated by health concerns for Dončić, they won’t be sleeping a whole lot sounder with Davis, who, while remarkably healthy for the last two seasons, has been injury-prone his entire career. Davis is undoubtedly worlds better than Dončić on defense, but Dončić is one of the best offensive players in the league, so it’s a hard sell for the Mavs to opt for an equally health-challenged player who’s significantly older and, though a formidable scorer in his own right, an offensive downgrade. Not to mention that, by all accounts, Davis was blindsided by the deal, and there’s no guarantee he’ll choose to stay in Dallas in the long run.So, there are certainly reasons for Mavericks fans to be optimistic about their team’s new setup, at least in the short-term. But unless Dončić has some deep, dark secret we don’t know about – health-related or otherwise – trading him away at this point in his career is averybizarre move by the Mavericks, and there isn’t really another way to frame it.View image in fullscreenLeBron James and Anthony Davis have developed a close relationship at the Lakers.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APFor the Los Angeles LakersDavis recentlysat down with Shams Charaniato reiterate his desire toplay the fouralongside another high-caliber big man. Little did he know, he would soon get his wish – it would just come in a trade to Dallas, where he will line up alongside Lively. It’s a mind-blowing change of course for this Lakers team, which had looked like it was finally starting to fire on all cylinders and find a clear identity in a Western Conference loaded with talent. But the move also makes sense for a franchise that has always prioritized having the biggest stars wearing purple and gold.It seems a bit counterintuitive to say that the Lakers a) made a trade that nearly any other team would have jumped at, b) almost certainly “won” the trade and c) that it could very well derail any momentum they had been building towards an NBA championship this year. But that’s my initial take. Before the trade, the Lakers roster was a couple of pieces away from true championship contention. And that’s due in large part to a newly embraced identity as a swarming, defensive-minded team. That identity was forged by a combination of factors, including an earlier trade for a pitbull of a wing in Dorian Finney-Smith, the return of defensive savant Jarred Vanderbilt, the meteoric rise of Christie, and, most importantly, leaning into the strengths of Davis, one of the best defensive players in the league.Christie and Davis have now been traded for Dončić, a player who, on hisbestday, is a “meh” defender. Even so, the Slovenian is only 25 and one of the best players in the world, thanks to his offensive wizardry. But the team, and its nascent and promising identity, has been flipped on its head overnight.And then there’s the truly fascinating case of where this leaves LeBron James, who is 40 and arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, a precarious combination in and of itself. There is plenty of nuance to be found here: James and Davis, who won a championship together in 2020, had grown extremely close in their years as Lakers teammates, and share an agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. It has been widely reported that James and Davis were kept entirely in the dark about the trade, and that LeBron wasblindsided with the news while at a family dinner.It would be understandable if James – known for his desire to have a say in how his teams are run – was upset at being left out of the planning for the trade. And Dončić, who shares many playing traits with James, is clearly being brought in to ultimately replace him as the face of the Lakers franchise when LeBron retires. But James has also made no secret of his admiration for Dončić,singing his praisesin the most public of forums. Brian Windhorst, ESPN’s resident LeBron expert, evenreportedthat James has long “dreamed” of teaming up with Dončić and explored ways to make it happen in years past. In some ways, this could sink James’s last chance at a championship, while ending a close partnership with his friend Davis. In others, it’s a dream come true. To say James is probably experiencing mixed emotions is an understatement.The Dončić trade, though, ultimately isn’t about James, and it isn’t about this year for the Lakers. It’s about the future, which, until this weekend, looked mightily unclear for one of the world’s marquee sports franchises. The Lakers have found their next superstar, their next face of the franchise, and they had to give up a lot less than most would have imagined. If that chance is available, you take it, even if it’s half blindfolded and drunk on Slovenian wine. If the Lakers want to stay in the mix as a contender this season, they’ll need to use their miraculously intact remaining assets to upgrade at center in Davis’ absence, and the Dončić/James pairing will probably be a clunky fit to start. But with Dončić in their arsenal for the indefinite future – and some great supporting cast members still around, such as Austin Reaves – the Lakers’ Showtime shows no signs of a curtain call.Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićNBADallas MavericksLos Angeles LakersBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The moment of the match was provided by Myles Lewis‑Skelly; the image of it, too.When the precociously talented 18-year-old scored with a curling shot for 3-1, crowning a driving performance, he sank into a meditative yoga pose that had previously been the copyright of Erling Haaland. What a way to score and celebrate your first senior goal.It was a dig at the Manchester City striker after the acrimony ofthe 2-2 draw between the clubsat the ­Etihad Stadium last September, which had featured – among other things – a bust-up between him and his ­Arsenal marker, Gabriel Magalhães. Haaland was also keen to tell Mikel Arteta to “stay humble” as tempers flared after full time.Arsenal 5-1 Manchester City: Premier League – live reactionRead moreFor a brief moment it looked as though Haaland would have the last laugh. It was he who rose in the 55th minute to equalise Martin ­Ødegaard’s early goal. But this was a day when Arsenal flexed their muscles, when they had too much power and desire. And when City subsided in end-of-era fashion.Arteta’s team knew they had to win to remain on the coattails of the ­Premier League leaders, ­Liverpool; to keep their title dreams alive, ­however faint they have come to feel. ­Liverpool have just been remorseless. Arsenal did so, ­absorbing the ­Haaland goal to subject City to an ordeal.Thomas Partey’s deflected shot put them back in front and after Lewis‑Skelly’s tour de force, they were on their way to the rout. The pressure was lifted. They enjoyed themselves. Kai Havertz scored for 4-1, the striker making amends for a glaring first-half miss and the ­picture-perfect afternoon was completed when Arsenal’s 17-year-old prodigy, Ethan Nwaneri, on as a ­substitute, drifted inside to bend home a ­wonderful shot.View image in fullscreenThomas Partey’s goal was crucial to Arsenal’s win, coming 38 seconds after Erling Haaland’s equaliser.Photograph: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Getty ImagesIt was too easy for Arsenal and the latest occasion when it was hard to recognise City from previous seasons. The concessions were marked not only by errors but a looseness about their defensive work, a sluggishness, a reluctance to get tight. Pep Guardiola has long since conceded the title. What price them salvaging anything from the most difficult season of his dynasty at the club? On this evidence, they cannot hope to get past Real Madrid in their upcoming Champions League playoff.Arsenal brought the intensity at the outset and they were in front inside two minutes, the concession a disaster for City and a horror show for Manuel Akanji.The centre-half accepted a pass from John Stones and he wanted too much time. When Akanji then took a heavy touch, Leandro ­Trossard was quick to get a foot in, the ball ­breaking for Declan Rice, whose first-time pass found Havertz. He was onside, City’s defensive structure in tatters, Stones still deep. Havertz went square for Ødegaard and the finish was a simple one.The tensions simmered. Gabriel Martinelli had the ball in the City net minutes later, dinking Stefan Ortega after an Ødegaard pass only for the offside flag to deny him. At the other end, Gabriel turned to scream in Haaland’s face. Gabriel had talked of a “war” at the Etihad Stadium and how Arsenal would be waiting for City. Everybody was on edge.City stabilised for a while and there was the moment when they almost equalised, Josko Gvardiol ­rising to meet an Omar Marmoush corner and David Raya pushing the ball up and watching it come back down on top of the ­crossbar, with Haaland waiting underneath. Savinho also extended the Arsenal goalkeeper with the first half about to end.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal set the traps and it was remarkable to see Ortega fall into one on 26 minutes. Mateo Kovacic surely did not want the ball with Rice so close and he was duly dispossessed outside his area. It was another dividend of the Arsenal hustle. The ball fell to Havertz and he had the time to pick his spot against Ortega and the covering Stones. He dragged wide.View image in fullscreenEthan Nwaneri scores the fifth goal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCity knew the onus was on them. They squeezed perilously high. Phil Foden roamed from the right flank, trying to make something happen. Which he did. Only to then undo the good work almost immediately.First Foden went up through the lines for Savinho, a lovely little pass and, when the Brazilian stood up the cross, Haaland had the position in front of William Saliba. He leapt high and seemed to hang there before thumping the header beyond Raya.City were soon behind again and it was not a moment that Foden will enjoy rewatching. His crossfield pass went straight to Partey, whose shot from distance took a heavy deflection off Stones to beat Ortega. Arsenal did not look back thereafter, and there was a final insult for City when it was all over. The play-out song inside the stadium?

In a statement United said: “Manchester United forwardMarcus Rashfordhas joined Aston Villa on loan until the end of the 2024-25 season. Everyone at Manchester United wishes Marcus good luck for the rest of the season.”Manchester United punished by Mateta double in defeat by Crystal PalaceRead moreA minimum 75% of Rashford’s £365k-a-week wage will be covered by Villa, rising to 90% depending on performance-based bonuses. The Midlands club have an option to buy in the summer, with the fee understood to be in the region of £40m.Speaking before the announcement, Amorim denied that United would be “embarrassed” if Rashford proves a prolific scorer for Villa during his loan.The head coach spoke after overseeingUnited’s 2-0 loss against Crystal Palaceat Old Trafford, a seventh home league defeat in their opening 13 games, which matches the club’s poorest-ever start, in the 1893‑94 season. The result was made all the worse when Lisandro Martínez was taken off on a stretcher in the second half with Amorim describing the injury as a “serious situation”.United have scored just 28 times in the top flight – only the bottom three clubs plus Everton have scored fewer. With Amorim’s team struggling to find the net he was asked if it would be humiliating for United if Rashford scores many times for Villa.The 40-year-old Portuguese said: “Humiliating? It’s not embarrassing. When you loan a player – and I don’t think it’s official – you expect him to play and to improve, so there is nothing humiliating there. I understand the question but I am just focused on my players, that’s all. When the window closes, I will be really focused on just our team and to improve our team.”Rashford said: “I would like to thank Manchester United and Aston Villa for making this loan deal happen. I was lucky to have a few clubs approach me but Aston Villa was an easy decision - I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager’s ambitions.“I just want to play football and am excited to get started. I wish everyone at Manchester United all the best for the rest of the season.”Men’s transfer window January 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreUnited are targeting the Bayern Munich forwardMathys Tel as a loan replacement,although it is thought the deal is in the balance after United had two bids rejected. Amorim was asked about his potential arrival. “When the window closes we will see the players. I’m focused on improving the team as a group, we need to win more games and we will try to do that, this season is like that. We need small improvements, try to win points, win the momentum, then we had setbacks and we go again.“But it’s clear we need to improve. We’ll see – there is one more day [of the market], let’s wait until the window closes. We have to improve as a team to score goals and we are trying the best to improve the team. This market is really hard on the clubs to make some deals here. It’s hard.”Arsenal are also in the running to loan Tel, who rejected a permanent move to Tottenham after they agreed a £50m fee with Bayern last week.Meanwhile, Amorim admitted real concern over the Martínez injury. “We are going to see in the next few days but I think it is a serious situation,” said the head coach. “He is not only a great player but a strong character in the dressing room. He felt it and when you are a player, you know when it is something serious. We are here to help him in this difficult moment like he has helped us.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMarcus RashfordRuben AmorimTransfer windowCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

And he was smiling with him. Pep Guardiola does that. Cole, you’re being played.”However Maresca saw nothing inappropriate about Palmer’s behaviour. “I don’t think Pep is playing a game, especially after the game is finished,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “I don’t know what kind of game you are playing when the game is finished.“But you probably have to ask him the reason why he [Neville] said that. Sometimes we finish the game and I go on the pitch and find an opposition player I know. I have a chat with him. If we say something we laugh.“Even the Fulham game we lost, I had [Timothy] Castagne at Leicester, I had a chat with him on the pitch, we were saying something and I was laughing. But it was not because I was happy to lose the game. It was just a moment.”There was amusement at the idea that Guardiola was getting in Palmer’s head. “OK!” Maresca said. “If you ask Cole if you remember what he said, I don’t think so.”Maresca, who said it is not ideal that his side host West Ham on deadline day, addressed the uncertainty around one of his top earners, Ben Chilwell. The left-back has interest from Crystal Palace before the window shuts on Monday night and is unlikely to feature for Chelsea if he does not leave. Maresca was dismissive when asked if Chilwell, who has not played in the Premier League this season, has shown signs of adapting to his tactical approach in trainings“One thing I can say about ‘Chilly’ is he has been a top professional, working every day,” he said. “But because of the situation and because of my choice he has struggled to get minutes. The decision is he can leave.

With us he was playing midfielder, attacking midfielder, full-back in some moments, a central defender in some games.

This year was particularly exciting as a huge crop of the league’s stars – including Breanna Stewart, Kelsey Plum, Jewell Loyd, Brittney Griner and more – were able to test the waters of free agency, some for the first time.As with any period of growth and upheaval, women’s basketball is in the middle of a truly critical moment. TV ratings are up,attendance is way up; Unrivaled ispulling in impressive viewershipeach week in Miami, and AU Pro Basketball kicks off its newest season in Nashville this month.On top of that, some teams are able to offer athletes more than others. In 2025 there appears to be a player emphasis on getting what they deserve – and it’s been a long time coming.Here are five of the biggest shake-ups that came out of the free-agency window:1) Kelsey Plum to the Sparks and Jewell Loyd to the AcesThe Los Angeles Sparks, Las Vegas Aces and Seattle Storm entered into a blockbuster three-way deal that ultimately might see the Storm coming out on top (depending on how the team the 2025 draft pick it receives). Plum will depart the Aces for the Sparks, Loyd will leave the Storm for the Aces, while the Storm will snag the second overall draft pick (which could end up being Notre Dame’s Olivia Miles), Li Yueru, and a 2026 first-rounder.The Sparks will also receive the No 9 overall pick this year and a 2026 second-round pick from the Storm. In addition to Loyd, the Aces get the No 13 pick in the 2025 draft.The addition of Plum to the Sparks is a massive win for the team, who will also welcome back Cameron Brink after an ACL tear early in the 2024 season. The Sparks’ backcourt was dismal last season, and Plum will inject much-needed energy and superior defense that could even lift the team into title contention.Loyd is a powerhouse shooter when she’s on fire, but in recent seasons she’s struggled with efficiency. Still, it’s clear she has plenty to give, and playing alongside A’ja Wilson might be the boost she needs.If anyone wins this trade, it’s the Storm, especially if they bring Miles in this year. The team already boasts a healthy crop of young talent and Miles will fit right in. It’s difficult to imagine any other trade scenarios that would have given the team a shot at drafting a player who so efficiently runs the floor – something the Storm definitely need.Grade for the SparksBGrade for the AcesB-minusGrade for the StormA2) Brittney Griner trades Phoenix for AtlantaOne big surprise that came out of free agency is Griner – who has played with the Phoenix Mercury since she was drafted by the team with the first overall pick in 2013 and who previously seemed unlikely to ever walk away –deciding to join the Dream. Playing in Unrivaled has changed Griner’s perspective, as the 6ft 9in center told reporters in Miami, and she ultimately decided to swap the southwest for the southeast.Griner will give the Dream the defensive anchor they lack and should help propel the team above last year’s 15-25 record. She will likely replace Tina Charles as the starting center and will offer veteran leadership for youngsters like Rhyne Howard, a former No 1 overall pick. Overall, this is a good deal that will help the Mercury free up cap space for Satou Sabally while helping the Dream build their defensive prowess.Grade for the DreamB3) Satou Sabally to the Mercury and NaLyssa Smith to the WingsAn absolutely massive trade between the Mercury, Dallas Wings and Indiana Fever was pulled off seemingly without a hitch. The Wings will send Sabally, who revealed she had already played her last game with the team mid-way through free agency discussion, to the Mercury. Smith will leave the Indiana Fever for the Wings, and the Fever will add Sophie Cunningham to their own roster.The Wings also gained point guard Ty Harris, the reserved rights to Kiki Herbert Harrigan and the No 8 pick from this year’s draft. In addition to Cunningham, the Fever gained Kalani Brown, the No 19 pick in this year’s draft while reserving rights to Sevgi Uzun.On top of that, the Wings have also added DiJonai Carrington from the Sun, the No 12 overall draft pick this year, and the right to swap picks with the Sun in next year’s draft.The Mercury came out on top with this deal. Sabally was the most sought-after free agent this year, and she’d previously made it clear that she wanted to join a team with top-tier facilities. But with this specific trade, everyone is a winner: each team received players they need and key draft picks.Grade for the WingsAGrade for the MercuryA-plusGrade for the FeverBView image in fullscreenBrittney Griner is headed to Atlanta after 11 years with Phoenix.Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images4) Alyssa Thomas joins the MercuryThomas, an 11-year vet of the Connecticut Sun, jumped ship from the northeastern team and will play for the Mercury this year (and it’s believed Phoenix are doing their best to land Thomas’ fiancee, DeWanna Bonner, from the Sun as well). In exchange, Natasha Cloud and Rebecca Allen will join the Sun, who will also get this year’s No 12 draft pick.The move is a powerful one for the Mercury, who need Thomas’ defensive skills. It also appears to indicate that head coach Nate Tibbets is putting energy and effort into building a team of his own design, and one that Thomas will be a key component of.With the loss of Carrington and Thomas, the Sun have officially lost their entire starting line-up (as well as former head coach Stephanie White, who went to the Fever last year) ahead of this year’s draft. This is an interesting moment for the team, who made it to the playoffs in 2024, and their rebuild will be worth watching. Cloud was third in the league for assists per game last year (Thomas was second), making this feel like an even trade.Grade for the MercuryAGrade for the SunB5) Natasha Howard returns to the FeverFree agency also brought about the return of Natasha Howard to the Fever, something fans of Caitlin Clark’s team should be pretty excited about. The three-time champion was drafted by the Fever as the fifth overall pick in 2014.Howard will definitely give a veteran boost to the team’s younger roster, including Clark and Aliyah Boston. She spent two seasons with the Fever under White before moving on to the Minnesota Lynx, the Storm, the New York Liberty and the Wings, andshe seems happyabout returning back to her original basketball home. The Fever will also benefit from her defensive presence – and her championship pedigree.Grade for the FeverAExplore more on these topicsWNBABasketballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, Knueppel scored 13 of his game-high 22 points in the second half and added five rebounds and five assists.Tyrese Proctor had 17 points and Sion James 13 for the Blue Devils, who forced nine of North Carolina’s 14 total turnovers in the first half and led by as many as 27 points before intermission.RJ Davis and Drake Powell each scored 12 points and Seth Trimble netted 10 for North Carolina (13-10, 6-5), who lost for the fourth time in five outings. Duke snapped a two-game losing streak in the series.Flagg scored or assisted on Duke’s first 18 points of the game. He sank two three-pointers and converted a three-point play while also assisting on a pair of James dunks, plus a triple and a dunk by Proctor.When Knueppel hit a three and another jumper 31 seconds apart, it capped a 16-0 Duke run for a 23-6 lead less than seven minutes into the contest.View image in fullscreenCooper Flagg of the Duke Blue Devils attempts to block a shot during the second half of Saturday’s game against the North Carolina Tar Heels at Cameron Indoor Stadium.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesElliot Cadeau’s three-pointer pulled North Carolina within 16 points before Duke’s defense went back to work. The Blue Devils made the Tar Heels miss their next nine attempts from the floor, two of them swatted away by Flagg. Duke stitched together an 11-point run of mostly free throws for an overwhelming 40-13 lead with 5:16 left in the half.Flagg’s fadeaway jumper at the first-half buzzer made it 47-25 Blue Devils and gave the freshman 13 points in the half to go with four boards, five assists and two steals.Duke made its first six shots from the floor of the second half.

But when Flagg knocked down his third three-pointer of the game, it handed Duke their first 30-point advantage of the night at 74-44 with 9:53 still on the clock.North Carolina cut a 32-point deficit to 16 in the final stages, as Powell gave the team a late boost with all 12 of his points coming in the final 12 minutes.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsBasketballShareReuse this content"

It came, of course, from the prodigiously talented Myles Lewis‑Skelly. Although it wasn’t perhaps the obvious one.With 62 minutes gone at the Emirates Stadium, Lewis‑Skelly took a sharp pass from Declan Rice and twirled inside with an easy kind of grace, one of those players who just seems to have that naturally intimate relationship with the ball.Guardiola admits City’s confidence is ‘fragile’ as Arsenal breaks title defenceRead moreLewis-Skelly is an interesting footballer in lots of ways. He isn’t actually a full-back, or wasn’t before he came into the first team. Then again, full-back is a mutable thing now, the whizziest, most postmodern position on the pitch, engine of tactical reinvention, new lines and angles. We’re all inverted false-flank innovators these days.It says a lot about Lewis-Skelly’s intelligence and range of technical skills that he has been able to pick up that evolving role on the hoof. And not least to play as he did here, as a shield, cutting edge and overload in midfield against the coach who brought that innovation into the English league, as first glimpsed in the strange, loitering manoeuvres of Pablo Zabaleta, back when the world was still young, tackles were a thing and goalkeepers didn’t do stepovers.Here Pep Guardiola cut an increasingly gloomy figure as the afternoon wore on, watching the game from deep within his thick grey woollen robes, and sat slumped on his bench looking like a sad dying Jedi by the time Ethan Nwaneri curled in an outrageous stoppage‑time goal to make it5-1 to Arsenal.That wasn’t the best moment, though. Neither was what Lewis‑Skelly did next, although this was a genuinely high‑end piece of skill, carrying the ball forward, switching the angle of his hips mid‑stride, then curling a shot on the run into the far corner of the City net.The best moment was Lewis‑Skelly’s celebration. This was The Haaland, the lotus position plus deep-thought pose, Yoga‑Haaland, an outrageous piece of craphousery given the ongoing needle between his teammates and City’s superstar striker. Best of all it was a really good version of The Haaland, suggestive of someone who has actually planned and practised this, an 18-year-old full-back making a contingency for when he scores against the champions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At which point, with teenagers scoring goals, revenge-banter arcs, and a total destruction of your rivals of the past two years, a sense of reality must intrude just a little.View image in fullscreenArsenal fans perform the Poznan while a glum Pep Guardiola looks on.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesThere was always a slight air of escapism about all this, of a lost weekend playing the old tunes. If you’d told Arsenal’s fans after the 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium that they would win the return 5-1 to go nine points clear of City the assumption would have been, OK, someone book the giant cake with an Arsène Wenger lookalike inside. We’re into the victory lap here.In reality this game always had a slight Joshua versus Fury vibe, a champion clash without any obvious belt on the line. And even here there was evidence of exactly why Arsenal aren’t running away with the league.The Emirates Stadium was crisp and clear at kick-off, the sky a lovely powder-blue wash above the lip of the stand. And Arsenal took the lead in the second minute through Martin Ødegaard after a low-comedy attempt to play out from the back. At which point there was a notable dropping of the revs.For a while in that first half Ødegaard seemed to be playing a different game to his teammates, haring about with genuine urgency, like the last man standing in a zombie apocalypse movie. Arsenal didn’t have another shot for 23 minutes. They missed the odd glaring chance. Kai Havertz had some Kai Havertz moments in front of goal. This team have a ruthless manager, a ruthless setup, a ruthless on-field style. But somehow they still aren’t a ruthless team. At least, not when it comes to the final gloss.Haaland equalised early in the second half. Thomas Partey made it 2-1. City duly collapsed. For Arsenal, the gap to Liverpool is six points. There really is nothing wrong with this team that a little more in the way of edge, an actual goal scorer couldn’t solve. Here they had an afternoon of catharsis. Shot through, perhaps, with a vague sense of regret.Explore more on these topicsArsenalManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was the visitors, Arsenal, who came out on top to surely confine the remainder of Manchester City’s Women’s Super League campaign to merely a battle for European qualification.City’s fourth defeat in their past six WSL games was another engrossing but mistake filled match that will be hugely damaging for their hopes of domestic success. On the overall share of the chances, Arsenal probably deserved to edge an end-to-end contest.Quick GuideWSL roundup: Blues battle past Villa, Everton climb tableShowChelseaextended their unbeaten streak to 21 games with a narrow 1-0 win away atAston Villa. The reigning WSL champions were far from their best at Villa Park but super-sub Mayra Ramírez ignited a much-needed spark in the 82nd minute. Receiving the ball just inside Aston Villa’s half, the forward made a powerful run down the right before cutting in and sending a low cross towards the six-yard box. Sarah Mayling attempted to make the clearance but instead tapped it into her own net. Despite the loss, it was a positive performance from Aston Villa who showed clear signs of improvement under new manager Natalia Arroyo after just one week in charge. Kirsty Hanson came closest for the hosts when her long-range effort hit the crossbar.Manchester Unitedreturned to second in the table with a 1-0 win over Tottenham. Elisabeth Terland’s sixth-minute strike proved to be decisive as Marc Skinner’s side moved seven points behind Chelsea. After receiving the ball from Ella Toone on the right, full-back Jayde Riviere found Terland in the box with a pinpoint cross. The striker then wrapped her foot around it to fire her shot into the bottom-left corner. That result takes United to five successive WSL victories.Evertonbounced back from last weekend’s defeat to West Ham with a crucial 4-1 win against fellow strugglersLeicester City. Shannon O’Brien cancelled out Kelly Gago’s early opener with a 16th-minute strike, but the hosts regained their lead just after half-time through Katja Snoeijs before Honoka Hayashi and another strike from Gago sealed the victory at Walton Hall Park. The result saw Everton leapfrog both West Ham and Aston Villa up to eighth in the table.Across Merseyside,Liverpoolgot back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory overWest Ham. Ceri Holland was the instigator of the decisive strike, weaving around two opposition players before firing a dangerous pass through to Leanne Kiernan, who flicked the ball past Kinga Szemik with the outside of her right boot. 'I think it was just important to get three points and also another clean sheet, which is really positive,' said the Liverpool manager, Matt Beard.Finally, relegation candidatesCrystal Palacetook a crucial point fromBrightonthanks to a late equaliser from My Cato at the Broadfield Stadium. The hosts took the lead through a Lily Woodham own goal in the 18th minute before Brighton's Maisie Symonds saw red for a late challenge on Aimee Everett. The result left Palace 12th in the table, three points adrift of safety.Emillia HawkinsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The errors were littered throughout almost every big moment in the match and began inside the first minute when Laia Aleixandri was dispossessed while trying to control a short pass from goalkeeper Khiara Keating and Mariona Caldentey put Arsenal in front. The away side were 2-0 up just seven minutes later when Keating attempted to punch clear Kyra Cooney-Cross’s free-kick but was beaten to the ball in the air by Lotte Wubben-Moy, who headed in.Gareth Taylor defended 20-year-old Keating, who also made errors in their4-2 defeatagainst Manchester United in January, saying: “We have to be really careful with these young players that we don’t just jump on the bandwagon straight away and lay all of the blame with them.“If you want to blame someone, then blame me. Blame me. I pick the team. I back my players all of the time. But for us to all of a sudden just look at the game, see the four goals and point to Khiara straight away, I think that is a little bit tough, because we know that there’s a very good goalkeeper in there, but who at the moment is suffering. Our job is to help her and support her as best we possibly can. If that support looks like me pushing back on questions from yourself, then I will do.”Taylor’s team were the stronger for the remainder of the first half, though, and halved the deficit when Mary Fowler nodded in Aoba Fujino’s right-wing cross, which perhaps the Arsenal goalkeeper, Daphne van Domselaar, will feel she could have done better with. The mistakes from both teams continued after half-time, with Caldentey giving away possession on the edge of her own penalty area to allow the former Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema to score her fifth goal in her past four appearances in all competitions.View image in fullscreenVivianne Miedema’s goal against her former club proved to be in vain.Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty ImagesIt was also the second time this season that Miedema had scored against her old club, since her summer switch from north London to the east side of Manchester. A minute later, Arsenal went 3-2 up as they sliced through the home side’s defence to see Frida Maanum score in front of their travelling fans.The next mistake to lead to a goal appeared to come from the officials, as a penalty was awarded for a foul on Fujino by Steph Catley that appeared to have occurred just outside the box, rather than inside it. Fowler did not care and dutifully dispatched the equaliser from the spot.More momentary lapses followed, with Keating running 30 yards out of her goal to try to intercept a long pass but timing it badly, allowing Stina Blackstenius to go around her and appear certain to score – but the Sweden striker had run too wide and was too hesitant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was hurt of course after the loss against Chelsea. We analysed it. I asked: ‘Who are we? What is the Arsenal way? What is our identity? How will we win games against top opposition?’ The girls were all with us.“It wasn’t the end of the world from a performance perspective against Chelsea but the loss of the three points meant a lot. I think the group is so strong from game to game and also within the games that we can show resilience and come back – which is what we did today.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballManchester City WomenArsenal Womenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The striker is set to undergo a medical before moving to the London Stadium for a reunion with Graham Potter, who gave the 20-year-old his professional debut.Ferguson played for Potter at Brighton and will provide a boost to the new West Ham manager’s attacking options, while also having the opportunity to play regularly. West Ham have been in the market for a new forward after losing Michail Antonio and Niclas Füllkrug to injury.Men’s transfer window January 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreWest Ham have been assessing various options and faced strong competition for Ferguson, who has just returned from an ankle injury. Bayer Leverkusen wanted the Republic of Ireland international, who has scored once this season, and there has been interest from Arsenal, Bournemouth, Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham.The club are targeting Lorient’s Eli Junior Kroupi, an 18-year-old who is also on Bournemouth’s radar after shining in Ligue 2 this season, as well as Celtic’s Daniel Cummings and the Liverpool midfielder Tyler Morton.Celtic are unhappy about the prospect of losing Cummings and it is unclear if the 18-year-old will join before the transfer window shuts on Monday night. If a deal cannot be agreed before the deadline then it is understood that Cummings will sign a pre-contract with West Ham for the summer, with compensation due to Celtic.Crystal Palacehave agreed a six-month loan for left wing-back Ben Chilwell after reaching an agreement withChelseaover his salary. The 28-year-old England international, who has been frozen out of Enzo Maresca’s plans and has made only one appearance this season, will provide competition to Tyrick Mitchell. Earlier in the transfer window Chelsea recalled fellow defender Trevoh Chalobah from his loan at Selhurst Park.Oliver Glasner’s side are also in the market for a central defender and have been linked to Union Berlin’s Danilho Doekhi, Tiago Djaló of Juventus and Milan’s Strahinja Pavlovic.Brightonhave had two bids for Sunderland’s teenage winger, Tommy Watson, rejected.

He doesn’t just look like a good player, he is a good player. Once he gets up to fitness in terms of how I want him to press the game, he’s going to be a fantastic player again.“He’s emotional. The journey that he’s been on since being here and then leaving, just not having that feeling. It’s a really, really difficult club when you come away from it, especially when you’re a player like him, when you’re adored to that level that he was when he was here the first time. He probably thought he was never going to feel that again.“So, to come back and get the goal, and obviously the support, they idolise him. Just like for every player, you want to feel wanted, appreciated, and he knows he has that here. He’s had the sample now of two moves that haven’t quite worked out. He also has probably a more realistic feeling of the actual size of the club, and what Celtic can give him.So, my feeling is that he’ll come back even hungrier and be even better than he was the first time.”Jota’s goal came after some sustained Celtic pressure but Motherwell were briefly level when Luke Armstrong cancelled out Maeda’s first-minute opener, before Adam Idah restored the visitors’ lead.The Motherwell caretaker manager, Stephen Frail, was delighted with his players’ effort after a difficult week that started with theshock resignation of the manager Stuart Kettlewell. “Losing a goal so early in any game is tough, especially against a team with the quality of Celtic,” he said.“You kind of fear the worst. But they dug in, they battled, managed to get a goal back in the game, caused them a couple of problems in the first half with the ball, not as much in the second half as we would have liked. But the actual workrate, desire, shape, whatever it was, without the ball, I thought it was really good and something for us to build on.”Philippe Clement saidRangers“need to be happy” this week after backing up European success with a 4-0 thrashing ofRoss Countyat Ibrox.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tottenham have rarely known afternoons such as this under Ange ­Postecoglou but they summoned a textbook away performance, rolling up their sleeves and putting a halt to the previous seven weeks’ freefall.Spurs had not won a league game since 15 December, and that was against the flimsy proposition of ­Russell Martin’s Southampton. This time they dealt with one of the division’s most exacting physical examinations and there was no doubting the importance to their manager, who leapt off his seat and punched the air when Pape Matar Sarr put matters beyond doubt late on.Brentford 0-2 Tottenham: Premier League – live reactionRead moreIt will not remove the unease around Tottenham, which was demonstrated by regular chants from the away ­section demanding that Daniel Levy step down. But they had to start somewhere and, with the Austria defender Kevin Danso arriving from Lens and a move for Axel Disasi in their sights before the transfer deadline on Monday, Postecoglou might feel cautious optimism that the darkest hour has passed.Brentford might fear theirs is to come after a fourth home defeat in five. They were dominant between the boxes but failed where it counted in both. A flap by their goalkeeper Hákon Valdimarsson, leading to an own goal from Vitaly Janelt, brought Spurs’ opener and Yoane Wissa was far from his clinical best at the other end. Thomas Frank lamented a “missed opportunity” afterwards but their threat faded in the game’s last quarter and by the close they were reduced to wild swipes at goal.“In the context of where we are, it’s an important one,” Postecoglou said of three points that had hardly been nailed on at the outset. Spurs had started with another makeshift back line, Micky van de Ven not deemed ready to build on his comeback against Elfsborg and Radu ­Dragusin sidelined with what may be a serious knee injury. “It doesn’t look good,” Postecoglou said of the Romanian’s problem, which will be assessed by a specialist on Monday.It meant another deployment at centre-back for Archie Gray, whose performance was impeccable. Frank said Spurs’ defending of the penalty area was “some of the best I’ve seen all season”, which would ordinarily require a double take. The 18‑year‑old did not put a foot wrong, a first-half block from Kevin Schade’s goalbound shot among numerous interventions that required bravery and immaculate ttiming.At left-back, the once maligned Djed Spence restricted Bryan Mbeumo to two or three dangerous deliveries. What was, on paper, a mish-mash had earned their fortune. “He’s had to bide his time,” Postecoglou said of Spence. “We needed him to become patient but also to mature a little bit. He’s one of those defenders who loves to take on the elite.”View image in fullscreenBrentford’s goalkeeper Hakon Valdimarsson is unable to stop the ball going in off Vitaly Janelt for Spurs’ first goal.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersPerhaps the post-match readings would have been different if Wissa had converted one of those Mbeumo crosses early on, instead heading over. Spurs had barely threatened in the first half-hour, some Dejan Kulusevski flashes aside, but a rare sortie saw Yves Bissouma’s shot deflected for a corner. Son Heung-min’s ball in from the left was devilish but Valdimarsson, playing due to Mark Flekken’s injury, had to be stronger. He was boxed in by Bissouma, who is hardly a colossus, and could not intervene before it cannoned in off the back of an unwitting Janelt.Give or take a few centimetres, the adage about settling for a ­winner off someone’s posterior seemed to ring true. Postecoglou would ­certainly have taken that and his players set about protecting it, Antonin ­Kinsky proving more resolute than his opposite number when batting away a vicious drive from Christian Nørgaard. A similarly rasping effort from Mbeumo rapped straight into the head of Richarlison, who came off mercifully lightly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Swede shot narrowly wide, as did his ­compatriot Kulusevski, but otherwise it was sleeves‑up time.Wissa surely had to equalise in the 54th minute after Schade had flicked on a ­Mikkel Damsgaard cross but, in front of goal, blasted over via the top of the bar. Set-pieces rained in, most of them repelled ­convincingly, and a Mbeumo attempt that spun out for a throw-in came to epitomise the sapping of Brentford’s belief.They had one last chance when Spence hacked away Fábio ­Carvalho’s overhead kick from near the line. Almost immediately Spurs sprang forward, slick work from Rodrigo Bentancur and, latterly, Son, feeding Sarr. A nudged finish ensured Postecoglou could celebrate.“Credit to the boys, they were brilliant,” he said. “The players have been hurting and I’m sure the ­supporters are.” Those fans milked the ­occasion, serenading the victors with ­renditions of “We are staying up”. Baby steps indeed, but this one was exactly that Tottenham needed.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Barça almost scored near the half-hour mark when Manu Sánchez’s attempt to clear Raphinha’s cross went to Lewandowski, but the Polish striker put his shot wide.Lewandowski then headed wide from Lamine Yamal’s cross in the 57th minute, but the two combined again four minutes later to put Barcelona ahead. Pedri’s lofted ball from the left reached Yamal, whose cross took a deflection off Nahuel Tenaglia and found Lewandowski, who volleyed home from close range.The Alavés goalkeeper, Jesús Owono stopped Yamal from doubling Barca’s lead, tipping away his shot to keep the away side in the game. Alavés then pushed for an unlikely equaliser, with Toni Martínez missing their best chance in the 87th minute when his attempt from Santiago Mouriño’s cross went wide.“Before the game we knew we had to win. We are a few points behind,” Lewandowski, the Spanish top flight’s leading scorer, said after netting his 18th goal of the season. “We can’t always win by three, four or five goals. We played with patience and vigilance and in the end we scored one more goal than the opponent.”The match was held up for several minutes when Gavi and Tomás Conechny clashed heads during an aerial challenge. Both players were substituted after receiving treatment on the pitch. “It’s the doctor’s decision. [Gavi] couldn’t continue playing and we have to respect that,” the Barcelona head coach, Hansi Flick, said afterwards.InSerie A,Napolispurned the chance to extend their lead at the top when they were held to a 1-1 draw away toRomaon Sunday, with Angeliño equalising in added time for the hosts.Leonardo Spinazzola scored against his former club to give Napoli the lead in the 29th minute but with time running out Roma snatched the goal to deny the away side what would have been a crucial win. Napoli are on 54 points, three ahead of Inter who still have a game in hand, while Roma stay ninth with 31 points.Milanhad a third derby win of the season firmly within their grasp before Inter netted late at San Siro on Sunday, and while the Milan manager, Sérgio Conceição,was clearly disappointed, he conceded that the 1-1 draw was the fairest outcome.Milan had won both previous meetings this season, with Conceição lifting the Italian Super Cup last month in his second game in charge after a 3-2 win over their rivals, but they were denied a hat-trick by Stefan de Vrij’s goal in added time. Tijjani Reijnders had put Milan ahead on the stroke of half-time.“We put on the field the attitude we wanted, Inter know each other very well and create a lot of difficulties for the opponents, it was important to curb their strengths and exploit some weaknesses,” Conceição said.View image in fullscreenKyle Walker made his Milan debut, on the day Manchester City were beaten 5-1 by Arsenal.Photograph: Image Photo Agency/Getty Images“In the end it is clear that we are disappointed, because we lost two points, but we saw all the joy they showed at the end. I think the draw is fair, but of course, mistakes are paid for.”The former Manchester City captain Kyle Walker made his Milan debut and the England manager, Thomas Tuchel, was watching in the stands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Empoli were awarded a penalty in the 15th minute, but the referee overturned his decision after a VAR check revealed an attacking handball.View image in fullscreenRandal Kolo Muani continued his impressive start to life at Juventus.Photograph: Fabio Ferrari/APJuventus, who had won one of their last eight games in all competitions, ended the first half with only one shot on target, but increased their tempo after the break. The Empoli goalkeeper, Devis Vásquez, did well to deny Nicolás González and Teun Koopmeiners before Kolo Muani equalised from close range.The Paris Saint-Germain loanee struck just after the hour mark, tucking the ball inside the near post after he latched on to a long pass from Koopmeiners. Kolo Muani then fortuitously put Juve ahead when a long-range shot by Timothy Weah ricocheted off him and flew into the bottom corner of the net.Substitute Dusan Vlahovic made it 3-1 in the 90th minute with a powerful shot under the bar after a solo run. Another replacement, Francisco Conceição, completed the rout late on after an excellent long pass from Khéphren Thuram. Empoli were left with 10 men in the 84th minute when Youssef Maleh was shown a second yellow card.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballSerie AJuventusBarcelonaLa LiganewsShareReuse this content"

A video of the incident swiftly went viral.Hermoso’s first reaction, according to changing-room footage, was to tell teammates: “Hey, I didn’t like it.”In a later statement, she said the incident had left her feeling “vulnerable and a victim of aggression”. She described the kiss as an “impulsive act, sexist, out of place and without any type of consent from my part”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the kiss was “without bad faith at a time of maximum effusiveness” and has cast himself as a victim of a campaign by “false feminists”.Prosecutors will argue that Rubiales coerced Hermoso after pulling her aside on the bus to the airport and asking her to approve a statement downplaying the incident, which she refused to do.Vilda is then alleged to have approached Hermoso’s brother, Rafael, on the flight back to Madrid and warned him her career would suffer unless she agreed to record a video supporting Rubiales’ claim that the kiss was consensual.Rubiales has called on his daughters to testify, while several of Hermoso’s teammates will also provide evidence.Amid the protests triggered by the incident, Rubiales’ mother, Ángeles Béjar, was admitted to hospital for a few days after locking herself in a church and going on hunger strike in support of her son, protesting against the “inhumane and bloodthirsty” persecution against him.Explore more on these topicsSpainSpain women's football teamWomen's footballWomen's World Cup 2023EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Romanian centre-back sustained what appeared to be a knee injuryagainst Elfsborgin the Europa League on Thursday night.Daniel Levy, Spurs’ Pelé of debt structuring, may yet be vindicated | Barney RonayRead morePostecoglou also has Cristian Romero out with a thigh problem, describing it as “tricky” and still without a clear comeback date. The club’s only other specialist senior centrral defender is Micky Van de Ven, who returned to the starting lineup on Thursday, playing the first half in a pre-planned arrangement.Spurs have taken Danso, the 26-year-old Austria international, from under the noses of Wolves. The Midlands club were close to securing his signature, having booked him in for a medical only for Spurs to move at the last moment. His debut could come on Thursday night at Liverpool in second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final. Spurs are 1-0 up from the first leg and hoping to seal a place in the final at Wembley.Danso, who will wear the No 4 shirt at Spurs, was born in Voitsberg, Austria but moved to England at the age of six where he began his career with MK Dons and Reading. He then went to Augsburg in Germany in 2014 to kickstart his senior career. In 2019-20, Danso spent the season on loan from Augsburg at Southampton, making 10 appearances, including six in the Premier League.Postecoglou has been pleading for new signings throughout January as he battles an injury crisis – he is without nine senior players for the trip to Brentford on Sunday afternoon – and he is still especially keen for a player for his forward line.Tottenham indicated a readiness to pay €60m (£50m) for Bayern Munich’s Mathys Tel but the forward did not want to join them. They are continuing to try to add a player in this area before Monday night’s transfer deadline. Their only other signing so far this month has been the goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky,bought from Slavia Praguefor £12.5m.Spurs could target another defender despite landing Danso, with a loan for Chelsea’s Axel Disasi a possibility. A complication is having to pay a big loan fee for Disasi, who is also wanted by Aston Villa. Chelsea would prefer not to loan the centre-back to Villa, who are rivals for a top-four place. The same goes for João Félix, who Chelsea will only let move to Villa Park in a £60m permanent deal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McIlroy made an eagle and five birdies in a superb final round of 66 to finish 21 under par, a shot outside the tournament record set by Brandt Snedeker in 2015.Playing partner Shane Lowry birdied the 18th to secure outright second on 19 under, with Justin Rose making an eagle on the same hole to share third place with American Lucas Glover. “Some people would argue the golf courses I have won on are not up to a Pebble Beach or an Augusta, but to win at one of the cathedrals of golf is really, really cool,” McIlroy told CBS.“I knew today was going to be tough, it was going to be exciting, there were so many guys around the lead and I guess with it being Pebble Beach I had to put that to the back of my mind and go out there and try to shoot a score, which I was able to. Really cool to have that walk up 18 and take it all in.Tyrrell Hatton’s victory in Dubai catapults him back into world top 10Read more“I said to Harry [Diamond, his caddie] walking up the last, start as you mean to go on. I’m just as determined this year in any of the years I’ve been out here on the PGA Tour and to get this win this early it means a great deal and hopefully just keep the momentum going into Torrey Pines in a couple of weeks’ time.”Starting the day a shot behind Ryder Cup teammate Sepp Straka, McIlroy birdied the 2nd and 7th to take the outright lead, but bogeyed the next to fall back into a three-way tie on 16 under par.A birdie on the 10th edged McIlroy back in front and he doubled his lead with another on the 12th before striking the decisive blow on the par-five 14th. He took an aggressive line over the corner of the dogleg and followed a 339-yard drive with a mid-iron on to the green, before holing from 25 feet for eagle.“I’ve hit three really good tee shots up 14, the previous two times this week I didn’t take advantage of them and I was determined to take advantage today,” McIlroy added. “I hit a perfect seven iron after that drive and to hole a putt like that across the green is a bit of a bonus, but it really gave me a cushion to play the last four holes.“I was really proud of myself, I made that bogey on the 8th hole and to play the next few the way I did that gave me the cushion for it to be pretty comfortable coming down the last few.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal now find themselves six points behind the leaders, Liverpool, who play their game in hand against Everton on 12 February, with City a further nine points behind in fourth spot.Arsenal and Lewis-Skelly keep title race alive with stunning win over Manchester CityRead moreIt was the first time Guardiola has lost by a four-goal margin since becoming a manager in 2007, with City now having conceded four goals on four occasions this season. The City manager acknowledged their standards had dropped after Thomas Partey restored Arsenal’s lead following a loose pass from Phil Foden.“The feeling is why we have not done in the last 20, 25 minutes what we had done well for the first 60,” Guardiola said. “Now we have to reflect and talk with the players and hope that it doesn’t happen again.”Asked whether theirsecond‑half collapsewas due to his squad’s fragile confidence after a season in which City have lost seven Premier League games, he said: “It can be fragile because it happens so many times. But we have a duty to learn and there are always margins to get better. It’s happened all season, we are giving away too many things, we are aware this cannot happen, it happened.”View image in fullscreenMyles Lewis-Skelly of Arsenal celebrates scoring his team's third goal.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesJohn Stones was at fault for Arsenal’s first two goals and he apologised to the City fans for the team’s performance in the final half‑hour. “It is hard to put into words straight after a game like that. Pride hurts. Sorry to the fans that have travelled to come and watch that,” he said. “How we played in the last 30 minutes was not acceptable. Personally and collectively, it’s not us.“It is not nice to be involved in that when you know it’s not your team in those situations. We were in the game and it was a swinging point. It swung the wrong way for us. I am angry, upset personally and collectively about how the game finished. There are a lot of different things that I still haven’t figured out as to why it hasn’t clicked. The heart’s there, the passion’s there; everyone’s got the right intention.

He does it in every action, he does it with his body language, he does it with his facial expression, how he lives the game, and then with the ball, because he takes it and he wants to make things happen, he takes risks, he takes initiative, and at his age that’s not easy to see.”Asked about Lewis-Skelly’s celebration, Declan Rice said: “It’s football antics. Things happen on the pitch. He celebrated. It’s obviously the Haaland celebration. I know he has respect for him, the whole team has big respect for him because of what he’s done, he’s a big player.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaMikel ArtetaArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

Anthony Davis won a championship with the Los Angeles Lakers.They’re switching teams now – in an absolute blockbuster.Dončić is being traded by the reigning Western Conference champion Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers for Davis, a person with knowledge of the agreement said early Sunday.Inside Cleveland’s quiet revolution: can the red-hot Cavs really win it all?Read moreDončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris are headed to the Lakers, while Davis and Max Christie are going to Dallas, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither team can announce the deal while it awaits league approval.The Utah Jazz also are involved in the deal, said the source. ESPN, which first reported the trade, said Jalen Hood-Schifino and two draft picks will be headed to the Jazz. The Dallas Morning News also reported those details on the trade.The trade news broke about an hour after the Lakers beat New York at Madison Square Garden. Davis was not with the Lakers for the game; he has been back in Los Angeles because of an abdominal injury that needed assessing.Dončić has not played for Dallas since Christmas Day, whenhe was sidelined with a strained left calf.“I believe that defense wins championships,” Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison told ESPN. “I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We’re built to win now and in the future.”The deal, at least for now, would pair Dončić withLeBron Jamesas the new 1-2 punch in Los Angeles, while Davis would be forming a new star duo with Kyrie Irving in Dallas.And there was immediate shock on social media when the news hit.“Luka getting traded from Dallas has to have a deeper story behind it,” Cleveland center Tristan Thompson wrote on X. “This just doesn’t happen on a random Saturday night.”Knicks guard Jalen Brunson wondered in another post if it was a joke: “April fools right?” he asked.Evidently not.Dallas plays at Cleveland on Sunday, while the Lakers are off until visiting the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night. It’s not clear when Dončić or Davis could play for their new clubs: the trade needs NBA approval, and both are dealing with injuries without any publicly known firm timetable for their returns.Among players with at least 400 games, Doncic’s 28.6-point average is third in NBA history behind only Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain – both at 30.1. When healthy, he’s typically somewhere between dynamic and unstoppable.He was third in the MVP voting last season after averaging 33.9 points, 9.8 assists and 9.2 rebounds per game, easily one of the greatest statistical seasons in league history. Dončić – who turns 26 later this month and has referred to James as an “idol” — had a 73-point game against Atlanta on Jan. 26, 2024, tying the fourth-highest scoring total ever in an NBA game. Only Chamberlain (100), Kobe Bryant (81) and Chamberlain (78) scored more.Davis, an All-Star pick this year for the 10th time in his career, turns 32 next month. He’s part of the NBA’s 75th anniversary team, helped the Lakers win the NBA title in the bubble in 2020, and – like Dončić – is a five-time All-NBA selection.And for Doncic, there could be a massive – $115m – cost to this trade.Dončić could have signed a supermax contract this coming summer, one that could have paid him about $345m over five seasons. He’s still extension-eligible, but likely cannot sign a five-year deal worth more than $230m this summer now.Dončić is averaging 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists this season. Davis is averaging 25.7 points and 11.9 rebounds.Explore more on these topicsNBALuka DončićBasketballUS sportsLeBron JamesShareReuse this content"

That’s the real reason the tech bros fear itKenan MalikWhile privacy fears are justified, the main beef Silicon Valley has is that China’s chatbot is democratising the technologySun 2 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 13.46 ESTShareNo, it was not a “Sputnik moment”. The launch last month ofDeepSeek R1, the Chinese generative AI or chatbot, created mayhem in the tech world, with stocks plummeting and much chatter about the US losing its supremacy in AI technology. Yet, for all the disruption, the Sputnik analogy reveals less about DeepSeek than about American neuroses.The original Sputnik moment came on 4 October 1957 when the Soviet Union shocked the world by launching Sputnik 1, the first time humanity had sent a satellite into orbit. It was, to anachronistically borrow a phrase from a later and even more momentous landmark, “one giant leap for mankind”, in Neil Armstrong’s historic words as he took a “small step” on to the surface of the moon.It was a significant moment in the cold war, too. A confidential White House report worried that “American prestige” had “sustained a severe blow”, giving the USSR “clear advantage in the cold war”. That fear spurred Washington into reshaping its space programme, and catalysed the Apollo missions, culminating with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming, on 20 July 1969, the first humans to walk upon another celestial body.DeepSeek, sponsored by a Chinese hedge fund, is a notable achievement. Technically, though, it is no advance on large language models (LLMs) that already exist. It is neither faster nor “cleverer” than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude and just as prone to “hallucinations” – the tendency, exhibited by all LLMs, to give false answers or to make up “facts” to fill gaps in its data. According to NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, DeepSeek’s chatbotmade false claims30% of the time and gave no answers to 53% of questions, compared with 40% and 22% respectively for the 10 leading chatbots inNewsGuard’s most recent audit.The figures expose the profound unreliability of all LLMs. DeepSeek’s particularly high non-response rate is likely to be the product of itscensoriousness; it refuses to provide answers on any issue that China finds sensitive or about which it wants facts restricted, whether Tiananmen Square or Taiwan.The true impact of DeepSeek is not on the technology but on the economics of AI. It is a chatbot as capable, and as flawed, as other current leading models, but built at a fraction of the cost and from inferior technology. TheUS banon the sale to China of the most advanced chips and chip-making equipment, imposed by the Biden administration in 2022, and tightened several times since, was designed to curtail Beijing’s access to cutting-edge technology. Paradoxically, it may have spurred Chinese researchers into becoming more innovative.Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted without global tumultDeepSeek is also free to use, and open source. The combination of low cost and openness may help democratise AI technology, enabling others, especially from outside America, to enter the market. There is a certain irony that it should be China that is opening up the technology while US firms continue to create as many barriers as possible to competitors attempting to enter the field.And here lies perhaps the biggest impact of DeepSeek. It has ripped off the veil of mystique that previously surrounded AI. Silicon Valley has nurtured the image of AI technology as a precious and miraculous accomplishment, and portrayed its leading figures, fromElon MusktoSam Altman, as prophets guiding us into a new world. The technology itself has been endowed with almost magical powers, including the promise of “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI – superintelligent machines capable of surpassing human abilities on any cognitive task – as being almost within our grasp.Last April, Musk predicted that AI would be “smarter than any human” by the end of 2025. Last month, Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the driving force behind the current generative AI boom, similarly claimed to be “confident weknow how to build AGI” and that “in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’”.Almost a decade ago, the Nobel prize-winning computer scientist Geoff Hinton urged nations to “stop training radiologists”, and similar medical technicians, because “it’s completely obvious within five years, deep learning [AI] is going to do better”. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, a corporation founded by former OpenAI employees, has claimed thatAI could double the human lifespanwithin five to 10 years. These fantasy claims have been shredded by critics such as theAmerican cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, who has evenchallenged Musk to a $1m betover his “smarter than any human” claim for AI.Nevertheless, for all the pushback, each time one fantasy prediction fails to materialise, another takes its place. Such claims derive less from technological possibilities than from political and economic needs. While AI technology has provided hugely important tools, capable of surpassing humans in specific fields, from the solving of mathematical problems to the recognition of disease patterns,the business model depends on hype. It is the hype that drives the billion-dollar investment and buys political influence, including a seat at the presidential inauguration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The disruptive quality of DeepSeek lies in questioning this approach, demonstrating that the best generative AI models can be matched with much less computational power and a lower financial burden.The hype around DeepSeek is in part a reflection of the hype around AI. It is a reflection, too, of geopolitical tensions. Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted but without the global tumult of the past two weeks. Beneath the panic lies fear of DeepSeek’s Chinese origins and ownership.Yet, too great an obsession with the geopolitics of DeepSeek can distort the lessons we take from it. The promise of more open access to such vital technology becomes subsumed into a fear of its Chinese provenance. Concerns about privacy, censorship and surveillance, rightly raised by a model such as DeepSeek, can help obscure the reality that such issuesbedevil all AI technology, not just that from China. Particularly at a time of threatened trade wars and threats to democracy, our capacity to navigate between the hype and the fear assumes new importance.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsDeepSeekOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)Silicon ValleyChinaComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

This book gives us only the first part of the story, tracing Gates’s evolution from birth in 1955 to the founding ofMicrosoftin 1975. For the next part of the story, we will just have to wait for the sequel.In a way, the volume’s title describes it well. In the era before machine learning and AI, when computer programs were exclusively written by humans, the term “source code” meant something. It described computer programs that could be read – and understood, if you knew the programming language – enabling you to explain why the machine did what it did.So what can we learn from inspecting Gates’s code? Broadly speaking, the message is that he was a very lucky lad. He was born in the right place at the right time to parents who gave him, he writes, “the precise blend of support and pressure I needed: they gave me room to grow emotionally, and they created opportunities for me to develop my social skills”. His account suggests, though, that it was an uphill battle at times. Bill Snr and Mary Gates discovered that they had a boy who was a strange blend of high IQ, arrogance, rebelliousness and insecurity.“If I were growing up today,” he writes, “I probably would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum. My parents had no guideposts or textbooks to help them grasp why their son became so obsessed with certain projects, missed social cues, and could be rude or inappropriate without seeming to notice his effect on others.”He was lucky. The Gateses were moderately affluent (his father was a prominent lawyer in Seattle) and they sent him to a remarkable private school – Lakeside – that was relaxed, liberal, supportive and tolerant. Which was good for a boy who was small for his age, with a reedy voice.Young Bill rebelled... there were lots of fights and arguments. In the end, his parents sent him to a therapistMore significantly, perhaps, some of the parents had raised enough money to buy a Teletype terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric time-shared computer for pupils’ use. This was extraordinary in the 1960s; it meant that Gates and some of his friends were writing software in their teens. He and a few others (includingPaul Allen, with whom he later co-founded Microsoft) even started writing software for companies in the Seattle area. And when the school eventually went coeducational, Gates and his mates wrote the software for scheduling classes and activities in the expanded institution.From Lakeside he went to Harvard in 1973, determined to sample everything that vast institution offered, while relying on his remarkable ability to cram ferociously before tedious assignments like exams. He inveigled his way into the university’s Aiken lab, which had just taken possession of an early minicomputer, aDEC PDP-10. But two years into this idyll, Allen turned up one day with the news that MITS, a two-bit firm in New Mexico, had just launched a microcomputer based on Intel’s 8080 processor chip.This freaked them both out, because they had been pondering how to get into what they knew was going to be a huge industry and now this outfit in Albuquerque had scooped them with a crummy little machine. But the new device did not have any application software. So they set about writing – on the Harvard computer – an interpreter for the Basic programming language, using an ingenious software emulation of the MITS machine that Allen had written. This remarkable project was successful, but the university discovered that none of it had been authorised, and Gates was disciplined – much as Mark Zuckerberg was, many years later, for another illicit use of Harvard resources.At this point, Gates dropped out and went, with Allen, to New Mexico, where they co-founded what was originally called Micro-Soft, and embarked on the path that led to great riches and industrial power. But that story has to wait for another volume, which will have to record how a powerful corporation became, for a long time, an institutional extension of its co-founder’s personality. And ran into antitrust litigation as a result.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was clearly a difficult child to manage, especially as his mother had very clear ideas about how life should be organised. From an early age, young Bill rebelled against her rigorous regime. There were lots of fights and arguments. In the end, his parents sent him to a therapist, who turned out to be sympathetic and wise.The biggest tragedy in his early life was the sudden death of his best friend (and fellow programmer), Kent Evans, in a mountaineering accident. “Kent’s dad greeted us and shook our hands,” he writes about going back to the family home after the funeral. “Kent’s mom was curled up on the sofa, sobbing. It was at that moment I understood that for all my grief, it would never run as deep as hers. He was my best friend, but he was her baby. At some level I knew that she and Mr Evans would be forever marooned in this loss. The stricken expressions on the faces of Kent’s kind, gentle parents that day have never left me.”In a nice coda, he describes running into Evans’s father many years later, and they have a long conversation about what might have been. Both believe that if Evans had lived he would have been the third co-founder of Microsoft. Now, there’s a thought.Source Code: My Beginningsby Bill Gates is published by Allen Lane (£25).

The system controls more than $6tn of federal cash flow each year, with millions of Americans depending on it for social security and medicare benefits, federal salaries, and more.Until now, the information stored on it has been exceptionally closely guarded, with only a select few officials having clearance to control it. But since the advent of theTrump administrationon 20 January, members of Musk’s Doge team have been battering to be given access.On Friday, theWashington Postrevealed that the Treasury Department’s top civil servant had retired after more than 30 years of service. David Lebryk had clashed with Musk associates over their efforts to effectively break into the system.According to theNew York Times, Lebryk had been placed on administrative leave after he objected to Doge agents being given access. The newspaper reported that the incoming treasury secretary, Bessent, gave his permission to the new deal late on Friday.Under the arrangement, the Times reported, one of the Doge members who can now scour the data of millions of Americans is Tom Krause, chief executive of the tech company Cloud Software Group.Before confirming the deal, Wyden had already sounded the alarm about Musk’s attempts to break into such a sensitive federal database. On Friday he wrote to Bessent warning that the system was so critical “it simply cannot fail”.Wyden warned that “any politically-motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy. I can think of no good reason why political operators who have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law would need access to these sensitive, mission-critical systems.”One of the fears about granting entry to the system to a freewheeling outfit controlled by Musk is that he could use it to block payments to a large number of federal programs as part of his mission to slash and burn the US government. Wyden also suggested that the move could pose a national security threat, given Musk’s extensive business interests in China, which in turn could give the Chinese intelligence services a pipeline into US data.This “endangers US cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make [Musk’s] access to these systems a national security risk,” Wyden said.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yes, everyone with any capacity to do so should join things, call politicians, support the groups and campaigns protecting the above. But it’s important to not limit our sense of what resistance looks like to these versions of doing something. In addition to these formal, structured ways of defending what you believe in, there are ways of doing so woven into everyday life and our conversations and communications.Each of us needs to stand on principle, loudly, whenever, wherever we can. Used strategically, our voices can do a lot to preserve anti-authoritarian worldviews about facts, science, history, rights, justice and inclusion. In this moment, it matters to just be a person who, wherever the opportunity arises, affirms that the climate crisis is real and climate solutions benefit us all, immigrants are vital to our economy and their rights matter, trans people harm no one by their existence but face terrible harm, diversity strengthens enterprises and communities and our country, women’s rights and equality should be non-negotiable.Right now, already, in many institutions and communities, there’s pressure to shut up and toe theTrumpline. Every person who doesn’t do so makes it easier and safer and more encouraging for others to likewise dissent. That is, the more we stand up, the more others will stand up too; by standing up you’re inviting others to join you, making it safer to be a dissenter, and those not ready to join you will maybe question their facts or fear or allegiance to the Trump agenda. You may find yourself in a position of being the first to dissent, or circumstances in which you join that first or third or 30th dissenter. Or you may speak up for someone who didn’t exactly dissent except by being a category of person under attack.The more we stand up, the harder it is for this authoritarian agenda to succeed and the more uncomfortable we make it for those going along with the lies and the cruelty. The huge and furious backlash against the National Cathedral’s bishopMariann Buddefor justsaying some pretty normal Christian thingsabout God’s mercy toward the most vulnerable is evidence that the Trump team and its followers expect to be flattered and groveled before and are not very good at coping with even an admonition to be kind.Something that should be said more often is that the reason authoritarians are authoritarians is that they’re unpopular. They have to use the threat of force along with intimidation and suppression tactics to get their way. They endeavor to scare people into obeying, whether or not they agree, and not being scared and not obeying helps demonstrate how finite their power is and how much of ours remains even in the bleakest circumstances.Call lies lies, call cruelty cruelty, call fascism fascism, call violations of the constitution and human rights by their true names. Be loud (when you can; I’m not saying get into bar fights or cornered by gangs of Nazis, and you’re a better judge of how to negotiate your family get-togethers than I am). Get on top of the facts you need to make your case. But beware of arguments. There’s nothing to debate about whether or not women are people or fossil fuels cause many kinds of harm, and we’re in an era when the most aggressive debaters are most liable to use bullying, ad hominem arguments, insults, untruths and misinformation, bait-and-switch tactics, and the rest of the arsenal of bad-faith discourse. Standing your ideological ground doesn’t mean wrestling verbally with strangers and slimebags.We’ve seen people rich and powerful enough to stand on principle cave and kiss the ring, seen huge corporations who likewise have the resources to have some integrity knuckle under, seen universities choose to veer right to please the incoming president, seen news organizations soften up outrageous violations and cruelty with bland and evasive language.Trump’s neofascism is here now. Here are 10 things you can do to resist | Robert ReichRead moreThey’re cowards. They’ve chosen craven advantage over courageous principle. But they alone cannot legitimize and normalize this regime. What will normalize it is if we all go along with it. Not going along with it, not pretending this is normal, not pretending human rights violations are anything but, not forgetting that the regime is attempting to make epic and unprecedented changes that dismantle our democracy: that’s up to us. Not only with how we organize and act, but how we talk and how boldly we talk.I learned something new about animal behavior last week, and it seems really timely. A reindeer cyclone is when a herd of reindeer facing a predator put the calves in the center and whirl around fast, making it difficult to impossible for the predator to pick off one reindeer. The more of us who speak up the harder it will be to persecute any single person who says trans rights are human rights or what’s being done to immigrants is terrorism. It’s not the only example from the animals. When threatened, musk oxen likewise circle up, facing outward with their huge horns, calves again in the middle of the ring.Some say that murmurations – those beautiful flights of thousands of starlings undulating and pulsating as they whirl through the sky together – create flocks that are hard for predators to attack. There’s safety in numbers, which is why a lot of prey animals move in herds and flocks and schools. For those who dissent from what this new administration intends to do, we may sometimes be able to surround an Ice van or march by the thousands, but every time we dissent we make room for others to dissent. Courage, like fear, is contagious. For a lot of us, right now, we get to choose, and what we choose has an impact on what others choose.What’s giving me hope nowAfter Trump took office the first time, I feared that people would be frightened or acquiescent, but the day after the inauguration, there were women’s marches –including plenty of men – hundreds, of them, all over the country. And the next week they tried out the Muslim ban and people all over the country rushed to the airport to support those who might be affected and protest, boldly and effectively. When theTrump administrationtried on Monday to seize Congress’s power of the purse, I was heartened to see people speaking up, calling their representatives, elected officials speaking up, and non-profits filing a court case that got a stay. They will be resisted and we will not be silent.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

With over a billion monthly users and a For You Page (#FYP) brimming with relationship trends, it’s where people turn to for advice on everything from their sexuality to launching a relationship like it is a PR campaign.Welcome to the digital age, where TikTok doubles as Cupid … and sometimes, Dr Phil.Welcome to the femosphere, the latest dark, toxic corner of the internet… for womenRead moreLike anything else, TikTok isn’t inherently good or bad when it comes to relationship advice – it’s a digital stage where people navigate, explore and even contest relationships, intimacy and sexuality. However, it’s also a complex and often contradictory space where the boundary between authentic experiences and curated performance becomes blurred.My research on dating apps and intimacy, conducted in 2020, revealed how profoundly online spaces influence people navigating their romantic lives. Participants spoke about adopting trends like “soft launching” relationships (posting vague hints of a new partner) or “hard launching” them (a full-blown reveal) directly from platforms like Instagram and TikTok.What emerged was a startling realisation:people increasingly see relationships as stories in which they must be the protagonist. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as having “main character energy”, invites individuals to centre their romantic lives in a way that’s public, performative and shaped by the need for external validation. TikTok plays into this trend perfectly, offering bite-size content that encourages users to frame their love lives as compelling narratives for an audience.This can be empowering, offering people tools to navigate intimacy, reflect on their experiences, and connect with others. However, it can also become a trap.When we start comparing our unscripted, messy, and very real relationships to the highly edited, sensationalised versions we see online, the gap between expectation and reality widens.TikTok, the short-form video platform originally launched as “Douyin” in China before its global expansion in 2018, has seen mass controversy and bans in many countries, including, most recently, the US (albeit for a short period of time). It offers everything from silly skits and dance challenges to deep dives into news, as well as more niche genres like relationship advice.Trends like #DatingStoryTime and #BeigeFlags are just the tip of the iceberg, offering humour and insight that draw millions of viewers into the relationship narrative world.At its core, TikTok thrives on relatability and entertainment. Whether through cringe-worthy first-date stories or exaggerated red-flag analysis, TikTok presents relationships as a form of personal and cultural storytelling. The structure often mirrors what literary scholars call the “romantic master plot”: a white, Westernised narrative framework popularised by romcoms in which love is the ultimate goal, providing life’s meaning and shape.Humour plays a significant role in these narratives. What I call the “jolly absurdism” or “merry nihilism” of TikTok trends allows users to laugh at the quirks and failures of modern romance.Yet this humour masks deeper issues. It perpetuates unrealistic expectations and invites us to compare our love lives with highly curated and often fictionalised digital personas.A growing genre on TikTok involves relationship influencers who claim to provide the blueprint for love and intimacy. These influencers often present saccharine “couple goals” content.On the surface, this might seem harmless. But it’s anything but.Because TikTok is a social media platform rather than a polished TV show or movie, its content feels more authentic. Users assume they’re getting glimpses into “real lives”, not realising how scripted and curated much of the content is. This sets impossibly high standards for relationships, making people wonder, “What’s wrong with me?” or “Why doesn’t my relationship look like that?”Alongside the relationship influencers are the dating gurus – a new breed of influencers who’ve swapped self-help books for bite-size videos packed with sensationalist advice. Their content often leans heavily on clickbait tactics, promising viewers surefire ways to “make them obsessed with you” or “manipulate someone into falling in love”.It’s the kind of toxic game-playing we thought we’d ditched along with shoulder pads in the 1980s. But these so-called experts thrive on controversy, crafting advice that’s equal parts absurd and unhealthy. Whether it’s “playing hard to get” on steroids or emotional tactics dressed up as empowerment, their approach often feels like a giant step backward for modern dating dynamics.66 days to rediscover boredom: ‘The way I’d been thinking about time was wrong’Read moreAnd while TikTok can be a space to explore identity – its algorithm famously tailors content so well that many users joked it could predict their sexuality (you might remember the trendTikTok knew I was gay before I did)– it can also be dangerously reductive.TikTok’s dual nature is where its real complexity lies. On one hand, it provides an unprecedented space for people to negotiate and navigate cultural norms around love, intimacy and identity. It amplifies voices, showcases diversity, and offers humour and relatability that can help normalise experiences once considered taboo.On the other hand, TikTok’s structure – its reliance on sensationalist trends and viral content – means it’s also a powerful force in reinforcing norms and setting unrealistic expectations. People become hostages to these norms, comparing their love lives with the glossy, choreographed snippets they see online.The narratives that dominate TikTok, especially around romance, often adhere to traditional norms that fail to account for the diversity and complexity of modern relationships.Dr Lisa Portolan is an academic.

The grief when she died was complicatedAhona GuhaIt was important for the daughter to acknowledge her sadness but to disentangle it from concepts of guilt, shame and responsibilityThe modern mindis a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their workSun 2 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 17.38 ESTShareFor some of us, the death of a parent brings a period of bereavement and deep grief which slowly abates with the passing of time. For others, the story is more complicated.Some find themselves unable to move past this loss and may continue grieving intensely for years and be unable to function because of the depth of the grief. Others find that they experience persistent difficult feelings such as anger or guilt. When the relationship with the deceased parent has been strained, these negative feelings may take over.These are all forms of complicated grief.This is a form of grief in which the grieving is unusually intense or prolonged, or there is marked disbelief about the death and poor processing, or other forms of intense emotional pain related to the death, such as anger or guilt. Many clinicians, including me, prefer not to pathologise a normal human emotional experience such as grief and instead work to understand the phenomenology of the experience, and what this form of arrested grieving might mean to a person or say about their experiences and history.*Sandra was in her 40s and had just lost her mother. She’d been seeing me for treatment for childhood trauma for a few months. She experienced sexual abuse perpetrated by her stepfather, who was now deceased. She told her mother about the abuse as an adult after his death, and her mother refused to believe her and told her not to disrespect her stepfather’s memory in that manner. Sandra was very distressed by this and decided to cease contact with her mother while she resolved some of her feelings and post-traumatic experiences.A year after the estrangement, Sandra’s mother unexpectedly died.Trauma can leave us emotionally numb – each step towards reconnection is a win | Diane YoungRead moreSandra was grief-stricken and surprised by the strength of her anguish. She wasn’t able to function or go to work and plunged into a deep depressive episode. She struggled to identify what she felt and kept ruminating about whether her mother’s death was caused by the estrangement, switching between this guilt and her anger at her mother.We spent many sessions talking about her complicated relationship with her mother. Sandra was racked with confusion as she explored a relationship she had historically thought was a reasonable one, especially when contrasted with the abuse she received from her step-father.As she reflected on this now, she started to develop a new narrative, one of a mother who would often leave her alone with her stepfather despite her frequent pleas to not be left alone. We spoke of ways to construct a new narrative to understand her childhood, and while we could never know whether Sandra’s mother knew about the abuse, we could still help Sandra own and express her rage and devastation.She found the concept of complicated grief provided a helpful framework to help her understand her competing and intense emotions and recognised that the core of her difficulties stemmed from the idea that she would never be able to express any of this to her mother, or to have a do-over or find rapprochement. The finality of death was difficult to stomach because it left so many questions.Did her mother know about the abuse and turn a blind eye? Could her mother have found a way to support Sandra?Despite this anger, Sandra felt guilty about her decision to become estranged from her mother. We spoke about the concept of regrets and hindsight bias (the tendency to perceive past events as having been more predictable than they really were) and the reasons Sandra had made the decision she did – to allow herself some space and time to sort through difficult emotions and experiences. It was important for Sandra to experience and allow her sadness but to disentangle this sadness from concepts of guilt (I did something bad), shame (I am bad) and responsibility (I could have stopped this).It was important for her to learn to grieve her mother and to name and allow the other difficult feelings she held; difficult as it was to hold all these competing emotions. We noticed that as we labelled and explored this wide range of losses, her depression was slowly lifting and she was regaining a sense of optimism and hope.*All clients are fictitious amalgamsDr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

Why do arms keep flowing in Israel’s direction?Sun 2 Feb 2025 07.26 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 08.04 ESTShareIhad never imagined, when working as a professor of transplant surgery at a large teaching hospital in London, that one day I would find myself operating on an eight-year-old child who was bleeding to death, only to be told by the scrub nurse that there were no more gauze swabs available. But I found myself in that situation last August while operating atNasser hospital in Gazaas a volunteer withMedical Aid for Palestinians(Map). Reduced to scooping out the blood with my hands, I felt an overwhelming wave of nausea – I was anxious that the child would not survive. Luckily she did, although many others did not.Having retired from the NHS, I decided to go toGazabecause it had become clear that there was a desperate need for surgical help, and I had the skills to contribute. Life as a transplant surgeon in London had been tough but hugely rewarding, and as a senior member of the transplant community I had enjoyed a certain status. This was going to be a different experience – but nothing prepared me for what I found when I arrived.From the moment we crossed into the territory and Sven, a large Swedish man in an incongruous flowery shirt leading the convoy of armoured UN Land Cruisers, exhorted us to “try not to get killed”, life became a bizarre, disorienting experience of extremes. Indeed, the same vehicles werefired on by the Israeli armya fortnight after we arrived. Gaza is the most dangerous place to work in the world, with more than300 aid workersand1,000 healthcare workerskilled since the start of the war.The journey across southern Gaza to our base evoked grainy photographs of Hiroshima. All buildings, for many miles around, had been literally flattened into the dusty landscape, and barring a few armed looters, people were conspicuously absent. Arriving at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, we found unimaginable, medieval chaos.Wards were overflowing, with beds rammed against each other in rooms and corridors, and spilling on to the open balconies, many surrounded by filthy mattresses on the floor where relatives slept in order to help the nurses care for the sick. Hygiene was nonexistent. Soap, shampoo and cleansing gel were oftennot allowed into Gaza, and medical supplies, which are also subject to import restrictions, were limited. On several occasions I inspected wound infections and found crawling maggots, and my Map colleague in intensive care had to remove maggots from a child’s throat when he found them clogging their ventilator. At various points we ran out of sterile gloves, gowns and drapes.The hospital regularly shuddered from nearby bombs. Like most other hospitals, it had already been attacked, in February last year, with many staff and patients killed. Every day we received one or two mass casualty incidents that transformed the emergency department into a Dantean maelstrom of dead bodies, blood, tissue and screaming children, many of them missing limbs. Usually this would mean 10 to 15 dead, and 20 to 40 seriously injured.We could receive casualties at any time, day or night, and sometimes operated continuously for more than 24 hours. There was a constant concern that the regular bombing close to the hospital would one day target us, and sleep was difficult. The exhausted local staff humbled us with their dedication and hard work since, apart from the conditions in the hospital, they also had to contend with living in “tents”, which are often pieces of carpet tacked on to wooden posts, with no water or sanitation. I also never saw any evidence of Hamas, either inside or outside the hospital, where we had no restrictions on movement.Looking back, it is the images of injured children that will never leave me. One evening, I operated on seven-year-old Amer, who had been shot by one of the drones that descend immediately after a bombing to pick off those who are running away, all civilians. He had sustained injuries to his liver, spleen and bowel, and had part of his stomach protruding through his chest. I was so glad to see him survive. But we saw patients like him every day, and most were not so lucky.Most of the cases we treated were women and children, and particularly disturbing were the children with a single injury, a bullet to the head, which was clearly the result of deliberate sniper fire. Indeed,30 UK doctors and nurseswho had worked in Gaza last year wrote to Keir Starmer in August stating that they had regularly seen evidence of the deliberate targeting of children (as did 99 US health workers whowrote a similar letterto President Joe Biden in October). The Palestinians feel that they are undergoing a genocide, andUN human rights experts, Amnesty International and many other organisations have concluded that Israel’s actions may plausibly amount to genocide. It is difficult to argue with them.I have worked in a number of conflict zones but have never seen so much civilian death and destruction. This was undoubtedly qualitatively different from any other war, currently or in the last two decades.Even ifthe ceasefireholds, which looks increasingly doubtful given Donald Trump’s recent actions, it will take years to reconstruct Gaza, both physically and as a society. My profound hope is that young Amer, and others like him, are given the opportunity of a decent, humane future.‘I had to evacuate five times’: a year in the life of a Gaza doctor battling to help victimsRead moreWhen our convoy rolled back out last September, I was left with an overwhelming sense of guilt that I could go back to an easy life while millions of others went to bed hungry, wondering if they would be blown to pieces overnight. This has been replaced by a deep sense of shame and embarrassment that the UK government, aLabourgovernment that I campaigned for, has refused to actively condemn Israel for the war crimes it has committed and continues to supply it with arms.Political power may require compromise and behind-the-scenes trade-offs, but there are some moral red lines that should never be crossed, whatever the political cost. In my view, the genocide in Gaza is the quintessential test of the moral courage of leaders in the 21st century – and so far, ours have failed. The bombing may have stopped for now, but the necessity to hold those who have committed crimes to account is no less urgent.Nizam Mamode is a humanitarian surgeon and retired professor of transplant surgery.

It has never seemed larger than it did last week, when England’s fielders were chasing the ball all over its vast green sward. Both on the ground and in the air the ball just kept escaping them, as Australia’s batters scored the first, then the second, ever centuries by women at their country’s oldest (and biggest) sporting venue.The third women’s Test held at the MCG was certainly a historic occasion, but not in the way England would have hoped. The tourists succumbed to the first ever whitewash in a women’s Ashes: they finished without a single point in the multi-format series, having lost all seven of their matches.England v Australia is meant to be one of the great showcases of women’s cricket, and this edition was hyped accordingly. The sides are ranked one and two in the world. Their meetings contain a juicy beef, cooked up by decades of rivalry between both the women’s and the men’s sides. And their last encounter, in summer 2023, had turned into a thriller as Heather Knight’s England came back from the seeming dead to draw the series.This winter, there has been no such Lazarus effect. Australia landed a killer punch in the very first game, completing their run chase with 11 overs to spare, the equivalent of having the fight stopped with four rounds to go. England never got back up off the mat. The series was lost at the first opportunity, and many of the defeats were embarrassingly one-sided.Such an epic humbling in the land of Lillee and Thomson, Warne and Waugh, Johnson and Starc, is nothing new to English cricket. The women’s efforts over the past three weeks have earned a place in the pantheon of disastrous Ashes tours established by their male counterparts, several of them in the past 20 years. It easily holds its own against the2006-07 whitewash led by Andrew Flintoff, or the infamous Covid collapse of 2021-22. Perhaps it can’t quite live up to Alastair Cook’s 2013-14 “Pomnishambles”. But the batters do convey the same broken, tortured look as they head to and from the crease.An Ashes tour is a brutal sight when it goes this wrong. The pressure of the contest is unrelenting, its conveyor belt of fixtures an industrial accident waiting to happen. Even as they were caught in the teeth of the machine that would mash them to a pulp, this England side remained in denial about what was happening to them. Others might call this tour a horror show, a bloody mess: they kept insisting it wasn’t as bad as it looked.View image in fullscreenA tense moment for England captain Heather Knight during the first day of the Test match at Melbourne.Photograph: Daniel Pockett/Getty ImagesTen-nil down on points after five matches, coach Jon Lewis announced that his team were “more competitive than the scoreline suggests”. And that wasn’t even the weirdest thing he said. Responding to criticism of his players’ failures in athleticism, Lewis told the assembled media that the real cause of their performance gap was down to Australia’s warmer climate, which encouraged their love of sport: it was this “cultural difference” that gave them the physical advantage.Cricketfans are used to blaming the weather for adverse results. But that’s usually because rain has scuppered a chance of victory – not because Sydneysiders get more vitamin D than everyone else. Lewis’s fatalistic assertion was proof that England had, collectively, lost their mind.The claim appears to be a refutation of professionalism in sport. What is the point of athletes dedicating themselves to full-time training if sporting outcomes are decided by the amount of time you spent outside as a kid? And yet these England women are the most professional ever to wear the three lions on their caps. They are paid £100,000 a year to train full time, and they are one of the few international women’s teams whose employers pay them the same match fees as their male counterparts. Their backroom staff are so well resourced that the only cricket team that bears comparison is, in fact, Australia’s. If their opposition are more agile and athletic than them, there is a failure either in what that staff are providing, or how the players are implementing it. It’s perfectly true that sometimes one team is just a lot better than another. Australia’s women went undefeated in T20 series for six years – a streak only broken in last year’s World Cup –and this current side is not just one of cricket’s best ever teams but one of the greatest in sport, full stop.England have not prevailed in the Ashes in over a decade.But Australia aren’t the only team that have caused England to go to pieces in recent years. A repeated pattern has emerged since the side’s semi-final defeat at the 2022 Commonwealth Games – they run rampant against weaker oppositions (witness December’s mammoth victory over South Africa), but choke when they meet unexpected resistance.Last autumn theylost their heads, and a place at a T20 World Cup final, against West Indies. Knight, their captain, insisted they hadn’t become a bad side“because we played poorly in 10 overs”. But those were the most important 10 overs they had played all year. There was a sense, even then, that England were inclined to let themselves off the hook a little too easily.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They appreciate that women’s sport, many decades behind in its development, needs support to achieve gender parity, rather than the judgment and even ridicule it once received.But sport is only compelling when it is competitive. The England women’s team mantra is “inspire and entertain”, and not even their most ardent fans would claim they have achieved either on this tour.The captain and coach’s apparent inability to recognise and deal with their team’s major failings suggests a far bigger problem than choosing the right “brand” of cricket to play. England’s well-funded national setup appears to have unintentionally created an environment where a self-deluding narrative and lack of outside competition for places invites complacency and stymies progress. Professionalism means more than just being paid to play, as Australia have very much proved.Emma John is a freelance writer and authorExplore more on these topicsWomen's AshesOpinionCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s Do Your Own Research, for those of us not quite meeting the 13- to 28-year-old gen Z age bracket. It’s a common refrain when one of them finds their truth challenged.So I set out on some DYOR regarding the report last week that most gen Zers were in favour of the UK becoming a dictatorship.The study, commissioned by Channel 4, has been described broadly as “shocking”, “worrying” and “bleak”. Yet for anyone with daily interaction with that generation, it would probably be better described as – “fairly predictable”.Far from schools being hotbeds of discussion about critical race theory and gender identity, in the past couple of years teachers have witnessed kids – particularly boys – being attracted to authoritarian ideas and the philosophy of such characters asJordan Peterson,Andrew Tateand Tommy Robinson.I have steadily/stodgily liberal-minded friends – both Labour and Conservative voting – utterly bewildered at how their teenage children are growing up fascinated by populist, authoritarian thinking. All those years spent faffing over organic baby food and additive-free hummus and now their kids have gone and ingested a truckload of toxicity.The algorithm is serving up young men and boys an endless stream of content promoting traditional ideas around gender rolesThe survey showed that 52% of gen Z thought “the UK would be a better place if a strong leader was in charge who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”; 33% agreed that the UK would be better off “if the army was in charge”.So, how did we get here? Well, in the name of DYOR, it’s (almost) all about TikTok. There, the algorithm is serving up young men and boys an endless stream of content, either consciously or subconsciously, promoting strength, “common sense”, traditional ideas around gender roles and incessant railing against wokeism. There’s a reason forDonald Trump’s unhinged attackon “woke policies” in federal aviation, which is the content swirling these social platforms right now.Pushback from the right against “liberal-elite dogma” and “political correctness gone mad” is as old as time. What is different is howTikTokhas turbocharged these ideas into the mainstream for young people – into teens who, by and large, aren’t engaged with politics. Those who previously might have been more interested in drinking cider and getting off with girls.Almost three-quarters of 18- to 24-year-olds visited TikTok in May 2024, spending an average of64 minutes a dayon the site. Among those in their early to mid teens, saturation is closer to 90%, and surveys show it is their favouredsingle news source.“Blaming the media” is the oldest cliche in the book. But to discuss the causes of the appeal of populism in the young without putting it in the context of TikTok’s capacity for mind control is to discuss causes of drug use without considering how heroin makes people feel. When the Biden administration came close to banning TikTok just weeks ago, it may have been partially on the grounds that the Chinese could use it to dip into our data like popcorn, but it was also on the understanding that it is a very sophisticated tool in a “cognitive warfare campaign”.And of course the minds of our young people are fertile for this messaging. It is a generation born into austerity, blighted by Covid and a cost of living crisis, taught in overcrowded classrooms, anxious about knifings on the way home and witness to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. They were born into a digital world that values individuality above community, a world in which the media has fractured into a million pieces. The backdrop to their lives has mind-boggling inequality in which therichest 1% of Britons hold more wealth than 70% of Britons– aquarter of adults have savings of just £100.We have gifted them an inheritance of insecurity and a desire for certainty. Then the tech bros created a business model built on super-serving them simplistic solutions through algorithms, which means any kind of DYOR simply confirms “their” truth and makes objective news harder to find.So why wouldn’t 47% of them say “The entire way our society is organised must be radically changed through revolution”? Why wouldn’t more? Desire for rebellion fades with age – but the march towards youthful populism is gaining momentum. Globally, the popularity of rightwing parties is particularly marked among young people –16% of German voters under 25 voted for the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland (AfD) in last year’s European elections. And in France,30% of young people voted for Marine Le Pen’sfar-right National Rally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two-thirds of white male Americans aged 18 to 29 who voted last November chose Trump, along with almost half of young white women.To a generation of young people, Trump is part president, part meme. A crazy-looking representation of “I take no shit from no one”. And they like it. It makes them feel less anxious.So how does the left respond to this? We are a generation that never imagined we would need to make a case for democracy; it was one of those things that was just there when you needed it, like Woolworths and phone boxes. Oh…So, yes, the case must be made. If we need a reminder of why, we saw it vividly this week in the faces of the Jewish people who returned to Poland to mark 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. That anniversary was marked with solemnity and sadness. But if we truly mean “never again”, we need to mark it with fury and anger that our children are being led away by the Pied Piper of populism.The problem with democracy is it lacks the razzmatazz, cage-fighting machismo of authoritarianism. And it’s all just a little too reasonable. OK, dull. But if we ever truly believed in equality of opportunity and social justice, we have to put some colour back in its cheeks. We have to now fight for it with authenticity and charismatic voices. The left has to be more passionate, more emotional and more combative – firstly, to physically demonstrate it in a visual world, but mainly because that works way better in the algorithm. It needs strong advocates for solidarity, for fairness and better economic outcomes for working-class people.For too long, the left has remained insulated from the appeal of populism, cossetted in our echo chambers of complacency. Well, if your kids are gen Zers, be warned – the fight for democracy could be coming to your breakfast table any day soon.

That’s the real reason the tech bros fear itKenan MalikWhile privacy fears are justified, the main beef Silicon Valley has is that China’s chatbot is democratising the technologySun 2 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 13.46 ESTShareNo, it was not a “Sputnik moment”. The launch last month ofDeepSeek R1, the Chinese generative AI or chatbot, created mayhem in the tech world, with stocks plummeting and much chatter about the US losing its supremacy in AI technology. Yet, for all the disruption, the Sputnik analogy reveals less about DeepSeek than about American neuroses.The original Sputnik moment came on 4 October 1957 when the Soviet Union shocked the world by launching Sputnik 1, the first time humanity had sent a satellite into orbit. It was, to anachronistically borrow a phrase from a later and even more momentous landmark, “one giant leap for mankind”, in Neil Armstrong’s historic words as he took a “small step” on to the surface of the moon.It was a significant moment in the cold war, too. A confidential White House report worried that “American prestige” had “sustained a severe blow”, giving the USSR “clear advantage in the cold war”. That fear spurred Washington into reshaping its space programme, and catalysed the Apollo missions, culminating with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming, on 20 July 1969, the first humans to walk upon another celestial body.DeepSeek, sponsored by a Chinese hedge fund, is a notable achievement. Technically, though, it is no advance on large language models (LLMs) that already exist. It is neither faster nor “cleverer” than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude and just as prone to “hallucinations” – the tendency, exhibited by all LLMs, to give false answers or to make up “facts” to fill gaps in its data. According to NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, DeepSeek’s chatbotmade false claims30% of the time and gave no answers to 53% of questions, compared with 40% and 22% respectively for the 10 leading chatbots inNewsGuard’s most recent audit.The figures expose the profound unreliability of all LLMs. DeepSeek’s particularly high non-response rate is likely to be the product of itscensoriousness; it refuses to provide answers on any issue that China finds sensitive or about which it wants facts restricted, whether Tiananmen Square or Taiwan.The true impact of DeepSeek is not on the technology but on the economics of AI. It is a chatbot as capable, and as flawed, as other current leading models, but built at a fraction of the cost and from inferior technology. TheUS banon the sale to China of the most advanced chips and chip-making equipment, imposed by the Biden administration in 2022, and tightened several times since, was designed to curtail Beijing’s access to cutting-edge technology. Paradoxically, it may have spurred Chinese researchers into becoming more innovative.Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted without global tumultDeepSeek is also free to use, and open source. The combination of low cost and openness may help democratise AI technology, enabling others, especially from outside America, to enter the market. There is a certain irony that it should be China that is opening up the technology while US firms continue to create as many barriers as possible to competitors attempting to enter the field.And here lies perhaps the biggest impact of DeepSeek. It has ripped off the veil of mystique that previously surrounded AI. Silicon Valley has nurtured the image of AI technology as a precious and miraculous accomplishment, and portrayed its leading figures, fromElon MusktoSam Altman, as prophets guiding us into a new world. The technology itself has been endowed with almost magical powers, including the promise of “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI – superintelligent machines capable of surpassing human abilities on any cognitive task – as being almost within our grasp.Last April, Musk predicted that AI would be “smarter than any human” by the end of 2025. Last month, Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the driving force behind the current generative AI boom, similarly claimed to be “confident weknow how to build AGI” and that “in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’”.Almost a decade ago, the Nobel prize-winning computer scientist Geoff Hinton urged nations to “stop training radiologists”, and similar medical technicians, because “it’s completely obvious within five years, deep learning [AI] is going to do better”. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, a corporation founded by former OpenAI employees, has claimed thatAI could double the human lifespanwithin five to 10 years. These fantasy claims have been shredded by critics such as theAmerican cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, who has evenchallenged Musk to a $1m betover his “smarter than any human” claim for AI.Nevertheless, for all the pushback, each time one fantasy prediction fails to materialise, another takes its place. Such claims derive less from technological possibilities than from political and economic needs. While AI technology has provided hugely important tools, capable of surpassing humans in specific fields, from the solving of mathematical problems to the recognition of disease patterns,the business model depends on hype. It is the hype that drives the billion-dollar investment and buys political influence, including a seat at the presidential inauguration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The disruptive quality of DeepSeek lies in questioning this approach, demonstrating that the best generative AI models can be matched with much less computational power and a lower financial burden.The hype around DeepSeek is in part a reflection of the hype around AI. It is a reflection, too, of geopolitical tensions. Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted but without the global tumult of the past two weeks. Beneath the panic lies fear of DeepSeek’s Chinese origins and ownership.Yet, too great an obsession with the geopolitics of DeepSeek can distort the lessons we take from it. The promise of more open access to such vital technology becomes subsumed into a fear of its Chinese provenance. Concerns about privacy, censorship and surveillance, rightly raised by a model such as DeepSeek, can help obscure the reality that such issuesbedevil all AI technology, not just that from China. Particularly at a time of threatened trade wars and threats to democracy, our capacity to navigate between the hype and the fear assumes new importance.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsDeepSeekOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)Silicon ValleyChinaComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

Not only have Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves run into severe turbulence over Heathrow, the flight deck deliberately steered the Labour plane into storm clouds. That’s an interesting choice for a government that was already buffeted byserious unpopularityand it’s a choice that a lot of their own party are struggling to explain to themselves. Anger about the chancellor’snew commitmentto back the expansion of the London airport and others is mingled with bewilderment. A lot of Labour people are scratching their heads trying to work out why she wants to burn political capital on a hugely contentious project that couldn’t possibly be complete until long after she’s done at the Treasury and Sir Keir is gone from Number 10.It was her choice and his. She didn’t have to make airport expansion the centrepiece of her keynote speech about growth. The prime minister, if his title means anything, could have stopped his chancellor had he wanted to. One consequence of the fury about the subject is that it diverts attention fromher more welcome thoughtsabout how to boost Britain’s growth-starved economy.No one is talking much about building new reservoirs or other features of her growth plan because airport expansion has blotted out everything else. Hostile fire was instant, will be continuous for years ahead and comes from several camps with which Labour has wanted to be friendly. For theincandescent environmentalists, Heathrow is a litmus test of whether or not the government is authentically committed to addressing the climate crisis. Backing expansion is a total fail. They kind of wanted to believe Ms Reeves back in the day when she told the Labour conference that she would be as proud to be “Britain’s first green chancellor” as she would to be its first female one. I would advise her against repeating that line, and especially not in front of green audiences, unless she enjoys being scorned.Crystal balls are darkening with a dystopian vista of years of protest and resistance to Heathrow expansion in inquiry roomsAnother group expressing disappointment are those who wanted to trust the chancellor and prime minister when they sought to contrast themselves with previous governments by saying they wouldn’t be fixated on the south-east of England and would instead seek to spread opportunity and prosperity across the country. Ms Reeves did touch on regeneration in the north and the Midlands, but her greatest emphasis was on Heathrow and reviving the push to create an Oxford-Cambridge “growth corridor”. That left the impression that she is shovelling the bulk of her chips on big-ticket projects in southern England. Labour mayors in the north are disappointed that, while she gave a nod to the desperate need to create new rail connections and upgrade existing ones between northern cities, there were no promises of cash that they could take to the bank. She declares she’s backing a majorredevelopment of Manchester United’s Old Traffordstadium and the surrounding area, but again declines to say exactly how.To these unhappy groups, we can add a third. These are the Labour MPs and ministers whose crystal balls are darkening with a dystopian vista of years of protest and resistance to Heathrow expansion in inquiry rooms, the law courts and parliament, and from antagonistic Londoners and environmental activists. The airport’s owners first started pushing for itmore than 20 years ago, but it has repeatedly stalled before takeoff over the many years since. Under successive governments going back to that of Tony Blair, it has been floated, approved, then unapproved, mooted again, approved again and then cancelled again.There’s good reason why hot flushes of enthusiasm have been followed by cold feet. On top of the additional levels of noise and air pollution that it would inflict on a very densely populated part of the country, there’s the non-trivial matter of demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting several waterways and rerouting a long stretch of the M25, Britain’s busiest motorway, anddropping it into a tunnel. “This has many years of difficult politics ahead of it,” groans one Labour strategist, pointing to the London mayoral elections in 2028 as one cause for concern.The government can pray in aid a few supportive voices, but that side of the ledger looks thin. Some business groups welcomed the announcement, before quickly returning to their gripes about the higher taxes that the chancellor is levying on them. A cluster of go-for-growth Labour MPs are rallying to her, but you can also find a lot who are either belligerent towards the idea or befuddled by it. With a massive majority, Sir Keir and Ms Reeves can likely bulldoze it through parliament if they are determined enough, but the effort will cause a lot of trouble and strife in their party.Is the chancellor discombobulated by the anger and consternation that she has generated? Her people give the impression that she no more cares about being unloved than the typical supporter of Millwall football club. The drama around the Heathrow announcement was no accident, they say. It was deliberately designed to “shift the dial” with international investors by persuading them that Ms Reeves has the grit to prioritise growth over any other consideration. One of her allies puts it this way: “Rachel’s brand as a chancellor is that she doesn’t duck the tough stuff and this is another decision which strengthens the brand.” She is treating opposition as a compliment to her steely determination to implement her new doctrine of growth-at-any-cost.Where is the cabinet in all this? Allies of the chancellor claim that “we thought we’d have a bit more of a cabinet problem than we’ve actually had”. Half of the cabinet – including Darren Jones, the number two at the Treasury, andSir Keirhimself – voted against a third runway the last time the idea was put to parliament. Another opponent then is still a dissenter now. I’m talking about Ed Miliband, the government’s most committed advocate of net zero, who took his opposition to the chancellor to the cabinet table. He’s telling his friends two things. One that he’s cross; the other that he has no intention of resigning. If he vacated his seat at the top table, Sir Keir would probably fill it with someone less committed to addressing the climate crisis, depriving the cause of a champion at the heart of government and strengthening the hand of the Treasury. And then there’s this. I suspect that the Net Zero Secretary thinks that resignation would be a pointless gesture of opposition to something that may well not happen and certainly not anytime soon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can already hear the lip-smacking among lawyers who will get rich on the legal wrangling that will accompany a marathon inquiry. The chief executive of Heathrow, Thomas Woldbye, has already conceded that getting the green light for a third runway by the end of this parliament will be “ambitious”. It is not at all clear how the government can reconcile expansion with its legally binding net zero targets.Many think it simply can’t. Some research suggests that airport expansions willeffectively nix all the carbon savingsfrom the government’s clean power programme. Ms Reeves talks breezily about flying becoming “cleaner and greener” thanks to advances in “sustainable aviation fuels”. People with more expertise in the subject point out that sustainable fuel is far pricier than traditional jet juice and only available in minuscule quantities at the moment. There are fierce arguments about whether Heathrow expansion would make a meaningful contribution to growth anyway and wildly varying estimates about how much it would cost. Heathrow’s previous plans werepriced at about £14bnwhen an estimate was produced in 2014. At least double that number, probably triple it. If investors can be found to stump up that kind of cash, they will want a return. This will meanhigher landing charges, which will most likely be passed on to customers in increased ticket prices. The chancellor asserts, but can’t possibly be confident, thatplanes will be landingon a third runway by 2035. That sounds worryingly similar to thevainglorious delivery timetableonce claimed during the sorry saga called HS2.Turning the Oxford-Cambridge arc into “Europe’s Silicon Valley” is aiming high and has its own controversies, but at least that is an ambition with plausible claims to be good for growth. Betting on Heathrow expansion looks like an excursion into political Death Valley.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayOpinionLondonTravel and transportRachel ReevesKeir StarmerEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

President Emmanuel Macron has proposedpaying for the “renaissance”of the Paris museum, in part, by increasing entrance fees for visitors from outside the EU.After some initial attempts to represent this as a direct insult – “Brits will be forced to pay more than EU residents” (theMail) – even the rabidly pro-Brexit press appears to have accepted that the scheme applies globally, to all non-EU visitors: an exceptionally cunning way of Brit-targeting, even for the French.If anything, of course, this opportunity for Britons to pay more is a proud reminder of their own Brexit triumph: a cultural dividend up there with the loss of theErasmus schemeand wrecked prospects for UK musicians. Happily for these purists, the current prime minister seems preoccupied with creating his own, potentially even uglier, legacy: that of an irreparably degraded UK environment.As for Macron’s thinking: it was anticipated only last summer by a British curator, Sir Mark Jones. He proposed that the national collections in London pay for improvements byintroducing admission feesfor overseas visitors aged over 25. After the British Museum somehow missed thousands of thefts from its collections, Jones had become interim director (the museum’s chair, the austerity enthusiast and financier George Osborne, stayed in place). Later, stepping down, Jones told theSunday Timesthat, although admission should remain free for UK taxpayers, charging overseas tourists could help with everything from the museum’s redevelopment and repairs to international partnerships, improving salaries and reducing occasionally intolerable overcrowding. He suggested that other major museums and galleries should consider doing the same.Since then, it has emerged that many of the very workers who deal, close up, with the mass tourism pressing into these invaluable spaces, are among London’slowest paid. Striking security guards at the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the V&A are asking the public toboycott the galleries all February. Their union, the United Voices of the World (UVW), notes the Science Museum’s report ofincreased visitors and profits. Separately, the V&A’s Tristram Hunt has celebrated “a successful financial return in secondary spend” that – to him – obviates the imposition of entrance fees. It can’t be unhelpful that their security staff, supplied by the contractor Wilson James, earn£13.15 a hour (the London Living Wage is £13.85).Like the Louvre, the British Museum is creaking, also leaking, under pressure to upgrade and, increasingly, to collaborateIn not charging for entry, the UK’s national museums are, as any British tourist knows, anomalous. “It would make sense,” Jones said, “for us to charge overseas visitors for admission to museums as they charge us when we visit their museums.” And largely, even when nationals and local residents are exempted, these museums do so without accusations – occasionally levelled at UK proponents of museum tourist-charging – of xenophobia. When you see Venice’s older inhabitants being shoved out of vaporetti or run into by rucksacks, wheelie cases and gurning selfie-takers, its two-tier approach seems the very least tourism can offer by way of compensation. New York’s Metropolitan Museum is likewise forgivenan exemptionwhereby the state’s residents decide their own fee.That less generous capitals deny tourists free admission does not amount to a case against the UK’s more hospitable entry principles, sometimes advertised with our-NHS levels of national pride and piety. To add to the arguments for universally free entry advanced in 2000, its supporters persuasively cite the importance, now better understood, of welcoming, to supposedly universal museums, visitors from countries that the colonising British relieved, more or less brutally, of future exhibits. Following Jones’s intervention,Prof David Abulafia arguedin theSpectatoragainst entrance fees: “These museums are custodians of their contents on behalf of all of mankind. This means that people from all countries of the world should be able to enter freely and see what these museums contain.”Yet the same argument (assuming you overlook how little is being asked of overseas tourists who have already covered the cost of getting there) applies to countless museums, galleries and churches that do extract payment, usually from everyone, for similarly being custodians of valued but contested historic assets. With great houses stuffed with colonial trophies and evidence of domestic exploitation, the National Trust, for instance, has even persuaded the paying public to delight in sites of ancestral servitude, in old laundries and freezing attics.Like the Louvre, theBritish Museumis creaking, also leaking, under pressure to upgrade and, increasingly, to collaborate. Where are the resources to come from? That’s if there is no future for my own proposal: a £50 (for now) permit for in-gallery mobile phone/watch photography. It would only inconvenience the disparate millions united by one conviction: that there’s no universal treasure that can’t be improved – including for fellow visitors – by having their own face planted in front of it.So, if not a Macron scheme, with inadequate state investment, what? At the same time that supporters of restitution and of fair pay have been demanding action from universal collections, other activists have challenged recourse to corporate funding, with campaigns against fossil fuel money, likeBP’s dealwith the British Museum. The Science Museum is under attack for itsdeal with Adani Green Energy, part of a conglomerate that invests in coal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now a raft of new offences will stop those who create heinous content escaping punishmentSun 2 Feb 2025 01.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2025 03.13 ESTShareTechnology moves fast. Legislation can be slow. For decades, that has felt like a fundamental fact of public life. But the gap between our laws and the world they are supposed to govern feels wider than ever. While the internet has transformed every element of our society, the state has not kept up.Most of the laws that prohibit the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse imagery have been in place since the 1990s. Back then, Photoshop was in its infancy. The physical photographs that paedophiles shared were no less vile, but they were easier for the police to seize and destroy.Since then, technology has completely changed the way these people operate, making it possible to create and distribute horrifyingly life-like images and videos of children in seconds. In just one month, theInternet Watch Foundationidentified more than 20,000 AI-generated images on one dark web forum.I firmly believe that AI will be a force for good in our society, helping British businesses grow and saving our doctors, teachers and nurses time so they can provide support to those who need it most. I have committed to bringing forward legislation to ensure that we can safely realise the extraordinary opportunities this technology offers in the decades to come. But the safety of children must always come first.That is why today, as part of our Plan for Change to deliver safer streets and protect the most vulnerable in society, we are announcing four new offences that will close the legal loopholes that are letting paedophiles escape punishment.In the past couple of years, we have seen a growing number of people facing prison for creating and distributing this kind of content. But we know that, for every person put behind bars, there are many more who are acting with impunity. In the outdated eyes of the law, some aren’t considered criminals at all. Today, it is actually legal to possess a “paedophile manual” that tells you – in horrifying detail – how you can use AI to sexually abuse children.We cannot pretend that all of this is new, nor can we say that we couldn’t have seen it comingWith the emergence of AI models capable of creating this kind of heinous content faster than we could have ever imagined, some might say it was inevitable that our laws fell behind. But we cannot pretend that all of this is new, nor can we say that we couldn’t have seen it coming. The fact that previous governments failed to close the loopholes that allow this technology to be used in such a vile way is unforgivable. Because every day of delay has come at a heartbreaking human cost – a cost shouldered by our children.A 15-year-old girl rang the NSPCC recently. An online stranger had edited photos from her social media to make fake nude images. The images showed her face and, in the background, you could see her bedroom. The girl was terrified that someone would send them to her parents and, worse still, the pictures were so convincing that she was scared her parents wouldn’t believe that they were fake.There are thousands of stories like this happening behind bedroom doors across Britain.Childrenbeing exploited. Parents who lack the knowledge or the power to stop it. Every one of them is evidence of the catastrophic social and legal failures of the past decade.That is why we are taking urgent action through a raft of new offences that will finally close the legal loopholes that paedophiles are exploiting to ruin young lives. If you are found in possession of a “paedophile manual”, you will now face years in jail. For the first time, we’ll imprison the people who are making the AI models that generate child sexual abuse material. Those who run or moderate websites where paedophiles share advice on how to groom children and avoid detection will spend a decade behind bars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is why we’re giving our border force the power to scan the devices of those they suspect to possess child sexual abuse material against the Child Abuse Images Database. This won’t just see more paedophiles put in prison; it will stop the tidal wave of illegal content inundating our country in its tracks.These measures are the first of their kind in the world. We are going further than any other country in the battle against AI-generated child sexual abuse material. But we are also sending a clear message to anyone who seeks to do children harm or believes that the law is too slow to catch them: you won’t be able to cower behind a keyboard any more.

Climate laws multiplied after 1997. All countries with targets met them, renewables spread much more quickly than expected, and emissions in the Kyoto bloc fell by over 20%, at least partly because of these policies.The real blame for the treaty’s eventual demise and relentlessly rising emissions today lies with fossil fuel/extreme libertarian interests and their deep-pocketed lobbying and misinformation, which led to US withdrawal and therefore a much weaker global response.The play amply demonstrates this through its anti-hero lobbyist Don Pearlman, funded by the oil majors (and in real life, also coal and other industries). Since the 1990s, powerful vested interests have sought to obstruct robust climate policies. They engineered the demise of theKyoto protocol, and continue to sabotage the strong climate action the world needs today.Dr Joanna DepledgeCambridgeTaking babies from mothersThank you for highlighting the appalling experiences of mothers whose babies are removed from their care shortly after birth (“‘I can’t sleep, I’m terrified’: the rise in mothers having their babies taken away within days of giving birth in England”, Investigation). These women are often the most judged, and their needs not understood by services. The article suggested that a psychotic episode is a possible reason for emergency child removal, but mother and baby units (MBUs) exist in many parts of the country that enable women experiencing mental health crises during pregnancy and in the two years after birth to access treatment, while also supporting the relationship between mother and infant. Crucially, these units ensure mum and baby are kept together.Women who have had their babies removed through care proceedings are at high risk of developing perinatal mental health issues and dying by suicide. Systemic change is urgently needed to ensure that the mental health of this vulnerable group is understood. The inhumane practices described in your article not only compound trauma but risk perpetuating cycles of loss and harm.Luciana Berger, chair, Maternal Mental Health Alliance, London E16Starry, starry night…It was lovely to read Jeanette Winterson and others on the joys of winter (“Winter wonder: Jeanette Winterson and others reveal why the cold has them under its spell”, Magazine). Every year, I look forward to winter so I can return to my astrophotography. The darker the better and usually the colder the better because that means clear skies, a sky that appears rock solid, full of stars that barely twinkle.As night approaches, the heavy equipment is transferred to the back garden. With guide camera glued to a guide star conducting this celestial orchestra, the data collection begins. Faint light is absorbed from 50m light years away to my garden. I awake as the scope sleeps in the morning light, holding its precious cargo of hydrogen and oxygen wisps and swirls. Let summer sunshine wait for now.Mike AndersonLymm, CheshireAirport expansion a disasterThe combination of Labour promoting airport expansion and voting down the climate and nature bill is a disaster (“Labour risks ‘powder keg’ clash over environment as it puts growth before green agenda”, News).Reeves must have reached panic stations to claim that economic growth, helped by airport expansion, is more important than net zero. Everyone in government knows that if net zero targets are missed the planet becomes uninhabitable sooner rather than later.Given the importance of growth and housebuilding, why is the government not promoting the manufacture of wind turbines, solar panels and all the components needed for green building that currently have to be imported from the EU or elsewhere? It might be possible to combine growth with housebuilding at the same time as working towards net zero and rescuing life on the planet as we know it.David HayhowChew Magna, SomersetHow can Rachel Reeves propose expansion of Heathrow, while maintaining a commitment to sustainability? (“In her pursuit of growth, Rachel Reeves must go green and go local”, Editorial) The idea is laughable that “sustainable airline fuel” is in any way better than conventional fuel at bringing down the environmental level of CO2.Much more beneficial would be an increased tax on the use of private jets landing or taking off in the UK, and investing it in improved public transport. That would definitely encourage growth and lower CO2 emissions.Bill SpearsTutzing, GermanyCleave to Europe, not TrumpAt last, someone senior in the government, chancellor Rachel Reeves, has admitted that Brexit was a serious mistake and how much it has damaged the UK and business (“‘Move closer to Europe – not Trump’, voters tell Starmer in major UK poll”, News).Why has it taken so long for the government to realise and admit the stupidity of what the last government started on lies? No wonder this country is in the black hole that it finds itself. Britain should certainly draw closer into the arms of Europe rather than to what is a timebomb waiting to go off in the US.Mimia Umney-GrayDorchester-on-Thames, OxfordshireLimiting the power of moneyClearly it is time for change when a majority of even Conservative voters believe that the rich have too much political influence (“Nearly two-thirds of Britons say very rich have too much influence on politics”, News).The solution is state funding of political parties, distributed in proportion to the number of votes received at the previous general election, together with a very strict limit on the size of donations that people can give on top of that. To be a truly grownup democracy, we also need to introduce proportional representation, ideally in the form of multi-member constituencies. These are roughly proportional, they keep a constituency link and they mean that the vast majority of voters will have at least one local MP, with whose views they are in sympathy.Richard MountfordHildenborough, KentSeeing with Melania’s eyesDear Catherine Bennett, I love your wonderfully delicious and satirical article (“‘You want to see my eyes, you pay extra.’ The Secret Diary of Melania Trump”, Comment).

Mr Trump’s proposal takes its name from Israel’s air defence system, but it is cast in more ambitious terms for the US: a space-based interception system designed to counter nuclear, hypersonic and cruise missile threats.It is also the latest turn of the wheel in a cycle of escalation. Moves by Washington to “increase security” have repeatedly ended up making the world more volatile and unsafe. The historic chance to eliminate nuclear weapons in1986slipped away over Ronald Reagan’s insistence on America’s unproven “Star Wars” missile defence system. In 2002, George W Bush – citing the threat from North Korea – ditched the anti-ballistic missile treaty, which was built on the idea that mutual vulnerability cools the nuclear arms race while unchecked defences fuel it. In The New Nuclear Age, Ankit Panda points out that Russia and China responded with countermeasures to ensure “their nuclear forces would have the ability to penetrate a sophisticated US system”.The upshot of such policies has been that Russia and China can deliver devastating nuclear attacks against which the US has no real hope of defence, while North Korea has intercontinental ballistic missiles that can hit the US mainland. Proverbially, insanity is repeating the same action and expecting a different outcome. Yet Mr Trump is launching Star Wars II. Given the technological hurdles and prohibitive costs involved, the odds are that itsvisionwill never be realised. The rhetorical effect, however, is likely to be to scare other countries into building more nukes.Mr Trump’s executive order also represents a shift in US policy. Rather than missile defence centring on “rogue states” such as North Korea and Iran, it is being refocused on Russia and China. Its logic is that a new system would be such a strong deterrent that it would reduce the temptation for enemies to attack in the first place. Whether it does misses the point that it risks triggering an uncontrolledarms race.InJanuary2022, a month before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the five recognised nuclear powers reaffirmed the “taboo” that using nuclear weapons is morally unacceptable. But their continued strategic value shows that nukes have not been truly stigmatised – because if they were, no one would be discussing them as useful military tools. Indeed, the dangerous rhetoric from MrTrump, Russia’s VladimirPutinand even India’s NarendraModisuggests a worrying normalisation of a nuclear exchange.This is particularly concerning when detente, eventually pursued by the US and the Soviet Union in the cold war, “appears elusive in this new three‑player great power nuclear contest” between Washington, Moscow and Beijing, as Mr Panda writes. The use of just a fraction of the trio’s nuclear arsenals would lead to mass destruction on an unprecedented scale. Unless there is a major shift, the last remaining US-Russia arms control treaty,New Start, which limits strategic nuclear warheads and restricts missile launcher numbers, will expire in 2026. US, Chinese and Russian officials must sit down together and rebuild nuclear stability. The world’s survival rests on them reviving an adversarial cooperation. True security comes fromarms controland reductions and creative nuclear diplomacy, not trying to build an impenetrable shield.Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionForeign policyDonald TrumpNorth KoreaRussiaChinaeditorialsShareReuse this content"

More than 50 years later, it is still relevantSun 2 Feb 2025 12.25 ESTShareIn 1987, just under half the population – 48% –still believedthat a man’s main job was to earn money, and a woman’s to look after the home, according to the British Social Attitudes survey. By 2022 that had plummeted to 9%. Yet while the proportion of women in full-time jobs hassoared, the burden of domestic labour still falls unfairly on their shoulders in heterosexual households – whereas same-sex couples tend to divide it more equally. Men are doing more than they did, but women still do most – even when they are the main breadwinners, US researchhas shown. Beliefs have been transformed, but behaviour has proved more stubborn.Globally, the UN hasreportedthat women do at least two-and-a-half times more household and care work than men, equivalent to 10%-39% of the gross domestic product of member states. In the US, analysis suggests that women – who make up half of the paid workforce – account for almost 80% of the unpaid domestic work: worth around $3.6tn a year. Yet this labour isnot included in GDPand in many countries is ignored or insufficiently recognised when it comes to divorce.So a new book on a half-century-old campaign –Wages for Housework: The Story of a Movement, an Idea, a Promise– offers food for thought today. Prof Emily Callaci traces the history and impact of the polarising feminist Marxist movement.“They say it’s love – we say it’s unwaged work,”wroteSilvia Federici, one of its founders. It was not just that women’s labour was going unrecognised and unrewarded, and that women lacked autonomy as a result. It was also about recognising that unpaid work is integral to capitalism, sustaining the souls and bodies needed for paid work with smiles as well as hot suppers. The campaign argued, too, that women’s paid labour is least valued when it mirrors the unpaid work they already do.The movement was international and intersectional, with the groups Wages Due Lesbians and Black Women for Wages for Housework soon emerging. But it was always a small strand insecond-wave feminismand it remains controversial. Its key figures split. Manysaw itas inviting capitalism into the home, encouraging women’s relegation to that sphere, or cementing the unequal domestic burden. In response, Selma James, another of its founders,accusedmiddle-class feminists of idealising the workplace: “I had waitressed, packed sweets, and wired and soldered TVs on an assembly line. Liberation didn’t look like that!” she wrote.Some activists demanded wages as a practical solution, while others saw the idea as a tool for challenging deeper systemic issues. In Prof Callaci’swords, it was “the starting point for a more fundamental transformation of our political imagination: the conjuring of a world organized around care rather than capitalist growth, the destruction of the environment, and pointless productivity”.That might mean, for example, paying farmers to support nature rather than produce food. The movement has inspired prison abolitionists, members of Argentina’s Ni Una Menos campaign against male violence, organisers of paid domestic workers, and proponents of a universal basic income. It now calls for an incomefor all caring work, whether that be of people or the planet. It is not just a question of whether we value what we do not pay for – but of the cost when we do not value what matters.Explore more on these topicsWomenOpinionWork & careersFeminismInequalityUnited NationsDomestic workerseditorialsShareReuse this content"

She has danced leading roles in all the great classical ballets includingSwan LakeandThe Sleeping Beauty, has performed in works by Kenneth MacMillan and Frederick Ashton, and created many new ballets, particularly those by Christopher Wheeldon, who cast her as Alice in his three-actAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and as Hermione inThe Winter’s Tale. She has recently become principal guest artist at the Royal Ballet and is taking a teaching diploma. She lives in west London with her boyfriend and their two daughters, aged four and two.You’re about to make your debut asTatianainJohn Cranko’sOnegin, based on Pushkin’s classic verse-novel. How are you feeling?It’s a funny sensation making such a significant debut so late in my career: it made me feel quite vulnerable, but also it was very thrilling. It’s been a lovely journey but it’s surprisingly physical. I did my first run through on stage at an 11am rehearsal and when I went to tear up Onegin’s letter at the end [as Tatiana sends him away], I had no strength in my arms. I hadn’t anticipated that. Mind you, an early call is always weird – it’s hard to eat properly. You might have a bit of breakfast, but suddenly you finish the rehearsal, and it’s 2pm. You can’t eat a sandwich in the middle of a three-act ballet.Do you do background reading as well as just learning the steps?I’ve been completely consumed with it. I bought a first edition of the Pushkin and then another copy from Waterstones that could get ruined in my handbag. Tatiana is an amazing character.You can’t plan your life because who knows what opportunities there are out thereShe ages on stage from a young girl to a mature woman. Every ballerina is always the wrong age for some of it…There are some ballets where I think about age, but if you feel you can transmit the essence of the character, that transcends age. And yet I’m not doingRomeo and Julietthis season, not because I don’t love it, but because I felt it might be someone else’s opportunity now. I feel genuinely fulfilled.And inAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland, you’ve stopped playing Alice and now play the wickedRed Queen?Oh,that was a trip! You don’t know if it’s good until you’ve got an audience and they laugh. It had been such a whirlwindcreating Alicewhen I was younger and coming back to it and being the Queen was like flipping a coin. I thoroughly loved all eight shows, apart from the performance when I went to collect the plate of tarts – and there were no tarts! I wanted the stage to open up. I had to carry on. But I was as cross as the Red Queen could be.View image in fullscreenWith William Bracewell in Swan Lake at the Royal Opera House, 2020.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDancers, like sports people, know their career ends young. How do you navigate that knowledge?You can’t plan your life because who knows what opportunities there are out there. My daughter Peggy doesn’t want me to stop dancing. But I don’t see gradually stopping performing as a sad thing, perhaps because I am still dancing. There’s a saying that dancers die twice, the first time when they stop dancing. But if you look at it with the glass half full, it means dancers get two lives.Why did you decide to take a teaching diploma at theRoyal Ballet School?I felt like I needed some foundations. I might not be a teacher my whole life, but I think in some capacity I might be a coach. I didn’t want to miss out that step in terms of the classwork and the pedagogy of learning. As dancers, you don’t ever get to really learn for the sake of learning. We don’t go to university. I had my contract with theRoyal Balletwhen I was 17. So now, I wanted just to learn things.You’re one of the few female principals who have children. How do you manage that?When I met Matt, my boyfriend, I got pregnant quite quickly. It completely changed my life – my children are lovely. I have a Norland nanny [trained at the prestigious Norland College], and I have benefited from that peace of mind. But sometimes at weekends I’ll take a child with me to work. I love the fact that my daughters will grow up understanding the theatre. And I always try to make sure they understand everything that goes on behind the scenes as opposed to just focusing on the ballet.How would you feel if the girls wanted to dance?If they want to, then that’s fine, but if they want to retire when they’re seven, that’s even better. They do love doing ballet but perhaps that’s because they see me doing it. They’ve both got some artistic qualities, but maybe I’m just imagining that!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Apparently on my first lesson it was like watching a duck take to water. I just never looked back. It was never a question of, “do you still want to do it?” It was always just, what’s next? It felt like my destiny. I’ve been on stage since the age of four.Do you think the ballet world has changed since you started?There’s definitely a focus on the whole person now. There is a lot of support for any sort of issues that you might be having and people around who can spot them as they arise. It feels like a safe space. Also, individuals and individuality are celebrated. And the more that happens, the more ballet will broaden.Is thereanythingyou think you would’ve liked to do if you weren’t a dancer?When I was at school, you had to write down the things you would want to be if you weren’t a dancer and I wrote: interior designer, tennis player, detective. Matt and I share a passion for interior design, and we’ve done a couple of projects together. Would I do it full time?

Meet the new artistic directors with great plans for British theatreOur ​theatre critic welcomes inspiring developments at stages across the UK,​ from the Young Vic to the Liverpool Everyman while, below, some of the top new recruits talk about working post-pandemic in an era of funding cuts – and share the secrets of their tradeIntroduction bySusannah Clapp, interviews byKillian FoxSun 2 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTShareIt happens every few years. An artistic director leaves a theatre; another steps up or down or sideways to take the position; a third follows. Within months a sweeping change has occurred and the theatrical landscape looks entirely different.Afterthe last spin of the wheel in 2019the crucial changes were immediately evident. They marked the beginning of the end of a particular hegemony: that of the white British male. This time the alterations are inspiriting in a different way. The talent and the zeal, the raring-to-go of the directors taking up new positions, have survived one of the bleakest of arts eras. In lockdown the stage was shredded: the National Theatre in London was wrapped up in barrier tape saying “Missing Live Theatre”; freelance performers, designers and directors were stripped of all income, often forced to leave their professions. In the social distancing that followed, auditoriums looked like crime scenes, with seats sealed off.Meanwhile the arts have slipped off the school curriculum: treated as merely decorative; assumed in the case of theatre to be the domain of kids who go to fee-paying schools equipped with their own stages. When the actor Michael Sheen launched – and funded – the Welsh National Theatrelast month, he talked of a “climate of fear” surrounding funding in the country.Sheen took Laurence Olivier, founder of the National Theatre, as his figurehead. In 2009 another inspirational head of that theatre, Richard Eyre, gave a wonderful account of what it is to be an artistic director in his bookNational Service. Eyre detailed the thrilling, onerous components of the job – the programming, the fundraising, the rows, the bombardment from performers, audiences, writers, designers, engineers – and the emotional toll and excitement the post entails. He did not offer a prescription for success. There is no such thing, any more than there is for a sellout show: who would have predicted thatOedipuswould have people fighting for tickets last year?There are other barriers artistic directors need to bash down. Crossing the threshold of a theatre can be like entering sacred ground – and then being kettledVitality is in difference and independence: it can be fuelled by responding to a particular place and time, or by conjuring up an imaginative, wide-ranging project. It is invigorating to hear Elizabeth Newman’s very particular plans for Sheffield Theatres, which continue the tradition – seen most recently inStanding at the Sky’s Edge– of responding to the city. Actor Alan Cumming, who has just taken over as the self-styled “Pied Piper of Pitlochry”, has yet to announce his programming atthe Highland theatre, but is also looking to give it both local roots and a long reach.Equally,David Byrne’s more general plan for the Royal Court – Starmer-like in its long-termism – has the authoritative sound of a carefully considered vision. And I am betting that Indhu Rubasingham – the woman behind bothThe Wife of WillesdenandThe Father and the Assassin– will make the National Theatre’s three stages distinctive, not allow them to be scaled-down versions of each other: the National is best when, like London, it is a series of interlinked settlements with separate identities. I hope Rubasingham also puts some Kiln-like fire into the cafes.One show may put a theatre on the map – look whatOperation Mincemeatdid for Byrne at theNew Diorama. Yet an artistic director must provide a glimmer of expectation that persists, surrounding a theatre even after a less buoyant – or rotten – production. The Almeida has had that glimmerunder Rupert Goold, who next year takes over the Old Vic. He has generated a sense of necessity – the equivalent of building a library – that is not dependent on any one claim to authority (new writing, musicals, visual flair) but which continually trips you up with surprise: you have to keep attending.The emphasis on ticket prices here is right. It is not only that ridiculously high charges keep people out. Unless audiences feel able to be more casual about theatregoing and take a chance on a new play, new plays will not be programmed. There are other barriers that artistic directors need to bash down. Historically one of these has been the buildings themselves: crossing the threshold has often been like entering sacred ground – and then like being kettled. That is slowly changing: at theredesigned Nationaland atthe Bridge(both taken in hand by the firm ofHaworth Tompkins), spectators are eased from exterior to interior. The West End – and Old Vic – might take note.Meanwhile: let’s also have some bans. On putting versions of movies on to the stage. On jetting in celebrities to suck the energy out of a production. When Sheen was asked if he would be approaching Catherine Zeta-Jones and other Welsh exiles to act in his theatre, he said they would face stiff competition from actors who actually lived in Wales. Hwre!Susannah ClappIndhu Rubasingham: ‘Every audience likes a good story, well told’National Theatre, London SE1; takes up her new post on 1 April“It’s a little mad, but it’s OK,” laughs Indhu Rubasingham, who is still coming to terms with landing the top job in British theatre.It was announced in December 2023 that she would be taking over as artistic director at the National – the first woman and person of colour to be appointed to the role. Previously, Rubasingham was at theKiln theatrein north London, where, in 11 and a half years, she oversaw a major renovation and rebrand while delivering crossover hits such asRed VelvetandThe Father. The biggest difference in her new job – she takes over officially from Rufus Norris in April but has spent the past eight months prepping for it – is scale. “There are about 900 full-time staff and over 1,500 freelancers at the National, compared to a staff of 35 to 40 [at the Kiln],” she says. “But the principles are basically the same.”Rubasingham, 54, grew up in the East Midlands and dreamed of becoming a doctor before falling for theatre in her mid-teens (“I like diagnosing,” she says). She did a drama degree at Hull and made a splash as a director in her 20s, but for a long time felt “utterly intimidated” in a predominantly white industry. Taking charge of an institution was another “really big leap”, and the biggest lesson she took from it was building “resilience at every level: how you keep going, how you programme, how you deal with critics, how you deal with your staff, how you lead… Every moment has been a learning curve.”She’s keeping the details of her vision for the National under wraps until March, but mainly, she says, “it’s to try and appeal to as many people as possible. Audiences like a good story, well told, and that’s true whether you’re at the Kiln or the National.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte Lucas and Adrian Lester in Red Velvet at the Tricycle theatre, directed by Indhu Rubasingham, 2012.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianWho or what first got you into theatre?I did work experience at Nottingham Playhouse when I was 16 and that ignited the bug, being backstage and getting obsessed with it. The same year, I sawThe Normal Heartby Larry Kramer. It was the first contemporary play I’d been taken to see. I didn’t realise theatre could be so relevant and in the moment. The political was really emotional – that was the jolt.Dream person to work with – dead or alive?Alive,Viola Davis, because she’s a powerhouse and has theatre in her bones. I’d love to see her rip up the National Theatre stage. And the person who’s passed away would be [Malian-Burkinabé actor]Sotigui Kouyaté. He was one of Peter Brook’s actors, an amazing presence.What’s the hardest part of your job?Finding enough time.What can’t you live without at work?Comfortable shoes. There’s a lot of walking to be done at the National. I had boots on yesterday and my feet were knackered! Everyone is telling me to look after myself, to not get burned out. I’m still trying to work out how. I could give you an answer – regular massages, peppermint tea instead of caffeine – but it wouldn’t be true.David Byrne: ‘Anything is possible if you plan enough for it’Royal Court, London SW1;in the job since January 2024“I see this as a 10-year project,” David Byrne says of his new job at the Royal Court, adding, with no small degree of ambition: “I see it as 10 years to fundamentally change the culture of playwriting in this country.”Byrne, 41, took over from Vicky Featherstone last January, leaving behindNew Diorama, the theatre he founded 10 years earlier. His tenure there, in a small building near Regent’s Park, was distinguished by a risk-taking approach and several successful transfers, includingOperation Mincemeat. “We also did a big lockdown project where we built 25 rehearsal rooms in the City and gave them away free for a year,” says Byrne. At New Diorama, he learned “that anything is possible if you plan enough for it, with the right team behind you – and I think I brought some of that energy with me here”.His first year at the Royal Court backs him up. He began with an adaptation of Maggie Nelson’sBluets, making extensive use of screens and live cameras, and struck gold with Mark Rosenblatt’sGiant, starring John Lithgow as Roald Dahl, which tackled antisemitism andtransfers to the West End in April. His team launched an initiative calledthe Writers’ Card“to bring together the playwriting community to work out how we best support writers”, and has speeded up the response time for open submissions. “There is [an unsolicited] script sitting on my desk as we talk. We had the writer in last week who was absolutely stunned to hear from us.”When he speaks about transforming the UK’s playwriting culture, Byrne acknowledges that “people might think I’m going power mad. But ultimately, we are at risk of a very censorious artistic culture where writers feel unable to take risks and theatres are afraid of taking those bigger swings. And I think, historically, when the Royal Court has been brave, it has made the entire culture braver.”View image in fullscreenGiant, starring John Lithgow (in blue) as Roald Dahl, at the Royal Court in 2024, part of David Byrne’s first season.Photograph: Manuel HarlanWhat three words sum up your theatre?Provocative, contemporary and dissonant.What are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Open-heartedness: the worst thing in theatre is to come across as hard to please – you’ve got to want to celebrate the work of others. Curiosity: you’ve got to be always wanting to find the new, and always interested in what’s coming up in the culture. And the ability to create space: in a time of polarisation, where there are a lot of conflicting views, you’ve got to be able to allow space for equilibrium and for working together.Dream person to work with – dead or alive?I’ve been reading about Lilian Baylis, who was at the Old Vic and who, among her eccentric behaviour, used to cook sausages in an oven she put into the wings… I was thinking: however irritating I must be sometimes, at least I’ve never sprayed fat on the props table. So I think she’d have been quite fun to work with, if only to get my eccentricities in context.What can’t you live without at work?I’ve eaten a huge amount of fruit pastilles this year. I don’t know why. I don’t drink, really, and I don’t smoke or do drugs. But I’ve had a real hunger for fruit pastilles. I think it’s partly about stress relief. (I say I don’t drink: I have actually started drinking since taking up this job.)Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatregoing type.I think it’s OK not to enjoy going to the theatre. I come from a family who don’t enjoy it, and me working in theatre has not convinced them otherwise. I think it is fundamentally part of the human experience, coming together to experience stuff, but I don’t necessarily think it’s for everybody, and that’s all right. There are other forms of culture which are equally enriching.Are ticket prices too high?I think it depends on which ticket prices. At the Court we’re still very cheap. Over half of our tickets downstairs last year were £22.50 or lower – that’s really affordable – but obviously elsewhere they are more expensive. I still think there are affordable tickets out there for people wanting to go and see shows.Elizabeth Newman: ‘It’s like being a vicar. I’m in service to this city’Sheffield Theatres;in post since December 2024Elizabeth Newman has only just moved to Sheffield when we speak and hasn’t yet started her new job atSheffield Theatres, but already she’s fizzing with ideas. Within minutes, the 38-year-old is brainstorming a play about an ice-creamery she has just visited, and another about the city’s workers banding together to set up Sheffield University. “For me, being an artistic director is being a public servant, or a vicar,” she says. “I’m in service to this city. It’s about how we share its story with the world.”For the previous six and a half years, Newman was in charge of thePitlochry Festival theatre, where she was known for her community engagement as well as the work she brought to the stage – including her own award-winning production of Brian Friel’sFaith Healer. Before that, she was artistic director of Bolton’s Octagon theatre, and over her career she has directed more than 100 productions around the UK. It’s all the more impressive given that, aged 13 and growing up in Croydon, she developed a neurological condition that left her unable to move from the neck down. She gave up her dream of becoming a ballet dancer and switched to directing, training at Rose Bruford College while relearning how to walk.At Sheffield Theatres – which comprises the Playhouse, the Crucible, the Lyceum and now the Montgomery – Newman wants to create a supportive environment so that actors and others can be free to take risks. She acknowledges how difficult the climate is for UK theatres at the moment but says that it’s an artistic director’s job to weather it. “That is the job – you face the challenge,” she says.“It’s a bit like learning how to walk again. You can either sit down and go ‘Oh, well, I’ve been told it’s not possible.’ Or you can go ‘I’m going to give it a bloody good try, and use all of myself to do it.’ Our role as artistic directors is to have vision, to lead the vision, to inspire people to achieve things that they never thought were possible.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Costigan in Faith Healer, directed by Elizabeth Newman, at the Pitlochry Festival theatre, 2019.Photograph: Douglas McBrideWhat are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Empathy, the ability to hold many things at once, and a deep love of place and people.What’s your favourite theatre in the world (not your own)?The National Theatre. It serves the nation, because it’s new and old. I decided I wanted to be a director for two reasons. The first was seeingAngels in Americaon the telly, which changed my life. The other thing was, at 17, school took us to see the revival ofSimon McBurney’sMeasure for Measureat the National, and three people made a helicopter land on stage just by moving their arms and bodies. I was just thinking, this is amazing, and it was mixed together with the most beautiful language and extraordinary acting. After that, the National became the place that I felt really welcome because of what Nick Hytner did with the Travelex £10 tickets, so I could afford to go as I got older. I saw all these amazing things that I could only dream of.What can’t you live without at work?Diet Coke and a bag of salt and vinegar crisps.Amit Sharma: ‘We can’t shy away from the political issues we’re facing’The Kiln, London NW6;in post since December 2023For Amit Sharma, a key part of his job as artistic director ofthe Kiln, which he took over in December 2023 from Indhu Rubasingham, is embracing complexity. “The best type of theatre isn’t saying ‘We’re in this one camp’. Actually, it’s exploring all the camps,” he says. “We’re living in such a complex world and we can’t shy away from all the political issues we’re facing.”Sharma, who was previously the Kiln’s associate director, is also acutely aware of his audiences and their needs. “We serve a local community,” he says. “The current audience is really diverse, it’s reflective of London and the international flavour of people that live here, and our ticket prices have to reflect the local audiences – and through community engagement we’re trying to bring in that next generation [of actors and theatre-makers].”Born in India and raised in Southall, west London, Sharma fell in love with theatre at school and worked as an actor for 10 years before the strain of touring – he has a physical impairment – prompted him to switch to directing. He worked atGraeae, Manchester Royal Exchange and Birmingham Rep before joining the Kiln.Getting the top job left him “speechless”, Sharma says, and he feels the pressure to match up. “On a personal level, because so few disabled people have been in these positions, I feel it’s really important to go ‘Disabled peoplecando this job equally if not better than their non-disabled counterparts.’ I’ve got a point to prove – not just for myself but for the next generation.”View image in fullscreenGraeae’s Cosmic Scallies at the Edinburgh international festival fringe, 2017, directed by Amit Sharma.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/the GuardianWhat’s the hardest part of your job?[Finding] family time.What can’t you live without at work?Sense of humour. If you ask people, sometimes they’ll say the sense of humour wasn’t needed, but I just put it in, because we’re not doctors or whatever, we’re making theatre. We should really just chill out a bit.Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatregoing type.Do you like stories? Do you like stories being told to you live? Then theatre is for you, because that’s essentially what it’s about.Are ticket prices too high?It’s so hard, because making theatre is expensive, right? So some of [the high pricing] is for good reasons. But it has to be accessible. I grew up on a council estate, and if I didn’t have the under-26 offers or whatever, I wouldn’t have been able to engage. And then it does become elitist. So it’s for us to strive to make theatre prices accessible by working harder to get people who might have a bit more money to support those that can’t access theatre like they can.Kate Wasserberg: ‘It’s been like coming home’Theatr Clwyd, Mold, Flintshire;in post since September 2024If having faith in Wales and its creative talent was a key requirement forTheatr Clwyd’s board when appointing their new artistic director, they found the ideal candidate in Kate Wasserberg. The 44-year-old from Stafford “fell hook, line and sinker for Wales” when she first worked at the Flintshire theatre in 2007, rising to associate director underTerry Hands. She went on to set upthe Other Room theatrein Cardiff, run new writing company Stockroom and direct James Graham’sBoys from the Blackstuff, but returning to Mold for her “dream job” has felt “in every way like coming home”.Beyond its theatrical offerings, one of the things Wasserberg loves about Theatr Clwyd is its work with communities. She aims to create a world-class workplace for her staff, with on-site counselling services, and has conducted a review of freelancer pay, adding up all the time and effort it takes to make a show. “As a result, freelancer fees have gone right up.”Covering these costs “will means that we make slightly fewer shows,” she says. The theatre is also diversifying. When Clwyd’s brand-new premises open this summer, at the cost of £50m, there will be event spaces and a restaurant in partnership with chef Bryn Williams. “So they all help [financially]. They are all part of the picture.”Wasserberg sees UK theatre as “an incredible community that is hanging on by its fingernails… People often say ‘Theatre or the NHS?’ But if you’re running a programme for at-risk children where you’re engaging with them using the arts, you might be part of the picture that reduces the burden on the NHS. So I think theatre is doing its bit.”View image in fullscreenBoys from the Blackstuff, directed by Kate Wasserberg, at the Royal Court, Liverpool, 2023.Photograph: Jason Roberts photographyWhat are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Candour, empathy and curiosity.Dream person to work with – dead or alive?I would make a musical with Joni Mitchell. I love her. She’s a storyteller. Every single one of her songs is like a play.What’s the hardest part of your job?Saying no. Sometimes, you love the work but it’s just not right for your building.Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatregoing type.Have a night out and let us tell you a brilliant story. You’ll feel better. I really do think that. In an increasingly atomised society, people are genuinely craving those moments of togetherness and community.Nadia Fall: ‘Theatre is the greatest deep therapy you’ll get’Young Vic, London SE1; in post since January“It is a bloody privilege to do it,” says Nadia Fall, who takes over from Kwame Kwei-Armah as artistic director at theYoung Victhis month, “but it is your life, seven days a week, and it does become who you are. The theatre becomes as much your family as your real family.” That, she thinks, is why there’s been an exodus of artistic directors from British theatres lately. “It takes some stamina, and lots of people, once they’ve done one stint, they don’t want to do another. Also, post-Brexit and Covid, it’s more full-on than it ever was.”Fall, who grew up in south London not far from the Young Vic, as well as in the Middle East, took up her first artistic director position at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 2017 and had a terrific run, putting on varied productions such as August Wilson’sKing Hedley II, which she directed, and an Olivier-winning version of Britten’sNoye’s Fluddewith the ENO featuring local schoolchildren. “I absolutely loved it,” she says of her seven-and-a-half-year tenure, but Covid struck midway through “and I don’t think things have been the same since. It’s costing more and more to make a show, and we’re getting less and less [money]. And loads of talented people have left the industry because it wasn’t viable.”Nonetheless, she’s thrilled to be starting at the Young Vic. “It’s got a similar spirit to Stratford East: it’s still a bit of a mischievous child. It likes stories that provoke and ask questions. What’s exciting to me artistically is that the audiences really want to be challenged there.”View image in fullscreenKibong Tanji in The Sun, the Moon and the Stars, directed by Nadia Fall, at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, 2021.Photograph: The Other RichardWhat three words sum up your theatre?Rebellious, global, event.What one show should we come and see there?James Graham’sPunch. He’s got the Midas touch and I’m really interested in a play around restorative justice. I’m so glad it’s coming to London.Dream person to work with, dead or alive?My friendLesley Manville. There isn’t a word that actor utters that you don’t believe, she is so authentic and nuanced, yet at the same time like a little titan. I thought she was extraordinarily inOedipus. There’s nothing she can’t do, and I can’t believe we haven’t worked together. We must correct that. If you put it in the paper she’ll feel guilty and she’ll have to do it.What’s your favourite theatre in the world (not your own)?Epidaurus outside Athens. It’s thousands of years old, and you can imagine people thousands of years ago sitting there watching the ancient plays. We tookPhèdrewith Helen Mirrenthere when I was an associate at the National and there were howling wolves and bats flying across the set. It was a proper spiritual experience. It’s electric.What’s the hardest part of your job?I always wish I could give birth to time.Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatregoing type.It’s like saying you don’t like music. You just need the right song for the right mood that fits you. People who say that just haven’t found their jam yet, just need to be matchmade with the right show. And do you know what? It’s the cheapest form of group therapy that you’ll ever get. It sounds a bit frivolous to say that, but it’s actually proven.Life is hard: the climate catastrophe is unfolding, there’s war blazing around the globe, and it’s really tough for people – and where do we congregate? We congregate in a theatre and we practise the act of empathy by watching plays. And that is group therapy. That’s what the Greeks got their citizens to do, to practise the act of empathy. Put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Physiologically, our bodies change when we’re watching a play. Our heartbeats sync with the actors on stage, with each other. That stuff is real. So I think it’s good for your health.Nathan Powell: ‘The rehearsal room is my happy place’Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse; in post full-time since December 2024It takes several tries to pin Nathan Powell down for an interview. That’s because, although he started part-time as creative director atLiverpool’s Everyman and Playhouse theatresin August, he’s been dashing around fulfilling prior commitments, directingThe Mountaintopat Curve in Leicester and thenAlice in Wonderlandat Shakespeare North.When we finally speak, the London-born writer-director tells me that for many years, his “bread and butter has been in community arts or working with young people”. He moved to Liverpool seven years ago to work with youth theatre company20 Stories Highand stayed to start a family, though freelance gigs have taken him all over the country. One of his concerns at Everyman and Playhouse is making the spaces accessible to all. “I haven’t always felt comfortable in theatres,” says Powell, “and I think that’s cultural.” But he believes attitudes are shifting. “It feels like theatres want to be more open spaces that when I was younger.”Unlike others here, Powell’s title is creative director rather than artistic director. The differences, he says, are fairly minimal. “It’s partly about broadening the scope of who could apply. They were very specific that you didn’t need that sort of artistic background [as a writer or director] to be in the role.” There’s less of an emphasis on staging work himself and more on facilitating others. To this end, Powell is keen to programme shows that are about or by local people while making room for risk-taking. His first season opens in April with his own playTakeaway, about a family-run Caribbean shop during riots in Liverpool, and also includes an experimental piece by Wirral-born playwright Billie Collins entitledThe Walrus Has a Right to Adventure.View image in fullscreenRay Strasser-King and Justina Kehinde in The Mountaintop at the Curve, Leicester, 2024, directed by Nathan Powell.Photograph: Ellie KurttzWhat are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Kindness, patience and a thick skin.Who or what first got you into theatre?I remember my auntie took me, my sister and our cousins to seeThe Lion Kingin the West End when we were really little. I don’t actually remember the show very much, I just remember being wowed and like, “Oh my gosh, this is insane.” I didn’t expect to walk into such an inconspicuous building and see all of this on stage.Best production you’ve seenrecently?I Am Steven Gerrardat the Liverpool Royal Court. I remember being in the audience with lots of people that thought they were coming to see a show about Steven Gerrard, who were all very excited, and then one of the first lines of the play is something like, “I fucking hate Jürgen Klopp,” and the whole audience gasped. [It was a] story in beautiful verse about this young man trying to find his identity because he couldn’t care less about football, and the audience were with him the whole way through. It was a beautiful piece of theatre.What can’t you live without at work?Laughter and silliness. The rehearsal room is my happy place. I’m not much of an “organised fun” person, but that’s the only place where I like organised fun, which is really just having a place where we can just laugh and enjoy what we’re doing.Are ticket prices too high?What surveys of ticket prices often leave off are regional theatres – the focus is on the West End. We work pretty hard to make sure that our ticket prices stay accessible. If you’re under 26 you can sign up toYEP[the theatres’ free youth membership programme] to get £5 tickets. But of course, it’s still a barrier to lots of people, isn’t it?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.These last few weeks, Sheila Hancock has surrendered. “I’m addicted, really,” she’s confessing. “I just can’t stop myself. I’m at it every night, without fail.” She halts, shakes her head, looks troubled, momentarily. “And everyone is fucking crying all the time. I can’t understand why for the life of me.” She leans forward, blue eyes piercing. Clocking my confusion, she grins wryly. “I’m talking about that television show, darling. What’s it called? No, don’t tell me. I’ll get there.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Her old pal Gyles Brandreth, Hancock informs me, always makes her find the word she’s searching for when it escapes her. “He won’t chip in. ‘Youmustremember it yourself,’ he says, ‘because not doing so makes you forget.’ So I do, when forced.”“The Traitors. That’s it.” She mimics the players’ blubbering. “Do you think they’re goaded to tears off camera? We love the word ‘emotional’ now,” she says. “Getting married? Long day? Emotional! Everybody feels they have to be since Diana died. We’ve become a nation that lays flowers and performs crying our eyes out. I’d like it more if we girded our loins and actuallydidsomething, but it’s bloody good TV. Anyway I’m not late, am I?” she asks, alarmed, briefly.Keeping up withHancock, it’s immediately clear, is quite the conversational adventure. Hers is a rapid-fire style of tête-à-tête: inquisitive, playful, sharp; quick-witted and potty-mouthed (“Fucking wankers”; “Bastards, darling!”) She’s chicly dressed in triple denim (wide-leg jeans, cap, jacket replete with floral prints, £28, Oxfam) and white blouse. She flits between nuanced thoughts on politics, technology and contemporary culture, and thenprotesting that asshe approaches 92, the modern world is baffling. “It’s absolutely incomprehensible, often,” she says. “The difference between when I was young and now; even when I was 80 and today, is a chasm. Take artificial intelligence…” A waitress is hovering. “Oh, flat white oat milk decaf, thank you.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d like to spend the last few years of my life being less anxious – that would be a gift’: Sheila Hancock wears bomber jacket byen.miharayasuhiro.jp; earrings byalighieri.com; shirt and jeans, both bymotherdenim.com.Photograph: Simon Emmett/The Observer“I’ve been having a terrible time these last few days,” she explains. “A friend is about to have a mega operation, so my heartbeat is already a little fast. Caffeine makes it worse. But it’s a good time for a coffee, being here with you.” Why? “When you get to my age, it should only be consumed where there’s a toilet nearby. Otherwise, disaster strikes. And the loos here are lovely.”We’ve only just been shown to a table at the Chiswick outpost of a private member’s club – her pick. Among the media-types and laptop-tappers, all decades her junior, Hancock is at home. Living nearby, she’s a regular, barely looking at the menu. “I’ll have the butternut squash soup and broccoli salad…” A glance my way. “They do a lunchtime deal, but do have a steak, if you like. Although I’d rather you didn’t, actually. I’m not a vegetarian, but I do think we should stop eating beef.” Soup for two, please.It’s early January when we meet, Hancock fresh from a Christmas with friends. After one festive evening she spent lamenting the state of the world, again, one companion had a word. “You’re being incredibly tedious,” she was told. “Which I was, certainly. He suggested I try looking for the small things in life that give you strength to go out and take on the big, ugly world and stop only moaning.”It got her thinking of friendships. “I’ve such a scope of relationships,” she’s realised, “which I take for granted. I live on my own and so many people are desperately lonely, but I have this whole network, different and fascinating.” It’s expansive. There are the Quakers she attends weekly meetings alongside; actors she’s shared the stage with. Hancock is close to her three daughters and eight grandchildren. She befriended a crow while self-isolating during Covid. A mouse, too. “I was chatting to the dustmen this morning, all with incredible hobbies. I’m so swamped by the awfulness of what’s going on in the world sometimes, I forget to take notice.”Hancock doesn’t often bother with resolutions. This year, however, she’s contemplating change. “I’m always desperately worried about being late,” she explains, “obsessive even. I’ll arrive so early that I sit for an hour in the car waiting, rather than risk being tardy or stuck in traffic.” She parked her car around the corner this morning. “It’s absurd. Everybody is late now; nobody is on time. Why am I the only person worrying?” Last week, she booked a cab to take her into town. It didn’t appear. “I called: ‘Where thehellare you?’ He’d missed my turning. ‘Look,’ I said, ‘I’ll come to you.’ I powered along the street, in the freezing cold. Things dropped from my bag. I locked myself out of the house in my rush. After all that, I arrived 10 minutes early! It’s madness.” Perpetual panic has long been a presence. “I’d like to spend the last few years of my life being less anxious, if I could. That would be a gift.” So she’s decided, “to sign up for an anti-anxiety course. You can get it on the National Health. It’s practical. None of this ‘Did you have an unhappy childhood?’ rubbish. More, ‘What are you going todoabout it?’”Hancock hasn’t, she hastens to add, been medically diagnosed. “It’s silly now, gotten out of hand,” she believes. “My anxiety is not an illness, just fear, for all sorts of reasons. I’m bored of normal emotions being categorised as sickness, honestly. Especially in children, put on pills. I find it disturbing.” She sees it firsthand while leading workshops in schools and prisons. “If a child is naughty they’re being diagnosed with all sorts immediately. Rather, they need a good talking to, or to belistenedto.”View image in fullscreen‘You’re incredibly lucky if you have one person in your life who is worth loving. I’ve had two’: Sheila Hancock receiving her OBE at Buckingham Palace in 1974, with husband John Thaw and daughter Melanie Ross.Photograph: PA ArchiveShe sees herself in the kids she encounters. “Oh, absolutely darling. I was off the scale mad. I was a wartime child and lived through the Blitz, evacuated aged eight to people who couldn’t handle me. I had a terrible twitch. I got bullied and I fought and joined a gang and shoplifted… You name it, I did it. We lived such unnatural, awful lives. We lived in fear. No wonder I’m anxious now. But I amnotill.”If she was a child today, she says, “I would have had everything thrown at me… I’d have been in an offenders institute, therefore in prison for the rest of my life. Once you’re there, you’re set on a path.” Some people, she concedes, require medical intervention. “But having been myself the sort of person who nowadays would be counted as troubled – very troubled – I know I wasn’t ill. I was reacting to the situations I was placed in. And look at what children are facing now: crisis after crisis; violence and war. Injustice and hatred is everywhere. Did you see what Musk said this morning?”When Hancock turns 92 later this month, given the choice, she won’t be doing much to mark the occasion. “My daughters will probably force something on me,” she suspects, her appreciation clear, if unspoken. “After my award thing,” (Hancock was made a Dame in 2021), “I was going to go home, but they’d organised a big do. I’ve never marked things very much. We didn’t do birthdays when I was a child. Evacuated. War. Mummy and Daddy working. I don’t remember any parties. Maybe a blancmange once…”Her 90th seemed significant. To others, if not Hancock herself. “Everyone started treating me like a very old person,” she says. “I noticed a change overnight. Suddenly, I was being helped up the stairs.” She feigns concern. “Oh, do you still drive? Do you live on your own? Careful you don’t fall, dear. Nobody had said it before.” She shrugs. “Just like that, it was everywhere.”She appears fighting fit – is it irritating, all the fussing? An eyebrow raise. “Curious, mostly. They do mean well…” Her tone is unconvincing. Alongside this presumed frailty, Hancock finds, comes another expectation: wisdom. She’s regularly turned to for sage insights and life advice. “Which is crazy,” she exclaims. What do I know? I change my mind constantly. No doubt I’ll say things today, read them back, baffled and think the total opposite.” Counsel she rarely offers up. An ear, however, is always available. “I’m very good at listening. That’s what the grandchildren come to me for. Nothing they tell me gets back to their parents.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ll say things today, read them back, baffled and think the total opposite’: Sheila Hancock wears shearling coat byconnollyengland.com; ring bypebblelondon.com.Photograph: Simon Emmett/The ObserverThis new secret-keeper role, she’s sure, has helped smooth what – at times – has felt a difficult generational transition. “The most important thing as you get older is learning to let go. You’re no longer in charge. When my daughter got really bad cancer, I had to take a back seat. Ideally, I’d have been phoning up all the best specialists, getting wigs…” But Hancock felt her place had shifted. “She has her husband, her children; the immediate family. I’m no longer there to make suggestions, but to support.”This change felt more pronounced after her second husband, actorJohn Thaw, died in 2002 after nearly 30 years of marriage. Her first husband, Alec Ross, also an actor, died in the early 1970s. She has a daughter from both marriages and a stepdaughter. “Both times I had an urge to wed,” she says. An urge? She smiles, conspiratorially. “Well, darling. I’m a working-class girl of the past. You didn’t have sex, you got married. And I’ve been very lucky,” she says of those relationships. “I think you’re incredibly lucky if you have one person in your life who is worth loving. I’ve had two. And they weresoworth loving. Only it’s different, ageing without that someone there.”Born in 1933 on the Isle of Wight, Hancock and her family soon moved to London and she spent her early years above a pub in Kings Cross that her parents ran, before the family settled south of the Thames, interrupted by wartime evacuation. Evidently bright, she landed a grammar school scholarship. “I wouldn’t have gone without one,” she says, “I started before the Education Act – and we couldn’t have afforded to pay.” The same was true for drama school. “I arrived at Rada,” she says, with a hammy eye roll. “It wasawful. Most of them just paid to be there: a finishing school. I turned up with my working-class London accent and they spent the whole time trying to get me to speak proper.” Her tutors succeeded. She graduated in 1952. “I came out a few years later speaking slightly more like them.”Talented and ambitious, Hancock set her sights high. “Quickly, I realised the working-class revolution hadn’t yet happened in the theatre: it was all beautiful, glamorous, posh, perfectly spoken people. I was thought of as a maid.” She auditioned for weighty parts: the West End; BBC television. Nothing.View image in fullscreenFunny business: with Peter Jones in the sitcom Mr Digby Darling, which ran from 1969 to 1971.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockRelatively recently, Hancock was told about a report from an early audition found in the BBC archives “In the notes, it said:‘Couldpass as educated.’ I got high praise for my acting, then it concluded: ‘Might be useful for juvenile character parts.’ Never did it occur to anyone that I could play leads; lovely parts played by lovely girls. I’ve never been seen that way. I was ordinary: blonde floozy; tits and arse.”Determined, she wrote to Beeb execs. “I pleaded for someone to see me. Eventually, I wrote: ‘I think you’re very rude, not replying to my letters.’” She looked elsewhere. “I did weekly rep and tatty tours for years. Still, the establishment institutions wouldn’t cast me.”“ThenJoan [Littlewood]happened.” The pioneering director revolutionised British theatre in the late 1950s, bringing working-class stories – and performers – to hallowed London stages. “It changed everything; suddenly all those posh people were out of fashion.” Hancock was rarely out of work thereafter.Over the decades that followed, she’s been a regular on stage, radio and the small screen. Films, occasionally. She won an Olivier Award; a Tony nomination for her Broadway debut. She starred inCabaret,GypsyandSister Act, Jacobean tragedy, Chekhov and Shakespeare. The credit list is sprawling. Her more recent turns in BBC crime dramaThe Sixth CommandmentalongsideTimothy Spalland ITV’sUnforgotten; were both remarkable.View image in fullscreen‘If someone reels off what I’ve done, it does surprise me’: with Timothy Spall in The Sixth Commandment, 2023.Photograph: Amanda Searle/BBC/Wild MercuryInstinctively unsentimental, she does, some times, reflect on her career. “To my mind,” she says, “I haven’t had a terrific range of parts. Although, if someone reels off what I’ve done, it does surprise me. Still, it’s a working actress’s career.” Not that of a traditional leading lady. It irks her. “Yes, I’d have liked to have played those roles; have opportunities others were afforded.” Early perceptions, she feels, were hard to shake. At points, that bothered her. “Now in my old age,” she says, “I am pleased to have made people laugh. My deep regret is not having played the classic roles. But there’s a bit of me that thinks,aha, on certain nights, audiences were crying with laughter at my performance. Maybe they were going through something in their lives and needed that joy, however fleeting. For me, that relief is the best an actor can offer.”Some of her contemporaries, she’s aware, bristle when labelled icons and legends; trailblazing pioneers. As if it’s synonymous with ancient. Hancock has no such problem. “I think it does fit for me,” she believes, “although I don’t often get it. I was the first woman to direct in all sorts of places.” The RSC touring company, in the Olivier at the National Theatre… There was her telly work, too. TakeThe Rag Trade: an early 1960s BBC sitcom set on a clothing- factory floor in which Hancock starred.“We had working-class women in leading roles,” she says, “with the whole country using our catchphrases. Yet it’s never mentioned. Because it was ‘light’ comedy. In fact, it showed and said something very important about women, under all the silliness: class, politics and gender.”‘The world moves on. So why be concerned about all that legacy lark?’Other work, she continues, has also been lost to time. “I did a show calledBut Seriously, It’s Sheila Hancock,” she says, “the result of a row I had with the BBC.” A Christmas party fight with a BBC boss led to her being offered an hour of telly time to do with what she felt fit.“I would interview someone and do sketches and poems to illustrate it. They wanted me to fail, but a whole series was commissioned. It was revolutionary. Nobody ever mentions it when they talk about women in comedy. But so be it. I’m not bitter.” She waves her spoon in my direction. “Seriously, who thefuckcares?”Two actresses were all the rage when Hancock was a child: Edith Evans and Peggy Ashcroft. I look at her, blankly. “See, you’ve not a clue. Why would you? The world moves on. So why be concerned about all that legacy lark?Hancock has noticed her own memories fade. The other night she couldn’t sleep, “Which happens a lot, so I was listening to this old play on Radio 4.” She heard the entire broadcast. “It wasn’t bad at all. At the end, the continuity announcer chimed in: that was whatever play, with Judith played by Sheila Hancock. I’d had no idea, through the whole bloody thing!” Of both rehearsal and recording, she has no recollection. “And yet, I think I had an accent in it. At the time, I’d have worked so hard… It’s not dementia or anything,” she assures me, “just I’ve done thousands of shows. There are millions of words in this scalp. My mind has said: ‘You’ve got to drop some of this.’ If I can’t even remember what I’ve done,” she asks, “how on earth can I expect anyone else to once I’m a goner?”View image in fullscreen‘They said ‘you look too young’. I’m fucking 92!’: Sheila Hancock wears trenchcoat by huishanzhang.com.Photograph: Simon Emmett/The ObserverJobs don’t come as thick and fast these days. Not because of any inkling towards retirement. “I miss the companionship,” she says, “of my fellow actors. Being part of a company. There aren’t many parts when you get to my age.” Productions struggle to secure insurance, she thinks, for actors in their 90s. And she understands her body’s limits. She was offered a role in a major touring musical six months back. “They would collect me in a car, hotel stays, eight shows a week… I had to decline, even just the London dates. I don’t want to waste all those days left of my life worrying about doing a performance and conserving my energy, even though I need the money.”Instead, she’d like small TV or film gigs. “A character that’s compact and complex who says something of significance.” She went up for one such film role recently; an ex-actor character. “So I made myself glam, got all dressed up.” The audition was a thumping success. “My agent phoned a few days later: ‘You’re not going to believe this. They said you look too young!’” She snorts. “‘I’mfucking92!’ I replied. ‘Please, what have I got to do?’ All my life it’s been something!”I pop to the bar and pay the bill. Returning to the table, I see my phone – laid in front of us to record – in Hancock’s hand, a look of bemusement plastered on her face. “Sorry, I thought it was mine – they look so similar.” I check our conversation hasn’t been deleted; she cracks a smile. “Not to worry, darling, you could just make it up anyway. I doubt I’ll recall any of the nonsense I’ve said.” And with that, Hancock winks, then shoots off to those lovely loos before I’ve had a chance to say goodbye.Dame Sheila Hancock is a regular columnist in Prospect Magazine.

Do what you don’t say. This philosophy of misdirection is one of the principles underlying this latest show from GandiniJuggling, a unique group that’s been plying its trade for more than 30 years. They juggle, yes, but not in the way you’d see at the circus. This is theatre, with a choreographer’s eye for the arrangement of bodies, balls and hoops, and every show is a deep dive into a new idea. In Heka, it is the art of magic. The seven-strong cast, already adept at manipulating juggling props, have learnt some impressive sleight of hand. Balls appear and disappear; they’re about to be tossed in the air then suddenly evaporate; they unexpectedly pop-up in someone’s mouth.Sean Gandini always approaches his subjects with love and a knowing raised eyebrow. This is not exactly a magic show, more like a show about magic shows. Gandini, the master of ceremonies, tells tall tales to the audience, playing with us and with magic’s malleable sense of reality and outright deceit, but we’re all in on it. We know that he knows that we know that there’s a wire magicking that hoop that hovers as if levitating in the air. The thing is, what we go to magic for are the bits we can’t work out, the moment it steals our breath in a sudden, delighted gasp. The discombobulation of: Wow! What? How did they?! And that’s not something we really get in this more gentle entertainment, amiable rather than awe-inspiring. Perhaps part of the point is to undo the spectacle, and get our eyes tuned in to the trickery, tracking the intricate and artful skills on show.View image in fullscreenA scene from Heka.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianActually, one of the moments that feels most magical is a simple illusion: when the troupe rhythmically toss red and white balls to the sky, the lighting turns each sphere into a streak in the air; we see a solid vertical line but in reality there’s nothing there. The Gandinis’ own art already has plenty of magic within it.Touring until 3 JuneExplore more on these topicsStageJugglingMagicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sophie Thatcher stars as Iris, the adoring but insecure girlfriend of smarmy Josh (Jack Quaid). She’s understandably nervous about a weekend break with Josh’s cliquey friends at the isolated luxury weekend retreat of Sergey (Rupert Friend), a shady Russian billionaire. As it turns out, though, making a good impression on the cool kids is the very least of Iris’s worries.Anyone who has seen the trailer will have already had a key plot point well and truly spoiled, but for the sake of those still in the dark, let’s just say that nobody, least of all Josh, expects Iris to survive the weekend. With its lavish, luxe backdrop and generous body count, the picture shares DNA (or at least circuitry) with Zoë Kravitz’sBlink Twice. It isn’t breaking new ground, but the feature debut from TV director Drew Hancock is pulpy, bloody fun.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Companion.Explore more on these topicsHorror filmsThe ObserverreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here he recalls his first encounters with activismSteve McQueenSun 2 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareMy first encounter with resistance was unbeknownst to me, and I was annoyed by it. At nine years old, I found myself attending Saturday school, missingFootball Focusand not being with my friends playing in the local park. First my sister and I went to the Marcus Garvey Saturday school in Hammersmith. Later we went to the Saturday school in Acton, organised by Mr Carter. He was a light-skinned Black man with slightly ginger hair and freckles, bearing a strange resemblance to Jimmy Carter, who was the president of the United States.The sole purpose of the Saturday school was to help Black children who were underachieving or being failed by the education system. At that time, I didn’t know that these facilities were organised throughout the United Kingdom by Black parents, teachers and academics. In 1971, a London schoolteacher, Bernard Coard, wrote a pamphlet calledHow the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System: The Scandal of the Black Child in Schools in Britain. Although there had been efforts to support Black children prior to this, this was the launching pad for a nationwide and organised act of self-determination.View image in fullscreenOutriders head the Africa Liberation Day rally, Rookery Road, Handsworth, June 1977.Photograph: Vanley BurkeGeorgie was an elderly white woman who taught painting and drawing at the Saturday school in Acton. She wore a blue artists’ smock and had short grey hair and glasses. I still remember her knobbly hands and how she held her pencil, drawing horses with fluid lines. I gravitated towards this, and she took a shine to me. I imitated her and fell in love with drawing. She was strict with her gravelly voice but encouraging. Mr Carter, being more academically minded, would put his head around the door to call me for maths lessons, which I hated.[As a] Black child … you are always alert … a part of your brain is constantly aware of the possibility of an attack, micro-aggressions or whateverMy sister and I were driven there every Saturday in a red Volvo estate by a white guy called Steve who had three daughters, one of whom was Black. There was solidarity and camaraderie, and people helped out wherever they could. This was my first understanding of community and group organisation. The thing about being a Black child and understanding that your environment is not equal is a strange one. You process it in a way that you are always alert, that a part of your brain is constantly aware of the possibility of an attack, micro-aggressions or whatever. You’re not really conscious of it; it’s just part of your makeup, like putting one foot in front of the other.View image in fullscreenA demonstrator is taken away by police as they try to stop fighting between anti-fascists and Oswald Mosley’s blackshirts during the battle of Cable Street in October 1936.Photograph: Associated Press/Eddie Worth/AlamyIt’s only now, looking back 45 years later, that I see certain situations in a more conscious light. By constantly campaigning and organising and demonstrating and resisting a system that failed their children, Black parents and teachers helped to eradicate subnormal schools, which undoubtedly I would have attended if this had not occurred. They liberated all children, Black and white, from being tainted with this ugly brush.My second introduction to resistance was from my neighbour, Milton, who would always post various newspaper cuttings in an envelope with my name on it through our door. These clippings included articles about the miners’ strike and Maurice Bishop, the prime minister of Grenada who had overthrown the previous government in a revolution in 1979. The first time I was introduced to Paul Robeson, the renowned Black American actor, singer and activist, was through a pamphlet from Milton about a memorial service in Wales. I looked at the cover with this Black man’s face and didn’t understand why he was celebrated there. Milton would often ambush me and engage me in conversation across the front garden fence, talking about politics and resistance.View image in fullscreenAnti-racists gather to block the route of a National Front march in New Cross Road, London, August 1977.Photograph: Paul TrevorMilton didn’t have children; he lived on his own. I feel part of his job in some ways was to enlighten me to the realities of our surroundings. I would often try to avoid him, knowing that one conversation could take up to an hour. He was an aeronautical engineer and eventually succumbed to asbestos poisoning due to his working environment. But he left his mark. He was the person who helped me ask the questions who?, how?, why? and what? I still have some of these cherished articles, kept in envelopes.My first demonstration was marching in central London against the introduction of student loans in 1988. I remember the exhilaration of being in the crowd and chantingEDUCATION IS A RIGHT, IS A RIGHT, IS A RIGHT,IS A RIGHT,EDUCATION IS A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE!I was fortunate enough to grow up at a time when education was free for everyone. I know I could not have gone to art school if I had had to pay to attend. My own resistance started with me loving myself. I had to start by seeing myself as brilliant because no one else did, and to have my ability match my ambitions. This might sound like a tall order, but the only direction for me was down. There were police to arrest me, judges to sentence me and prisons to hold me – that was my reality. My only way out at that time was my ability to draw, which flourished under Georgie’s guidance. It is where I felt myself. It’s where I felt challenged, and it’s where I thought I could strive. My resistance was my courage to dare and push my ability. Through art, my interest in history, geography and literature grew in my later teens in a way that they didn’t at school.View image in fullscreenDarcus Howe addressing anti-racist demonstrators in Lewisham, August 1977.Photograph: © Syd SheltonMy good fortune was that my family moved to the suburb of Ealing when I was six years old. There I was surrounded by green space to play and imagine. I remember long summer days with my friends in Lammas Park, lying on my back, smelling the fresh grass and looking at the sky.

As a major exhibition opens at Tate Modern, family and friends talk about Bowery’s larger-than-life legacySean O’HaganSun 2 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTShareIn October 1980, 19 year-oldLeigh Boweryarrived in London from the small Australian town of Sunshine in suburban Melbourne. He brought with him a single suitcase and a portable sewing machine. A few months later, he spent his first Christmas away from home in a rented bedsit feeling depressed and lonely. On 31 December, he attempted to raise his spirits by writing down his new year resolutions:1. Get weight down to 12 stone.2. Learn as much as possible.3. Become established in the world of art, fashion or literature.4. Wear makeup every day.He failed miserably to keep the first resolution despite completing several crash diets. “As soon as they were over, he would stuff his face with about 10 burgers, which undid his good work.” his close friend Sue Tilley recalls in her fly-on-the-wall, gossip-drenched book,Leigh Bowery: The Life and Times of an Icon.He set about the second fitfully and the fourth with often extravagant application, but it was the third that now seems most indicative of his bigger ambition, which was to become famous at all costs. He pursued it in spectacular fashion throughout the 1980s and into the early 90s – posing, performing, modelling, working as an art director on promo videos for bands including Massive Attack. During that time, he also collaborated with the dancerMichael Clark, formed a transgressive pop group, Minty, and became a nude model for the portrait painter Lucian Freud.Bowery’s greatest achievement, however, was to transform himself into a living, breathing work of art in a sustained process of continuous sartorial self-reinvention that lasted right up until his death in 1994 at the age of 33. Throughout, he created a succession of elaborate looks that included decorating his cherubic face with polka dots, dripping brightly coloured paint over his gleaming bald head, encasing his body in thick foam costumes that exaggerated his bigness, squeezing into tightly bound basques and covering his entire body, including his face, with dazzlingly patterned material. One of his creative collaborators, corset maker Mr Pearl, described the latter outfit, which was topped with a military style helmet, as “Shelley Winters if she belonged to the Gestapo”.View image in fullscreen‘He created a masterpiece – himself’: one of Bowery’s outlandish costumes.Photograph: © Fergus Greer. Courtesy The Michael Hoppen GalleryThe fame that Bowery sought in his lifetime was fleeting and cultish, not least because the extravagant alter ego he created was too strange and threatening to ever cross over in the manner of other contemporary gender-mischievous 80s celebrities such as Boy George or Marilyn. On the rare occasions that Bowery did manage to gatecrash the mainstream, usually on TV chatshows, his wilfully freakish presence shocked and appalled studio audiences in equal measure. Instead, the nightclub became his catwalk and gallery. “Before he called himself an artist, he already was one,” says his friend, the film-maker John Maybury. “He had an artist’s obsessive drive to create and constantly reinvent himself.” Another friend, Tony Marnoch, now more famously known on the global club scene as DJ Fat Tony, says: “He created a masterpiece – himself. It allowed him to cover up all his cracks and bruises.”Today, 30 years after his death, Bowery remains on the margins, but his influence is palpable everywhere, from the high camp melodrama ofRu Paul’s Drag Raceto the extravagant costumes worn by modern pop stars including Lady Gaga. Next month, though, Bowery himself will make headlines once again in a way that even he may have found surprising. At Tate Modern, an exhibition entitledLeigh Bowery!will celebrate his art, life and legacy in a series of themed rooms – the home, the club, the stage, the gallery – that will explore his myriad self-styled roles and singular presence.It is a belated recognition of his enduring influence on the increasingly porous worlds of art, pop and fashion, but also, as curator, Fiontán Moran, says, a moment to reappraise him as a serious artist. “Just having Leigh Bowery’s work inTate Modernrather than a fashion or design museum is a way of reimagining him. And, while fashion design is a major part of his legacy, the exhibition will look at his life as one never-ending performance that explored the body and all the things that can be done with it. That groundbreaking idea is central to everything he did, and everything he made.”In its size and elaborate adornment, Bowery’s body mirrored his ambition and his personality, loudly and unapologetically signalling his otherness, whether on the dancefloors of London’s gay clubs or on his regular, head-turning trips to his local supermarket. To encounter him unexpectedly, as I once did in the semi-deserted streets of early hours Soho, emerging out of a side alley on Brewer Street, was to be momentarily taken aback. He looked arrestingly strange, his size and manchild features, alongside his body-hugging costume, lending him an unsettling aspect that seemed to have more in common with the darkly unconscious imaginings of surrealism than the high-camp flamboyance of drag.Brix Smith was a guitarist in indie band the Fall when they collaborated with Bowery and Clark in the latter’s 1988 show,I Am Curious, Orange.She remembers being simultaneously intrigued, exhilarated and unsettled by Bowery’s brilliance and his edginess, comparing him to“the scary clown figure that everyone encounters as a child”.Fat Tony remembers witnessing him “becoming this ever more extravagant character who lived out his fantasies in a way that could not help being confrontational. He was brave. He had no fear.”View image in fullscreenPolaroid portrait of Leigh Bowery, 1986.Photograph: The Hartnett Archive/© Peter Paul Hartnett/Camera PressBowery’s constant urge to shock and confront had its beginnings in his childhood in Sunshine, where he was raised in a strict, conservative family in a suburban religious community. “When you grow up in that kind of environment, you have two choices: conform or react,” says his younger sister, Bronwyn, who now lives in Cardiff. “Leigh chose to react. Even as a boy, he was instinctively driven by a desire to challenge and shock the status quo, both at home, and in the wider community.”When he was 12, Bowery’s body played a strange trick on him. “He had a dramatic growth spurt and shot up to the height [6ft 3ins] that he remained for the rest of his life,” recalls Bronwyn. “He suddenly found himself able to tower over my father and all the teachers at school. This was around the same time that he decided he wanted to have a voice. His physicality definitely became a way of asserting that voice.”In Sunshine, having an assertive voice was not encouraged unless it conformed to strict rules of good behaviour and decorum. Bronwyn recalls witnessing several familial rows that were precipitated by her brother’s willingness to challenge their father’s disciplinarian outlook by “looming over him as they argued and arguing with him in such a rational and articulate way that it further provoked my dad’s rage”.Bowery’s acts of defiance became more confrontational as he discovered his sexuality in his early teens, not so much coming out as gay as realising and accepting it, seemingly without any attendant anxiety. “As a young gay man, he knew he was never going to be accepted,” says Bronwyn, “but he found the courage to challenge that in his own inimitable way.” At one point, he knitted himself a green woollen suit that, Bronwyn remembers, “was so itchy it was almost unbearable to wear”. But wear it he did, forcing his feet into a pair of tiny pointy shoes to complete a look that seems, with hindsight, a signal of what was to come. “It did not surprise me at all when he went to London and began transforming himself so dramatically,” she tells me.He became bored so he took all his clothes off and paraded naked up and down the aisle of the cinemaIntriguingly, too, Bowery seems to have discovered the power of public embarrassment at around the same time, using it initially as another weapon in his war against the constrictive conformity of family and community. He once lifted his mother up and, despite her protestations, placed her on the grocery conveyor belt at their local supermarket. Another time, he returned home from a friend’s house with his hair dyed bright orange. “That caused a total meltdown,” says Bronwyn. “My mother found out just before he was supposed to play the piano for all the local ladies at a Mother’s Day church service. She absolutely freaked out and must have washed his hair about 10 times to try to get rid of the colour.”Years later, in London, as his notoriety grew, Bowery used embarrassment as a weapon, both in his performances and, more casually, in his everyday life. In her wonderfully matter-of-fact way, Tilley recalls a visit to Birmingham with him in the 80s for an appearance on the daytime TV showPebble Mill at One. “We had time to kill so we drank a half bottle of vodka and went to see the pre-Raphaelites at the local gallery. Leigh immediately told the security guards that I wanted to give them blowjobs.” In her book she describes how he also loudly propositioned a passing nun on her behalf. “I was hiding behind a pillar with embarrassment, but also laughing,” she says, shaking her head as if still thrilled and appalled.View image in fullscreen‘His body played a strange trick on him’: Leigh Bowery in the bath, 1984.Photograph: © Bronwyn Bowery-IrelandLater when they went to a local cinema, the mayhem continued. “He became bored so he took all his clothes off and paraded naked up and down the aisle for the entertainment of the three other people in there. They just sat there quietly, ignoring him in that very English way. Afterwards, she adds cheerily, “he bought me a Cornetto. Then another one, and another one.” She pauses for a moment’s reflection. “Leigh had to be busy doing something all the time, either making stuff or making mischief. It’s almost as if he had too much personality for his body. That’s why he kept his friends separate and flitted between them. There was too much of him for one person to deal with.”In the early 1980s, as the edgy invention of punk and post-punk gave way to the posturing dandyism of the New Romantic movement, Bowery drew on both, using his body and the outrageous clothes he created as a way to shock and provoke. “We had all learned from punk,” says Maybury. “To a degree, the same sensibility was at play – have fun, annoy people, and maybe get your face on the front of a tabloid newspaper. Attention was Leigh’s currency and he used it to open doors and push boundaries.”As Maybury also points out, the London club scene of the time was relatively small by today’s standards. “Everything happened in and around Soho back then and it was all word-of-mouth – no mobile phones, no social media. Everyone involved was connected on some kind of psychic telegraph and that somehow made it even more exclusive and exciting.”Initially Bowery was a big presence in a small scene. That changed dramatically in 1985 when he foundedTaboo, the wildly dissolute nightclub he created in his own image. At first a place for his equally outre friends to dress up, hang out, dance and pose, it slowly gained a kind of hip notoriety as its reputation for excess spread. Soon, it became a mecca for the city’s most outrageous nocturnal revellers: drag queens, transvestites, gay and straight punters who dressed to outrage rather than impress and curious celebrities such as Bryan Ferry, George Michael and Mick Jagger. According to Tilley, straight people were reportedly turned away at the door by Bowery’s flamboyant accomplice, Mark Vaultier, who, “if he didn’t like the look of someone would hold a mirror up to their face and say, ‘Would you let yourself in?’”View image in fullscreenOne of Bowery’s many striking looks, from a series of pictures by Fergus Greer in 1991.Photograph: © Fergus Greer. Courtesy The Michael Hoppen Gallery.In the 80s street style biblei-D, journalist Alix Sharkey wrote of its curious allure: “These days Thursday nights in the West End usually means Taboo – London’s sleaziest, campest, bitchiest club of the moment which is stuffed with designers, stylists, models, students, dregs and the hopefully hip, lurching through the lasers and snarfing up amyl.” The defining atmosphere, he concluded, was characterised by “a narcissistic air of self-absorption”.Soon, though, things turned darker. The first ecstasy pills had just appeared on the UK club scene alongside other more established dancefloor stimulants amphetamine and amyl nitrate. At some point, as if to emphasis the self-absorbed nature of the scene, heroin, arguably the least clubbable drug imaginable, also became fashionable. In August 1986, Bowery’s best friend, former flatmate and creative collaborator, the waif-like Trojan (AKA Gary Barnes), became the first casualty, dying from an overdose. Bowery had fallen hopelessly for Trojan on first encountering him, but, despite his persistent overtures, his feelings were never reciprocated. Instead, Trojan had begun a relationship with Maybury. Devastated by his death, Maybury also overdosed on heroin a week later, but survived after being taken to hospital. He spent several weeks paralysed and emotionally at sea, before beginning a long recovery.“My friendship with Leigh was close initially,” Maybury tells me, “but it dissolved when I became Trojan’s boyfriend even though, to a degree, they remained what I called a ‘reluctant double act’ on the scene.”While recovering in hospital, Maybury saw another side of Bowery. “To my surprise, he visited me nearly every day and was incredibly supportive, caring and loving. Suddenly, there was a real human being there who really did care about other people.”In December of that year, Vaultier, another Taboo regular, was also found dead, in this case from an overdose of methadone, just a few days after being arrested on a charge of drug possession alongside Boy George, who went into hiding to escape the ensuing tabloid frenzy. It seemed like the darkness had descended on the pretty young things of 80s London.View image in fullscreenOne of Leigh Bowery’s eye-catching costumes.Photograph: Joe Humphrys/Tate Photography (Seraphina Neville). Courtesy Leigh Bowery Estate.“The darkness was heroin,” says Maybury, “I was vehemently anti-smack in the beginning, but Trojan made it seem glamorous and I fell into it. At that age, you think you’re going to live for ever, but I was so incredibly lucky to survive.”With hindsight, Maybury sees heroin as a symptom of those darkening times. “The Aids pandemic was beginning – the forgotten pandemic – and with it this sense of dread and the fear. We were entering a period of what seemed like constant funerals. I think there was a sense among some on the scene of, ‘Fuck it, let’s party!’ A kind of crazy defiance in the face of the coming storm.”Throughout the 80s, Bowery had stayed clear of hard drugs, but, as Tilley’s book attests, had a sexually promiscuous lifestyle that tended towards casual encounters with often straight men that he picked up at his regular “cottaging” haunts around London. “Everyone was sleeping with their friends back then,” says Tilley. “We were right slappers, but oddly Leigh didn’t get off with people when he went clubbing. Instead, he had to go out to lavatories and find people to have sex with. Then, he’d come back and tell us all about it. How he managed to get anything done, I don’t know.”At Taboo, Bowery also encountered the woman who was to become his most unlikely – and arguably most important – collaborator and soulmate. Her name was Nicola Bateman (now Nicola Rainbird), a quiet but flamboyantly dressed young woman who studied textiles at Middlesex Polytechnic and who, it turned out, had an aberrant creative urge that matched his own.“We got on very well from the very start,” she tells me over the phone from the seaside town of Eastbourne, where she now lives with her three children. “Because we had a deep art connection. For us, making pure art was the most important thing of all.”Their subsequent performances, though, stretched the definitions of the words pure and art in their shared determination to shock and disturb – some involved vomit and urine. In another, which features in Charles Atlas’s filmThe Legend of Leigh Bowery, he falls on his back on stage to “give birth” to Rainbird, who emerges from his Velcro-ed nether regions, covered in slimy red liquid and trailing a string of sausages. She looks dazed and disoriented, which adds to the unsettling absurdism.View image in fullscreenBowery with Nicola Rainbird (then Bateman) in 1988.Photograph: Altostratus Photography Limited/© Dave Swindells“I had to be a baby, attached upside down to his body underneath this quite complicated garment,” she says. “At one point, I did have a panic attack, laughing uncontrollably then crying uncontrollably from being tipped up and down too much and the lack of oxygen to my brain. It did make me wary, but I concentrated on my breathing from there on.”Initially, Rainbird had simply collaborated on his costumes, sewing sequins long into the night. Their closeness bemused his inner circle. “People on the scene didn’t like our relationship,” she says. “I wasn’t a bloke and that caused a bit of jealousy, but luckily I was naive so a lot of the insults went over my head. I also think a lot of them mistook my niceness for weakness.”Their relationship, though, had a power dynamic that seems, to say the least, imbalanced. “He would sometimes pick on me at first in front of his friends for a laugh,” she recalls. “It didn’t make me look very good, but he had such a way with words that it was always amusing somehow. We’d have arguments afterwards and he’d be contrite, but then he’d do it again.”The first sitting at Freud’s studio radically changed Bowery’s life, lending him credibility in the art worldIn her book, Tilley writes: “A lot of the time, Leigh was really horrible to Nicola,” describing how, following a heated row, he would sometimes “pick her up and lock her on the balcony of his flat for a couple of hours”. Her anger would invariably turn to laughter, at which point he would relent and open the door. “I really think he wanted to test me,” says Rainbird, “to see how far I was prepared to go with him. Later it all slowed down.” Today, she remembers their time together fondly and without regrets: “I realise now how lucky I was to be with him and be so creative in that scene.”On Friday 13 May 1994, the pair were married, further surprising everyone in Bowery’s several circles of friends. He described it to her as “a little private art performance between ourselves”. It lasted seven months until his death from Aids-related illnesses on New Year’s Eve. “I cried for a day and a night when he told me he was HIV-positive,” says Rainbird, “but I was glad for him in the end that his death was quick. He had tuberculosis and pneumonia.” She pauses. “I think he was annoyed more than anything, because he still had so much he wanted to do. Death was an inconvenience.”Bowery had managed to keep his illness secret from everyone but Tilley and Rainbird. His sister, Bronwyn, had received a late-night call from him a few months before a planned trip to London, in which he told her he was not feeling well. “After the call,” she says, “I ran to the toilet and vomited. I knew it was bad news.”Both she and her father had travelled to Britain to visit him, but were away seeing relatives when Bowery died. They returned for a gathering of his friends in his flat and went to Taboo afterwards, but no one’s heart was really in it. Bowery was buried weeks later, next to his mother’s grave, beside the family’s holiday house near Melbourne. “I read some poems and we drank champagne,” says Bronwyn. “Then, when it was time to drop the coffin into the ground, the grave wasn’t big enough so my cousins had to go and find some shovels.” Even in death, then, Bowery was larger than life.View image in fullscreenLucian Freud’s painting Nude with Leg Up (Leigh Bowery) 1992.Photograph: Bridgeman ImagesAt Tate Modern, Bowery will be remembered for many things, including the groundbreaking pop-cultural event when he “danced” with Clark’s ensemble at Sadler’s Wells to live music by the Fall, and the moment he entered the art world through his installation at the Anthony d’Offay gallery in 1988, posing daily in a different costume on a chaise longue behind a one-way mirror. More resonant still are the extraordinary series of portraits of him byLucian Freudin the early 1990s which have enshrined his body, for once utterly unadorned and in almost meditative repose, for posterity. In their oil-smeared detail, they capture Bowery’s fleshy corpulence and looming presence, but with a grace and honesty that seems more uncharacteristically poignant as the years pass.Tilley noted that the first sitting at Freud’s studio radically changed Bowery’s life, lending him credibility in the art world and allowing him “to learn an enormous amount”. The artist’s daughter, fashion designer Bella Freud, also witnessed their intriguing interaction on her visits to the studio. “I sensed he was deeply absorbing what my father said in their conversations because he was often so quiet and listening intently. But he also brought stuff to the table that my dad found fascinating. They were both outsiders – and artists – in their different ways and, as such, complementary to each other.”Freud remembers her father’s voice breaking on the phone after he learned of Bowery’s death. “There were tears, which was very unusual for my father, who tended to hold back his emotions. He really loved Leigh and was devastated when he died.”Whatever new – and possibly more restrained – creative paths Bowery may have pursued had he lived longer is anyone’s guess. What remains are the remnants of his singular life. His legend, reimagined and repositioned, will hover over the Tate Modern exhibition, not least because one crucial element will be missing: Bowery himself in all his attention-seeking, jaw-dropping, over-the-top otherness. “I miss him,” says Maybury, speaking for many of his contemporaries. “Every time he showed up, he was like a kinetic beacon, vibrating.”Leigh Bowery!is at Tate Modern from 27 February to 31 August.

This book gives us only the first part of the story, tracing Gates’s evolution from birth in 1955 to the founding ofMicrosoftin 1975. For the next part of the story, we will just have to wait for the sequel.In a way, the volume’s title describes it well. In the era before machine learning and AI, when computer programs were exclusively written by humans, the term “source code” meant something. It described computer programs that could be read – and understood, if you knew the programming language – enabling you to explain why the machine did what it did.So what can we learn from inspecting Gates’s code? Broadly speaking, the message is that he was a very lucky lad. He was born in the right place at the right time to parents who gave him, he writes, “the precise blend of support and pressure I needed: they gave me room to grow emotionally, and they created opportunities for me to develop my social skills”. His account suggests, though, that it was an uphill battle at times. Bill Snr and Mary Gates discovered that they had a boy who was a strange blend of high IQ, arrogance, rebelliousness and insecurity.“If I were growing up today,” he writes, “I probably would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum. My parents had no guideposts or textbooks to help them grasp why their son became so obsessed with certain projects, missed social cues, and could be rude or inappropriate without seeming to notice his effect on others.”He was lucky. The Gateses were moderately affluent (his father was a prominent lawyer in Seattle) and they sent him to a remarkable private school – Lakeside – that was relaxed, liberal, supportive and tolerant. Which was good for a boy who was small for his age, with a reedy voice.Young Bill rebelled... there were lots of fights and arguments. In the end, his parents sent him to a therapistMore significantly, perhaps, some of the parents had raised enough money to buy a Teletype terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric time-shared computer for pupils’ use. This was extraordinary in the 1960s; it meant that Gates and some of his friends were writing software in their teens. He and a few others (includingPaul Allen, with whom he later co-founded Microsoft) even started writing software for companies in the Seattle area. And when the school eventually went coeducational, Gates and his mates wrote the software for scheduling classes and activities in the expanded institution.From Lakeside he went to Harvard in 1973, determined to sample everything that vast institution offered, while relying on his remarkable ability to cram ferociously before tedious assignments like exams. He inveigled his way into the university’s Aiken lab, which had just taken possession of an early minicomputer, aDEC PDP-10. But two years into this idyll, Allen turned up one day with the news that MITS, a two-bit firm in New Mexico, had just launched a microcomputer based on Intel’s 8080 processor chip.This freaked them both out, because they had been pondering how to get into what they knew was going to be a huge industry and now this outfit in Albuquerque had scooped them with a crummy little machine. But the new device did not have any application software. So they set about writing – on the Harvard computer – an interpreter for the Basic programming language, using an ingenious software emulation of the MITS machine that Allen had written. This remarkable project was successful, but the university discovered that none of it had been authorised, and Gates was disciplined – much as Mark Zuckerberg was, many years later, for another illicit use of Harvard resources.At this point, Gates dropped out and went, with Allen, to New Mexico, where they co-founded what was originally called Micro-Soft, and embarked on the path that led to great riches and industrial power. But that story has to wait for another volume, which will have to record how a powerful corporation became, for a long time, an institutional extension of its co-founder’s personality. And ran into antitrust litigation as a result.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was clearly a difficult child to manage, especially as his mother had very clear ideas about how life should be organised. From an early age, young Bill rebelled against her rigorous regime. There were lots of fights and arguments. In the end, his parents sent him to a therapist, who turned out to be sympathetic and wise.The biggest tragedy in his early life was the sudden death of his best friend (and fellow programmer), Kent Evans, in a mountaineering accident. “Kent’s dad greeted us and shook our hands,” he writes about going back to the family home after the funeral. “Kent’s mom was curled up on the sofa, sobbing. It was at that moment I understood that for all my grief, it would never run as deep as hers. He was my best friend, but he was her baby. At some level I knew that she and Mr Evans would be forever marooned in this loss. The stricken expressions on the faces of Kent’s kind, gentle parents that day have never left me.”In a nice coda, he describes running into Evans’s father many years later, and they have a long conversation about what might have been. Both believe that if Evans had lived he would have been the third co-founder of Microsoft. Now, there’s a thought.Source Code: My Beginningsby Bill Gates is published by Allen Lane (£25).

It has been referred to as Racists Across the World andcriticised by Amnesty Internationaland some charities.However, one of the producers, Liam Humphreys of Minnow Films, said: “It’s really important to engage with people who have different opinions [and ask] why do they think like that?”In the first episode, a contributor called Dave suggests putting landmines off Dover beaches to stop small boats: “It’s like rats, you leave food out they’ll keep coming.”The joint executive producer, Emma Young, acknowledged there had been a lot of comments about platforming racists with extreme views. “But these voices that you hear within the series are the voices we were hearing up and down the country as we were casting and they are a vocal voice that is shaping our political landscape,” she said.“People might find it uncomfortable to hear the things they hear but you … have to understand why they feel like that. I did not want it to be preachy at all.”Humphreys said the show is about empathy and “understanding other people’s points of view; not saying you have to agree with them but … take the debate off Twitter … and try to have a discussion where you can understand someone’s point of view”.Channel 4’s head of documentaries and factual entertainment, Alisa Pomeroy, said that “difficult opinions [are] expressed in the series that will make uncomfortable viewing for some”.But, she added, it was important that the series unflinchingly and accurately represented the range of strong views on immigration in the UK. In order to “be able to challenge – and wrestle with – these views, we need to be able to air them,” she said. “Otherwise, we simply drive them online, where they metastasise and we end up with combustible events like last summer’s race riots.”The series isbased on an Australian formatand Pomeroy said it was worth noting that none of the charities criticising the show had seen the programme. There was a similar level of outcry about the show in Australia pre-transmission, she said, but it went on to win awards and become part of the school curriculum.The series gives what Humphreys called “information by stealth” because it is “entertaining, but you’re also dealing with complex issues”. It includes potted histories of regional conflicts and first-hand accounts from refugees as the contributors trek across mountainous border crossings, through the African desert and experience small boat crossings.Pomeroy said Channel 4 had never done a show with such risk and ambitionwhich involved immersing ordinary people in hugely dangerous places. Minnow had seven safety assessors, two psychologists monitoring participants, security and legal teams and the heads of Channel 4 signing off risk assessments nightly during filming.Shifting geopolitics changed plans last-minute and, Pomeroy said, they wouldn’t have been able to make the series a few weeks later as some countries became too dangerous.The participants were dramatically pulled from a market by security after kidnapping fears and the Tunisian government revoked permission at the last minute to film the contributors making a boat crossing.“Within the constraints of health and safety and hostile filming protocols, we had to provide the most authentic experience for them,” said Humphreys, so the participants were not told the crossing was choreographed. Producers cut the engine on the boat halfway across and hired a local Lebanese coastguard to rescue them.The participants were terrified, thinking they were about to be arrested. When they discovered the truth they were initially angry but then understood it needed to be as immersive as possible so they could empathise fully.All of them had seen the show and were happy with their portrayal, Minnow said.Young said they had all “gone on a journey … to varying degrees” and “minds have been changed, or at least educated”.Humphreys added it had affected them all and had a lasting impact on how they viewed the world.Go Backto Where You Came From begins on Channel 4 on Monday 3 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevisionChannel 4Television industryImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Rushdie later lost sight in one eye and sustained nerve and liver damage.The trial, which starts on Tuesday with jury selection, was postponed from January 2023, when Matar’s defense team requested the manuscript of Rushdie’s memoir Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder, and again in October, after Matar’s defense appealed for a change of venue, arguing that an impartial jury of Matar’s peers could not be found in Chautauqua county.The author has credited a series of “man-made miracles” for surviving the attack.“There was a slash right the way across my neck here, but it didn’t seem to cut the artery … there’s three stab wounds down the centre of my torso, but they missed the heart,” he told CBC Radio’sThe Current. “That’s what we call good luck.”After refusing a plea deal for a 20-year sentence, Matar also faces federal terrorism-related charges, including providing “material support and resources” to the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah.Prosecutors in the federal case argue that Matar’s attack was not random but motivated by the fatwa, or death threat, issued by Iran’s leadership against Rushdie over the author’s 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, which many Muslims considered to be blasphemous.Rushdie spent years in hiding afterthe fatwawas issued in 1989, but began to reemerge in the late 1990s. He has traveled mostly freely over the past two decades and become a fairly frequent fixture on the literary circuit and television shows.Matar, who was born in the US but holds dual citizenship with Lebanon, has pleaded not guilty to both charges, and has been held without bail at the Chautauqua county jail. His mother has indicated he was radicalized during a trip to see his father in Lebanon in 2018.Rushdie, 77, and Henry Reese, who co-foundedPittsburgh’s City of Asylumto grant sanctuary to writers exiled under threat of persecution, and whom Rushdie has credited for helping to save his life, are expected to testify.But prosecutors in Matar’s trial have said jurors likely will not hear about the fatwa. “We’re not going there,” district attorney Jason Schmidt said during a recent hearing.View image in fullscreenHadi Matar is escorted into the courtroom for a hearing in Chautauqua county.Photograph: Carolyn Thompson/APSchmidt said presenting a motive was unnecessary since the attack was witnessed and recorded on cellphones by members of the audience.Schmidt previously told reporters that his “biggest hurdle” would be picking a fair and impartial jury due to the level of publicity surrounding the incident. Matar’s lawyer, Nathan Barone, told the court he fears the current global unrest would influence their feelings toward his client.“We’re concerned there may be prejudicial feelings in the community,” said Barone, who also has sought a change of venue for the trial. With tensions around religious-motivated violence running high, the judge in the case has ordered both parties to avoid statements to the media.In an interview with the Rochester Post-Journal,Barone said he has concerns about “inherent and implicit bias” toward Arab Americans and the Muslim or Arab American community in Chautauqua county.“There’s a segment of the population that looks at them or hears about them and they form a stereotype,” Barone said, adding that he would have liked to see the trial moved to one of the boroughs of New York City or Erie county, where there is a bigger Arab American population.After he was arrested, Matar gave an interview to the New York Post in which he described taking a bus to Buffalo from his home in Fairlawn, New Jersey, and a Lyft to Chautauqua, 40 miles away. He then purchased a ticket to the festival and slept outside the night before Rushdie’s talk.“I don’t like the person. I don’t think he’s a very good person,” Matar told the newspaper. “He’s someone who attacked Islam. He attacked their beliefs, the belief systems.” Matar also praised the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini as “a great person” but would not say whether he was following Khomeini’s fatwa.Nasser Kanaani, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, said Tehran was not involved. “We don’t consider anyone deserving reproach, blame or even condemnation, except for [Rushdie] himself and his supporters. In this regard, no one can blame the Islamic Republic of Iran.”Kanaani added: “We believe that the insults made and the support he received was an insult against followers of all religions.”Ron Kuby, who represented Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind cleric who headed the Egyptian-based militant group al-Gama’a al-Islamiyya, said it was no surprise Matar refused to take a deal with prosecutors.“I suspect he thought he was going to be killed in the course of this attack so his expectations were low. He was fortunate enough to survive it so he’s probably going to continue the fight inside the courtroom and in prison,” he said.Kuby said he wondered if Matar would opt for a traditional defense by trying to create reasonable doubt and challenge eyewitness accounts or instead talk about his motives behind the attack.“Is he or his lawyer going to put on a more ideological or religiously inspired defense and talk about the religious values that motivated him to try to kill Rushdie, The Satanic Verses, and try to put on a political defense?” Kuby said.In Knife, Rushdie himself described the attack vividly, writing, “Death was coming at me … it struck me as anachronistic”, and described his alleged assailant as “a sort of time traveler, a murderous ghost from the past”.The courtroom collision of Rushdie and his alleged attacker is likely to be fascinating, especially if Matar tries to turn the trial into a justification of attacking the writer for the offense his work caused.“Matar allegedly tried do it on that stage that day, and may continue to do it in the courtroom even though it’s going to result in his conviction,” said Kuby. “Sometimes people prefer to get a conviction than to give up their conviction.”Explore more on these topicsSalman RushdieNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s howRob Autondescribes his life’s work – half- (or less) jokingly – in his new hour The Eyes Open and Shut Show. So whatishe doing? At points tonight, the Yorkshireman self-identifies as a comedian, and as a poet. You might throw in philosopher too, or indeed aphorist – with reference to the pithy principles Auton hews from his inquiry into life and how to live it, and which, fashioned into homespun artworks, he touts as merch at the end of the show.If that sounds like a commercial instinct at play – well, I think the 42-year-old can be forgiven a rearguard effort to make his eccentric brand of performance pay. Tonight’s set takes as its soft focus the subject of eyes. What’s the difference between whale-watching and whale-seeing? If we sneezed with our eyes open, would they pop out of our head? And “can you imagine if you loved blinking?” Auton worries away at these half-banal, half-profound inquiries, sends up his own kooky interest in them, and gets meta on the jokes he constructs thereof. The upshot is a meandering monologue piloted by Auton’s curiosity about graveyards, the teachings of Eckhart Tolle, or the key to Mick Jagger’s success.It may be stronger on sideways observation and wonderment (“I’m always trying to bring my life to life”), but it’s not without laughs: I relished his account of how acquiring a telescope gave him the confidence to talk to bus drivers. And there are satisfying callbacks and circularities that give Auton’s ruminations a semblance of structure. At points, you might find the material too (faux?) naive for its own good, or that Auton’s sentimentality isn’t quite sufficient as a substitute for big laughs. But the show reeled me in, with the freshness of our host’s way of seeing and being. Then won me over in its heartfelt final moments, which comprise a hymn to the preciousness of life, for all that it’s never quite as good as you want it to be.Rob Auton is at the Glee Club, Birmingham, on Wednesday, then touring.Explore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

That said, the wildly uneven wedding clash comedyYou’re Cordially Invitedis certainly in the vicinity of terrible on numerous occasions. Ferrell plays Jim, the smothering, widowed dad of Jenni (Geraldine Viswanathan); Witherspoon is Margot, the overprotective older sister of Neve, played by Meredith Hagner. When, due to an administrative snafu, Jenni’s and Neve’s weddings are double booked at the same venue, Jim and Margot are determined that their loved ones will still get their day to remember, no matter the cost to the rival party or to personal dignity. Wedding catastrophe cliches abound (cakes, hair and frocks take the brunt of the physical comedy).

But Naoko Yamada’s charming animeThe Colours Withinis certainly the most beguiling. The film views the world through the eyes of adorable space cadet Totsuko (Sayu Suzukawa), a student at a Catholic boarding school run by serene, sympathetic nuns. Totsuko feels colours: people have distinct “auras”; music is a shimmering pyrotechnic display. One of her fellow students, Kimi (Akari Takaishi), has such a beautiful and distracting aura that Totsuko zones out during a dodgeball game and gets flattened by a ball to the head.From this inauspicious beginning, Totsuko and Kimi build a friendship, and together with quirky loner Rui (Taisei Kido) they start a rock band. And that’s pretty much it, in a story that teeters on the edge of tweeness. Yet with its wide-eyed lack of cynicism and the crystalline delicacy of the animation, this is a heart-swellingly lovely work.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for The Colours Within.Explore more on these topicsAnimeThe ObserverreviewsShareReuse this content"

Consistently provocative and self-dramatising, Shirin makes a kind of performance art out of her snowballing midlife crisis, but hers is just one of five contrasting perspectives from which this matrilineal saga is told.The Persiansspans three generations of the Valiat family – wealthy, well-connected Iranians who have largely been living in the US since the Islamic revolution. Thanks to Shirin’s late sister, Seema, her niece, Bita, and the two Valiat women who remained in Tehran – her mother, Elizabeth, and Niaz, the daughter Shirin left behind – the book contains a multitude of moods and dramas. Twentysomething Bita, for instance, is quitting law school in New York in search of a life that feels more authentic. In Tehran, Niaz has been risking her freedom, looking for meaning in the city’s underground rave scene. Even Seema, a spectral presence, has much to say as she contemplates her unfulfilled journalistic ambitions.‘We didn’t come here for a better life. We left a better life,’ says Bita, in a punchy snub to the US immigrant storyWhile their voices provide ballast to the chaos that Shirin trails in her wake, none can compete with her for intensity and verve, except for snobby matriarch Elizabeth, whose journey over the course of the novel will prove the most radical, hinging on a secret passion that daringly crossed class lines and retains its power to astound decades later (one of Mahloudji’s most memorable descriptions conjures empowered, octogenarian seduction, creaky knees and all).Threading these stories together is the notion that each woman has in turn been failed by her mother. They are also burdened by their very name, marking them out as descendants of the fictional Babak Ali Khan Valiat, a predictably flawed hero known as the Great Warrior, whose money still largely defines them.View image in fullscreenSanam Mahloudji: combines ‘outrageous laughter’ with tenderness.Really, though, it’s the revolution that is to blame for their profound and, it must be said, highly entertaining dislocation. It rendered them all exiles – not least those who chose to stay. In a punchy snub to the conventions of the American immigrant story, Bita, chatting to her therapist, quotes her auntie Shirin: “We didn’t come here for a better life. We left a better life”. A life no longer possible in a homeland that has become unrecognisable.What keeps this expansive group narrative broadly on track is the ticking clock of Shirin’s court date back in Aspen. She is unrepentant but, social scandal aside, the chance that she might be deported back to Iran adds peril.The Persiansis a novel full of outrageous laughter, retaining its fire even in tender moments, and relishing the challenge of locating beauty and complexity within outright gaudiness. If it falls short, it is in its depiction of contemporary Iran, which lacks the solidity of Mahloudji’s evocation of the pre-revolutionary country. (Mahloudji herself was born in Tehran, but left when the Shah fell.) However, this is, perhaps, a life-affirming reminder that the imperfect place the Valiats yearn for, with its fragrant courtyards where poetry (some of it written by women) and wine once flowed, endured far longer than the Islamic Republic yet has.The Persiansby Sanam Mahloudji is published by 4th Estate (£16.99).To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

He doesn’t effuse; rather he growls, a bristly, whiskery warning to the world to keep its distance. Listening to him, you could be forgiven for assuming that, with a career spanning more than half a century, seven Oscar nominations, a Cannes Palme d’Or (forSecrets& Lies) and aVenice Golden Lion(forVera Drake), Leigh is not much of a fan of anything to do with the film industry. But then you watch one of his films – his latest,Hard Truths, for example – and it becomes clear that there is one passion that remains undimmed over the years, one thing that he cherishes above all others. And that is actors and their craft.The British director has a distinctive way of working that amplifies and embraces the contribution of his cast. This is not just a case of handing an actor a few inert lines on page and hoping for the best. His films are born out of an extended process of workshopping and rehearsals. Dialogue is chewed over; characters are fully lived in; stories are grown out of the fertile collaboration between director and performers. It’s a way of working that has pros and cons for the final film, but what’s undeniable is that Leigh’s method has helped give birth to some viscerally powerful performances over the years, the latest of which is a quite remarkable Bafta-nominated, British independent film awards-winning turn fromMarianne Jean-Baptistein the central role of housewife Pansy.Pansy is the most relentlessly abrasive character in a Mike Leigh film since David Thewlis’s rampaging hate machine in NakedShe’s a hard person to like. Obsessively house-proud, agoraphobic, hypochondriac, repulsed by animals and plants, she greets the world with a scalding torrent of anger and bitter grievances. Her palpable displeasure spreads like an ink spill, spoiling the space around her and tainting all her interactions. Something as banal as a trip to the supermarket or a checkup with her dentist is akin to entering a hall of magnifying mirrors, all of which reflect back her fury and aggression. Pansy is the most relentlessly abrasive character in a Mike Leigh film sinceDavid Thewlis’s rampaging Mancunian hate machine in 1993’sNaked. But unlike Thewlis’s Johnny, who attacks from a place of perceived superiority, Pansy lashes out largely from terror. What Jean-Baptiste’s painfully raw performance makes clear is the dual role of fear in the character’s life. Fear is a cage, with Pansy snarling from behind its bars. But in some ways, her fear is also the most comforting certainty in her emotionally impoverished life: something to hide behind; an excuse to barricade herself away from the world.View image in fullscreen‘Tough watch’: David Webber, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Tuwaine Barrett play a deeply unhappy family in Hard Truths.Photograph: Simon Mein/APAll of which is tough on Pansy’s family. Her stoic husband, Curtley (David Webber), has been browbeaten into silence rather than risk saying the wrong thing. Her unemployed adult son, Moses (Tuwaine Barrett), clearly on the autistic spectrum, shuts out his mother’s hectoring judgments with his headphones. And her big-hearted sister, Chantelle (a lovely, tender turn fromMichele Austin, in her fifth collaboration with Leigh), sees the pain that Pansy endures, but can’t see a way of helping her out of it. The contrast between the lives of the two sisters couldn’t be more stark: single mum Chantelle, who owns a thriving hairdressing business, has a home full of laughter, mess and the love of her two daughters. Pansy’s house is pristine and spartan, with none of the informal clutter that suggests shared joys and family memories.Mike Leigh and Marianne Jean-Baptiste on rage, sex and insults: ‘There’s an intolerance in society now’Read moreLeigh’s unshowy, restrained direction deliberately refuses to assert itself, keeping the focus on the actors at all times. And make no mistake, these performances are certainly worth the weight of attention that is placed upon them. But great turns don’t always amount to a great picture, and the unfortunate consequence of this no-frills directing approach is that the film-making can feel rather flat and functional – a display cabinet for the acting rather than a vital piece of storytelling. The episodic structure ofHard Truthsdoesn’t help, with Pansy lurching from confrontation to confrontation, but floundering rather than moving forward in the story. Ultimately, it’s a tough watch, not just for the psychological suffering on show, but because the audience is denied any kind of resolution or closure. Going in, we assume that we will accompany a character on a journey, but instead we find ourselves marooned in the bleak cul-de-sac of Pansy’s misery.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Hard Truths.Explore more on these topicsFilmWendy Ide's film of the weekMike LeighMarianne Jean-BaptisteDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Possessed of a mighty voice and virtuosic piano skills, her repertoire spans jazz standards to civil rights anthems, sweeping orchestrations and storytelling balladry. Yet, to do Simone justice, it isn’t simply a case of performing vocal acrobatics and keyboard technique. The task instead is to channel the raw vulnerability and emotional honesty that made her presence so captivating – to find the spirit that led Warren Ellis tokeep a piece of her onstage chewing gumfor 20 years following her final London performance in 1999.Tonight’s celebration of Simone’s music takes place on the same stage as that show and features five vocalists. The repertoire is extensive, covering standards such as George Gershwin’s I Loves You, Porgy, featured on Simone’s 1959 debut, to the 1967 civil rights song I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free, the late ‘70s reggae of Baltimore and cinematic melodrama of I Put a Spell on You.Peter Edwards’s Nu Civilisation Orchestra is masterfully deft in its backing, veering from Gershwin’s luscious strings to a thundering rhythm section on African Mailman and enveloping horn fanfares on I’m Feeling Good. Yet, this is a show for singers. Each admirably presents their own interpretation of the material rather than a pastiche, with somewhat mixed results. Early on, China Moses’s See-Line Woman is partly swallowed by the orchestra’s funky backing and Tony Njoku’s falsetto on I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free strains over the triumphal music. As the show continues, though, the singers hit their stride. Newcomer Ni Maxine beautifully conveys the yearning emotion of I Loves You, Porgy and Moses delivers a confrontingly powerful finale to the storytelling Four Women, but it is Corinne Bailey Rae and Laura Mvula who steal the show.Rae embodies the innate theatricality of Simone’s music by vamping over the orchestral stabs of I Put a Spell on You and finding a softer register for the coy intimacy of My Baby Just Cares for Me, while Mvula feels Simone’s pain in a standout solo performance of Stars where her voice cracks and whispers as she sings the sombre tale of fading fame. It is a fitting tribute to Simone, a star whose spirited music can still hold a room of thousands captive.Mississippi Goddamn is part of theSouthbank Centre x Montreux Jazz Festival ResidencyExplore more on these topicsMusicNina SimoneJazzSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It starts in 1830, years after the famed novelist’s death, when a family drama compels Cassandra to go in search of the private letters. When she finds them, we are treated to flashbacks of the siblings’ strong bond as they navigate their coming-of-age years. But by the end of the first episode, a shock discovery leads to a juicier story as it takes her on a personal mission. Synnøve Karlsen and Patsy Ferran play young Cassy and Jane, with Rose Leslie and Jessica Hynes completing a perfect cast.Hollie RichardsonBoyzone: No Matter What9pm, Sky Documentaries“Sadness and disenchantment” is how Mikey Graham describes being in Boyzone.

In this regard, The Straight Story serves as a career outlier. However, despite lacking all his trademark dread and disquiet, it deserves to go down as one of his very best. Based on the true story of Alvin Straight, a man who, in 1994, took his 5mph lawnmower on a 240-mile road trip to visit his sick brother, it shimmers with awestruck wonder. Lead actor Richard Farnsworth was in the latter stages of terminal cancer during filming, and his stubborn determination to see the journey through is reflected throughout the whole movie. A perfect film with a perfect ending.Stuart HeritageKindling, 10.30pm, BBC ThreeWhen he was 21, Connor O’Hara lost two of his friends; an ordeal that he used as raw material for his debut feature Kindling. The result is an undeniably lovely story about a group of young men who gather to build a fire during the final summer of their friend’s life. It’s sweet and poignant, but really shines in its portrayal of male friendship. When Kindling gets it right – when it aims its focus squarely on a group of lads who need each other to get through something unimaginable – it’s nothing less than beautiful.SHLive sportWomen’s Super League Football: Man City v Arsenal, 11.30am, Sky Sports Main EventFollowed by Aston Villa v Chelsea at 2.15pm on BBC Two.Women’s Premiership Rugby: Exeter Chiefs v Harlequins, 12.30pm, TNT Sports 2All the action from Sandy Park.T20 Cricket: India v England, 1pm, TNT Sports 1The fifth and final T20 of the series.Premier League Football: Brentford v Tottenham Hotspur, 2pm, Sky Sports Main EventFollowed by Arsenal v Man City at 4pm.Premiership Rugby Cup: Bath Rugby v Bedford Blues 2.45pm, TNT Sports 2The Pool D match from the Recreation Ground.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Courtesy of Polka Galerie.The big picturePhotographyThe big picture: a seemingly innocent winter’s day in MoscowAlexander Gronsky’s photograph of families in the snow hints at something more dubiousTim AdamsSun 2 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareThe photographer Alexander Gronsky calls the series of pictures he took in Moscow suburbs, after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine,SomethingIs Going on Here. This image of families in the snow has a kind of dubious innocence. It is juxtaposed in other photos in the collection with military vehicles idling in these same winter landscapes at the edge of the city, and uniformed Russian soldiers mingling with ordinary residents. The contrast gives all of the images a disturbing edge of menace. You find yourself looking hard, for example, at the couple of figures on the right of this picture, in authoritarian black, and wondering how they fit with the people in the primary-coloured jackets. They are part of a landscape in which “normal life” is never quite what it seems.Gronsky was born in Estonia, and has been based in Russia for most of his career – despite being arrested in the anti-Putin protests of 2015. He has long been drawn to the curious hinterlands at the edge of cities, places half-developed or awaiting development, bulldozers standing by, tower blocks not completed. In a recent interview he explained how he was drawn to these areas because those “edgelands” represented an uncertain kind of escape from the normal rules of cities that require you to walk on the pavement and behave yourself. “Suddenly,” he said, “there’s a gap in the fence, and beyond lies an abandoned construction site. Different rules apply in this space – there are no ethical boundaries; you can use this place as a restroom or smash beer bottles.” That kind of unwritten licence creates what Gronsky documents as a new kind of uneasy “pastoral” where norms become unruly, borders porous, and everywhere is a sort of no man’s land, where – good or bad – “anything can happen”.Alexander Gronsky is atGalerie Le Château d’Eau, Toulouse, until 23 MarchExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big pictureRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The trail can be completed over a few nights and stargazers can glimpse Orion, the Great Plough and the North Star.

Their presence is far more visible during the winter months in the northern hemisphere, despite being 440 light years from Earth.Darkness is measured by the Bortle scale, with 1 being the darkest skies on earth, generally found in remote deserts or the Arctic, and 9 the most light-polluted areas, typically the centre of vast, seething cityscapes.

A case of waste not, want not rather than to spotlight a vegetable in season. The results can be good or less so, depending on just how many turnips and swedes I am also trying to get rid of. This week, I made soup simply to celebrate a particularly fine head of celery.I carried it home with my shopping, the celery’s plume of leaves poking pertly from my bag. The soup was good, using the entire head, or at least those stalks I hadn’t torn away and munched raw the moment I arrived home. The like-it-or-loathe-it vegetable was mellowed and sweetened by sour cream and potato.For all the big flavoured soups, with their spices and chilli notes, this one with its muted tones the colour of a winter sky, its soothing “there, there” quality and the feelgood factor that can only come from potatoes, seemed perfectly suited to the day. There are often looks of disbelief when I list celery as among my favourite vegetables, but it is. So radically are its mineral notes softened by cooking that an ardent celery refusnik lapped up this soup and asked for more.As an accompaniment, there were potato pancakes the size of coins, to eat alongside. So good were they, I made a second batch the diameter of a crumpet, which we ate with an untidy nest of sauerkraut and a spoonful of sour cream. The batter, despite having a froth of beaten egg white stirred in to lighten it, kept well in the fridge overnight and we enjoyed them the next day with slices of gravlax and a mustard and dill dressing.Celery soup with thyme and parsleyA deeply satisfying soup you can keep slightly rough or blend to a smooth purée as you wish. I like to leave a few pieces of unblended celery in there.Serves 6. Ready in 1 hourpotato1, largecelery1 large head (about800g)butter60gthyme leaves1 tspspring onions6parsley10 bushy sprigsvegetable or chicken stock or water1.5 litressour cream150mlScrub, then roughly chop the potato.Remove 6 tufts of bushy celery leaves and set aside for later.Trim the root end and any dry ends of the celery stalks and discard. Roughly chop the ribs and attached leaves. Melt the butter in a deep saucepan over a moderate heat, stir in the potato and celery and partially cover the pan with a lid. You need it to soften and toast very lightly, but not to go brown.Stir the thyme leaves into the celery together with a generous grinding of black pepper. Roughly chop the spring onions and parsley, and add to the celery. Continue cooking for about 10 minutes until everything is soft.Pour in the stock or water, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat, still partially covering the pan with a lid, and simmer for 25 minutes. Correct the seasoning with salt, remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream, then eat with the pancakes below.Potato pancakesView image in fullscreen‘Fluffy’: potato pancakes.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverYou can make these fluffy pancakes with whatever potatoes you may have to hand, but I have had the best results using large floury white potatoes. Once they are boiled or steamed and drained, leave them for 5 minutes to let the steam escape. Crush them with a vegetable masher or, better still, a potato ricer, making sure they’re still warm – they will be easier to deal with that way. Serve them with smoked salmon or sauerkraut.Makes 12 large pancakes, serves 4. Ready in 1 hourpotatoes750g, large and flouryeggs4milk150mlparsley3 tbsp, choppedspring onions4double cream4 tbspplain flour150gTo cook:olive oil3 tbspbuttera large knobPeel the potatoes and cut them into large pieces, as you would for roasting. Boil the potatoes until tender in deep, lightly salted water in a medium to large saucepan – about 20 minutes, depending on the variety. When they are tender to the point of a knife, drain in a colander and either mash with a fork or, better I think, push through a potato ricer. Let the mash cool a little.Separate the eggs, putting the whites into a bowl large enough in which to beat them. Mix the yolks together briefly with a fork. Season the potato with salt and black pepper – be generous. Finely slice the spring onions.Warm the milk in a small pan and, when it is near to reaching the boil, remove from the heat and stir into the potato. Stir in the parsley, chopped spring onions, egg yolks, cream and the flour. Take care not to overmix. The mixture should be soft enough to fall from the spoon with a gentle shake (if it is too runny, stir in a little more flour).Warm the oil in a shallow pan and add the butter. Place 3 large spoonfuls (I use a kitchen spoon about the size of a tbsp) of the mixture into the hot fat, each roughly the size of a digestive biscuit. Let them cook for about 5 or 6 minutes, then slide a palette knife under each and flip them over. Leave for a couple of minutes, until the underside is gold, then remove from the pan, place on a warm plate or, best of all, wrapped in a tea towel in a wicker basker to keep them warm.Continue until all of the mixture is used up, replacing the oil and butter if necessary. Serve the potato cakes with the soup.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsSoupNigel Slater recipesPancakesPotatoesFoodVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

There’s a pleasing creaminess to the spice-dusted, oil-dribbled, tahini-rich hummus that comes topped with a single shiny black olive, the savoury equivalent of a cherry on top. But the restaurant is more than that. Much likeArabic Flavourin Aberystwyth, which I visited last year, it is both the story of exile and an act of memory. It is the product of one woman’s determination to maintain her family’s traditions; to free the country of her birth from a single narrative of war and hardship, however overwhelming that narrative might seem right now.Muna Al-Maflehi was born in Taiz, a brown stone city in the highlands of southwestern Yemen, known before the current civil war for its quality coffee production and for the abundant citrus fields with which it is surrounded. When she was seven, Muna moved with her family to Saudi Arabia, where her father taught her the dishes his father had cooked for him. It was a way of keeping alive a connection to the country and culture they had left behind. In 2013, looking for a better life, she moved with her five children to live near Salzburg. There she started her first food-delivery business before, in 2017, following close relatives to York.The plan was always to open a restaurant, but it’s never easy; harder still for those who are newly arrived. It began with a couple of well-received pop-ups in the city from 2019 onwards, but like so many projects it was delayed by Covid. Eventually, they found an old pub, the Spread Eagle on Walmgate, in need of custodians and love. The wood-panelling and parquet are still there, and so is the bar, though beaten copper teapots now stand upon it. Otherwise, the space has been carefully papered and polished, and rubber plants strategically placed. According to the blackboard on the pavement by the front door, there is now a “secret Mediterranean garden” for smoking shisha out back.View image in fullscreen‘It is just a plate of chicken and rice, but it is the best chicken and rice’: chicken mandi.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverShortly before they were due to open, at the end of 2021, the newly decorated restaurant was broken into and ripped apart byvandalswho splattered the walls with paint. “It was like a bomb had just hit it,” Muna told theYork Pressat the time, despairingly. “It was like being in the war in Yemen. I couldn’t believe that this had happened in the UK.” But the community wanted the restaurant. A crowdfunder was launched. More than £21,000 was raised. Yemen Heaven opened and it remains very much a family affair. It was her daughter Zay who wrote me an email spun through with gentle pride about her mother’s achievements. It was her son Moe who served us, guiding us through the menu to the Yemeni specialities. Because there is a lot here that will look familiar: hummus andbaba ganoush,fattoush,tabboulehandfalafel, a quintet of those Middle Eastern bangers. Try them by all means. But as ever, it makes more sense to order the things you don’t recognise.View image in fullscreen‘An unapologetic chilli heat’: hummus and bisbas’.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverTo go with the oven-hot flat bread, we get a bowl of bisbas, a sharp vinegary dip of blended tomatoes, coriander and garlic with an unapologetic chilli heat that comes in a few moments after you’ve nodded appreciatively at the freshness and vibrancy of the rest of it. Try the spicy shafoot which, by comparison, isn’t very. It’s a salad of cucumber and finely sliced radish, the green of a woodland clearing in spring, mixed in with pieces of crustless wholemeal bread that have soaked up the spiced mint yoghurt dressing. Pomegranate seeds and a sprinkle of sumac shine out from amid the additional layers of rocket and baby chard.View image in fullscreen‘Soft and crisp’: homemade flatbreads.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverIt is very hard not to like Yemen Heaven; just the idea of it, the very bones of it. The temptation with such a place is to hype it as some gastronomic temple, where a kind of kitchen alchemy turns humble ingredients into something highborn. There is indeed a form of alchemy at play here, but it is not that. It is more about comfort and care; a feeling of being properly looked after with cooking that draws on the domestic. Chickenmandiis an exotic name for something very simple. It’s a quarter piece of chicken on the bone with a timbale of rice. That long grain has the buttery separation familiar from the region. But the wonder is the chicken that looks roasted, but instead has been slow-cooked, so that it’s now falling apart. Usually, a bird like this is cotton-wool dry and cloying; this is anything but and the aromatics have penetrated every fibre. It is just a plate of chicken and rice, but it is the best chicken and rice.View image in fullscreen‘The green of a woodland clearing in spring’: spicy shafoot salad.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverThere is something similar at play with the fah’sa, which is a lamb stew. There is nothing else to it other than shredded lamb and a deep, generous broth, fragrant with fenugreek. It is delivered to the table in a Yemeni stone pot, which is so hot that the broth is boiling fiercely on arrival. Think of it as the floor show. It tastes as you hope every meaty broth will, but too often doesn’t. It tastes of long cooking; of the lamb giving its all to the liquor in which it swims. It is the kind of dish that you know will improve a day, from bad to good, or from good to better.View image in fullscreen‘Creamy’: um Ali.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverThere is a short wine list, which is three versions of “Would you like red or white?”, all priced in the mid-20s and then, at £55, a bottle of Lebanon’s Chateau Musar described as “Moe’s Wine Pick”. He’s got taste, that boy. Desserts are for those who like their sweet things very sweet indeed. Um Ali (or “Ali’s mother”) is a creamy pudding of coconut and nuts, topped with the green of pistachio and the pink of dried rose petals. Areeka is a darker, spiced bread pudding mashed together with dates and sesame oil. They are the light and dark versions of each other, and are both served so hot we have to sit and observe them for a while before digging in. At the end, we are brought glass beakers of sweet, milky Yemeni tea, heavy with black cardamom. It is very cold out there in York tonight, but like everything else at Yemen Heaven, the tea will see us right.News bitesRejoice! The long wait is over. After two decades, the motorway services operator Welcome Break is opening a new outpost. Welcome Break Rotherham, which has created 230 jobs, is located at junction 33 of the M1 and includes concessions from Pret a Manger, Burger King, KFC and Chopstix. And all of this inside a site which has been designed to look like a Yorkshire village. They spoil us, they really do (welcomebreak.co.uk).The Caribbean-inspired restaurant brand Turtle Bay has announced it is going upmarket with an ‘elevated dining concept’ boasting a menu of ‘refined’ dishes drawing on the culture of the islands alongside ‘warm and welcoming venue design’, all of which honours ‘the roots of being a joyful and carefree place to connect with people’. The new Turtle Bay is being trialled at a branch in Chelmsford, which is currently shut until March while it undergoes an ‘inspired transformation that will see the restaurant elevated entirely from its current standing’. And so on (turtlebay.co.uk).Husband and wife team Luke and Stacey Sherwood French have finally opened the much-delayed new version of their umlaut-rich Sheffield restaurant JÖRO. The original was located in a shipping container on Kelham Island; this is very much a bricks and mortar affair at the city’s Oughtibridge Paper Mill development. It will serve both an express £45 tasting menu and much longer versions priced at £125. There are seven rooms up above as well as space for SHÖP by JÖRO, selling various deli products and store cupboard staples – although there is no sign of the word ‘grocerant’ to describe this part of the business, first floated when the move was announced in 2022 (jororestaurant.co.uk).Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Instagram@jayrayner1Explore more on these topicsMiddle Eastern food and drinkJay Rayner on restaurantsRestaurants (Food)FoodRestaurants (Travel)reviewsShareReuse this content"

In the spirit of the fresh start, then, this week strikes me as being the perfect time to give tired drinking habits leftover from last year a bit of a makeover – and no wine country in the world is better equipped to do that than Italy. There are more than 500 indigenous grape varieties spread around the Italian peninsula and islands, with vineyards, and distinctive wine cultures, in all of the country’s 20 administrative regions. For a sense of the sheer range and contrast you could begin at either end of an A to Z: a lush, darkly bittersweet heavyweight Amarone red made from dried grapes in Valpolicella in the northeast such as M&S Collection Amarone Montresor 2021 (£24,M&S) and an unashamedly floral, pretty, gently peachy-grapey dry white from a Sicilian member of the muscat family, zibibbo.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The Nebbiolo variety, ingredient of the region’s most famous red, Barolo, is the red star here; but my choice this time is the less widely heralded, if in fact rather more widely planted, barbera, as exemplified in the completely delightful example from Cascina Alberta; with its characteristically enlivening streak of tomato/red plum acidity and a squirt of tangy red cherry it’s a prime example of Italian red wine’s wonderful food-matching capabilities (I would have it with any kind of wintry pasta and ragu). Sangiovese, the dominant red variety across Central Italy, especially Tuscany, has similar tangy food-friendliness, not least in Tesco’s true-to-type, savoury Finest Chianti Classico Riserva 2019 (£10.50). And the last red stop is back in Sicily, for the outstanding value offered by the suavely, richly, darkly plummy Extra Special Sicilian Reserve Red 2020 (£7.47,Asda).Extra Special Fiano, Sicily, Italy 2023 (£6.75,Asda)Sicily, which accounts for about 18% of all Italian wine, is the first step on an Italianvini bianchitrail, in the shape of a slightly smoky, ripely stone-fruited example of fiano. Another island, Sardinia, meanwhile is one of the best sources of vermentino, a white variety that creates characterful, fresh whites in dry, warm conditions across the Med: Cantina Castiadas Notteri Vermentino di Sardegna DOC 2022 (£21.95,dorsetwine.co.uk) is alive with orange citrus, fennel and fluent acidity. Frascati, made principally from malvasia a few miles south of Rome, is one of those classic old-style trattoria wines that has been much-improved in recent years in the hands of producers such as Castel de Paolis, whose refined Frascati Superiore 2022 (£20.65,thefinewinecompany.co.uk) blends understated tropical fruit and pithy citrus with freshening seabreezy tones. Last stop is in far northern Alto Adige, and a reappraisal of the much-maligned pinot grigio, with the discreetly charming, fresh pear, camomile and soft, serpentine acidity of Piccozza Alto Pinot Grigio 2023 (£12,Tesco).Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodItalian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
