We are as close as we’ve ever been, but conversations at the political level cut both ways,” the source said.Reeves rejects calls for ‘buy British’ campaign in response to US tariffsRead moreAt a briefing with UK negotiators from the trade department on Tuesday, businesses were told that 90% of the deal had been agreed and that some of the outstanding issues related to whisky, cars and pharmaceuticals.The eventual deal could mean dramatic tariff reductions onscotch whiskyand car exports to India, helping two sectors of the UK economy that areheavily exposed to the impactof Donald Trump’s tariffs in the US.The call with businesses took place before talks betweenRachel Reevesand India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, about a bilateral investment treaty, which the UK and India are negotiating in parallel with the free trade agreement.The treaty, which would establish legal protections for investments between the UK and India, is a top priority for ministers because of the benefits for the British financial services sector.Sitharaman attended a working dinner with Reeves and Keir Starmer on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, she held talks with Jonathan Reynolds, the trade secretary,who travelled to New Delhiin February to formally relaunch the talks.At an event at the Indian high commission before her meetings on Tuesday, Sitharaman said India wasseeking more bilateral trade agreementsas a result of global uncertainties “multiplying by the day”.Speaking to reporters after the talks on Wednesday, she said there was a “great sense of positivity and dedication” to conclude the UK-India deal soon. Ministers announced a package of £128m in new export deals and investments with India after her visit.Reeves said ministers were pursuing trade deals with countries including India because it was “imperative we go further and faster to kickstart economic growth”.Keshav Murugesh, the chief executive of the technology company WNS, which is expanding its London headquarters, said closer ties would “fuel innovation and generate high-skilled jobs” in both countries.Some of the issues that remained outstanding in the trade deal negotiations earlier this year included some agricultural exports and India’s demand to be excluded from the UK’s forthcoming border tax.The Guardian revealed last yearthat India had asked for an exemption from the UK’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) – a planned tax on the import of carbon-intensive goods such as steel and fertiliser – on the basis that it is a developing country.Any such exemption would be controversial because the tax is designed to support UK steel producers by levelling the playing field with countries that have a lower or no carbon levy.The UKlaunched negotiationsfor a free trade agreement with India, which is seen as one of the biggest prizes of Brexit, in January 2022. Successive Conservative governments sought tostrike a quick deal with no success.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyRachel ReevesKeir StarmerJonathan ReynoldsIndiaShareReuse this content"

The proportion of secondary leaders cutting teachers has gone up from 38% in 2024 to 51%, while 50% reported cuts to teaching assistants, up from 41% last year.“State schools are overwhelmed with financial pressures and many are rapidly heading towards breaking point,” said Nick Harrison, the chief executive of the Sutton Trust, which is calling for a new national strategy to close the attainment gap.“This is having a devastating impact on their ability to provide the support that the most disadvantaged pupils need, with almost half of secondary school leaders forced to use funding intended for poorer pupils to plug budget holes. If action isn’t taken, we will be failing the next generation.”The proportion of school leaders having to reduce GCSE choices rose from 29% to 33%, while at A-level it went from 23% to 29%.

Di’Iasio said: “And the government is set to make the situation even worse by its proposal to implement a teachers’ pay award for 2025-26 without the funding necessary to enable schools to afford those costs.”James Bowen, the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “We’ve heard of schools having to fundraise for basics like paper, online learning resources and school trips – this can’t be right. While public finances may be tight, it remains essential that children’s education and futures are prioritised, and it’s vital this is reflected in the three-year spending review in June.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “This government has protected key education priorities through our plan for change. In 2025-26, we are putting a further £3.2bn into schools’ budgets and increasing pupil premium to over £3bn to provide additional support for those children that need it most.”Explore more on these topicsSchool fundingTeachingSecondary schoolsSchoolsEnglandTeacher shortagesGCSEsnewsShareReuse this content"

The black, chequered lid is in fact solar panels that power the scanner.The postbox’s extra-large opening hatch offers a new way for the postal service to cash in on a roaring parcel trade. While letter volumes are in steep decline, Britain is in the grip of a secondhand selling boom as consumers use sites such as Vinted to make extra cash.In a process that will be familiar to those withside hustles, the postboxes can be used to drop off packages that have barcoded postage. Once customers have scanned their code – the postbox’s batteries store energy to power its scanner when there is no sun – the drawer on the front opens. They can then use the Royal Mail app to request “proof of posting”.View image in fullscreenThe parcel hatch opens when a valid barcode is scanned.Photograph: Royal MailWith competition fierce among delivery services,Royal Mailsaid the redesigned postboxes would make it easier and more convenient for customers to use its network. There are 115,000 postboxes in the UK, and the company flagged the potential to adapt “thousands” to accept larger parcels.The red pillarbox has a storied history, with the author Anthony Trollope proposing their introduction in the 1850s when he was working as a surveyor’s clerk for the Post Office. The design was not standardised until 1859 when two sizes with a cylindrical shape, painted green, were settled upon. However, people complained that green was difficult to spot and, in 1874, the distinctive red colour was chosen to replace it, although it took 10 years to repaint them all.The Royal Mail’s chief executive, Emma Gilthorpe, said that “in an era where letter volumes continue to decline and parcels are booming, we are giving our iconic postboxes a new lease of life on street corners across the nation”. You may have to wait for one near you, though, as the trial involves just five in the Ware, Hertford and Fowlmere areas of Hertfordshire andCambridgeshire.News of the postbox pilot comes before the imminent sale of Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services, to the Czech energy billionaireDaniel Křetínský’s EP Groupin a£3.57bn deal.At the same time, Royal Mail is grappling with a shake-up of postal service rules it must follow. As part of a modernisation plan drawn up by Ofcom, it would only have to deliver second-class letters onalternate weekdays. However, the regulator also wants to set new reliability targets requiring 99.5% of first-class letters to be delivered within three days, and 99.5% of second-class letters within five days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similar to a spending review, it could be published as a public government document, debated in parliament, and be subjected to select committee scrutiny.Labour MPs launch campaign for digital IDs to crack down on illegal migrationRead moreThe suggestion comes as the government prepares to release an immigration white paper, while facing competing demands for lower overall migration and more visas from businesses, the NHS, universities and social care.Reports earlier this week claimed that the white paper was delayed following rows between the Home Office and education ministers over proposed student numbers.The Home Office has tended to focus on limiting migration. For other departments – including the Treasury, the Department of Health and Social Care, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Business and Trade – migration is an economic lever with which to secure workforces and promote exports.Sachin Savur, IfG researcher and author of the report, said: “For too long, governments have failed to set out what aims they have for migration policy and a realistic route to achieve them.“They have been tempted to make kneejerk changes in response to net migration and labour market statistics.“Adopting an annual migration plan would allow ministers to get on the front foot and set out a genuinely cross-government agenda for immigration that takes into account the government’s wider priorities, evidence and interests.”Net migration – the measure for the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the country –hit a record high of 906,000 in June 2023, in a period covering the premierships of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.Rights groups urge Starmer to dial down anti-migrant rhetoricRead moreThe figures prompted dismay and allegations that the Tories had failed to “take back control” of the UK’s borders following Brexit.According to the report, an annual plan would give the government’s immigration policy credibility by:Allowing for a more honest assessment about the pros and cons of migration.Ending the antagonistic relationship between the Home Office and other departments.Creating a more coordinated approach that weighs up interests and evidence across government to produce a collectively agreed strategy.Ensuring a predictable approach to developing policy which gives certainty to employers, universities and trade associations.An arbitrary annual cap on net migration would be impractical, but more specific targets, set by route, could be more realistic if an annual plan was implemented, the IfG said.The Home Office has been approached for a comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

An official audience had previously been removed from the royals’ schedule due to the pontiff’s ill health.The Vatican said in a statement that during the meeting the pope expressed his best wishes to Charles and Camilla on their 20th wedding anniversary, which they celebrated on Wednesday, while they wished for his “speedy recovery”.Buckingham Palace said Charles and Camilla “were delighted the pope was well enough to host them – and to have had the opportunity to share their best wishes in person.”Francis was discharged from Rome’s Gemelli hospital, where he spent five weeks being treated for the life-threatening pneumonia, on 23 March. His medics said he would need to convalesce at home for at least two months.The meeting on Wednesday came after Charles became the first British monarch to address a joint session of the Italian parliament, surprising many politicians with his Italian language skills.The king joked that he hoped he wasn’t “ruining” the language of Dante to the point that “he would not be invited toItalyagain”.“Italy is a country very dear to my heart and to that of the queen, as it is to many British people,” he said.The couple met the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, earlier on Wednesday and are being hosted by President Sergio Mattarella for a state banquet at the Quirinal Palace on Wednesday night.

Labour’s leadership is under pressure to offer new policies for party councillors in England to sell on the doorstep as they gear up to fight local elections on May Day.Starmer will say that visible policing has fallen dramatically over the past decade and will reiterate plans to put 13,000 more officers into neighbourhood policing roles by 2029.“For years, crimes such as shoplifting and antisocial behaviour have wreaked havoc on our neighbourhoods,” he will say. “Policing has become reactive, picking up the pieces after crimes have occurred.“Britain deserves better. It should not matter where you live – everyone deserves local, visible policing they can trust.”Officials said every neighbourhood in England andWaleswill have dedicated teams “on the beat” with guaranteed police patrols at peak times such as Friday and Saturday nights. There will also be a dedicated antisocial behaviour lead officer in every force, working with residents and businesses to develop tailored action plans, a statement said.The model announced by Starmer is inspired by an initiative launched two years ago by Greater Manchester police (GMP), which the force said had helped reduce burglary by a third, vehicle crime by a quarter and led to the conviction of about 100 shoplifters a week.As well as having a named officer for every area, GMP has sent more resources – both visible and undercover – into problem areas such as particular local supermarkets and parks, in part based on data identifying crime hotspots.Ch Insp Stephen Warriner, of GMP, admitted that police in recent years had “lost the confidence of our businesses and our communities to report crime to us”.As part of its neighbourhood policing drive, GMP is known to have placed undercover officers in shops wearing supermarket uniforms in an attempt to catch thieves in the act.Warriner did not deny the force used this approach when asked by reporters in Manchester this week, saying only: “We will certainly do our utmost to blend in as part of the community.”Darryl Stuart-Cole, the manager of a Co-op supermarket in Withington, south Manchester, said his store was targeted 20-30 times a week by shoplifters and that some of his staff now feared coming to work. “Most of the offenders walk in, fill their bags and walk out,” he said, adding that four or five regular offenders were responsible for the vast majority of thefts.In its 2024 general election manifesto, Labourpromised 13,000 more police officerson the frontline, made up of fully warranted officers, community support officers and volunteer specials. The announcement will include the first tranche, about one-third, of the promised officers.Forces will have some say in the mix between fully warranted officers, police community support officers, specials, and potentially employing police staff to free up officers in back office jobs to return to front-facing roles.A senior police source said: “It’s welcome money. We’d rather take the money with no strings attached and invest in other things. But no police chief is going to turn down more police officers if they are being offered.”From 2010 the Conservative government cut budgets and officer numbers by 20,000 as part of their austerity programme. Then, in the run-up to the 2019 election, they announced a hiring spree of 20,000 new officers.The government set aside £200m to fund neighbourhood policing this financial year, which comes out of the central police settlement. However, several forces have warned that existing funding levels mean they will still have to make cuts.Crime is expected to be a key battleground in the local elections, with the latest YouGov tracker poll showing that 63% of the public believe that the government is handling crime in the UK badly.In response to Starmer’s announcement, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “The previous Conservative government delivered record police officers, but law and order is taking a backseat under Labour.“They must urgently get a grip to ensure our police have the resources they need to cut crime and keep the British people safe.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceCrimeEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

We have shown that a relatively simple, inexpensive spit test to identify men of European heritage at higher risk due to their genetic makeup is an effective tool to catch prostate cancer early.”Prostate cancer surgery breakthrough offers hope for erectile functionRead moreSince carrying out the trial, called Barcode 1, the team has developed an updated version of the test based on more recently identified risk variants for men of Asian and African ancestry and are assessing this in a new study.Routine PSA testing is not currently offered on the NHS but patients may be offered a PSA test if a GP suspects they have prostate cancer. Men over the age of 50 can ask their GP for a PSA test, even if they do not have symptoms. Men with a high PSA result will be sent for further tests, such as an MRI scan and biopsy, to detect cancer.Chris Hoy, whohas been diagnosed with terminal cancer, has called for the tests to be made available to younger men with a family history of the disease and to black men, who are twice as likely to be diagnosed as white men. This week, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, suggested that he wouldsupport a screening programme for men at higher riskif it were backed by the evidence. Recent studies have concluded that universal screening would not greatly help prevent deaths and would be very likely to lead to unnecessary treatment.The problem is that PSA tests falsely indicate prostate cancer in men three out of four times, and can detect cancers that grow so slowly they are unlikely to ever be life-threatening – meaning that men may undergo unnecessary MRI scans, invasive biopsies and treatments whose side effects can include urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction.Black men in England more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer, analysis showsRead moreThe latest study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, calculated the polygenic risk score (PRS) of more than 6,000 men of white European heritage recruited from their GP surgeries, aged between 55 and 69 years old – the period of life at which risk of prostate cancer is increased. The men with the highest 10% of risk scores, based on 130 gene variants linked to prostate cancer, were invited to further testing. After an MRI and prostate biopsy, 40% of these men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. By contrast, 25% of men with a high PSA level will actually have prostate cancer.The PRS saliva test also identified a higher proportion of aggressive cancers. Of the 187 cancers detected, 55.1% were aggressive cancers, compared with 35.5% identified by a PSA test, in a recent study.The polygenic test, if used in combination with existing methods, could help doctors more precisely identify men who would benefit from more aggressive treatments and could tip the balance in favour of screening those at greatest genetic risk. However, the team behind the work said it would be necessary to track outcomes to assess the risk-benefit trade-offs.“We can identify men at risk of aggressive cancers who need further tests and spare the men who are at lower risk from unnecessary treatments,” said Eeles, who is also a consultant in clinical oncology and cancer genetics at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust.Prof Kristian Helin, the chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: “The current PSA test often leads to unnecessary treatments and, more worryingly, fails to detect some cancers. There is an urgent need for a better screening test. This research represents a promising advancement towards that goal and underscores the life-saving potential of genetic testing.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerCancer researchCancerHealthMedical researchNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.”The White House said in astatement on the executive order: “By restoring shower freedom, President Trump is following through on his commitment to dismantle unnecessary regulations and put Americans first.”Some appliance experts have found Trump’s continued focus on American water pressure notable.“It was very striking that the White House memo included toilets and shower heads as a presidential priority. It really was something,” Andrew deLaski, executive director at the Appliance Standards Awareness Project,told the Guardian in January. “But I think Donald Trump’s concerns are somewhat out of date, to tell you the truth.”Trump’s comments on Wednesday echoed remarks he has made many times before. Heclaimed in 2019that “people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once” as a result of insufficient water pressure. “When you go into these new homes with showers, the water drips down slowly, slowly,” he said in 2023.During his first term as president, Trump rolled back stricter energy-efficiency standards for lightbulbs, again citing consumer choice as the reason for the change. At the time, Xavier Becerra, then attorney general of California,called it“another dim-witted move that will waste energy at the expense of our people and planet”. The first Trump White House also created loopholes for less efficient appliances such as dishwashers and showers, moves that were later reversed by Joe Biden.“Biden undid this progress and the shower wars continued,” the White House said on Wednesday, claiming that Trump’s new executive order would “make America’s showers great again”.Oliver Milman contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

SourceMaterial’s analysis identified 38 active datacentres owned by the big three tech firms in parts of the world already facing water scarcity, as well as 24 more under development.Map of the world with kahki-colored areas representing areas of water scarcity, and green and pink circles representing data centresDatacentres’ locations are often industry secrets. But by using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel and Data Center Map, SourceMaterial compiled a map of 632 datacentres – either active or under development – owned by Amazon, Microsoft andGoogle.It shows that those companies’ plans involve a 78% increase in the number of datacentres they own worldwide as cloud computing and AI cause a surge in the world’s demand for storage, with construction planned in North America, South America,Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.A grid of pink and green rectangles growing from a horizontal baselineIn parts of the world where water is plentiful, datacentres’ high water usage is less problematic, but in 2023Microsoft saidthat 42% of its water came from “areas with water stress”, whileGoogle said15% of its water consumption was in areas with “high water scarcity”. Amazon did not report a figure.Now these companies plan to expand their activities in some of the world’s most arid regions, SourceMaterial and the Guardian’s analysis found.“It’s no coincidence they are building in dry areas,” as datacentres have to be built inland, where low humidity reduces the risk of metal corrosion, while seawater also causes corrosion if used for cooling, Jaume-Palasí said.‘Your cloud is drying my river’Amazon’s three proposed new datacentres in the Aragon region of northernSpain– each next to an existing Amazon datacentre – are licensed to use an estimated 755,720 cubic metres of water a year, roughly enough to irrigate 233 hectares (576 acres) of corn, one of the region’s main crops.In practice, the water usage will be even higher as that figure doesn’t take into account water used to generate the electricity that will power the new installations, said Aaron Wemhoff, an energy efficiency specialist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.Between them, Amazon’s new datacentres in the Aragon region are predicted to use more electricity than the entire region currently consumes. Meanwhile, Amazon in Decemberaskedthe regional government for permission to increase water consumption at its three existing datacentres by 48%.Opponents have accused the company of being undemocratic by trying to rush through its application over the Christmas period. More water is needed because “climate change will lead to an increase in global temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events, including heat waves”, Amazon wrote in its application.“They’re using too much water. They’re using too much energy,” said Aurora Gómez of the campaign group Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “Your cloud is drying my river” – which has called for a moratorium on new datacentres in Spain due to water scarcity.View image in fullscreenAn Amazon datacentre in Stone Ridge, Virginia.Photograph: Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSpain hasseenrising numbers of heat-related deaths in extreme weather events linked by scientists to the climate crisis. Last month, Aragon’s government asked for EU aid to tackle its drought.Farmer Chechu Sánchez said he’s worried the datacentres will use up water he needs for his crops.“These datacentres use water that comes from northern Aragon, where I am,” he said. “They consume water – where do they take it from? They take it from you, of course.”With 75% of the country already at risk of desertification, the combination of the climate crisis and datacentre expansion is “bringing Spain to the verge of ecological collapse”, Jaume-Palasí said.Asked about the decision to approve more datacentres, a spokesperson for the Aragonese government said they would not compromise the region’s water resources because their impact is “imperceptible”.Water offsettingAmazon does not provide overall figures for the water its datacentres use worldwide. But it does claim that it will be “water positive” by 2030, offsetting its consumption by providing water to communities and ecosystems in areas of scarcity elsewhere.Amazon says it is currently offsetting 41% of its water usage in areas it deems unsustainable. But it’s an approach that has already caused controversy inside the company.“I raised the issue in all the right places that this is not ethical,” said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at Amazon. “I disagreed quite a lot with that principle coming from a pure sustainability background.”Microsoft and Google have also pledged to become “water positive” by 2030 through water offsetting, as well as finding ways to use water more efficiently.Water offsetting ca not work in the same way as carbon offsetting, where a tonne of pollutants removed from the atmosphere can cancel out a tonne emitted elsewhere, said Wemhoff, the Villanova University specialist. Improving access to water in one area does nothing to help the community that has lost access to it far away.“Carbon is a global problem – water is more localised,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAmazon should pursue water accessibility projects “because it’s the right thing to do”, not to offset the company’s usage and make claims about being “water positive”, Wangusi said.In March, Amazon announced that it would use AI to help farmers in Aragon use water more efficiently.But that is “a deliberate strategy of obfuscation” that distracts from the company’s request to raise water consumption, said Gómez, the campaigner.Amazon said its approach shouldn’t be described as offsetting because the projects are in communities where the company operates.“We know that water is a precious resource, and we’re committed to doing our part to help solve this challenge,” said Harry Staight, an Amazon spokesperson. “It’s important to remember many of our facilities do not require the ongoing use of water to cool operations.”‘Extreme drought’Amazon is by far the biggest owner of datacentres in the world by dint of its Amazon Web Services cloud division, but Google and Microsoft are catching up.In the US, which boasts the largest number of datacentres in the world, Google is the most likely to build in dry areas, SourceMaterial’s data shows. It has seven active datacentres in parts of the US facing water scarcity and is building six more.A grid of pink and green rectangles growing from a horizontal baseline“We have to be very, very protective around the growth of large water users,” said Jenn Duff, a council member in Mesa,Arizona, a fast-growing datacentre hub. In January, Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, opened a $1bn datacentre in the city, and Google is developing two more.The surrounding Maricopa county, where Microsoft also has two active datacentres, is facing “extreme drought”, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In June 2023, Arizona state officials revoked construction permits for some new homes there due to a lack of groundwater.Drought has not halted Google’s plans for a second Mesa datacentre, while its first centre has a permit to use 5.5m cubic metres of water a year – about the same quantity used by 23,000 ordinaryArizonans.“Is the increase in tax revenue and the relatively paltry number of jobs worth the water?” said Kathryn Sorensen, an Arizona State University professor and a former director of Mesa’s water department. “It is incumbent on city councils to think very carefully and examine the trade-offs.”Google said it won’t use the full amount of water in its Mesa permit as it plans to use an air cooling system.“Cooling systems are a hyperlocal decision – informed by our data-driven strategy called ‘climate-conscious cooling’ that balances the availability of carbon-free energy and responsibly sourced water to minimise climate impact both today and in the future,” said Google spokesperson Chris Mussett.StargateIn January at the White House, Trump announced “Project Stargate”, which he called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”.Starting in Texas, the $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, the American software companyOracle, Japan-based SoftBank and Emirati investment firm MGX will finance datacentres across the US.The day before the Stargate announcement, Trump’s inauguration date, the Chinese companyDeepSeeklaunched its own AI model, claiming it had used far less computing power – and therefore less water – than its western rivals.More recently, Bloomberg hasreportedthat Microsoft is pulling back on some of its plans for new datacentres around the world. Microsoft has alsopublished plansfor a “zero water” datacentre, and Google has said it will incorporate air cooling to reduce water use – though it isn’t yet clear how its systems will work.“I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Jaume-Palasí. “Most datacentres right now are going from air cooling to water cooling because liquid is more efficient when you try to cool down high-density racks, which are the ones that are mostly being used for AI.”And while theTrump administrationhas pledged to fast-track new energy projects to power these new datacentres, it has so far said nothing about the water they could use up.“Neither people nor data can live without water,” said Gómez. “But human life is essential and data isn’t.”Quick GuideMethodologyShowThe locations of the datacentres were compiled using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel andData Center Map. Of the 632 datacentres analysed, we were unable to determine the “active” or “developing” status for 16. Areas with water scarcity were defined as places where water is 10 times as scarce as the world’s average, according to ametricdeveloped by academics for the United Nations.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Additional reporting by Eleanor GunnExplore more on these topicsWaterAmazonMicrosoftGoogleTrump administrationDesertificationDroughtnewsShareReuse this content"

He had been briefly detained by RSF forces on several occasions since the war between theRSF and army began in April 2023, before he finally disappeared in October 2024.Awad says he does not know how Abdeen was captured but that many in the area were taken prisoner while trying to reach markets to buy food.Last month, the Sudan Tribune reported that50,000 people have been forcibly disappearedby the RSF during the war, based on data from the Sudanese Group for Defending Rights and Freedoms.Awad said citizens who remained in Khartoum struggled to access food, water, electricity and medical care after health facilities were taken over by the RSF; shortages which led to Abdeen’s mother dying from illness shortly before his detention.“They brutally arrested citizens and tortured them without any care for their rights, especially in Arkaweet,” says Awad. “Our homes, women, were not safe. They threatened by gunpoint to steal, loot, beat and abuse.”The video of Abdeen in detention was taken in Jebel Awliya, on the road south out of Khartoum. In another video from the area, the same soldier recorded images of bodies and says they died of hunger and thirst.The news that Abdeen had died later in hospital prompteda wave of mourningon Sudanese social media because of his popularity in the city, where he was a well-known figure.View image in fullscreenAlwaleed Abdeen after his graduation at Lancaster University in the UK, which had awarded him a fellowship to study.Photograph: HandoutAbdeen was considered a force in Sudan’s entrepreneur scene, helping co-found the Khartoum edition of Ted Talks and innovation hubs such as 249 Startups, which helped young entrepreneurs.

But I was stumped by one of the admission requirements – an immunization certificate for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and tetanus vaccines, verified by a doctor.Fortunately, I had my mother’s handwritten documentation of my vaccines and took this to my primary care physician. “Beautiful,” she said, admiring the yellowed paperwork, which noted one measles vaccine when I was 13 months, the other at 10 years. “But these aren’t official records, so you need a titer test.” Awhat?Measles outbreak: how contagious is it and what are the symptoms?Read moreTiter tests, my doctor explained, measure antibody levels in the blood. The results threw me for a loop. My immunity to rubella was sufficient, but mumps and measles antibodies were too low, and I needed anMMRvaccine before stepping foot on campus.It was a simple fix, but the incident lingered in my mind. Why were my titers low for measles antibodies despite two rounds of the vaccine? Withrecord outbreaks this year– 607 in the US as of 3 April 2025 – I wondered if older adults should be concerned.What if I was vaccinated between 1963 and 1967?According to Dr Scott Roberts, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist, adults who were immunized against measles between 1963 and 1967 – as I was – are at risk. During that period, said Roberts, children received either an inactivated measles vaccine or a live one. The inactivated version was less effective; it was discontinued in 1967.According tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 1 million people in the US received the inactivated vaccine between 1963 and 1967. (It was tested in clinical trials in the UK but never put into widespread use.) Per my mother’s records, my second measles vaccine was live, but the first one, administered at the end of 1967, was not, which could explain the low titers test.If you know you received the inactivated vaccine, said Dr Aniruddha Hazra, a UChicago Medicine infectious disease expert, or don’t know which one you got in the 1960s, “get the MMR vaccine again. There is no harm in getting the shot even if you are fully immunized.”Adults can confirm immunity with a titer test, like I did, but the test can cost more than the MMR vaccine. “If you would rather get the titers checked first,” said Hazra, “that’s a conversation to have with your healthcare provider.”Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’But a low titer test doesn’t necessarily mean you’re susceptible to infection. Dr Robert Bednarczyk, an associate professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of PublicHealth, explained that even if vaccinated individuals don’t have detectable circulating antibodies, they probably have memory cells in their immune system ready to produce more antibodies against the virus.What if I was born before 1957?Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, measles was a major cause of death in children under five. Infection could lead to hearing loss, deafness or debilitating neurological side effects. What is the current recommendation for adults born before the vaccine?“Anyone born before 1957 was exposed to measles,” said Hazra. “Based on that, the CDC and ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] said we can assume you were exposed or acquired measles, and measles immunity is lifelong.” This means no additional vaccine is recommended for this age group.One shot or two?If you’re wondering how many shots you should have had, the answer is slightly muddy.Until 1989, the CDC recommended only one dose of the MMR vaccine for children. Thereafter, a second MMR dose was recommended to help “increase the immune response in the small number of people who didn’t fully respond to the first dose”, said Bednarczyk.The CDC currently recommends two doses of the measles vaccine for children and “one or two” doses for adults, reserving the two-dose recommendation for adults identified as high-risk, such as those in higher learning and healthcare settings, or who are traveling internationally.“One dose is very effective at preventing measles,” said Bednarczyk. “This is important, because many people born before the mid or late 1980s likely only received one dose of the MMR vaccine.” But, he added, people vaccinated prior to the two-dose recommendation benefited from high MMR vaccine uptake, which greatly reduced the risk of large measles outbreaks.The vaccination landscape has changed in recent years. Since the 2019-20 school year, vaccination rates amongst school children – targeted for 95% – have fallen dramatically. According to KFF, a non-profit health policy organization, only11 US statesreported vaccination rates of 95% or higher in the 2023-24 school year. Previous vaccination recommendations took into account the fact that measles had been eradicated in the US, said Hazra. “All adults living in the US should be considered high-risk” right now, he says, and should receive two live doses at some point in their life, except for adults born before 1957.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDr David Nguyen, an internal medicine and pediatric infectious disease specialist at Rush University System for Health, has a similar take. “If an adult received only one MMR vaccine before the recommendation for two doses was made, they should consider getting a second dose.”In the absence of a formal CDC guideline for all adults, one thing is clear: two live vaccines confer lifetime immunity. “There is also no value in getting more than two,” said Hazra. If you know you were vaccinated with the two doses of the live vaccine, he says, there is no recommendation for another dose, even in an outbreak or traveling internationally.Does measles immunity wane over time?Last month,Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, remarkedin an interviewthat immunity from the MMR vaccine “wanes 4.5% a year” and that “older people are essentially unvaccinated”.“That is factually incorrect,” said Hazra. “If it was true, we would be seeing more measles in people with histories of vaccination.” Hazra stresses the importance of including older adults in the discussion about measles protection; they’re more vulnerable to possible complications from measles infections, which include pneumonia. But all the experts I spoke to warn against widespread misinformation about the measles vaccine. “Levels of antibodies against the measles virus may decline over time,” adds Bednarcdzyk. “But in the cases we’ve seen so far in 2025, only 3% of the cases had documented history of measles vaccine receipt.”Are there side effects from the MMR vaccine?Bednarczyk cites “no big differences for adults compared to children” and that side effects usually clear up in a few days. “A lot of these live vaccines elicit a greater immune response for 24-48 hours,” adds Hazra. “The body is mounting an immune response and creating a lot of energy to do so.”The most common side effects are fever, soreness and swelling at the site of the injection, headache, muscle aches, tiredness or a mild rash. “In some very rare cases,” said Bednarczyk, “there may be a short-term drop in blood platelet levels after vaccination, which can also happen if you are infected with measles virus.”Wonder drug or waste of money? The truth about fish oil supplementsRead moreA person infected with measles spreads the disease to an average of 18 new cases in unvaccinated individuals, said Bednarczyk, making measles one of the most infectious diseases out there. (By comparison, individuals with seasonal influenza usually infect about two other people.) “Airborne pathogens hang around for two hours,” added Hazra. “It can infect so many people because of this.”The MMR vaccination is significantly safer than acquiring natural immunity via infection. “Having the measles disease runs the risk of complications later on,” said Nguyen. These include subsequent measles infections from “immune amnesia” and serious complications from measles-related encephalitis.Anyone who is unsure about their vaccination status should speak to their healthcare provider about an MMR or titer test. A high level of immunity across the US will help protect everyone.Jean Iversenis a Chicago-based writer and developmental editorExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyMMRHealthVaccines and immunisationInfectious diseasesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Flür happily obliged. He said the person told him, referring to Daft Punk: “Without Kraftwerk we would not find our own robot style, being on stage with the helmets”. Believing they were Bangalter, Flür then asked the person if they would like to work on some tracks. The impersonator agreed and sent over demos for the songs, which were worked up into a two new Flür tracks billed as featuring “Thomas Vangarde”, supposedly a new alias of Bangalter.But after the release of the collaborations on the album Times, the moderator of Daft Punk’s Reddit page said Bangalter disavowed the recordings, and sources close to Bangalter have also confirmed to the Guardian that he did not participate in the collaboration (Flür and his label have been approached for comment).This isn’t the first time Daft Punk have had to distance themselves from a fake project: in 2011 a Spanish newspaper reported that Daft Punk would be playing the Arenal Sound festival under a new alter ego, the Third Twin, before the duo said it was “completely untrue”. And it’s not the first time artists and audiences have been the victims of musical hoaxes.Milli VanilliGerman R&B duo Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus, known as Milli Vanilli, have possibly the most toe-curling revelation of fraudulent behaviour. They sold 7m records in the US, with international sales reaching a reported 30m singles, and in 1990 they won a Grammy for best new artist. But during a live performance on MTV, at a theme park in Connecticut, their backing track malfunctioned causing the recording of their song Girl You Know It’s True to skip: a sign that the pair were actually lip-syncing. The deception began unravelling, and eventually their svengali Frank Farian fired the duo and revealed the real singers to be a team of session players. The pair protested they really could sing, they just hadn’t been allowed to by Farian – but their album was deleted by their label and their Grammy award rescinded.The ZombiesEnglish rock band the Zombies parted ways in 1967, but their US label released the group’s Time of the Season single a year later and it became a US hit, reaching No 3. In an era with no internet access, it was hard for audiences to know a band’s whereabouts or what they even looked like, which is how US tours were then successfully booked by management company Delta Promotions, who passed off two other groups as the real Zombies (one of the fake bands even contained two future members of ZZ Top). Chris White from the real Zombies complained the fake versions were “taking money from our fans and dragging down our reputation”, but in 2016, a member of one of the fake bands, Mark Ramsey, was unrepentant: “We were a blues rock band from Texas, a band with plenty of good looks, better than the original Zombies”.View image in fullscreenThe actual Zombies, in 1964.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamySilibil N’ BrainsAfter failed auditions with label bosses in London who laughed them off as “the rapping Proclaimers”, early 00s Dundee rap duo Gavin Bain and Billy Boyd started scheming on ways they could make it big: what if they were no longer from Scotland? Faking their accents and reinventing themselves as California rap duoSilibil N’ Brains, they auditioned again, secured a record deal with Sony Music and a support slot with Eminem’s group D12, and kept up the ruse for four years. But Bain said that maintaining the lie became too difficult, and Boyd decided to go back to Dundee to work in the oil industry. Their story, though, has endured, being told in 2013 documentary The Great Hip Hop Hoax and again as a forthcoming feature film directed by James McAvoy entitled California Schemin’.Classical musicSome of the biggest and most egregious hoaxes have been perpetuated in classical music. Henri-Gustave Casadesus’s early 20th-century quintet became famous for premiering rediscovered works by dead composers including the sons of Bach – but they were actually written by Casadesus and his brothers. There is also pianist Joyce Hatto, who rose to prominence in the 1950s. Later, after she was diagnosed with cancer, her husband passed off other performers’ recordings as her own on more than 100 releases (Victoria Wood adapted the story for the screen as Loving Miss Hatto). There’s an entire Wikipedia page for classical hoaxes, in fact.One of the most extraordinary examples is Japanese composer Mamoru Samuragochi, who claimed he was deaf but could play beautiful melodies on the piano and write his own compositions – his symphony honouring Hiroshima became widely acclaimed in Japan. But doubts began to surface in 2013 when, during an interview, Samuragochi responded to questions before the sign-language interpreter had finished and he stood up to answer a doorbell when it rang. All was revealed in 2014: Samuragochi’s compositions had been ghostwritten by musician and composer Takashi Niigaki, who also claimed Samuragochi was pretending to be deaf. Samuragochi admitted he had partially regained some of his hearing, saying he was “deeply ashamed of living a lie”.Artificial intelligenceMany of the above hoaxes are unlikely to have happened in an era of surveillance and globally disseminated information, but AI could bring about a whole new catalogue of fraudulent music. Last year it was revealed that at least 30 notable metal bands, including While She Sleeps, Bury Tomorrow and Thy Art Is Murder, had fake AI-generated music uploaded to their streaming service accounts without their involvement. And in 2024, a man in North Carolina was charged with fraud after allegedly using AI to create thousands of fake songs – with titles like Zygotic Washstands – by fake bands with rather prog-metal names such as Callous Post or Calorie Screams, that were then “listened to” by bots, to earn royalty payments from streaming services to the tune of $10m.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whilescented candlesdefinitely have their place, diffusers can be left unattended so you can be greeted by a lovely aroma as soon you walk through the door (although do keep them out of reach of small children and pets).The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Reed diffusersare the most common type and most straightforward to use. It’s simply a case of inserting a pack of reeds – typically rattan – into a container of fragrance oil, whether that’s a synthetic scent or a blend of essential oils in a carrier oil. The reeds slowly absorb the oil and waft the fragrance around the room. They take longer to do their work, so allow 24 to 36 hours to achieve a full fragrance level. They will continue to perfume a room for about two to four months before the oil runs low, though, so can be more worthwhile than their price tag suggests.For a more potent and fast-acting hit, look toelectricdiffusers, although it’s best to avoid using these in the same room as cats and dogs, who may ingest the particles when they lick their fur. With anultrasonic diffuser, you fill up the internal reservoir with tap water (generally speaking, the larger the reservoir, the more fragrance oomph or “throw”) and add a few drops of fragrance oil. When you turn it on, ultrasonic waves break the oil down into microscopic particles that blend with the water. This is then released from the diffuser as a visible stream of cool mist that will scent a room in minutes – more speedily than a scented candle.Nebuliser diffusersare similar but work without water, relying on a stream of pressurised air to blast the aroma into the room. They often provide a stronger fragrance hit and won’t create any condensation, but they do make an intermittent buzzing noise that’s at odds with the idea of creating a pleasant, calming environment.All the electric options can be a bit of a faff to set up and require regular cleaning, but they provide a powerful, targeted hit of fragrance.There are many other methods of diffusing, too, such as pouring drops of essential oil on to unglazed pottery or pieces of stone.We tested each diffuser and oil, allowing each reed diffuser a couple of days to properly fill a room and each electric diffuser a few sessions. We tested 50 products, compiling the longlist from personal recommendations of people’s go-to products. We were looking for lovely fragrances – nothing that smelled too artificial – and good throw to ensure a fragrance had enough heft to make a difference. This means some were discounted despite a lovely smelling product because they failed to fragrance even the tiniest room. Others didn’t make the cut because the scent was reminiscent of walking in the slipstream of someone’s vape.Here’s our edit of the best reed, electric and crystal diffusers out there.The best reed and crystal diffusersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sonny FlanaganRose and honeyView image in fullscreenForest Breath reed diffuser, 250ml£40 at Airy AromaThis Japanese brand has generously sized bottles and some lovely fragrances: unusual without being challenging, and powerful enough to scent a large room. This one features rose and honey notes, tempered by sandalwood, clary sage and geranium, so it smells fresh, not oppressive.Woody figView image in fullscreenFiguier reed diffuser, 200ml£152 at Diptyque£75 for 200ml refill at SelfridgesWe wanted to test this expensive reed diffuser because Parisian fragrance brand Diptyque is considered the gold standard of home fragrance. This diffuser lives up to that reputation with a natural-smelling green, woody, fig-leaf aroma, as well as the most powerful throw of all the diffusers tested. It quickly filled a large room and wafted into adjoining rooms, too. The fluted glass bottle echoes the oval shape of the brand’s label, but it’s a little unsteady and got knocked over during the trial.Layered scentView image in fullscreenHimalayan cedarleaf reed diffuser, 200ml£39 at John Lewis£39 at Aery LivingIn a charming little matt clay pot, this diffuser has quite a complex, perfume-like aroma that features notes of cedarleaf, amber, patchouli and jasmine, in a sustainable plant-based oil, perfect for creating a warm and calming atmosphere.ZestyView image in fullscreenOrange blossom reed diffuser, 150ml£33.99 at St EvalLike a classic eau de cologne, this smells fresh and bracing rather than sweet and cloying, with notes of flowery neroli and zesty lemon and mandarin. A lovely one for the bedroom.Fresh and breezyView image in fullscreenFresh linen reed diffuser, 100ml£18 at Beautifully UniqueThis diffuser captures the clean aroma of laundry day and bed linen that has been line-dried in the sun. The airy fragrance is a bit lacking in throw, though, so it’s best appreciated in a smaller room. Beautifully Unique’s range is vegan and cruelty free and can be customised with a choice of gold and silver caps and black or white reeds.Freshly cut herbsView image in fullscreenBayand rosemary reed diffuser, 150ml£33.99 at St Eval£30.59 at AmazonWhile many diffusers inherently smell like a “fragrance”, this potent aroma is reminiscent of actual herbs being chopped. For that reason, it works well in a kitchen where anything more perfume-like might clash with cooking smells.Salt and woodView image in fullscreenSea salt & vetiver reed diffuser, 200ml£12 at DunelmThis fragrance evokes a walk in the sand dunes with notes of tangy ozone, grassy vetiver and smoky wood, all at a refreshingly modest price.Faraway beachView image in fullscreenSeychelles reed diffuser, 200ml£30 at John Lewis£30 at the White CompanyA distinctly luxurious fragrance that feels like you’ve wandered on to the set of the White Lotus, with beachy notes and wafts of vanilla, coconut and exotic flowers.Intense and sophisticatedView image in fullscreenPomegranate Noir reed diffuser, 165ml£74 at John Lewis£74 at Jo MaloneA heady aroma of fruity pomegranate and smoky wood that may not be for everyone, but a satisfyingly powerful throw for those who love it. One for a larger room.Summer walkView image in fullscreenHedgerow reed diffuser, 98ml£33 at JoinThese small-batch diffusers are made using sustainably sourced, skin-safe ingredients and recycled materials. This one has a gorgeous summery floral scent that includes neroli, rose geranium and basil essential oils.Fruit dupeView image in fullscreenHotel Collection pomegranate reed diffuser, 100ml£3.39 at AldiAnother pleasing pomegranate scent, which has good throw without being overwhelming. It’s part of a great range of affordable fragrances at Aldi.Zesty and freshView image in fullscreenNeroliand bitter orange reed diffuser, 100ml£18.95 at the Botanical Candle CoA bright, clean orange blossom fragrance with sharp green notes that’s made with 100% plant-based ingredients. This may explain the modest throw; it’s best enjoyed in a smaller room.Rocking diffuserView image in fullscreenThe Culbutooscillating diffuser£200 at DiptyqueThe extravagant price will put this out of reach of many, but I’ve included it here because it’s an innovation. The Diptyque fragrance is embedded in a ceramic reed that attaches to a beechwood orb. When you give it a nudge, this oscillates hypnotically, wafting out Diptyque’s celebrated Baies scent, which is evocative of tangy berries, or sticking your nose into a rose and inhaling deeply.Warm and spicyView image in fullscreenPatchouliand amber reed diffuser, 90ml£9 at Argos£9 at HabitatWith hints of plum and apple, ginger and cinnamon, this one is as comforting as a fruit crumble. It has a limited throw but fills a small room well.Quartz-diffused aromasView image in fullscreenStone diffuser£49 at Airy AromaView image in fullscreenBlissful Harmony fragrant oil, 10ml£19 at Airy AromaI was sceptical about this diffuser method, dotting essential oil on to a bowl of rough-cut chunks of quartz. I doubled the suggested amount of fragrance drops, using about 10. It wasn’t enough to fill a room with fragrance but, positioned on the landing, it gave a welcome waft of gardenia and green tea whenever I passed. It needs topping up every couple of days, though.Cherry blossomView image in fullscreenThe Ritual of Sakura fragrance sticks, 250ml£34.90 at Rituals£34.90 at Look FantasticWith notes of pear and fruity cherry blossom, this is the sweetest scent that made the cut, although it might be a little sickly for some. The tall bottle and long reeds look striking but did take a tumble during the trial, so place out of reach.The best electric diffusersView image in fullscreenLamp and diffuser in oneView image in fullscreenConfetti glassultrasonic diffuser£30 at ArgosView image in fullscreenSeaside Walk scented oil, 15ml£3.50 at Sainsbury’sA great ultrasonic diffuser for the money, it also doubles as a pretty lamp with its white glass cover. It’s easy to set up and simple to use with the Habitat range of fragrance oils. I like Seaside Walk, with tangy coastal notes, alongside narcissi and coconut.App-operatedView image in fullscreenPerfume Genie ultrasonic diffuser£114.90 at RitualsView image in fullscreenRituals of Sakura cartridge, 30ml£42.90 at RitualsTaking home fragrance to the next level, this chic little ultrasonic diffuser combines a lavish gold metal finish with a simple, sculptural design. But its real USP is that it’s operated via a smartphone app, allowing you to activate it remotely, as well as with voice command controls. I confess it took me a while to set the whole thing up, but I can see the benefits of setting a programme to reflect when you typically use a room, across weekdays and weekends, or remotely activating a scent while on the way home with friends. This one is for someone who loves gadgets and takes home fragrance seriously.Big-tank diffuserView image in fullscreenLarge electric aroma ultrasonic diffuser£89.95 at MujiView image in fullscreenRelax essential oil gift set, 4 x 5ml£14.95 at MujiJapanese brand Muji is way ahead of the curve with home fragrance. It offers several types and sizes of diffuser, including this ultrasonic one, its largest. It was easy to use and can quickly fill a large room with fragrance. There is a pared-back aesthetic, it also functions as a lamp and can be used with the brand’s range of high-quality and affordable essential oils. That includes blends for sleep and study, as well as single-note oils that you can have fun mixing for yourself; I created my own energising blend of four parts mandarin, four parts bergamot and one part lavender.Waterless diffuserView image in fullscreenRechargeable electronic nebuliser£70 at the White CompanyThe White Company’s comprehensive range of diffusers includes this effective rechargeable waterless nebuliser that can be used to quickly fill a room with any of the brand’sfragrance oil blends, including the summeryAmalfi Lemon. I’m not the world’s greatest at following instructions so found many of the electronic versions – including this one – fiddly to set up. It was simple to use, though, as the control panel is straightforward.Travel diffuserView image in fullscreenWellbeing Pod mini waterless nebuliser diffuser£55 at Neom£55 at AmazonView image in fullscreenReal Luxury essential oil blend, 10ml£23 at Neom£23 at Marks & SpencerNeom makes some great electronic and reed diffusers, but I’ve singled out this dinky rechargeable travel nebuliser. It comes in various pretty pastel colours and black, and it is great for helping regular travellers set the mood wherever they are. I used it with Neom’s Real Luxury oil blend, which balances rich jasmine with touches of lavender and sandalwood.A different styleView image in fullscreenCeramic blue ombre electric aroma diffuser£45 at Oliver BonasWhen it comes to electric diffusers, the prevailing look seems to be pale and pared-back but, if you’re looking for something more maximalist, Oliver Bonas does some fun colourful ones. We didn’t love the accompanying fragrances we tried but any essential oil or fragrance oil can be used in its electric diffusers – just no perfumes or reed diffuser oils, as they may damage the diffuser.Just the oilView image in fullscreenEssential oil blends, 10ml£16 at Earl of EastIf you’ve already got your diffusion method sorted but want to stock up on essential oils – or want something to go with the Oliver Bonas diffuser above – Earl of East is hard to beat for interesting, unusual blends. These includeShinrin-Yoku, a peppery, woody scent with a bracing forest walk vibe, andOnsen, an invigorating blend of eucalyptus, peppermint and mandarin that’s great for clarity and focus when working from home.Getting the most out of your diffuserTo get a reed diffuser working quickly, dip in the reeds, swirl them around and then carefully flip them over so that they’re coated at both ends. Flip again every week or so, or whenever you want to boost the scent levels in your room.Keep reed diffusers away from direct sunlight and sources of heat, to stop the oil running out too quickly. Place them somewhere around chest height – such as on a shelf or mantelpiece – to get the fragrance moving around the room, and always place them far from the reach of children and pets.To increase the level of fragrance from your reed diffuser, you can add more reeds, but that will obviously make the oil run out sooner. Replacement reeds are widely available,such as these from Dunelm(10 for £1). Likewise, if a fragrance is too potent for a small room, you can reduce the number of reeds.As the oil runs low, the level of fragrance (or throw) will diminish, so keep them topped up if possible. If the oil lasts for ages, think about changing the reeds every six months or so. Don’t reuse reeds in different fragrance oils as this will ruin the aroma.You can pause a diffuser if needed by removing the reeds, placing in a plastic bag or container and putting the stopper back in the bottle.If you like a particular fragrance, but not its container, you can always replace it with something prettier: most glass and glazed pottery vessels will do the job, as long as they have a narrow neck. I like to use colourfulvintage glass chemist bottlesand antiquestoneware ink bottles, which are easy to pick up in junk shops or on websites such as Etsy. Stoneware ink bottles are particularly great if you need something sturdy; two of the more precarious oil bottles I tested were knocked over. If you’d prefer to use a bottle of your own, you can save money by buying refills from the start.Perhaps predictably, some of the more budget options can be on the weaker side for fragrance but, if you like the smell, you could always dot a couple around a room, or use them in a smaller room like a downstairs loo.If you’ve become nose-blind to diffusers in the past, try using a few different fragrances around the home. And don’t forget about overlooked spaces, such as bathrooms, where a fragrance can add a spa vibe, and hallways, where it can welcome you home.Explore more on these topicsHomesThe FilterFragranceInteriorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The show heralded his final scene with great portent (the screaming monkey!) but that doesn’t cover for his lack of things to do.37. Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong, s3)View image in fullscreenFrustrating … Gaitok the hotel security guard.Photograph: HBOHas there ever been a television character as constipated as Gaitok? The hotel security guard did little more than stare on paralysed instead of doing his job. What a frustrating man.36. Mark Mossbacher (Steve Zahn, s1)View image in fullscreenJust boring … Mark Mossbacher.Photograph: HBOWant to know how low stakes season one of The White Lotus was? One of the main characters was a fundamentally decent man, rather than a leering caricature of consumer culture. Boring! Next!35. Nicole Mossbacher (Connie Britton, s1)View image in fullscreenCheers … Nicole Mossbacher came across as a crayon sketch at times.Photograph: HBOMark’s wife did have a little more to do, but not much. As a CEO who struggles to let go of the stress of her everyday life when she arrives at the resort, she felt like a crayon sketch of future characters who’d be better defined.34. Piper Ratliff (Sarah Catherine Hook, s3)View image in fullscreenLeast memorable … Piper Ratliff.Photograph: HBOPiper, no! The least memorable of the Ratliff siblings (largely because she didn’t commit incest onscreen) Piper’s arc was a bit of a damp squib. She wanted to become a Buddhist, tried Buddhism, didn’t like it because of the lack of air conditioning, and then went home.33. Olivia Mossbacher (Sydney Sweeney, s1)View image in fullscreenSnarky teen … Olivia Mossbacher, left.Photograph: HBOA cross between Mook and Portia, Olivia was a snarky teen who didn’t meaningfully contribute to the wider story. Also, she was played by Sweeney, an actor capable of much more than this.32. Dominic Di Grasso (Michael Imperioli, s2)View image in fullscreenJust the one orgy …. Dominic Di Grasso.Photograph: HBOSeason two arrived as the Michael Imperioli Season of The White Lotus. After all, if White was going to hire an actor of this pedigree, he must have written something meaty for him. In the end, though, he got one orgy scene and then nothing else.31. Timothy Ratliff (Jason Isaacs, s3)View image in fullscreenFree holiday … Jason Isaacs as Timothy Ratliff.Photograph: HBOLet’s look at this positively. Isaacs got a free luxury holiday, $40,000 an episode and – after his mid-season full-frontal shot – a weird little press cycle about penises in return for basically being catatonic for several hours at a time. He’s had harder jobs, I’m sure.30. Albie Di Grasso (Adam DiMarco, s2)View image in fullscreenSensitive ... Albie on the cusp of embracing his sexuality.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOBy this point, The White Lotus has a clutch of favourite archetypes. Albie fell into the “sensitive young man on the cusp of embracing his sexuality” camp and, unfortunately, was the weakest of the lot.29. Valentina (Sabrina Impacciatore, s2)View image in fullscreenBad boss … Valentina in season two.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOAfter Armond , there was hope that the next member of White Lotus staff depicted onscreen would be given something of comparable juiciness. Instead, Valentina tutted at her employees and her main highlight was comparing Jennifer Coolidge to Peppa Pig.28. Cameron Sullivan (Theo James, s2)View image in fullscreenEntitled bro … Cameron Sullivan makes a call.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOAnother White Lotus go-to archetype is the obnoxious, entitled bro. Cameron hit all the marks he was required to but, compared with his analogues in other seasons, was unsatisfyingly obnoxious and entitled.27. Kitty Patton (Molly Shannon, s1)View image in fullscreenSurprisingly forgettable … Molly Shannon as Kitty Patton.Photograph: PRShannon is such an onscreen force that she’s reliably memorable in almost every role. However, her part in The White Lotus – as an annoying mother-in-law designed to torment Rachel – was one of the more forgettable characters of her season.26. Jaclyn Lemon (Michelle Monaghan, s3)View image in fullscreenLeast likable … Jaclyn Lemon.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOSeason three’s “blonde blob” (as nicknamed by White) – a trio of superficially nice but secretly mean women – were all much of a muchness. Jaclyn got plenty to do on the show (her disgust at being squirted with water pistols by local kids was a masterpiece) but she was the least likable out of the three.25. Kate Bohr (Leslie Bibb, s3)View image in fullscreenReaction time ... Kate Bohr’s main job seemed to be reacting to her friends.Photograph: HBOSimilarly, Kate had her moments – her pyjama-clad eagerness to get the blob’s Big Night Out wrapped up in time for bed was hilarious – butit still felt a little like her main job was to just react to her more interesting friends.24. Sritala Hollinger (Patravadi Mejudhon, s3)View image in fullscreenHotel co-owner … Sritala Hollinger.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOThe hotel co-owner in season three, Sritala drifted in and out of the action, but made her presence known whenever needed. That said, she’s only this far up thanks to the show’s decision to use that incredible clip of Mejudhon singing the traditional Thai song Lam Tad on a 1992 TV show as part of the plot.23. Mia (Beatrice Grannò, s2)View image in fullscreenWannabe singer … Mia is close friends with Lucia.Photograph: HBOFirst and foremost an accomplice to Lucia (who was a better character), Mia gets points for elevating her potentially thankless sex work plot with her desire to sing for a living.22. Paula (Brittany O’Grady, s1)View image in fullscreenSnarky sidekick … Paula was an integral part of season one.Photograph: HBOA character who started out as Olivia’s snarky sidekick, Paula ended up as a fairly integral part of season one. Her discovery that the hotel had been wrongly built on native land went a long way to underscore the show’s jaundiced view of western tourism.21. Rachel Patton (Alexandra Daddario, s1)View image in fullscreenSweet but ambitious … Rachel with her husband Shane.Photograph: HBORachel was a sweet and ambitious woman who had just got married to the world’s biggest jerk. Her slow burn realisation that the rest of her life was going to be awful forms a huge part of the first season.20. Lochlan Ratliff (Sam Nivola, s3)View image in fullscreenCloseup magic … Sam Nivola as Lochlan Ratliff.Photograph: Stefano Delia/HBOWhat a weird arc Lochlan had this year. He stared longingly at his brother while Saxon went into the bathroom to masturbate, then he masturbated his brother, then he was poisoned. Extra marks for his beautifully shot near-death scene. Extra extra points for seducing women via the medium of closeup magic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Laurie Duffy (Carrie Coon, s3)View image in fullscreenAble to articulate … Laurie Duffy.Photograph: HBOThe only distinguishable member of the blonde blob, on the basis that she was actually able to articulate her sadness rather than frantically gloss over it.18. Harper Spiller (Aubrey Plaza, s2)View image in fullscreenTotal conviction … Harper Spiller.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOFor a while it looked like all Plaza would get to do on The White Lotus was roll her eyes at her husband. But then her character slept with Theo James. Or maybe she didn’t. Has any actor managed to play both possibilities with such total conviction?17. Jack (Leo Woodall, s2)View image in fullscreenSeducer … Jack, a magnetically sexy Essex man.Photograph: HBOWoodall can neatly divide his life into the bit before The White Lotus and the bit afterwards. And this is all thanks to Jack, a secretive and magnetically sexy Essex man who seduced Portia, then his “uncle”, then the world.16. Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger, s3)View image in fullscreenA changed man? … Saxon Ratliff.Photograph: HBOCameron Sullivan walked so that Saxon Ratliff could run. Preening, obnoxious and obsessed with sex and smoothies, Saxon started the season as an unbearable bro. But thanks to a combination of drugs, incest and a Pema Chödrön book, he came out of it a changed man. A bit? Maybe?15. Greg/Gary (Jon Gries, s1 to s3)View image in fullscreenEver-present … the mysterious Greg/Gary.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOThe only character to appear in all three White Lotus seasons, Greg/Gary started out as Tanya’s meek and apparently terminally ill love interest, and ended as an all-powerful, obscenely wealthy villain with a weird sex thing. Will this be the last we see of him? Hopefully not.14. Bert Di Grasso (F Murray Abraham, s2)View image in fullscreenTrailblazer … Bert Di Grasso, right, with Dominic Di Grasso.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOOn paper, Bert didn’t have all that much to do during season two. But whatever he was given, he wrung every last drop out of it. Ruder and more sexually forward than most 80-year-olds, Bert blazed a trail through every scene.13. Ethan Spiller (Will Sharpe, s2)View image in fullscreenDoubt and paranoia … Ethan Spiller.Photograph: HBOHarper’s husband, Ethan spent his time on the show experiencing various levels of doubt and paranoia as he watched his wife and best friend flirt in front of him, which Sharpe portrayed with aplomb.12. Rick Hatchett (Walton Goggins, s3)View image in fullscreenKiller death scene … Rick Hatchett.Photograph: HBOAt times Rick felt as if he was shipped in from another, slightly more generic show. His hard-boiled quest for revenge at times felt a bit too straightforward for The White Lotus. However, it was rewarded with a killer death scene and an all-timer reaction meme. But we’ll get to that in a second.11. Daphne Sullivan (Meghann Fahy, s2)View image in fullscreenExtraordinary climax … Daphne Sullivan.Photograph: HBODaphne earns her high spot thanks to her storyline’s extraordinary climax. Ethan tells her that he thinks their spouses had sex. She responds with a mind-blowing silent 25-second reaction shot where wave after wave of emotions pass across her face, then probably has sex with Ethan in retaliation. A star-making performance.10. Frank (Sam Rockwell, s3)View image in fullscreenUncredited … Sam Rockwell as Frank.Photograph: PRAnyway, about that meme. Rockwell’s uncredited appearance was a breath of fresh air in an often turgid season. He drank. He did kung fu. He embarked on a berserk monologue about how he wished he was an Asian girl who could have sex with himself, while Rick boggled at him. Amazing.9. Shane Patton (Jake Lacy, s1)View image in fullscreenPetty and whingy … Shane Patton.Photograph: HBOIn a show full of entitled idiots, Shane Patton was by far the most entitled. A man so petty, whingy and obnoxious that he actually ended up murdering a hotel manager.8. Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood, s3)View image in fullscreenTriple threat … Chelsea was doomed from the start.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOPoor Chelsea. All season long she worried that bad things come in threes. Who knew that the third thing would be her being accidentally shot in the chest after watching her boyfriend kill his dad. The smart money is on Wood being this year’s Woodall, a breakout star with an enormous future ahead of her.7. Quinn Mossbacher (Fred Hechinger, s1)View image in fullscreenTranscending tourism … Quinn Mossbacher ended up staying in Hawaii.Photograph: HBOThe beating heart of season one. He was a sensitive, awkward boy whose family went to Hawaii and argued a lot. He ended up staying there, achieving the greatest honour that The White Lotus can award: transcending tourism and integrating with the local people.6. Belinda Lindsey (Natasha Rothwell, s1 and 3)View image in fullscreenRags to riches … Belinda Lindsey became a millionaire.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOIn season one she was a hotel worker whose heart was broken when a guest befriended her and then left her in the lurch. In season three she returned as half-guest-half-worker who befriended a member of staff and then left him in the lurch. Now she is a millionaire, so God knows who’ll she’ll leave in the lurch in season four.5. Lucia Greco (Simona Tabasco, s2)View image in fullscreenChecking in … Lucia Greco emerged a folk hero.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOA prostitute who electrified every scene she was in, Lucia ran riot through the corridors of the hotel, gleefully ripping off guests left and right as she went. In any other show she’d be a villain. But this is The White Lotus, and everyone is terrible, so she somehow emerged a folk hero.4. Quentin (Tom Hollander, s2)View image in fullscreenThe Quentin Show … sadly Tom Hollander’s role was killed off in season 2.Photograph: HBOHollander is uniformly great in everything. However, he was especially great in the second season of The White Lotus as Quentin, a mysterious British man with intangibly nefarious intent. In a way it’s sad that he died; The White Lotus could have quite happily become The Quentin Show and nobody would have minded.3. Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey, s3)View image in fullscreenBack for a fourth season? … Victoria Ratliff.Photograph: HBOPiper, no! Again! Letting Posey loose on a southern accent with dialogue that required her to massacre words like “Buddhism”, “guru” and “tsunami” was, in retrospect, a masterstroke. Officially Victoria is now broke. But if White can’t find a way to drag her back to a luxury hotel for season four, it’ll be a tragedy.2. Armond (Murray Bartlett, s1)View image in fullscreenWarm welcome … Armond had the best death in season one.Photograph: HBOArmond is the reason why we started talking about The White Lotus in the first place. The entire first season was structured and paced around his transition from pin-sharp hotel manager to gibbering, drug-addled lunatic. Armond also had the best death of the series – visibly defecating in a suitcase and then getting stabbed. He will be forever missed.1. Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge, s1 to s2)View image in fullscreenOne of the greats … the tour de force that was Tanya McQuoid.Photograph: HBOCould it be anyone else? In Coolidge’s hands, Tanya – rich and lost and self-absorbed – became one of the all-time great television characters. Her appearance in the first season gave the show a sad, sweet note. But in the second she was the centre of gravity, forcing the action to orbit around her whims. She was a great character, who had an amazing death. Thank God for Coolidge, thank God for Tanya and boo to everyone who tried to murder her.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of his major London show, he explains why he often paints over his work afterwardsCharlotte HigginsWed 9 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareThere’s a kerfuffle in the Camden Art Centre. Painter Richard Wright’s exhibition is opening soon and time is not on their side. Ten people are on the landing off which the galleries open. Huge, elaborate leaded glazed panels have just arrived, the metallic sections forming intricate geometric designs, and they need installing. It is a relatively new departure for Wright, teaming with artisans to work in glass. These panels need to be set precisely to hover just below the roof lanterns, so that light will flood through them and throw a dance of pattern and shape on the walls and floors.View image in fullscreenIllumination … Wright with his Turner Prize-winning work in 2009.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianWright – intense, immensely tall, rapidly and quietly spoken – lets me know by his wry air of forbearance that he wishes they would just do it, and then the rest of the show can go up. In the galleries to either side are books laid on tables, some of them partially drawn or painted over, “illuminated” as he says, borrowing the word used of medieval manuscripts. On the walls there are many drawings and paintings. Some are made by dipping an old-fashioned cartographer’s pen in size (a kind of adhesive) before burnishing the whole surface with gold leaf: the gold sticks to the marks made by the pen, and the rest is shaken away so that a shimmering, fugitive drawing remains. In the main, vaulted gallery, scaffolding climbs up one wall and four people are arrayed on it in perfect symmetry, two below, two above, painting black stars, diamonds, triangles and other shapes into a great design up its back wall. The painters are Wright’s daughter and brother and two longtime assistants. He himself has just clambered down to talk to me, his fingers dotted with disobedient black acrylic.Since 2009, when hewon the Turner prize, Wright has been chiefly known as the artist who makes incredibly labour-intensive wall paintings that are either painted over at the end of an exhibition or left to fade at their own pace. He has painted a ceiling at the Queen’s House in Greenwich, a grand stairwell at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh and a folly at Lismore Castle in Ireland. He has also, most remarkably, painted 47,000 stars on the ceiling of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, a response to the building’s architecture and its decorative motifs. Even allowing for the fact that he has assistants to help, I wonder how this extreme repetition must feel psychologically. “Yes, it is torture,” he says. “You ask yourself, ‘Why are you doing this?’ I suppose the answer would be, ‘Because it’s the only way that it can be done.’”View image in fullscreen‘It’s a way of feeling’ … Richard Wright with his stars painted on the Rijksmuseum ceiling, Amsterdam, in 2013.Photograph: Jerry Lampen/EPA/ShutterstockWright – who, until a fairly recent move to Norfolk, lived in Glasgow for many years – trained in Edinburgh in the late 1970s and early 80s. It was a weird time to be doing painting, and remained so for several decades: it was only about 10 years ago that painting stopped regularly being declared dead. “Being someone who’s pretty passionate about painting, it was hard,” he says. “Hard to be like, ‘Shit, I’m playing the banjo, but everyone else is playing the guitar.’” He moved to Amsterdam and spent several years making what he calls “pretty awful painting”. And then, in 1988 he stopped, abandoned painting altogether. “That sounds sort of dramatic,” he says. “I mean, it was obstacles of life, really: relationship breakdown, studio loss, things that happened that made it very difficult to continue. And also, I suppose I became disheartened; disheartened by painting one bad painting on top of another.”He decided to train as a sign writer. He also moved to Glasgow. Sign writing proved a turning point, a way of seeing everything differently. The kind of painting he had trained in was all about the artist’s touch. But sign painting meant using paint “in a deadpan way”. The idea was to deliver the paint “almost the way it looks in the tin. To put one thing on top of another, that’s it.” He stripped things back to basics. No more figuration. Painting became doing one thing – putting red paint on a canvas, say. In the early 1990s, in Glasgow, he also started wall painting. His scene back then included artists such asDouglas Gordon, and others who had come out of Glasgow School of Art’s environmental sculpture programme, who were thinking about their art as a specific response to places and contexts. He was finding a groove.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a way of feeling’ … Wright’s untitled stained glass work, 2022.Photograph: Keith Hunter/Courtesy of The Artist and The Modern Institute/ Toby Webster Ltd., GlasgowWright’s conversation is peppered with references to art history. He thinks and reads deeply. There was a period between 2008 and 2011 when he painted 1,000 circles, one a day.Paintingthe letter O had been a big part of his sign-writing training. There is a story in Vasari’s Lives of the Artists, that Wright talks about, in which the writer describes Giotto’s brilliance by way of his ability to draw a perfect circle. “This is enough and more than enough,” Giotto was supposed to have said. “I like the idea of it because it is a fact,” Wright says. “A circle is not a horse’s head or a hand or an eye, something of which you could say it was well done but Michelangelo’s was a bit better. All you can say is: this is a circle. It’s a perfect circle. I like the idea of the painting having a kind of factualness, of being somewhere between being a sign and a thing.”It is not just the fact of the circle, though, it is the fact of making the circle. “I don’t want to tell people how to live their lives,” he says, “but I do think everyone should start their day by doing a drawing.” But not everyone has the confidence, or the facility, I say, thinking guiltily of my drawing-free life. “But that’s sort of a misunderstanding what drawing is,” he counters. “All it is is looking.” He thinks, he says, of drawing as a kind of impulse, that might be as simple as your desire to move your pepperpot from one spot on the table to another. He tells a story that American artist John Baldessari told in an artwork. “He describes driving around in LA with his pencil rolling backwards and forwards on his dashboard. One day, he decided to take the pencil out of his car and sharpen it. And he knew that that had something to do with art. And I think that’s what I’m getting at. For some reason he needed to sharpen the pencil. It made the world feel close to him somehow. It made the world feel more complete.” I sharpened my pencils yesterday, I tell Wright. “And did it feel good?” he asks. I say that it did, but I intended to use them for writing, not drawing. Though I would love to be the person who drew every morning. “But it’s not that, is it?” he says. “It’s a way of feeling about things.”View image in fullscreen‘All it is is looking’ … Wright’s ceiling at Tottenham Court Road station.Photograph: GG Archard/Courtesy of The Artist, Gagosian and The Modern Institute/ Toby Webster Ltd., GlasgowTo try to make me understand, he tells me a story about where it all came from, his need to paint. “That’s where it started for me: when I saw aPiero della Francesca. And I wanted one. I wanted one like that – and I could go home and make one. I had the impulse and desire to feelthat thing.” I think, I tell him, that is why he is a painter and I am not: being moved by a Piero does not involve, for me, the desire to make one. “OK, that’s true, and I agree with you,” he says. “I suppose what I’m getting at is that when you say you’re moved by a Piero della Francesca, you are experiencing the joy of the material somehow being transformed, the surface of reality somehow dispersing. And that you’re somehow between heaven and Earth.” He laughs, perhaps to dispel the earnest intensity of the thought, but no, I am with him. We walk through to the large gallery where his colleagues are busy on the scaffold. He picks up a bottle of carbon black acrylic. His wall painting, he says, “is also a certain quantity of this. Probably not even this much. There’s enough paint in here for a lifetime of ideas.”Richard Wright is atCamden Art Centre, London, from 16 April until 22 JuneExplore more on these topicsRichard WrightArtTurner prizePaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now possibly less welcome.How so?You know the old thing about the problem with going anywhere is that you always take yourself?So true!Now you could say you also take your president.This is about Donald Trump?Everything is about Trump.But I thought the story was about tourists not going to America.Because they wouldbe interrogated by ICE (United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement), have their social media histories trawled through, in case they once– in a moment of naive youthful rebellion– admitted to believing in the climatecrisis, and would thenface immediatedeportation.True, inbound travel to the US is expected to take a hit this year. Flight bookings from Canada are well down …Hardly surprising…And bookings from Europe are also down.Britain and Germany have issued travel warningsto their citizens in the wake of some visitors’horrific experiences.But it’s also been reported thatUS tourists, too, are scaling back their overseas travel plans?Cirium, a company that analyses air travel, found that summer flight reservations from US cities to European destinations were down 12.6% compared with the same period last year.Could that be becauseTrump has trashed his own economy as well as the world’s, and people are worried they won’t have any money?Sure to be a factor, economic uncertainty is cited byVirgin Atlantic as the reason it is seeing a slowdownin travel from the US to the UK. It could also be because of how American tourists are being, or think they will be, received.Says who?The websiteBusiness Insiderinterviewed Americans about their experiences abroad. One couple on a ski trip to Canada had been given a hard time by a local woman. When they asked for advice on which run to take, they said: “She sent us down the most awful way, and we were like: ‘Do you think she did that on purpose?’”Yeah, you hit us with tariffs, we’ll send you down therubbish slopes!Business Insider also spoke to a woman from California who will be travelling to Germany but said: “I’m not bringing the usual pride that I have as an American.”I see.Essentially, the worry for US tourists is that if they are not experiencing outright anti-American sentiment and even anger, then they are at least having to dodge awkward conversations about politics.Rick Steves, a travel blogger, has adviceabout whether Americans are still welcome in Europe.Such as:“Maybe leave the red Make America Great Again (Maga) cap at home.” Steves says Americans are still welcome, “but be prepared for some interesting conversations”.Do say:“Actually, we’re Canadian. Honest …”Don’t say:“Usha, honey, I thought for our summer vacation this year we couldgo back to … Greenland.”Explore more on these topicsTravelPass notesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anisa is listening to the baby’s heartbeat with a stethoscope. After foreign aid cuts, including Trump’s, she is now out of a job’Interview byAmy FlemingWed 9 Apr 2025 10.09 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareMy home country, Japan, is one of the safest places in the world to give birth: it has one of the very lowest mortality rates in Asia. A few years ago I had the opportunity to work on a story about midwives in Japan, and I became very interested in their role. In November 2023 I travelled to Badakhshan province in the northeast ofAfghanistan, the country with the highest maternal mortality rate in Asia. I wanted to meet midwives there and see how they support women.The Badakhshan province is far from Kabul, with rugged terrain and poor transportation and medical infrastructure. In winter, heavy snowfall blocks roads for months.Womenwho are about to give birth are sometimes carried on donkeys escorted by family members or neighbours on multi-day trips to clinics. The literacy rate for women there is extremely low compared with other provinces – less than 10% – which is partly why there’s a serious shortage of midwives. This combination of geographic, social and cultural factors means there are often delays responding to emergencies, and deaths from complications like excessive bleeding or infection, which might otherwise have been preventable.Some women have 10 children and ask their midwife to help persuade their husbands to use birth controlThis picture was taken in a small village while I was following a mobile health team of six, organised by the United Nations Population Fund. The midwife, Anisa, was giving medical checkups to women who had recently delivered a baby at home. One of these mothers took us to another woman in the neighbourhood who was nine months pregnant but had never had a checkup. Anisa is listening to the baby’s heartbeat with a stethoscope in the picture, and telling the woman: “Your baby is growing well, and if you start having contractions, be sure to call me and I’ll come right away.” Ten days later, Anisa assisted the delivery at her home.After she finished a long day at work, I was in the same car with Anisa. She looked out the window at the narrow mountain road, and I saw a snowy peak in the distance, and said it must be so tough to travel from village to village every day, especially in winter. She replied that, even so, she would continue to do this work in an area where so many women have died – that being able to save a single life at birth is reward enough. I was really touched.Midwives like Anisa are saving pregnant women in many ways – not only helping them give birth but also acting as unofficial therapists. Afghan women are often isolated and disconnected from society, but with the midwives they can share personal problems they would never be able to otherwise, such as struggles with mothers-in-law, or their marriages. Women who have been pregnant for years – some have 10 children – ask their midwives to help persuade their husbands to use birth control. It’s not easy, but they do succeed sometimes.Take your pic!

In conservative rural areas, it was customary for women to be accompanied by male relatives when travelling, even before the Taliban regained power in 2021. Since then, this rule is followed more stringently. This makes it difficult for women to travel to distant clinics.After the Taliban took over, many international donors that had supported Afghanistan’s healthcare system withdrew, and hospitals and clinics have been forced to close amid concern that the maternal mortality rate will worsen. In December 2024, the Talibanbanned the midwifery schools, having already banned women’s wider education. While those who had already graduated could still work, women who had not completed their studies could not.Last month I found out that Anisa has not been able to work as a midwife since January. Since thewithdrawal of international donors and US aidafter Donald Trump’s suspension order to cut US foreign aid for 90 days, the mobile health team can no longer function. Anisa and her husband, who was a vaccinator on the mobile team, are both jobless for now.View image in fullscreenNoriko Hayashi’s CVBorn:Kanagawa, Japan 1983.Trained:Self-taughtInfluences:“My grandmother, who taught me the importance of being positive, and encouraged me to pursue what I am passionate about when I started photography”High point:“Now.

When I hear someone describe their house-sharing era as the “best time of my life”, I know they have had at least two years to forget their trauma. That is not a luxury afforded to me – I am living in my eighth house share with my 18th housemate, still holding on to past horrors like they happened yesterday and facing the anxiety they may happen again. So here they are: the 10 worst moments from my many house shares.Finding my housemate’s stash of ecstasy in my favourite mugIt was the first time my older sister had visited my house share and she had her six-month-old baby in tow. I was determined to show her that I was no longer a grubby student. I was a working adult and I lived like one.I covered our grimy table with a tablecloth and pulled the chairs that didn’t match around it. I would serve chicken pie with buttery mash and an array of vegetables.View image in fullscreenThe scene of the ill-fated dinner party.Photograph: Courtesy of Alice WilkinsonWhen she arrived, I went to make her a cup of tea in the nicest mug I owned – only to find a wrap of MDMA crystals inside. Furious with my housemates, I sent a photo to the group chat immediately. No words, just: “?!?” For a few hours, there was silence, then an apology. I had made my point. Then, with the type of passive aggression unique to house shares, I made sure it didn’t happen again by moving all my mugs to my bedroom.Realising that my housemate washed his clothes without any detergentThis particular house share had a few hygiene issues from the outset. An obscene amount of beard hair was being left in the sink and there were mice hanging out under the toaster. I had also noticed a persistent smell of damp, similar to the smell of rotting leaves. Then I watched my housemate stuff his clothes into the washing machine and switch it on. No powder, no tab, no liquid; no detergent of any sort. When questioned, he told me detergent was a waste of money. I insisted that he helped himself to mine, any time, all the time. I decided it was more cost-effective than continuing to buy heavily fragranced candles to mask the smell.Losing my temper with a housemate who had called me outIt was the tail end of the pandemic and I had just got a taste for nights out again, albeit socially distanced ones. Because of levels of nervousness in the house, my housemates and I made a pact to socialise outdoors only for a while once restrictions lifted, out of respect for each other. But then I went out, got carried away and broke the rule I had been instrumental in making by going inside a friend’s house.When my housemate raised it (because clearly I hadn’t been in a park until 2am), I was so cross that I yelled at the top of my lungs about all the things she had been doing to wind me up over the three years we had lived together. It was never the same after that. I learned a steep lesson in knowing when to accept, with grace, that I was wrong, as well as the importance of voicing concerns early, rather than waiting until tensions are running high to pull out a list of grievances.Asking my housemate’s boyfriend to pay rentView image in fullscreen‘I found my housemate’s boyfriend a lot less funny when I realised he was living with us rent-free.’Photograph: NoSystem Images/Getty Images (posed by models)From the day I moved into this house share, I clocked that my housemate’s boyfriend (let’s call him Dan) was around a lot. It was a sociable house and we would often have dinner together. He was quick-witted and funny. But after a month passed, I realised he was living here. Every. Single. Night. When you’re in a house share of four, paying an obscene amount of money for a room and a share of the shower, it’s hard to welcome someone who is not doing the same. I found him less and less funny.When Dan let himself in (with a key we didn’t know he had) to “drop some of his stuff off”, I decided to ask him to pay rent. It transpired he had nowhere else to live; he really had moved in full-time. Still, he didn’t want to contribute, but he vowed to stay with a friend a few nights a week. After that, we agreed as a house that partners should stay over no more than three nights a week.Cleaning up a stranger’s sick after a misjudged housewarmingWe were new housemates. I thought she and I would probably be friends soon – we just needed a bit of time. A housewarming! What a good idea to help us bond. I made punch and invited my friends, who turned up with clinking bags full of booze. Her friends arrived with bags of cocaine, which one of them appeared to be selling. Apparently, we had envisaged very different housewarmings.View image in fullscreen‘While my housemate was raving, I was mopping up her friend’s sick.’Photograph: Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty ImagesAfter a couple of awkward hours, her half of the party left the flat to attend a rave, bar a few stragglers – one of whom vomited all over the kitchen floor. While my housemate was out raving in a forest, I was on my hands and knees mopping up her friend’s sick. I vowed to make sure I met new friends in a neutral location before hosting anything in the house share in future.Discovering that a departing housemate had ransacked the cupboards and stolen every knifeShe had grown to hate me because she thought I was deliberately slamming doors to upset her. I had explained that they were just heavy fire doors, but by the time she decided to leave the relationship had soured. The morning she was moving out, I sent her a “good luck with everything” text from the safety of my office. When I got home, all the doors and drawers of the kitchen cupboards were open. The place had been ransacked and she had stolen all the cutlery, as well as the kitchen knives. I lived in fear of her coming back, so I asked the landlord to change the locks.I gave up renting in London to live nomadically – it’s dramatically enriched my life | Lydia SwinscoeRead moreBeing trapped in my room until my housemate had finished having sex in the loungeI have long thought that the success of a house share is closely linked to how well the space is set up for communal living, as well as privacy. This one, where the doors to our bedrooms bordered the lounge, was doomed from the off – especially for two women in their mid-20s who were casually dating.One night, I woke at 4am to scratching sounds against my wall. I lay there paralysed, trapped in my room. If I opened my door, I knew I would see them in the throes of passion. I stayed put and reached for my earplugs, too embarrassed to let them know I could hear every thrust and gasp.Hating myself for getting up at 6.30am to claim the kitchen tableView image in fullscreen‘We became as pathetic as holidaymakers laying out their towels on sunbeds.’Photograph: Courtesy of Alice WilkinsonLiving in a house share where all four people worked from home meant there was a daily fight over the communal workspaces. If you didn’t make it on to the kitchen table, you would be cooped up in your room. We became as pathetic as holidaymakers laying out their towels on sunbeds at the crack of dawn until, eventually, we saw sense and drew up a rota.Discovering that the person stealing from us was my friendThis one still lays heavy on my heart, because it was a sorry situation and I had very few of the life skills needed to deal with it. I was living with a friend and her boyfriend, who had become a friend, too. Money and alcohol had been going missing for months – sometimes even from our rooms – and the vibe in the house was fraught. When I caught my friend’s boyfriend in the act, I knew I had to tell her. In hindsight, I wish I had kept quiet. I may have solved the mystery of the gin thief, but getting involved cost me our friendship.Waking up to the horrified faces of my housemate’s elderly parents after a night outMy housemate was older than me, recently divorced and in a fragile place. I was still in my post-university partying era and I thought she was a bore. I can see now why she would be angry at the eight hungover bodies in her living room on a Sunday morning, especially when she was planning to host her parents, who had travelled a long way to see her, but at the time it felt as if she was being unreasonable. I left the house share at some point after this incident, moving into one where house parties took place monthly – and where my housemates stashed their MDMA in my favourite mugs.How to Stay Sane in a House Share by Alice Wilkinson is out now (DK Red, £14.99).

It’s taken diplomatic humiliation to cause real angerWed 9 Apr 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 08.58 EDTShareWhat does it take for the British government to express genuine outrage over the conduct of Israel? The extermination of tens of thousands of civilians, many of them children, did not cross that particular threshold. What Donald Trump flippantly summarised as “a civilisation has been wiped out in Gaza” did not qualify either: to be specific, the obliteration of almost all civilian infrastructure, such as homes, hospitals, schools, libraries, mosques and universities. Deliberatestarvation; repeated forced displacements; the butchery ofmedics,aid workers,journalists; overwhelming evidence of industrialisedtortureandsexual violence– none of this merited much more than our foreign secretary issuing a tweet or, at best,penning a letterto “urge” Israel’s government to do something he knows it will not do.So what has finally drivenDavid Lammyto direct real, righteous anger towards Israel – to describe its actions as “unacceptable, counterproductive and deeply concerning”? Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, being denied entry to Israel and deported.My objection is not to Yang and Mohamed, subjected to this diplomatic humiliation because they were en route to visit the illegally occupied West Bank, where a UN special rapporteurhas warnedof mass ethnic cleansing by Israel. It was their past criticisms of Israel’s violations of international law that led to their removal, after all. Israel’s authorities knew they would speak the truth about what they would witness, rather than regurgitate propaganda: the authorities claim Yang and Mohamed sought to “document Israeli security forces and spread anti-Israel hatred”. (But really, they needn’t worry: Starmer’s goonsblacklist Labour MPswho speak out about Israel’s crimes quicker than Lammy’s speechwriter can think up meaningless platitudes.)A shellshocked parliamentary Labour party decided that this time Israel needed to face the consequences: namely, a few dozen MPsposing in a photoshootalongside Yang and Mohamed, all staring down the barrel of a camera looking very stern indeed. Tel Aviv’s rulers haven’t quaked so much since Lammy last sent a disappointed missive on headed paper.The two deported MPs have every right to feel aggrieved. Yet it is not an attack on them to point out that they are now being showered with more heartfelt emotion by their insipid colleagues than has been offered up for all the Palestinian women, men and children slaughtered in 18 months of genocidal depravity.“This is no way to treat British parliamentarians,” cries Wes Streeting, the health secretary who was nearly unseated by the then 23-year-old British-Palestinian wunderkind Leanne Mohamad at the last election, not least because of his failure to take a stand against genocide. Streeting’s colleagues suffered embarrassment and inconvenience; asnew reportsunderline, Palestinian detainees held without charge and trial – including children – have been beaten with batons, subjected to electric shocks, denied access to medical care, sprayed with tear gas in cells, menaced by dogs, deprived of food and water, had their toenails removed, been dunked in chemicals, set on fire and sexually abused. In Westminster, there is not even a fraction of the uproar at this barbarism, but then the victims do not have the grand imprimatur of “British parliamentarians” – they are mere Palestinians.In truth, the unpleasant treatment of Yang and Mohamed could have been worth it if it achieved what thousands of Palestinian children being burned alive and crushed under rubble has not: forcing the UK government to cease its complicity in some of the worst crimes of our age. Alas, it will not.Remember thethree British aid workersslaughtered by the Israeli state in Gaza almost exactly a year ago? Don’t feel embarrassed if not, given how swiftly the World Central Kitchen attack was memory-holed by British politicians and media outlets alike. Six western aid workers and their Palestinian colleague set off in a convoy of vehiclesclearly markedwith huge WCK logos. They had coordinated their movements with the Israel Defense Forces on a pre-approved route. The Israeli army then methodically attacked the vehicles one by one in direct, targeted strikes, killing all seven aid workers. British politicians even let Israel get away with massacring our own citizens – do you really think the Israeli authorities are going to blink at whisking two backbenchers back to Heathrow Terminal 4?No amount of photoshoots featuring Labour MPs with hammed up indignation on their faces will erase the central fact. This government is helping to facilitate genocide. Under legal pressure, it has suspendedfewer than 9% of arms export licencesto Israel, and continues to sendcrucial components for F-35 jetsto rain death and destruction on Gaza’s traumatised survivors – something Mohamed hascommendably criticised. As research by Action on Armed Violence has uncovered,the Royal Air Forcehas conducted well over 500 surveillance flights above Gaza since December 2023, with no public explanation.Despite incontestable evidence of Israeli war crimes, the British government refuses to describe them as such – with Lammy’sfleeting objective descriptionof Israel’stotal siegeon Gaza as violating international law swiftly disowned and walked back. No action is therefore taken, whether imposing sanctions on the Israeli state or preventing British nationals from serving in its military. Indeed,a group of lawyers, including the distinguished barrister Michael Mansfield, has submitted a legal complaint to the Metropolitan police alleging war crimes and crimes against humanity against 10 such British people.Yang and Mohamed wanted to report the truth. Too manyLabourMPs, however, are affronted because they believe their collective status as Very Important People has been besmirched. That’s why these two wronged parliamentarians no doubt can’t walk around the House of Commons right now without their frowning colleagues plaintively asking: “Are you OK?”Israel isn’t actually being finally denounced as a rogue state, here. It’s being subjected to an impromptu rendition of our political masters’ favourite anthem – “Do youknowwho weare?” – before yet more F-35 components are dispatched toIsraelso that toddlers can be incinerated in their tents. And the thing is, politicians more offended by their wounded self-importance than by genocide think they’ll get away with it. It’s our job to make sure they don’t.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The noise is eating into my soulAdrian ChilesJust one antisocial fellow traveller can ruin a journey. Is it agiant two-fingered gesture to the rest of the world?Wed 9 Apr 2025 10.37 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 21.31 EDTShareSome time in the early years of the last decade, a friend and I travelled by train from London to Barcelona, where we would be covering a football match for work. We had a very nice day, playing Scrabble and drinking train wine as we sped south. The only problem was that a kid near us, not 10 years old, was watching a cartoon or playing a game on an iPad without the benefit of headphones. The sound wasn’t so much loud as persistent. Slowly but surely it drilled its way into our skulls and started to eat into our souls. I shot the family a couple of glances but got a look back which managed to communicate two things. Firstly that they were sorry. Secondly that if they took the iPad off the kid, we’d all be sorry. So, on he went. And an otherwise perfectly pleasurable journey started to drag.Then I had an idea. I got my headphones out of my bag, caught the mother’s eye, and handed them over. After a bit of faff they were connected to the iPad, the wretched noise ceased and I got a round of applause from men, women and children of many nations. I relate this story even though I never think it’s a good look to be the hero of your own anecdotes. My excuse is that the incident reminds me of how rare such behaviour was back then. Yes, people were known to yak away too loudly on their phones, but whoever they were talking at remained a stranger to us. And if anyone was watching or listening to something, they’d be using headphones. True, a bit of tinny noise would occasionally leak out, which was annoying, but that was about as bad as things got.What happened? What changed? Why do so many people on public transport or in public places now have the sound on their phones coming through the speakers instead of headphones? Do they think it’s acceptable or do they know it’s unacceptable and do it anyway? Is that the point? Last week I boarded a London bus, the No 70 in Ladbroke Grove. It was an afternoon as gentle and warm as you’re ever going to get in west London. But the noise was quite incredible, all of it generated by just one young woman with some very angry sounding music fighting its way out of her phone. We had a dozen or so fellow travellers, all of whom, like me, said nothing. This young woman stared straight ahead. We all looked down at our phones or the floor. I thought about trying my French train trick and offering her my headphones but concluded that neither my headphones nor I would survive this. It was so loud. If any of us had dared to say anything we would have had to shout to make ourselves heard, before – I sense – having to run for our lives.It got worse. Some bloke rang her and we all listened to a conversation, just as loud, about, as far as I could work out, some smelly clothes getting washed. This went on for so long that I found myself yearning for the return of the dreadful music.I was fascinated more than angered by this absurd performance. What’s it all about? Try as I might to find a charitable explanation, the only one I could come up with is that it was a giant two-fingered gesture to the whole world, wordlessly posing the question: “I know this is out of order, but what are you going to do to stop me?”I spent a couple of stops trying to work out how, in an utterly non-confrontational way, I could ask her what she was up to. But before I came up with anything she alighted. And for the time being I remain none the wiser. If you have an explanation of any kind, please do share it with me.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It underscores the judiciary’s commitment to the first amendment, and it suggests that standing up for one’s principles may not be just a gesture made in vain.Here’s what the US district court judge Trevor McFadden – a Trump appointee – had to say about the AP’s beingdenied accessto White House news events because of the organization’s editorial decision tocontinue using the termGulf of Mexico instead of Gulf of America:Donald Trump has transformed the American story | Osita NwanevuRead more“The Court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists – be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere, it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints. The Constitution requires no less.”The Trump administrationis appealing the ruling. It is not clear that a higher court will not overrule McFadden.But what is clear is that Julie Pace, the AP’s top editor, was right when she made the argument in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that more was at stake here than the name of a body of water. “It’s really about whether the government can control what you say,” Pace wrote.This administration wants to do that – and it is willing to punish those who don’t fall in line.Yet, courageous voices are out there. And sometimes, they make a difference.When Jaime Cook, the school principal in Sackets Harbor,New York, put out a heartfelt public statement about three students and their mother being abruptly taken to a Texas detention facility by federal agents, her words required the same kind of guts.“Our 3 students who were taken away by ICE were doing everything right,” Cook wrote. “They had declared themselves to immigration judges, attended court on their assigned dates, and were following the legal process. They are not criminals.”Others found their voices, too. In this tiny town of fewer than 1,400 people – which happens to be a vacation residence of the US “border czar”, Tom Homan – nearly 1,000 people came out to protest last weekend. This week, the mother and three children were on their way back home.Courage mattered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Too many lines had been crossed, he said; he had no choice.“The day after I resigned,” Crosswell testified, “my sister had her first daughter and I want my niece to know the same democracy that I’ve known. That’s worth any cost.”None of this is easy. After all, Trump and those around him are famously vindictive.

In so doing, they have the power to inspire the rest of us, which is likely to be important in the long run.Do brave words or principled resignations or expensive, possibly fruitless lawsuits really accomplish anything? Will they keep America’s teetering democracy from falling off a cliff?Maybe not. But everyone who cares about fairness, freedom and the rule of law ought to be grateful nonetheless for these demonstrations of integrity. Amid the darkness, they cast some faint light along our treacherous path.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionAssociated PressDonald TrumpUS press and publishingUS politicsUS immigrationNews agenciescommentShareReuse this content"

This is the real thingLarry ElliottThis battle between the US and China goes far beyond market turmoil – it has killed off the liberal dream of a borderless worldWed 9 Apr 2025 11.38 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 15.00 EDTShareDonald Trump’s decision to impose a125% tariffon Chinese imports into the US has raised stakes in the struggle between the world’s two biggest economies. If the markets have been spooked by the events of the past week then that’s hardly surprising.Over the past few decades, phoney trade wars have been commonplace. Rival nations have squared off against each other, indulged in a bit of sabre-rattling, but eventually agreed on a deal. Headlines that screamed “trade war looms” were quickly replaced by those that read “trade war averted”.This time it’s different. The battle between the US and China prompted by Trump’s tariffs is no pretend trade war. It is the real deal – and it will have real consequences. Tariffs operate as a tax, adding to the costs of doing business and raising prices for consumers. Growth will slow and inflation rates will rise. The global economy was already growing only slowly. As things stand, it is now heading for recession.Trump seems prepared for this, making it clear that he is ready for some short-term pain for what he thinks will be long-term gains: a revitalised US industrial base and higher exports. This also represents a shift in approach. In the past, US policymakers have tended to take fright at big falls on Wall Street and have eased policy to limit the damage.But only up to a point. The spread of the panic to the bond market seems to have forced something of a rethink. Hence the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause for all countries other than China. Perhaps this is Trump’sLiz Truss moment, where he has been forced into a partial U-turn by a sell-off in US assets. Important though they are, the market turmoil and the heightened risk of recession are only part of the story. Trade will continue despite Trump’s tariffs and China’s tit-for-tat response to them. Talk of the end of globalisation is exaggerated. Rather, the dawn of a new protectionist era represents the end of a particular model of globalisation, an imagined liberal nirvana in which all barriers – to movement of goods, people and money – would be dismantled.This hyper-liberalised dream world has been on its way out ever since the global financial crisis of 2008, and all that was needed was a final shove, which Trump has just administered. From now on, migration will be restricted, supply chains will be shorter, hands-on industrial strategies will be back in favour, trade barriers will be removed only slowly.To the extent that this marks a return to the sort of global economy that existed before the hyper-liberals took charge in the late 20th century, this will be no bad thing.Trump’s tariffs have also raised the temperature in the new cold war between Washington and Beijing. Briefly, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US was unrivalled as a superpower and it was during this period that hyper-liberalism held sway.Subsequently,Chinahas emerged as a rival to US hegemony and now poses a much bigger threat to continued American dominance than the Soviet Union ever did.China has gradually been growing in strength since the Deng Xiaoping reforms of the late 1970s, and throughout that period it has been consistently underestimated. It was assumed that China would for ever be a country that specialised in low-cost, high volume goods such as textiles.That proved wrong, as did the assumption that as China grew richer there would be unstoppable pressure for liberal democracy. For at least a decade, there have been predictions that China’s economy would collapse as a result of a bursting property bubble. That hasn’t happened yet either.Trump is fully aware that China poses both an economic and geopolitical threat to the US, and appears to see tariffs as the equivalent of the massive increase in military spending by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s that helped bring about the demise of the Soviet Union.The idea that a 125% tariff will make Xi Jinping blink first represents a huge gamble. China has been busy cultivating new markets for its exports in recent years and is already allowing its currency to slide in order to make its goods more competitive. It has immense financial firepower – and has made it clear that it is prepared to “fight to the end”.As Joe Biden discovered, the willingness of the American public to tolerate economic painis limited. Trump’s tariffs are a sign of weakness, not strength, a fear in Washington that the days of US imperial glory arecoming to an end. If that is the case, the US is going to need all the friends it can get, which makes Trump’s indiscriminate use of tariffs even more of a risk.All that said, Trump’s tariffs are a response to a policy vacuum that would once have been filled by parties of the left. The failings of the hyper-liberal model – slow growth, rising inequality, the hollowing out of manufacturing – have been evident since Bruce Springsteen sang his laments to lost rust belt communities in the early 1980s.The left has proved not just incapable but also unwilling to construct a social democratic response to these failings, preferring instead to fall back on the idea that the global free market was a force of nature that could not – and should not – be interfered with. If rightwing populism is on the march, then that’s because when the call for help came out from communities that felt abandoned, the left was nowhere to be found.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionTariffsChinaEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

The boast sounded better before the US whacked 40%-plus tariffs on countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia, the manufacturing source of many of the trainers and “athleisure” apparel in the shops.JD’s answer to the tariff question was a big dunno. “At this stage, the outcome of these developments is uncertain,” said the company, stating the bleedin’ obvious. Even its forecast that pre-tax profits this year will be between £878m to £982m came with the enormous qualification that it “excludes any potential impact from changes to tariffs”, which makes the prediction meaningless.But one can’t blame Schultz for such vagueness. Trying to model this stuff is genuinely pointless when US tariffs on China, for instance,can double in a day. In JD’s case, it isn’t sourcing most of its US products directly from overseas, but is buying from those who do – Nike, Adidas, New Balance and so on. On the safe assumption that Nike et al won’t volunteer to absorb 100% of the tariff impact in their profit margins, the first big question is how the arm-wrestle between manufacturer and retailer plays out. JD starts from the position of being the biggest on its side on the table; on the other hand, it is in a market where brands reign supreme.Then there is a huge unknown of what price increases US consumers will swallow, and what happens to consumer confidence along the way, including in the two-thirds of JD’s business that is not in the US. It may be at least six months, one suspects, before it is able to offer useful reports on the real-world effects. Even then, it may be hard to separate the tariff whack from other factors – the sports fashion world, for example, has been slowing for at least two years, especially in the UK.Yet another variable is the extent to which manufacturers with global supply chains can play the tariff rate card game of switching between locations. It is a fantasy to think many shoe and garment factories will migrate to the US but Turkey, with a baseline 10% tariff, may be an alternative to Asia.The multiple uncertainties are a downer for investors but one also understands why JD’s shares rose 10% on (another) big down for the FTSE 100 index. At 69p, JD – after a rocky few years ofprofit upsetsand heavy spending on logistics and IT systems – is rated at just six times earnings and is currently generating enough cash to afford a £100m share buy-back.In normal circumstances, you’d call that cheap. It isn’t cheap if a proper Trump-inspired deep global recession is on the cards – trainers are the ultimate deferrable purchase. But the bit we don’t know is how retailers and supply chains will adapt and automate. The pass-through effects of US tariffs probably won’t be straightforward.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsNils Pratley on financeJD Sports FashionInternational tradeDonald TrumpTariffsNikeRetail industrycommentShareReuse this content"

This is a terrifying illustration of Germany’s lurch to the rightWed 9 Apr 2025 05.35 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 09.05 EDTShareIn the first week of January, I received a letter from the Berlin Immigration Office, informing me that I had lost my right of freedom of movement inGermany, due to allegations around my involvement in the pro-Palestine movement. Since I’m a Polish citizen living in Berlin, I knew that deporting an EU national from another EU country is practically impossible. I contacted a lawyer and, given the lack of substantial legal reasoning behind the order, we filed a lawsuit against it, after which I didn’t think much of it.I later found out that three other people active in the Palestine movement in Berlin,Roberta Murray, Shane O’Brien and Cooper Longbottom, received the same letters. Murray and O’Brien are Irish nationals, Longbottom is American. We understood this as yet another intimidation tactic from the state, which has alsoviolently suppressed protestsand arrested activists, and expected a long and dreary but not at all urgent process of fighting our deportation orders.Then, at the beginning of March, each of our lawyers received on our behalf another letter, declaring that we are to be given until 21 April to voluntarily leave the countryor we will be forcibly removed.The letters cite charges arising from our involvement in protests against the ongoing genocide in Gaza. None of the charges have yet led to a court hearing, yet the deportation letters conclude that we are a threat to public order and national security. There has been no legal process for this decision, and none of us have a criminal record. The reasoning in the letters continues with vague and unfounded accusations of “antisemitism” and supporting “terrorist organisations” – referring to Hamas – as well as its supposed “front organisations in Germany and Europe”.Germany is now deporting pro-Palestine EU citizens. This is a chilling new step | Hanno HauensteinRead moreThis is not the first instance of Germany weaponising migration law.Since October 2023, the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has unlawfully frozen the processing of all asylum seekers from Gaza. And on 16 April 2025 a federal administrative court in Germanywill reportedly decide on a casethat could set a precedent for the German state to increase deportations of asylum seekers to Greece.These extreme measures are not a sudden shift or solely a fringe rightwing position. They are the result of a more than year-long campaign by the liberal Ampel coalition – the Social Democratic party (SPD), the Free Democratic party (FDP) and the Greens – and the German media, calling for mass deportations, widely seen as a response to the growing pro-Palestinian movement,and targeted predominantly at the Arab and Muslim German population.In November 2024, the deputy parliamentary leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), Beatrix von Storch, granddaughter of Hitler’s finance minister,took to the Bundestag podiumto applaud the passingof the resolutiontitled Never again is now: protecting, preserving and strengthening Jewish life in Germany, drafted by the Christian Democratic Union of Germany/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CDU/CSU), the SPD, the FDP and the Green party. She ecstatically claimed that the new antisemitism resolutiondraws its contentfrom her party’s position.The resolution, adopting the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)definition of antisemitism, identifies immigration from the Middle East and north Africa, and the “anti-imperialist left” as two of the main sources of antisemitism in Germany. Without new legislation, it directs the state and public institutions to maximally wield executive powers, resulting in a massive crackdown on all forms of pro-Palestinian speech and action. Among suggested methods are heavy scrutiny of all cultural and academic funding, screening of all candidates for university teaching positions, unprecedented expansion of disciplinary measures across universities and last, but not least, utilisation of migration law.Put in von Storch’s emphatic words, “to send Muslim antisemites back home aboard an aeroplane.Tschüss und nicht auf wiedersehen![Goodbye and never see you again!]”My deportation order, as well as those of two other EU citizens, openly cites Germany’s Staatsräson (the idea that Israel’s security is part of Germany’s reason of state, or reason for existence) as a basis for our deportation, saying: “It is in the considerable interest of society and the state that this Staatsräson is always brought to life and that at no time – neither at home nor abroad – do any doubts arise that opposing currents are even tolerated within the federal territory.” The Staatsräson, never a genuine attempt to atone for Germany’s past, has now become a way to justify the indefinite suspension of a rights-based order and the unrestrained exercise of executive power.Murray, O’Brien, Longbottom and Iwent public with our casesin order to fight this intimidation. Each of our lawyers has filed a lawsuit against our deportation, and we are now filing a motion of interim relief against the 21 April deadline. Since our deportation orders are a test to see how much more repression the state can get away with, it is hard to know what verdict we can expect.What we do know is thatit is not criminal, but an urgent responsibility to mobilise against the ongoing genocide and for a free Palestine. The plight of the Palestinian peopleshould be enough of a reason for us to stand with them in solidarity. I reject the idea that solidarity is based on fear of something similar happening to us one day.However grave of a precedent these actions set, we can not and will not let them distract us and implore others not to get discouraged. Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza escalates daily. The four of us from Berlin stand in unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian people and their fight for liberation.Kasia Wlaszczyk is a cultural worker based in BerlinThis article was amended on 9 April. An earlier version said that the court case scheduled for 16 April could set a precedent for the mass deportation of Palestinian refugees. However the case will also affect asylum seekers from places other than Palestine.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I have a theoryWed 9 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 12.30 EDTShareExcuse me for a moment while I clamber on top of my high horse to deliver an important public safety announcement:stop buying enormous cars!Please, for the love of God, pedestrians and my tiny chihuahua that is just trying to cross the road, stop this cycle of car-brained insanity.I write this from the US, where everything (including the presidential ego) is supersized and where going for a walk means having to constantly peer around one enormous truck to make sure you’re not going to get hit by another enormous truck. Still, at least in the US the big cars have big roads to drive down. The trend for bloated vehicles is spreading to places where they’re even more unsuitable. New research has found thatmore than 1m carsthat are too big to fit in parking spaces are being sold in the UK each year.It’s wrong to call these supersized vehicles sport utility vehicles (SUVs): a large proportion of them are not used for anything sportier than a supermarket run. Rather, we seem to have crossed over into emotional support vehicle (ESV) territory. A lot of the tanks I see on the road appear to serve no other purpose than making their owner feel better about their insecurities.Large car enthusiasts may protest that this isn’t true and bigger cars are the safer choice. And I can certainly see how it feels dangerous to be the smallest car on the road nowadays. But this obsession with ESVs is proving deadly. “For every life that the heaviest 1% of SUVs and trucks save, there are more than a dozen lives lost in other vehicles,” arecent analysisby the Economist found. The analysis also found that “the heaviest US vehicles are responsible for 37 deaths in the other car per 10,000 crashes compared with 5.7 for median-weight cars and 2.6 for the lightest cars”. Car bloat is part of the reason pedestrian deaths in the UShave been rising.Still, perhaps this problem is now in the rear-view mirror. Trump’s tariffs are about to make cars – along with everything else –even more expensive. It’s going to be hard to justify a giant car when dinner consists of one $30 egg. It would be a shame if it took an economic crash to trigger it, but there’s a tiny chance the US, forced to tighten its belt, may find itself falling back in love with smaller cars.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMotoringOpinionRoad safetyAutomotive industryUS politicsTariffsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But it sees a bigger, more promising story of US hegemonic declineWed 9 Apr 2025 14.11 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 14.17 EDTShareNo one, least of all consumers and workers, will win theferocious trade warthat Donald Trump has unleashed. This is “a game of who can bear more pain”, in the words ofone analyst. And because trade is at the heart of US ties with its biggest tariff target, China, the rest of the bilateral relationship is likely to deteriorate. That too is concerning.Yet China, despite theeconomic strugglesof recent years, may see a longer-term opportunity in the current crisis. Beijing’s response to the initial US tariff announcements was measured. Now it vows to “fight to the end” and has imposed an additional 50% tariff on US goods – taking the totalto 84%– in retaliation for tariffs that Mr Trump now says will hit 125%.Do not expect itto falter first. Concessions would likely be taken as a sign of weakness, encouraging the US to turn up the pressure. Xi Jinping is also a strongman who has dialled up nationalism as economic growth has slowed. Backing down would be humiliating, especially when the US vice-president, JD Vance, speaks dismissively of “Chinese peasants”.Beijing is already allowing the yuanto weaken, though a major devaluation is thought unlikely. And it has been preparing for this moment. The end of its demographic boom, Mr Xi’s vision for his nation, the impact of the pandemic, Mr Trump’s first term and the bipartisan US turn against China (for which Beijing itself deserves much of the blame) have all begun to reshape the economy. China has diversified agricultural imports and found new markets for its goods – though exports to the US still account forjust under 3% of its GDP. Last month, itannounced plansto “vigorously boost” domestic consumption, though previous action on that long-held ambition has not matched the rhetoric.Mr Trump’s abrupt announcement on Wednesday that he is suspending punitive tariffs on other countries for 90 days highlights an apparent underlying intention to make them distance themselves from China and stop them being used as a conduit for its goods. But if he goes ahead, high rates risk pushing them towards Beijing instead. Mr Trump’s erratic policy may also reflect growing anxieties about the impact of these tariffs, not least among his own supporters. China is confident that Mr Trump will come under growing pressure to rethink frombillionaire backers, ageing workers watching their retirement fundsdive,farmers, employeesfearing for their jobsand consumerscontemplating costlier iPhonesand groceries. A bilateral deal is not impossible.Beijing does not like what lies ahead. But in the longer term, it has more confidence in its trajectory. It looks back to the 2008 financial crisis, when it “saved the world” with its massive stimulus package, and looks ahead with new self-assurance after January’s AI “Sputnik moment” with itsDeepSeekplatform.Above all, Beijing believes that when this storm has passed, few will regard the US as a dependable economic or security guarantor, and China will appear a more predictable, if not more likable, partner. At February’s Munich security conference – where Mr Vance’s sneering attack on European allies made the headlines – China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi,pledgedthat China would be “a steadfast constructive force” and “factor of certainty in this multipolar system”. Some countries may feel forced to live with Beijing’s own trade and investment restrictions, and its use of economic coercion for political purposes. Others may simply drift from America’s orbit.This is a transformational moment in the global order.Chinaexpects to suffer. But it will not be entirely unhappy as it watches the US advance its own decline.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sixty years old this month, thePennine Wayis being celebrated in style, with guided walks and an exhibition at the Dales Countryside Museum in Wensleydale. In North Yorkshire, speeches and a singsong are planned to mark the April day, in 1965, when the village ofMalhamhosted the opening of Britain’s first national trail.The recognition is richly deserved. Stretching 268 miles from Derbyshire to the Scottish Borders, the establishment of the Pennine Way represented an epic political achievement as well as a new leisure option. Though the inhabitants of northern mill towns and mining communities had a voracious appetite for open spaces and beauty, local landowners were for decades reluctant to give it to them. The postwarcampaigningwork of the Lancashire journalist Tom Stephenson and the Ramblers’ Association opened up swaths of private moorland previously fenced off behind “No Trespassing” signs.The rest has been walking history. Tens of millions nowvisitthe 15 national trails of England and Wales annually. Stephenson’s route across the northern uplands has an intimidating reputation for austere splendour amid biting winds. But less challenging experiences are also available.The Thames Pathfrom the Cotswolds to London is a much milder, gentler affair, and constitutes the longest river walk in Europe.The desire to immerse oneself in such natural glory is often combined with more personal motives for leaving everyday life behind. Next month, thefilm versionof Raynor Winn’s 2018 bestseller,The Salt Path, will be released, starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs. In Winn’s memoir, she and her husband decide to set off on the 630-mile South Coast Path, which becomes a redemptive backdrop as hiking helps them to come to terms with sudden homelessness and serious illness. Other authors, such asSharon Blackie,David NichollsandRobert Macfarlane, have explored the spiritual dimensions to an activity that can concentrate the mind, removing the quotidian clutter which prevents it from thinking clearly.In the 21st century, long-distance walking is perhaps best seen as a form of secular pilgrimage, in which homage to our natural landscape is literally paid on the hoof. As in Chaucer’s time, the path can sometimes be a self-imposed endurance test, but will usually feature a generous number of hostelries along the way. For millions, the familiar acorn symbol marking a national trail route amounts to an invitation to some free soul therapy.Sixty years on, those northern pioneers would rightly take that as a win.Columnisingfor the Daily Herald in 1935, Stephenson envisioned the collective wellbeing his pet project could deliver: “None could walk that Pennine Way,” he wrote, “without being improved in mind and body, inspired and invigorated and filled with the desire to explore every corner of this lovely island.”From Cornwall to the North Downs, and the ruins of Hadrian’s Wall, an army of backpackers will prove him right this Easter.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Older recruits, ie career changers, are an outlier when it comes to the low number of male teachers in classrooms across England. At Now Teach, a charity helping people retrain as teachers,51% of our network is men, compared with 35% nationally.Over half our hires last September were men; nationally women made up 68% ofnew trainees. This gender imbalance is set to worsen – just 30% of currentnew startersare men, while Now Teach is at 50%. We have seen this pattern for several years.At an average age of 47, these converts bring decades of professional and lived experience. Men want to be teachers, but justtwo in fivemale applicants makes it on to a training course compared with nearly two-thirds of female applicants. Now Teach’s conversion rates are near parity. We believe that this shows the need for a dedicated support service to help men make a sustainable career change to the sector. We could hire nearly 1,000 male teachers by the end of this parliament if our state funding was restored.The Tory government cut our funding, but Labour has committed £450m torecruit 6,500teachers. We back a recruitment campaign and stand ready to scale our efforts to close the classroom gender gap.Lucy KellawayCo-founder, Now TeachBridget Phillipson is right that it’s important for boys to see men teaching, guiding and leading in classrooms. But she’s missed something crucial: childcare.Young children lack male role models. While just one in four teachers in schools are men, that number plummets in early years. We desperately need to see men supporting children during those crucial years from birth to five.Stereotypes and misconceptions about childcare careers have kept men largely absent from this sector. Any efforts to recruit more of them into education must therefore give equal focus to early years. Addressing this could unlock a previously untapped workforce and provide more positive role models for children at the most critical stage of their development.Brett WigdortzFounder, Teach First; CEO,TineyThe renewed call for more male teachers is but another iteration of the inflamed debate about masculinity, misleadingly called a crisis. This is not a crisis in masculinity, but a chronic stasis – the world is changing, but masculinity is not changing with it.Women have been entering areas of work traditionally reserved for men, while men remain resistant to the converse. This is not an expression of genetic proclivity, but of socially engendered roles and perhaps of the gender pay gap.We have a plethora of public male role models in most fields – industry, the arts, sports. What we lack are alternative models in the private sphere of invisible (and generally unpaid) domestic work and caring, or in primary schools. Masculinity is still defined largely in terms of public profile, competitive success and social status. Significantly, these qualities confer power over others.Misogyny is not the hatred of all women, but the fear, expressed as hatred, of non-compliant women who threaten the status quo. We do not need to reaffirm masculinity, we need to redefine it, blurring the destructive boundaries between the masculine and feminine.Sarah MulhollandGoldsithney, CornwallDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

But of course creativity is not simply a matter of training on the work of others. Innovative artists make decisions towards low-probability outcomes; imitation, meanwhile, seeks high-probability outcomes.Authors call for UK government to hold Meta accountable for copyright infringementRead moreAs things stand, generative AI models are imitation engines – and they do not celebrate their sources, they conceal them. Writers carry forward ideas and techniques, yes, but an immeasurable part of human creativity comes from the certain knowledge that we will one day die. AI does not have that gift. For all it consumes, it does not choose what to remember or believe or feel. Authors are as much up in arms about the extreme-capitalist assumption that we’re simply machines, regurgitating content, as we are about the systemic theft of our work. Human authors also tend to worry about the difference between inspiration and plagiarism. AI has not yet been programmed to care, and no one’s holding their breath on that count.Timothy X AtackBristolAndrew Vincent says creativity has always “trained” on the work of others. He is right. Reading widely helps my writing, and art influences art. But I’m not objecting to Meta using my work for AI training;I’m objecting to Meta having done so without permission or payment, for commercial gain and outside the scope of fair use. I buy the books I need to read, or borrow them from a proper library, so that the authors get their fair library payment and their intellectual property is respected. Meta has stolen far more books than any single author could read – around7 million. Please let’s consider properly the long-term consequences of allowing big, wealthy tech to flout legal protections and steal intellectual property from artists.Abie LongstaffChair of the Children’s Writers and Illustrators Group,Society of AuthorsDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

For Exhibit A, see Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s preposterous strike, a flash of lightning that helped to secure for PSG a deserved advantage heading into the second leg of this quarter-final.Exhibit B was a beauty, too, Désiré Doué cracking a rasping strike in off the woodwork after Morgan Rogers gave Villa a shock first-half lead. The killer goal, for both teams, came in stoppage time, Nuno Mendes making it 3-1. By the end it was 29 shots to seven and tempting to wonder quite how many full-backs Unai Emery would require to cage PSG’s ravenous front three of Kvaratskhelia, Ousmane Dembélé and Doué, the prodigious teenager. Frankly it is hard to envisage PSG not scoring at Villa Park.‘It’s not done yet’: Emery and Rogers defiant despite first-leg defeat at PSGRead moreAs the flag with which a few fans posed on the Pont d’Iéna, opposite the Eiffel Tower, several hours before kick-off declared, this was Emery in Paris and drama was a given. It is why the Prince of Wales was compelled to be here, with his eldest son in tow. “I want George to experience a night out away from home in a big European competition,” the royal Villa supporter said before kick-off.And they do not get much bigger than this. Villa’s first quarter-final on this stage since 1983, when they exited to Juventus, had the feel of a big-ticket event. It also represented their first monstrous away tie in the competition this season, a European behemoth in a fitting arena. The PSG ultras in the Auteuil stand unravelled a giant tifo of a flat cap perched on a skull, a nod to the Peaky Blinders as the players emerged. “By order of the Paris SG fans,” read a giant banner in the lower tier, though they seemingly ignored the television show is set in Small Heath, round the corner from Villa’s arch‑rivals Birmingham City.View image in fullscreenKhvicha Kvaratskhelia (right) celebrates on the turf with Achraf Hakimi (centre) and Ousmane Dembélé after his stunning strike for PSG.Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPAThe L’Équipe front-page headline Viser Juste (aim accurately) spoke to what promised to be an absorbing subplot. Could PSG find a way past Emiliano Martínez, persona non grata in these parts long beforetravelling to Paris in a capshowing off Argentina’s World Cup triumph against France and a rooster, the national symbol. Had Martínez strayed into coq of the walk territory? The thing with Martínez is he tends to back up his brashness, and the mind games and dark arts usually pay off. His first touch invariably was heavily jeered and the locals took great delight in his first kick smacking the advertising hoardings.From there PSG assumed control. Martínez made a superb save to thwart Dembélé and the goalkeeper then smothered when Achraf Hakimi made tracks towards the byline. Vitinha sent a shot over. Kvaratskhelia was too hot to handle and Villa shifted to a 5-4-1 out of possession to soak up pressure. PSG appeared comfortable so it was a shock when Villa seized the lead in the 35th minute. Until that point Villa had 23% of possession and their sole shot – from their captain, John McGinn – billowed into the stands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rashford spotted Youri Tielemans on the overlap and his ball across the six-yard box was converted by Rogers at the back post. Emery clenched both fists in celebration but kept his arms by his side.But the game quickly reverted to type. Martínez somehow prevented a Doué shot, via a post, from creeping over the line but what happened next was unstoppable. Doué was undeterred. The 19-year-old drove inside off the left flank, past Rogers, and promptly sent a blistering right-foot strike into the goal off the underside of the crossbar. Doué tested Martínez and spooned another effort over before half-time.PSG carried on where they left off. The only difference was now it was Axel Disasi, a half-time replacement for the cautioned Matty Cash, who had to live with PSG’s devastating attack. Kvaratskhelia quickly got to work, annihilating Disasi, once of Paris FC, four minutes into the second half. The Georgia forward surged at Disasi, darting infield before ripping in the opposite direction to send the Chelsea loanee stumbling. Kvaratskhelia still had work to do but made light of an awkward angle and blasted a vicious strike inside Martínez’s near post.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Now this stadium was bouncing. Emery turned to Marco Asensio, who entered to face his parent club, but it was one of those ahead of him in the pecking order who stole the show. Kvaratskhelia nutmegged McGinn and then released Doué, who burned down the left and found Hakimi infield. Martínez made a fine save down to his right. Eventually Mendes made it 3-1 in stoppage time, feinting to fool both Ezri Konsa and Martínez, before chopping inside and finishing in style.Fresh from clinching Ligue 1 for a fourth successive season, PSG have their eyes on a bigger prize, one which eluded Emery during his time here. On this evidence, it may not for much longer. “We want to make history in Paris,” Luis Enrique said.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Their captain, Raphinha, refused to admit as much, flashing a knowing smiling as he said so, but a second Champions League semi-final in a decade is virtually secure already after all three of their fantastic forward line scored en route to a 4-0 victory againstBorussia Dortmundat Montjuic. The last was taken by a 17-year-old who may already be considered the best player on the continent. And if he is not, perhaps it’s because a teammate is.After all, while Lamine Yamal completed a near-perfect Barcelona performance with a gorgeous 14th goal of the season, Pedri continues to glide across a different plane and Robert Lewandowski, 20 years Lamine’s senior, scored his 39th and 40th. At 37, the Pole is the Champions League’s second top-scorer; the man above him is Raphinha, who also scored here as Barcelona reached 144 goals this season and almost certainly the next round, and perhaps beyond. They will take some stopping, that’s for sure.PSG 3-1 Aston Villa: Champions League quarter-final, first leg – live reactionRead moreDortmund couldn’t do it. Paris-Saint Germain or Aston Villa should prove a sterner test than the German side, who only momentarily got close on a night that began withBarcelonain control and ended that way too. Lamine Yamal drew the first of five saves from Gregor Kobel and then bamboozled Ramy Bensebaini before bending past the post before Raphinha teed up Lewandowski. Six minutes in and it was already Barcelona’s third sight of goal. Dortmund were being asphyxiated, shown space beyond a daringly high back line but denied time or room to reach it.Pedri and Frenkie de Jong dominated. Fermín López impressed. Raphinha never stopped running, although his best move was more about subtlety than speed, disappearing behind the goal and reappearing again at the other post, almost catching Dortmund with a sneaky short corner. That didn’t come off, but the next set play did, giving Barcelona the lead.View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Lamine Yamal (left) celebrates with Raphinha after scoring the fourth goal.Photograph: Pedro Salado/Getty ImagesKarim Adeyemi caught Jules Koundé’s hair and from the clipped free-kick, Iñigo Martínez headed down. Pau Cubarsi, Barcelona’s other extraordinary 17-year-old, turned it goalwards. It was going in anyway but, sliding in, Raphinha got the final touch on the line – which led to a VAR wait. “I was worried: I said sorry to Pau,” he admitted but to his relief he wasn’t offside and his team had a lead that might have been doubled when Lamine Yamal failed to find him sprinting clear soon after.The game was shifting a little, though, Dortmund finding a way through that first wave to threaten. Koundé had to block Serhou Guirassy, who then had an extraordinary chance only to miss Carney Chukwuemeka’s pass entirely and fall over by the penalty spot. Already on the floor, Wojciech Szczesny watched in happy disbelief as the ball dropped into his hands.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The next time Dortmund broke, the referee Espen Eskas accidentally stopped them, but they kept flowing through. Twice Chukwuemeka had shots blocked, Szczesny saved from Jamie Gittens, and a fantastic ball from Adeyemi just evaded Guirassy.

Pedri spread another expertly weighted ball wide and what came next was like something from the volleyball court: three men, three touches, a flawless sequence. Up, across and down. Lamine Yamal’s perfect, almost gentle looping ball reached Raphinha at the far side of the net and the Brazilian provided the set. Leaping, virtually on the line, he headed back across, over and past the man protecting the net, and there was Lewandowski to finish the move.Dortmund were done – and the third followed fast if not immediately. By the time Fermín and Lamine Yamal set up Lewandowski, it was their fourth chance in as many minutes and Fermín had hit post and bar. Those came on 62min and 64min. Between them, Kobel denied Lewandowski. Now he could not, the ball squeezing under his body. It was another superb goal, a move that began inside Barcelona’s area, executed with speed and precision.There would be more, too, Raphinha sprinting free and bending into Lamine Yamal’s path. He controlled and guided in a toe-poke as if he was still on the playground and it was easy.

A venue and tournament that takes itself so seriously applies a heavy weight of expectation to competitors. This is totally phoney in a way, ridiculous in fact, but the Masters “thing” exists. Nobody feels that burden more acutely thanRory McIlroy, who on Thursday afternoon will begin his 11th attempt to march into the pantheon of golfing greats. Psychology matters in McIlroy’s quest to complete a career grand slam, not technical ability. It is the inches between McIlroy’s ears that are far more significant than 7,500 yards of picture-perfect golf course. Augusta’s great paradox is that beauty and splendour play such menacing tricks on the mind.The theory of now or never in relation to McIlroy and the Masters is a prevalent one. He landed in Georgia with two wins in the calendar year, in itself a first. The 35-year-oldwon at Pebble Beachand Sawgrasswhile playing considerably short of his best, proof not only of his outrageous talent level but maturity. In a non-tribal environment, the foot traffic following McIlroy’s every move over Tuesday and Wednesday this week has been quite the sight.Augusta National chair defends allowing Cabrera to return to MastersRead moreAn added layer to the McIlroy story is that so many peoplewanthim to reach his holy grail. Perhaps only when – and it is, for now, fair to say when – he gets there will McIlroy expand on the scale of his torment sincea painful capitulationin the Masters of 2011. The extent of veneration towards McIlroy in a Green Jacket promises to be as spectacular as the outpouring of emotion from the man himself. More broadly, this sport would benefit from McIlroy glory. It has waited long enough for it.More curious than the fact McIlroy has not prevailed at Augusta National since the trauma of 14 years ago is the fact he has not placed himself in pole position to do so. It would be genuinely intriguing to see how he reacts with, for example, a two-shot lead nine holes from home. The world No 2 rails against any suggestion the golfing gods owe him one. It was supposedly written in the stars that Greg Norman and Ernie Els would win the Masters. Neither ever did.The problem with golf is that there is precious little opportunity to damage your fellow competitors. Muhammad Ali could thump George Foreman. Roger Federer could batter serves past Rafael Nadal. McIlroy could play fantastically well at Augusta and still fall short, courtesy of an opponent he is not in direct combat with. Yet peak McIlroy still takes quite some stopping. His demeanour this week is of a man perfectly comfortable with what he can produce over 72 holes.View image in fullscreenLudvig Åberg was second on his Masters debut in 2024 and has won on the PGA Tour this year.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesThe draw may not favour the four-time major winner. His Thursday tee time is in the fourth-from-last group, meaning umpteen decent scores are likely to have been posted before he strikes a ball in anger. McIlroy has spoken before of the tricky feeling of playing catch-up here. The flipside is that he has scope to study the precise challenge of round one at Augusta National before entering the fray. The quick turnaround between late Thursday and early Friday offers opportunity to lay down markers. McIlroy would relish a fast start; he has not broken 70 in a first round of the Masters since 2018.Scottie Scheffler remains the man to beat. That much is patently obvious. The world No 1’s iron play is among the finest in the history of golf, a key strength at a course where approach shots have to be so precise. The record books suggest successfully defending a Masters is a troublesome project; only three golfers have achieved it. You could, though, whack Scheffler around the face with a wet kipper and receive next to no reaction. An uncluttered mind is one of his key attributes. The 28‑year‑old will pay no heed to the experiences of others. Going by his pre-tournament comments, hay fever may be the prime threat to him this week.Augusta provides a president-free oasis amid the Trump maelstromRead moreAmerican golfers hold all four majors, a matter the European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald will be keen to see change. McIlroy aside, there should be European faith in Shane Lowry, Robert MacIntyre and Ludvig Åberg.The Mastersafforded Joaquin Niemann a special invite; it would be no shock to see the Chilean respond with a title charge.Nine is the lucky number. Over the last 20 years, the champion has, on average, been playing in his ninth Masters. Notables in that group this time are Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Bryson DeChambeau. We are overdue a thrilling Masters Sunday. Tiger Woods and 2019 was the last occasion for genuine, jaw‑dropping excitement against the backdrop of azaleas. There has been no Masters playoff since 2017.0:50Rory McIlroy's four-year-old daughter Poppy sinks putt at Augusta – videoThere have, as ever, been pre‑tournament peculiarities. Fred Ridley called a Monday press conference for a grand announcement regarding a project involving Woods, without the five‑time Masters champion turning up himself. This had the effect of making Augusta National appear smaller than Woods. Cameron Smith, the former Open champion, sent drives down the practice range on Wednesday wearing a suit jacket.Ridley later reflected on the horrific impact of Hurricane Helene on the Augusta community before confirming an underground car park had been completed at this course between the tournaments of 2024 and 2025. A new player clubhouse will be fully operational by next year, offering facilities Ridley insisted will be “unlike anything in sport”.

LA28 will feature 22 more medal events than Paris 2024, while maintaining a total athlete quota of 10,500 across 31 sports.“These additions reflect our commitment to innovation and gender equality,” an IOC spokesperson said. “They offer thrilling new moments for athletes and fans alike.”‘It’s a privilege’: Boris van der Vorst, the man who saved Olympic boxingRead moreThe sprint swimming events bring pure speed to the Olympic pool, with the 50m backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly offering fast-paced races that are already staples at the world championships but have never featured on the Olympic stage. Track and field’s new 4x100m mixed relay adds to the growing lineup of mixed-gender events across the Games, while artistic gymnastics will feature its first mixed team competition – blending male and female routines into a single event.Several of the new and returning events will unfold in some of Los Angeles’ most prominent venues. Swimming will be held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, where 38,000 seats will make it the largest natatorium in Olympic history. Gymnastics will take place at Crypto.com Arena, home of the NBA’s Lakers, in downtownLos Angeles. Basketball will be played at the LA Clippers’ Intuit Dome, while track and field will remain at the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.Six new mixed events have been added, including those in golf, rowing (coastal beach sprint), table tennis and archery. Sport climbing will also see its boulder and lead disciplines split into separate medal events after previously being contested as a combined format.The LA Games have articulated a priority in gender equality. For the first time in Olympic history, the number of female athlete quota spots (5,655) will surpass male quota spots (5,543). The Games will also feature full parity in all team sports, withwomen’s soccer expanding to 16 teams– four more than the men’s tournament – and water polo adding two women’s teams to match the men’s 12.Boxing will also achieve full gender parity with the addition of a seventh women’s weight category, equalizing the number of men’s and women’s divisions. In 3x3 basketball, the number of teams per gender will expand from eight to 12.The IOC received 46 new event proposals from 24 of 31 international federations. The final program was shaped by guiding principles set in 2023, which emphasized global appeal, cost-efficiency, athlete focus and gender balance.Five sports proposed by the LA28 Organising Committee – baseball/softball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash – will return or debut in Los Angeles, contributing an additional 698 athlete quota places.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 2023 World Cup was the last time Stokes featured in an England white-ball team, his recent focus tied to the long form while dealing with various injuries.The Spin | In praise of cricket’s dibbly-dobbler: once a familiar sight, now an endangered speciesRead moreBrook, however, would welcome a Stokes comeback to the shorter forms should a packed itinerary allow for it. “With the schedule, he’s not going to be available all the time,” the 26-year-old said. “But he’s one of the best players in the world and we’d be stupid to turn a blind eye to him.”Jonny Bairstow, who has not played for England since the T20 World Cup last year, remains in contention too, according to Brook. “We’ve all seen that he can put the best bowlers in the world under pressure from their best balls and manipulate the field and score big runs. There’s no reason why he can’t get selected again.”Brook’s own schedule will surely require management, his appointment marking a break from the past. Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler, his most recent predecessors, were out of the Test picture during their periods in charge, unlike Brook.“Missing the odd series wouldn’t be a stupid thing,” the new captain said. He also voiced his excitement at a busy winter schedule: a white‑ball tour of New Zealand is followed by the Ashes, before a visit to Sri Lanka and India for bilateral commitments and the T20 World Cup. “It’s a lot of cricket, and I’m looking forward to all of it.”A brief tour of Ireland this September could be one from which to rest, but Brook did not want to rule himself out. “I might want to play, because it’s my first year, I might want to try to keep around the lads and keep them in high spirits.”If something has to give, it is franchise life for the time being. Brook pulled out of his £590,000 Indian Premier League deal with Delhi Capitals last month to focus on international cricket, leaving him at the mercy of the tournament’s new rules: withdrawals unrelated to injury or illness prompt a two-year ban.“That’s the rules, so if I do get banned, fair play,” Brook said. “I’m completely committed to playing cricket for England – if that means franchise takes a step back for a little while, so be it.”Asked if he could envisage any amount of money coming before playing for England, Brook replied: “Definitely not at the minute. I just want to play cricket for England, represent my country like I have done over the last few years and hopefully have a big impact on the side moving forward.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A three-match one-day international series against West Indies, Brook’s first assignment in charge, begins just four days later.“I’m going to be myself, as much as I possibly can be.

It is the most comprehensive, far-reaching and up-to-date analysis of the climate crisis, playing a key role in local and national decision making about agriculture, energy production, and land and water use.The next assessment is due by 2027. But now,Nasahas ended its contract with the consulting firm ICF International, which convened the USGCRP and coordinated the federal agencies that contribute to the quadrennial report.Trump takes aim at city and state climate laws in executive orderRead more“There’s really no coming back from this, and it means we are all less informed about climate impacts, and won’t have the most up-to-date information on risks and threats,” said one federal staffer who was engaged in USGCRP activities, and who requested anonymity to avoid retribution. “USGCRP helped me to leverage resources from other agencies for use in my own work. But without these networks, I’m left without a support system and the latest science on climate change.”The end of the contract,first reportedby Politico and confirmed by multiple sources to the Guardian, imperils the federal government’s climate research, say experts.“The firing of USGCRP staff guts the entire climate research and services ecosystem leaving teetering silos of climate teams, already reeling from federal cuts due to Doge,” the anonymous staffer said.Another federal worker with knowledge of the program, who was also granted anonymity, said the contract’s cancellation will mean “the Sixth National Climate Assessment is effectively destroyed.”USGCRP staff who hailed from the 15 federal agencies had all been told to abandon the body; its only remaining staff were from ICF and have now been fired, the second worker said. “Climate research as a whole will be hobbled because USGCRP’s interagency working groups are essential coordinating bodies across the entire government, including and beyond the 15 USGCRP member agencies.”The move came one day after the rightwing outlet the Daily Wirepublished an articleattacking ICF International saying the firm was “raking in millions to spread climate doom”. Since its publication, the second worker said they had had a “pit in their stomach”.The attack on the USGCRP and national climate assessment did not come as a surprise. In the Heritage Foundation’s far-right policy blueprint Project 2025,Russ Vought– now Trump’s head of the office and management and budget – called to end the USGCRP or fill it with pro-oil industry members.Since Trump’s second term began in January, the monthly meetings of delegates to the body from federal agencies have been cancelled, the anonymous worker said. “We were waiting for new principles to be sent from each agency, which never happened, so that could have been a sign in retrospect,” they added.Andrew Rosenberg, a former Noaa official who is now a fellow at the University of New Hampshire, called the end of the contract “very foolish” and “thoughtless”. National climate assessments provide an important synthesis of “science across fields” – and are not particularly expensive to produce because the authors are all volunteers, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Days earlier, 200 environmental, consumer advocacy and social justice groups hadurged top congressional Democratsto block attempts from big oil to gain legal immunity, the Guardian reported.Oil interests applauded the new move from the president. “Directing the Department of Justice to address this state overreach will help restore the rule of law and ensure activist-driven campaigns do not stand in the way of ensuring the nation has access to an affordable and reliable energy supply,” Ryan Meyers, the senior vice-president of top US fossil fuel lobby group American Petroleum Institute, said in astatement.But advocates say the order is an an anti-democratic attack on municipalities’ climate action, which serve acrucial rolein counterbalancing Trump’s anti-environmental agenda.“Make no mistake: this executive order isn’t about energy independence or economic security – it’s about ensuring billionaire polluters never have to face a jury of ordinary Americans,” said Cassidy DiPaola, the communications director of Make Polluters Pay, which backs the climate superfund laws. “The American people deserve better than a government that protects polluters’ profits over people’s lives.”Fossil fuel companiespoured $96minto Trump’s re-election campaign and affiliated political action committees, as he pledged to roll back environmental regulations and loosen regulations on the industry. This was slightlyless than the $1bnTrump requested from the sector in an infamous meeting at his Mar-a-Lago club last spring, but still constituted record levels of spending.Trumppledgedto attack climate lawsuits, which he has called “frivolous”, on the campaign trail. And during his first term, his administration filed influential briefs in the casessupportingthe oil companies.But environmental lawyers question the validity of the new executive order.Trump signs orders to allow coal-fired power plants to remain openRead more“This illegal and unconstitutional order panders to the biggest polluters on the planet and shows Trump’s utter hypocrisy on states’ rights,” said Jason Rylander, the legal director of the climate law institute at the conservation organization Center for Biological Diversity. “Trying to sic the justice department on state officials who are protecting their people from pollution will fail because the US attorney general has no power to declare state laws illegal.”In recent months, rightwing groups havelaunchedcampaignsattempting to shield oil companies from city and state climate accountability. Somehave tiesto Leonard Leo, who is known as a force behind the Federalist Society, which orchestrated the ultraconservative takeover of the American judiciary and helped select Trump’s supreme court justice picks.A truck parked outside a major fossil fuel conference last month in Houston warned that city and state policies and lawsuits “are threatening America’s pro-consumer energy dominance”, linking to anop-ed from a group with links to Leo. The new executive order echoes this sentiment, saying the litigation and laws “threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocracy and justiceDonald TrumpUS politicsFossil fuelsOil and gas companiesClimate crisisNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

It throws environmental protection to the wind, with little to offer future generations or communities fearful for the future of nature.“It would leave vulnerable species and irreplaceable habitats like chalk streams and ancient woodlands more exposed than ever to unsustainable development. Promises of nature recovery efforts in return are thin and uncertain.”The CEOs, from charities including the National Trust, the Wildlife Trusts, ButterflyConservationand the Woodland Trust, have proposed amendments to the bill in order to rebalance it towards nature.UK housebuilders ‘very bad’ at building houses, says wildlife charity CEORead moreThese include a guarantee for upfront environmental benefits – new habitats such as ponds or woodlands delivered at the point of construction – and prioritising avoiding harm to nature before resorting to mitigation. They also argue that the bill should require definite, measurable and significant benefits to nature, rather than just probable improvements.Beccy Speight, the RSPB chief executive, said: “We were promised legislation that would deliver a win-win for nature and economic growth, but by stripping out essential protections for nature this bill offers neither. Unamended, it will supercharge the decline of our most precious habitats and wildlife.”The government originally promised that the bill would be a “win-win”, delivering the homes and infrastructure the country needs as well as restoring nature. But the CEOs argue that it rides roughshod over environmental protections.Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “As it stands, the limited safeguards for nature in the planning and infrastructure bill merely undermine nature protection laws and threaten the constructive dialogue of the Wildlife Trusts and environmental groups with Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It could also significantly affect local communities with issues such as more sewage in rivers, greater flood risk and loss of valued local parks, woodlands, and river and wetland walks.The CEOs also say the legislation weakens EU-derived habitat regulations, which post-Brexit can be eroded without consequence. These laws were transferred to the UK statute book after the country left the EU, and still apply in Europe. The regulations protect species such as hazel dormice, otters and struggling bird and butterfly species.This week the governmentimplemented regulationsthat will protect beavers when planning decisions are being made, requiring developers to conduct surveys for beavers 12 months before any application if their development is near a watercourse, and, if they are found, to write a management plan to prove they will not disturb their habitat, block their dams or damage or alter watercourses.Some developers will have to plant more trees for beavers to eat and use for dams. The regulations follow the historicreleaseof beavers in Dorset in February.Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsPlanning policyThe National TrustWildlifeConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Those in support say the measure will be crucial to generating billions of dollars of climate finance a year to help poor countries cope with the impact of the climate crisis.But now the US appears to have joined China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and at least a dozen other statesin opposing the levyat the International Maritime Organization negotiations. A leaked document seen by the Guardian, which has not yet been verified by the US government, purports to threaten countries with “reciprocal measures” if they agree to any levy.The document appears to have been sent to governments at the talks to urge them to “reconsider any support for the GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions measures under consideration”.However, sources suggest the US is still present and taking part in the talks, which are scheduled to carry on until late afternoon on Friday.The leaked document alleges the levy would be “blatantly unfair” and “inconsistent” with current international law of the sea. It states: “The IMO’s effort to achieve absolute greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for international shipping, including net zero emissions by or around 2050, would unwisely promote the use of hypothetical, expensive, and unproven fuels at the expense of existing and proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets. These measures would impose substantial economic burdens on the sector and drive inflation globally.”The text continues: “A plain reading of these measures is that they are foremost, an effort to redistribute wealth under the guise of environmental protection. Accordingly, we must be clear: the United States rejects any and all efforts to impose economic measures against its ships based on GHG emissions or fuel choice.”According to sources, many countries have been bemused over the US being concerned about the impacts of the proposed levy – which would raise about $60bn (£47bn) a year, if fixed at $100 a tonne of carbon dioxide – while it is engaged in aglobal trade war, caused by Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on all countries except Russia and North Korea, which has alreadywiped trillions from the value of stock markets.Other participants said the IMO talks would continue, with signs that the voices of developing nations –which are concerned that rich countries have been “backsliding” on their commitmentsto tackle greenhouse gas emissions from shipping – were having an impact.Emma Fenton, the senior director for climate diplomacy atOpportunity Green, a campaigning organisation, said: “The IMO negotiations resumed as normal this morning, with countries focusing on reaching an ambitious outcome. If anything, a strong pricing mechanism could create stability and predictability in volatile markets. If the IMO fails to achieve an ambitious outcome this week, it’s because of the people in the room – not those trying to bully from the sidelines.”A levy on shipping, with the proceeds to help poor countries afflicted by climate breakdown, has beenunder discussion for several years, but progress has been stalled bydisagreement over the impacts on trade, and whether the proceeds should be re-invested in shipping. One rival proposal is for a system of carbon trading, which critics fear would prioritise short-term and harmful measures such as biofuel, rather than drive shipowners to re-engineer their fleets. The IMO has beenaccused of moving too slowly to reduce emissions from shipping, after taking more than a decade to agree to a roadmap on reaching net zero by 2050.The US did not deny authorship of the leaked document. A Department of State spokesperson said: “The US will not be engaging in negotiations at the IMO’s 83rd Marine Environment Protection Committee. Consistent with President Trump’s executive orders on international environmental agreements and on energy dominance, it is the administration’s policy to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements.”Explore more on these topicsShipping industryGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

There have long been calls for Gill’s works to be removed since his diaries revealed he had sexually abused his two eldest daughters.The BBC said it had taken advice before restoring the sculpture that adorns Broadcasting House, while visitors can now scan a QR code near the building to understand the dark background of the sculpture’s creator.BBC ‘deeply sorry’ for not protecting female employees from email abuse by ex-presenterRead moreGill’s statue was carved on-site for Broadcasting House in 1931 and 1932, underlining his status as one of the most prominent sculptors of the early 20th century. However, private diaries published several decades after his death in 1940 revealed his history of sexual abuse.As well as the abuse of his daughters, they also documented sexual activity with the family dog. His statues, particularly his Broadcasting House work, have become a focus of attention for the hard right, including Tommy Robinson and the conspiracy group QAnon.Broadcasting House is a Grade II* listed building, meaning it is of special interest. The cost of restoration and protective work was just over £500,000. “Broadcasting House is a building of historical and cultural significance and has been so for almost a century,” a BBC spokesperson said. “The sculpture of Ariel and Prospero – depicted as symbols of broadcasting – is an integral part of it.”They added: “The BBC in no way condones Gill’s abusive behaviour, but it draws a line between the actions of Gill and the status of these artworks. When the building was subject to serious criminal damage, on two occasions, there were no easy options for addressing the destruction caused.“Having sought expert advice and opinion, we repaired the facade in line with the building’s Grade II* status. Additionally, working with Historic England and Westminster city council, we have installed a protective screen in front of the sculpture to avoid future damage.”Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said his organisation had advised the BBC on the work. “We recognise that, since details of Gill’s abusive behaviours came to light in the late 1980s, he has understandably become a controversial character,” he said. “We welcome the BBC’s approach to repairing the sculpture and providing interpretation which explores this complex history.”Explore more on these topicsBBCEric GillStatuesnewsShareReuse this content"

She told MPs she had spoken to Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor who said “markets are functioning effectively and that our banking system is resilient”.Reeves said she would seek to negotiate a US trade deal when she headed to Washington later this month for the IMF meeting of global finance ministers.When asked if she would have to make future tax rises or spending cuts, Reeves added: “Economic stability, fiscal stability is the key underpinning for a strong and growing economy, and thats why we are, as a government, so committed to those fiscal rules.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsRachel ReevesKeir StarmerEuropean UnionEuropeBrexitInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The committee said there was currently a threat to such programming, which was vital to the UK’s identity, national conversation and talent development.Major streamers should commit to pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with British audiences in mind, the committee concluded. It said that ministers should force them if they fail to do so voluntarily.High-end dramas can still draw large audiences when made and broadcast on traditional TV channels. The first episode ofWolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, broadcast on the BBC at the end of last year, drew an audience of 4 million viewers in a few days.However, there is a growing affordability problem. Peter Kosminsky, Wolf Hall’s director, has revealed that filming for the series was nearly called off weeks before it was scheduled to start because of budget pressures. In the end, expensive external scenes were cut, meaning there were more “conversations in rooms” in their place.Jack Thorne, the writer of theglobal hit Adolescence, has questioned whether the Netflix show could have been made in the same way by the BBC because of the financial pressures it is facing after real-terms cuts to the licence fee.Others inside the TV industry claim the arrival of large streaming services has had a huge impact. They say that in their drive for subscriptions, they made hugely expensive shows – costing up to $10m (£8m) an episode – which has had an inflationary impact on the business of making television.View image in fullscreenThe BBC, ITV and Channel 4 have been unable to match the big production budgets of shows such as The Crown by streaming service Netflix.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/APAs a result, the traditional British broadcasters have increasingly had to find international partners to fund the shows they want to make. Such agreements have been harder to come by as streamers have reined in their funding, leaving a list of potential shows by theBBCand others in limbo.Elisabeth Murdoch is among those to have warned that the economic pressurescould lead Britain’s broadcasters to turn awayfrom issues that appeal mainly to a British audience, in favour of more saleable global money spinners. Even some producers of theITV hit Mr Bates vs the Post Officehave questioned whether it would be made in the current environment.MPs on the committee shared the concerns and backed radical action. “While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens,” said Caroline Dinenage, the Conservative chair of the committee.Kosminsky said it was “hugely welcome” that the committee had backed a levy on streamers’ revenue to support British broadcasters’ high-end television. “This is a brave thing to do in the current political climate and absolutely the right solution,” he said.“However, I do think it is important to stipulate that the fund created by this levy should only be available to productions which are either commissioned or co-commissioned by a public service broadcaster. As far as I can see, this isn’t made clear in the report and it is an essential aspect of the 5% levy solution to the problems our industry faces.”A Netflix spokesperson said: “The UK is Netflix’s biggest production hub outside of North America – and we want it to stay that way. But in an increasingly competitive global market, it’s key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk-taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.”The select committee also warned that the government’s current plans to regulate the training of AI models on copyrighted material – a so-called“opt out” system– risked damaging the UK’s reputation for strong copyright laws.Explore more on these topicsTV streamingTelevisionDramaBBCITVChannel 4NetflixShareReuse this content"

Hamas does not and never has posed a threat to Britain, despite the latter’s ongoing complicity in the genocide of our people.”The Home Office said it did not comment on proscription matters.Hamas’s military wing, Hamas IDQ, was proscribed by the UK in 2001. In 2021, its political wing which runs Gaza, was also proscribed, with the UK government describing the distinction between the two wings as “artificial” and labelling Hamas “a complex but single terrorist organisation”.If an organisation is proscribed as a terrorist organisation it is a criminal offence to, among other things, belong to it, show or express support for it, and wear clothing or carry or display articles in public which would arouse reasonable suspicion that the individual is a member or supporter of it.In a document provided to Drop Site summarising its legal arguments, Hamas’s legal team reportedly said it represented the group pro bono because it would be illegal to accept payment. It quotes the lawyers as saying: “Hamas does not deny that its actions fall within the wide definition of ‘terrorism’ under the Terrorism Act 2000. Instead, it notes that the definition also covers all groups and organisations around the world that use violence to achieve political objectives, including the Israeli armed forces, the Ukrainian army and indeed the British armed forces.”Terrorism is defined in the act as the use of or threat of action, including serious violence against a person or damage to property, where it is “designed to influence the government or an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and must be undertaken for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause”.Hamas is represented by Riverway Law. The lawyers state: “Rather than allow freedom of speech, police have embarked on a campaign of political intimidation and persecution of journalists, academics, peace activists and students over their perceived support for Hamas. People in Britain must be free to speak about Hamas and its struggle to restore to the Palestinian people the right to self-determination.”They argue proscription is contrary to Britain’s obligations under international law to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity, and endIsrael’s illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories. It says Hamas is the “only effective military force resisting” such acts.Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “Hamas is an evil Iranian-backed terrorist organisation, which kidnaps, tortures and murders people, including British nationals. They pose an ongoing threat to our security and to the peace and stability of the Middle East and they have weapons and training facilities that put lives at risk and threaten our interests. They show no respect for human rights, life and dignity and have oppressed people living in Gaza for too long.”Explore more on these topicsHamasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelCounter-terrorism policyIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Before and after the change of government, unions have been urging the department to take more action.The letter,first reported by the Guardianin November 2023, included claims that women had been propositioned, groped and touched repeatedly by male colleagues in a workplace culture the civil servants said was “hostile to women as equal and respected partners”.Since then, more women have come forward to Prospect and other unions, including one MoD civil servant who told of being subjected to three separate incidents of sexual assault by male colleagues.Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of Prospect, said:“More than a year has passed since a series of disturbing revelations about the extent of sexual harassment in the MoD and wider defence sector, and women do not feel that anything has changed. In fact, in a number of respects things have worsened.“Nothing less than a wholescale, top-down culture change will make this a sector that women feel safe working in. Our view is that an independent, solutions-focused inquiry is the best way to deliver the shock the industry needs to change.“The international situation has not been this perilous in a generation. We need the best people working in defence and we need to get the best out of them.“That is not going to happen if 50% of the population are being made to feel ill at ease due to the culture of misogyny and harassment.”The Prospect data found that 57% of respondents were not aware of any action having been taken in the past 12 months to raise awareness of the harms of sexual harassment at work, and 46% of workers surveyed said their employer had taken no action to tackle sexual harassment in the past year.Confidence in the effectiveness of action taken to deter sexual harassment fell from 47% in January 2024 to 39% in February 2025. The fall is sharpest at the MoD arm’s-length bodies, where confidence has fallen from 46% in 2024 to 29% in 2025.Confidence in reporting incidents of sexual harassment fell in all organisations. In 2024, 65% of respondents felt confident to report an incident of sexual harassment, which dropped to 58% in 2025. In the MoD, confidence fell from 63% to 55%, in MoD arm’s-length bodies from 61% to 56%, and in the private sector from 72% to 67%.A majority of respondents still viewed behaviours in the defence sector as toxic and inappropriate, but this was down from 65% in 2024 to 58% in 2025.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

found guilty of breaching UK sanctionsDmitry Ovsiannikov transferred funds to UK bank account while brother also convictedPA MediaWed 9 Apr 2025 17.02 EDTFirst published on Wed 9 Apr 2025 15.46 EDTShareA former Russian government minister who was appointed as a governor in illegally annexed Crimea by Vladimir Putin has been found guilty of circumventing sanctions, in the first case of its kind.Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, the former governor of Sevastopol, was accused of deliberately avoiding sanctions by opening a Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) account and having tens of thousands of pounds transferred to it by his wife, Ekaterina Ovsiannikova.He was found guilty at Southwark crown court on Wednesday of six out of seven counts of circumventing sanctions between February 2023 and January 2024.The jury failed to reach a verdict on the final charge.The 48-year-old, wearing a navy suit, did not visibly react as the verdicts were read out.His brother, Alexei Owsjanikow, 47, was convicted of two counts of circumventing sanctions by paying school fees of £41,027 for his sibling’s children.The case is the first prosecution in the UK regarding a breach of sanctions under the Russian Regulations 2019, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.Under the original asset freeze, Ovsiannikov – who also served as the Russian Federation’s deputy minister for industry and trade before he was dismissed and expelled from the ruling United Russia party in 2020 – was not even allowed to buy groceries.His wife was cleared of four counts of circumventing sanctions by assisting with payments totalling £76,000 to her husband in February 2023.His brother was cleared of a further three counts of breaching sanctions, namely by buying a Mercedes-Benz worth £54,500 and arranging car insurance for Ovsiannikov, and by making a Barclays bank account available to him.During the trial, it was largely accepted that the defendants engaged in the relevant activities, but their lawyers denied this amounted to the charges.They claimed their clients either did not know Ovsiannikov was a designated person or were unaware he was barred from receiving the financial help.All three defendants, who had denied the charges, are Russian nationals and hold Russian passports, while Ovsiannikov and Owsjanikow also hold British passports by virtue of their Bradford-born father.Ovsiannikov was also convicted of possessing and using criminal property.The trial heard that in a “high-profile political appointment”, Putin appointed Ovsiannikov as the governor of Sevastopol in Crimea on 28 July 2016,two years after Russia illegally annexed the region from Ukraine.Prosecutor Paul Jarvis KC said it placed Ovsiannikov “in charge of a strategically significant city so far as the Russian annexation of Crimea was concerned”, meaning he was an “important political figure within the Russian Federation”.Ovsiannikov was elected as governor of Sevastopol in an election organised by Russia in September 2017.View image in fullscreenOvsiannikov briefly served as governor of Sevastopol, in Crimea.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesOn 21 November 2017, the EU made Ovsiannikov a designated person under its sanctions legislation, saying that his work had compromised or threatened the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.This restricted him from entering or accessing funds in member states.At the time, this meant he was also a designated person in the UK as the country was still in the EU.Ovsiannikov resigned as the governor of Sevastopol on 11 July 2019 and returned to work as the Russian deputy minister for industry and trade.On 4 August 2022, Ovsiannikov made an online application from Turkey for a UK passport, having travelled from Russia to Turkey three days earlier, the court heard.His wife was granted entry clearance for the UK on 7 August 2022 on the basis she was the parent of a child studying there.Jurors were told she first entered the UK on 13 August 2022 with her two youngest children.The court of justice of the European Union ordered that Ovsiannikov’s designation should be annulled on 26 October 2022, but that did not happen for some months.However, Ovsiannikov remained subject to sanctions in the UK by virtue of being a designated person under the Russia Regulations.On 27 January 2023, Ovsiannikov was issued with a British passport and he arrived in the UK on 1 February 2023 – five days before his name was formally removed from the EU sanctions list.The trial heard that on 7 February 2023, he had emailed the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office requesting the revocation of his designation under UK law.The prosecution said this was a “significant moment” as he “would not have applied to cancel his UK designation unless he knew that he was designated under UK law”.On 24 February 2023, HBOS froze Ovsiannikov’s account after they discovered that he was on the UK sanctions list.Jarvis told jurors there was “ample evidence” to show Ovsiannikov was aware of his status as a designated person from the moment of his arrival in the UK.In a statement after the verdicts, Julius Capon, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “The sanctions regime was introduced against key individuals to encourage Russia to cease military action because it was hoped those with power will be hampered in their normal international business dealings.“Dmitrii Ovsiannikov was a high-profile official who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin as the governor of Sevastopol after Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia.“He knew he had been on the UK sanctions list since 2017 but chose to ignore this.“Another member of his family sought deliberately to breach the sanctions to live their own lavish lifestyle and showed complete disregard for the law.“We hope this sends a clear message that the CPS and NCA (National Crime Agency) investigators will work closely together to seek the convictions of sanction busters.”The CPS will start criminal proceedings in order “to get back illegally obtained cash and assets”, they added.Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said: “Mr Ovsiannikov thought he could hide from our sanctions. Today’s verdict proves otherwise.“We are resolutely committed to increasing pressure on Putin, his cronies, and all those who aid his barbaric war in Ukraine.“When this government came to office, we made clear we were committed to making sure sanctions were used most effectively – and crucially, robustly enforced.“We have been working tirelessly with colleagues across government to ensure our sanctions enforcement regime is both effective and efficient, and to give the right tools to our law enforcement agencies to be able to take robust action when necessary.”Graeme Biggar, director general of the NCA, said: “These convictions demonstrate not only that designated individuals are on our radar, but so are those who enable breaches of the regulations.”Ovsiannikov and Owsjanikow will be sentenced at the same court at a later date.Explore more on these topicsRussianewsShareReuse this content"

None of the parties in the case can be named.The mother is appealing a decision by the recorder Christopher Sharp KC in March in which he said the status quo with respect to the daughter’s contact with her father should remain, despite a recommendation by the daughter’s court-appointed guardian to reduce contact by ceasing overnight stays.The mother initially sought an order for a stay on contact or supervised contact with the father but then accepted the guardian’s recommendations. She said in submissions: “Despite such serious findings, contact was ordered to commence between [the daughter] and F [father] without a full risk assessment … The approach in this case has been nothing short of alarming.“A [sexual abuse] victim ordered to promote contact with her [abuser]. At no stage has there been any consideration, nor any regard given to the impact of the profound sexual violence and abuse that I have suffered. Nor has there been any assessment as to whether F even accepts the findings, which is required.”She said that the father manipulates her daughter to be mean about her and “exert control over me and cause me distress”, adding that a cross-allegation of “hostility” against her was victim-blaming “for struggling to promote my [sexual abuser]”.Sharp also presided over the 2021 fact-finding judgment, but Proudman told Wednesday’s hearing there had been a “lack of engagement with any of the findings in 2021, which were of course very serious”. She said the father’s behaviour was criminal, “reprehensible and horrific” and added: “The approach in this case has been nothing short of alarming.”The court heard that the mother had, at a hearing before a district judge in September last year, agreed to her eight-year-old daughter staying overnight with the father. She said she was “coerced” into that contact agreement but Carl Geary, for the father, told the family division of the high court in London it was “freely agreed” by the mother who then made an application to vary it and made fresh allegations against his client.He told the court the father accepted the 2021 findings but said in written submissions: “F’s position is that the decision was consistent with [the daughter’s] welfare being the paramount consideration under section one of the Children Act 1989.“M [mother] now seeks to depart from a position she previously agreed to, without identifying any material change in circumstances or new evidence of risk as between the time of her agreement and the imposition of the varied contact arrangements. It is F’s case that the court made a careful, case-specific assessment of harm and benefit.”Mr Justice Peel said he expects to give judgment in the next few days.Explore more on these topicsLawnewsShareReuse this content"

It came up with a “bespoke process” for him, which he believed had singled him out for “different, unjustified and inferior treatment”.In closing submissions at the end of the two-day appeal, the duke’s barrister, Shaheed Fatima KC, told three appeal court judges: “One must not forget the human dimension to this case. There is a person sitting behind me whose safety, whose security and whose life is at stake.“There is a person sitting behind me who is being told he is getting a special, bespoke process when he knows and has experienced a process that is manifestly inferior in every respect.“His presence here and throughout this appeal is a potent illustration, were one needed, of how much this appeal means to him and his family.”Prince Harry accused of bullying ‘at scale’ by chair of charity he foundedRead moreThe Home Office, defending the appeal, has said Harry’s “bespoke” security arrangements are designed to accommodate his “unique set of circumstances”.Sir James Eadie KC, for the Home Office, said Ravec’s decision for a “bespoke” arrangement, whereby the royal’s security would be decided on a case-by-case basis, was seen to have “positive advantages” as a flexible, tailored approach better suited to the duke’s circumstances.It was “hard to imagine”, Eadie said, someone more experienced than the then Ravec chair Sir Richard Mottram, a senior civil servant with experience overseeing national security, to make a decision to accommodate “the unique and unusual circumstances of the appellant [Harry]”.Although no assessment by the risk management board was conducted in Harry’s case, Eadie argued Ravec’s terms of reference were not intended as “hard-edged rules”. He said: “Ravec is able to draw upon expertise and is itself expert and experienced in a thoroughly important way.”Judges have been told Harry’s case is not that he should be automatically entitled to the same protection he was given as a working royal, but that “he should be considered under the terms of reference and subject to the same process as any other individual being considered for protective security by Ravec, unless there is a cogent reason to the contrary”.A high court judgeruled last yearthat Ravec’s decision, taken in early 2020 after Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped down as senior working royals, was lawful. Harry’s legal team argue the judge erred in his judgment.Parts of Wednesday’s hearing were held in private owing to security concerns. Shortly after proceedings were paused to allow the room to be cleared, a member of the public shouted her support for the duke and said: “If you’re members of the press, you’re the reason he’s no longer in England.”The judges, Sir Geoffrey Vos, Lord Justice Bean and Lord Justice Edis, will give their decision at a later date.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarrynewsShareReuse this content"

He was found guilty of murder by a majority of 10 to two jurors on Wednesday.Thibou was also convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to 20-year-old Adjei Isaac with intent, which the prosecutor Ed Brown KC described as an “equally horrifying attack”, as well as having an offensive weapon.Shakeil Thibou.Photograph: Metropolitan policeThe man’s brother Sheldon Thibou, 25, was found guilty of violent disorder and assaulting PC Oliver Mort, who tried to intervene.A third brother, Shaeim Thibou, 22, was cleared of violent disorder but convicted of assaulting PC Mort. The jury deliberated for 50 hours and 33 minutes, with a shout of “yes” heard from Maximen’s family in court as the verdicts were delivered.The Old Bailey heard that a disturbance broke out at about 5.48pm on the day between the defendants and at least two other men, close to where Maximen was standing.The crowd parted as Sheldon Thibou got into a physical confrontation with the two men, prompting PC Mort to step in to break it up. Sheldon Thibou was said to have been holding a stun gun as he and Shaeim hit out at the officer.Shakeil Thibou also thrust a “huge” knife repeatedly towards Isaac’s stomach, only missing him because the victim drew back. This led to Maximen being knocked to the ground and only partly getting to her feet, Brown said.View image in fullscreenCher Maximen.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PAThe mother appeared to lift her right leg at Shakeil Thibou, who raised the knife directly towards her and deliberately stabbed her in her groin, jurors heard.Brown said: “The injuries inflicted on Ms Maximen were fatal – the defendant had killed her. It was a truly shocking attack, and regarded as such by those around it.”The defendants, of Kensington, westLondon, had denied the charges against them, although Sheldon Thibou admitted having the stun gun. In his defence, Shakeil Thibou claimed he picked up the knife at the carnival and acted in self-defence against Isaac.He claimed the death of Maximen was an accident, but the prosecution case claimed he brought the knife to the scene, and that another blade was found during a search of his room.The judge set sentencing for Shakeil Thibou on 16 May. Emma Currie of the Crown Prosecution Service described the case as “profoundly tragic” and said the brothers’ actions showed no regards for the hundreds of people around them.She said she hoped the verdicts would bring a sense of justice for the community and that the thoughts of the CPS remained with Maximen’s family and friends.Currie said: “Cher was caught up in the panicked crowd caused by the actions of the Thibou brothers, who robbed her of her life and the chance to see her little girl grow up.”Explore more on these topicsLondonNotting Hill carnivalCrimeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Later, while a whip in Boris Johnson’s government, she helped recruit two fellow peers to the company’s advisory board.Once Lady Bloomfield had stepped down from government, she was given share options, which could prove highly valuable later this year when Terrestrial Energy launches its shares publicly for the first time on an American stock exchange, with an estimated value of $1bn (£770m).Jonathan Rose, a political integrity expert at De Montfort University, said there were questions “about whether she has always acted with openness and accountability”.He said the meetings in 2018 with ministers and Bloomfield’s appointment as an adviser shortly afterwards, for which she received share options, raised “serious questions” about whether she had broken theHouse of Lordsrules, which he said the Lords commissioners for standards “should investigate as a matter of urgency”.Bloomfield said she had been “scrupulous” in her declarations and “strongly” maintained she did not breach the code of conduct.‘Ambushed’Bloomfield, now a Conservative whip and shadow Welsh minister, joined the Lords in 2016 after being nominated by David Cameron when he quit Downing Street. She ran Tory fundraising from 2006 to 2010.In the House of Lords, Bloomfield developed an interest in nuclear energy and took up a fellowship that provided her with knowledge of and access to the industry.Her support for Terrestrial Energy appears to have begun around April 2018, when she met the thenjunior business minister Richard Harringtonwith executives from the company, including its CEO, Simon Irish, according to official documents gained through freedom of information legislation. The meeting was organised after Bloomfield contacted Harrington. She noted that she had “no commercial interest” with Terrestrial Energy at that time.Beforehand, Whitehall officials said they had been “ambushed” by Bloomfield to hold a meeting. They wrote in an email to the business minister that she “strongly represents the views” of the company and that it was “apparent from previous correspondence” she would be “lobbying [for] the best interests of Terrestrial Energy”.They noted that Bloomfield had already introduced the company to officials working with Alun Cairns, the then minister responsible for Wales.Download original documentOfficials’ notes of the meeting with Harrington said Terrestrial Energy had pushed for government grants to be given to companies developing reactors.Two months later, on 5 June 2018, Bloomfield and another Terrestrial Energy executive met Stuart Andrew, a junior minister in the Wales Office. An official’s notes show they pressed for Terrestrial Energy’s reactors to be developed in Wales.Bloomfield had helped to secure the meeting with Andrew and sent the Wales Office documents drawn up by Terrestrial Energy to promote its case.Later the same month, she was appointed an adviser to the company. On 21 June, Terrestrial Energy awarded her share options, a right to buy shares in the company at a fixed price after a set period of time.She told the Guardian that she took the options for the role instead of a fee because Terrestrial Energy had yet to make a profit.Members of the House of Lords are not permitted to provide parliamentary services in return for payment.Bloomfield said she had “no financial involvement or interest in Terrestrial Energy” when she organised either of the meetings and there was therefore no breach of the House of Lords’ rules.At issue is whether she had started discussing a commercial role with Terrestrial Energy when she attended the meeting with the Welsh minister on 5 June. When asked, Terrestrial Energy and Bloomfield both declined to answer this question.She described the April meeting with Harrington as purely “educational” about next-generation nuclear technologies, but declined to provide any details of her meeting in June.Rose said: “I think there are serious questions to answer about whether at the time of the June meeting she had agreed to accept a payment or incentive in the form of the share options – particularly given how quickly they were granted after.”‘Grant/financing opportunities’In late July 2019, Bloomfield was appointed to Johnson’s government as a Lords whip. Her duties included speaking in debates on behalf of a few departments if their minister was unavailable, including for the energy department.She said she relinquished the share options and her rolein Terrestrial Energy on her appointment. However, she continued to support the company while a minister.Until February 2020, one of Bloomfield’s frontbench colleagues in the Lords was Ian Duncan, a climate minister in the energy department.She said that when she stood down from the advisory board she “replaced” herself with Lord Duncan and another peer, John Browne, the former BP chief executive. Duncan’s appointment began in October 2020. Browne did not start his role until February 2023.In April 2021, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, an energy minister at the time, held a meeting with Irish. Trevelyan met the Terrestrial Energy chief executive “on the recommendation” of Bloomfield, according to an email from an official in Trevelyan’s private ministerial office.A readout of the meeting days later shows Irish asked if the government would consider “grant/financing opportunities” and adapt the scope of a government-funded programme on nuclear fuel development. Trevelyan, the readout says, expressed interest in his proposal.Bloomfield said it was “unlikely” she would have only recommended Trevelyan meet Terrestrial Energy. Trevelyan did hold other meetings with nuclear companies, including with companies that are partners of Terrestrial Energy, but Bloomfield declined to give any further details on other recommendations she may have given.In April 2022, Bloomfield attended a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on small modular reactors, which was hearing a presentation from Terrestrial Energy. Bloomfield declared she was formerly on the company’s advisory board. She cited having previously introduced Terrestrial to a minister in 2018, “when there was a very firmly closed door!”, according tominutes of the meeting.‘Deeply concerning’Bloomfield returned to the company in August 2023, less than three months after leaving government, and was awarded fresh share options as remuneration for a role as an “ad hoc consultant responsible for future fundraising and headhunting suitable individuals to join the firm”.Susan Hawley, a campaigner and director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “That she went on to be rehired by the company having played such an apparently useful role to the company as a minister is deeply concerning and suggests that further investigation is in order.”Do you have information about this story? Email henry.dyer@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7721 857348.Bloomfield said she went through “all the proper channels”. She added that she hadreceived approvalfrom the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which regulates jobs taken up by former ministers.Bloomfield said to the Acoba committee she had had no official contact with Terrestrial Energy while a whip. She does not appear to have told the committee about her attendance at the all-party parliamentary group meeting in April 2022 or about her role in hiring two peers to the company’s advisory board, while she was a minister.A spokesperson for Terrestrial Energy said: “We trust and require that our employees and advisers always operate in line with all relevant laws, ethics policies, regulations and codes of conduct that apply. We would take any breaches of those rules by our representatives very seriously.”They added they were aware of the Lords code of conduct and had been assured by Bloomfield that she had “only ever acted for us in accordance with that code”.From the backbenches, at times declaring her role as an adviser to Terrestrial Energy, Bloomfield has continued to speak in the Lords on the merits of advanced modular reactors, a version of which the company is developing.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debateEnergy industryTechnology sectorLobbyingCanadaConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli military said the strike targeted a seniorHamasmilitant.According to the UN, nearly 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes or shelters since Israel decided to abandon a two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas, cutting off aid, food and fuel on 2 March and resuming large-scale bombing two weeks later. A total of 1,500 people have been killed and 3,700 injured since then, according to the local health ministry.Earlier this week, Hamas fired its strongest volley of rockets into Israel since the ceasefire collapsed, aiming 10 projectiles toward the southern city of Ashkelon that injured 12 people.Israeli officials say the renewed military campaign is aimed at pressuring Hamas into releasing Israeli hostages. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued sweeping evacuation orders amid a vow from the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to “divide up” and seize large swathes of the territory.On Wednesday, the Israeli dailyHaaretzreported that the IDF was preparing to incorporate the entire city of Rafah and its surroundings – one-fifth of the entire Gaza Strip – into the new “Morag corridor” between Rafah and Khan Younis. Such a move would cut off Gaza from Egypt and turn the territory into an enclave completely surrounded by Israel.The report has renewed fears of permanent displacement for the strip’s 2.3 million residents and inflamed worries that Israel intends to establish permanent control of the Palestinian territory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed more than 50,000 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.Mediators have since attempted to bring the sides to a bridging agreement that would again pause the war, free hostages and open the door for talks on ending the conflict, but Netanyahu, under pressure from rightwing allies, says Israel will not agree to stop fighting until Hamas is defeated. Hamas wants the war to end before it frees the remaining 59 hostages it holds, 24 of whom are believed to still be alive.Netanyahu this week travelled to the US – Israel’s most important political and military ally – to meet Donald Trump, who has said he wants the war to end. He has suggested expelling Gaza’s population either voluntarily or by force. While Israel has embraced Trump’s vision, the rest of the Middle East and the international community have refused to entertain the idea.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

And it is also a clear signal to our partners in the European Union,” said Merz during a news conference with his coalition partners.“Germany is back on track,” he added.The compromise package, which Merz had aimed to have completed by Easter, must still win majority approval among the SPD’s 357,000 members via an online ballot as well as from the leadership of the CDU and CSU, known as the Union parties.Assuming those hurdles are cleared by the end of April, Merz could be sworn in before the Bundestag in early May, realising adecades-long dreamfor the longtime rival of the veteran leaderAngela Merkel.The agreement includes tax breaks for low- and moderate-income households, phased-in tax reductions for corporations, subsidies for electric cars to help the ailing auto industry and further reform of the “debt brake” seen as hobbling public investment.On border policy, a pivotal issue in the campaign aftera series of attacks blamed on asylum seekers, Merz said Germany would “effectively put an end to irregular immigration” and aim to cooperate with neighbours to turn back people at the frontier.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz is Germany’s prospective chancellor, and the longtime rival of Angela Merkel, hoping to be sworn in to the Bundestag in early May.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesBut the SPD co-leader Lars Klingbeil, who is expected to become vice-chancellor, insisted the government would work on the principle that the “basic right to asylum remains inviolable” and that “Germany is a country of immigration” that benefits socially and economically from newcomers.He said the coalition would lead a modernisation drive in a nation often criticised as slow to change. “The excavators have got to get to work and the fax machines must go,” Klingbeil said.Germany has been in protracted political limbo since the chancellor, Olaf Scholz of the SPD, whose fractious three-way coalition was deeply unpopular, in Novemberannounced the collapse of the governmentand called for an early election.In the 23 February pollthe CDU/CSU came out on topwith 28.5%, ahead of the anti-immigration, pro-Kremlin Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) on 20.8% – the strongest showing for a German far-right party since the second world war.The SPD turned in a dismal 16.4% result but became Merz’s only potential partner in a two-way coalition given a pledge by the centrist parties to lock out the AfD.That do-or-die situation strengthened the Social Democrats’ hand in the coalition negotiations, leading Merz towater down a number of campaign pledgesincluding strict fiscal discipline, major tax breaks for corporations and wealthy individuals, and an uncompromising line on immigration.The SPD extracted a pledge to keep pensions at the current rate until 2031, and will have control of powerful briefs including the finance and defence ministries.The Union will take over the foreign and interior ministries. The latter steers immigration and domestic security policy – core issues for the conservatives as they scramble to fend off the far-right challenge.Merz, a wealthy former corporate lawyer, largely stuck to a pledge during the month-long talks to avoid the spotlight despite a deluge of troubling economic news, leaving an opening for AfD leaders to hammer the mainstream parties as unfit to steer the ship through the storm.The far right has only gained in support since the election, withone poll on Wednesdayshowing the AfD in first place with 25%, ahead of Merz’s CDU/CSU on 24%.“The AfD has become the strongest force in Germany for the first time in the polls!” the party co-leaderAlice Weidelcheered on X. “Citizens want political change and not a more-of-the-same coalition between the Union and the SPD!”Turmoil on global markets and fears for the postwar order of transatlantic cooperation have also taken a toll on Merz’s personal popularity, with many Germans doubting his leadership abilities in a time of converging economic, diplomatic and security crises.A Forsa institute poll released on Monday showed thatonly 32% thought Merz was the right person to be chancellor, down from 40% in early March, with 60% saying they disapproved of him.Germany’s lengthy political vacuum amidan extended economic slumphas also frustrated allies looking to the European heavyweight to show leadership in the face of Donald Trump’s erratic course on trade and defence and an emboldened Russia.Merz has pledged to maintain Germany’s strong backing for Ukraine while mending frayed ties with neighbours including France and Poland and fostering “independence” from Washington under Trump.He has already encouraged many partners by agreeing last monthto a historic pact to loosen rules on running up debtto allow for steeper defence spending and boost sorely needed investment in infrastructure.The move to release the “debt brake” has, however, met with criticism from within his own conservative camp and drawn attacks from the AfD as breaking with German fiscal orthodoxy.Merz on Wednesday acknowledged his centrist government must use its four-year term to address voters’ growing disillusionment or risk the AfD coming out on top at the next general election.“That is our mission: to show that problems can be solved by the political centre of our country,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzDonald TrumpInternational tradeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The 3D reconstruction of the cubic millimetre of brain is helping uncover how the brain is organised and how different cell types work together, and could have implications for the understanding of intelligence, consciousness and neuronal conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, autism and schizophrenia.The advances are “a watershed moment for neuroscience, comparable to the Human Genome Project in their transformative potential”, according to Dr David Markowitz, former programme manager of the US governmental organisation Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), who coordinated the work.TheMICrONS projectsought not only to map the structure of neurons, but also investigated the electrical signalling between then, showing how they communicate and providing a better picture of the hidden conversations in the brain.Scientists at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas began by using specialised microscopes to record the brain activity from the target region as the animal watched various movies and YouTube clips. Afterwards, Allen Institute researchers took that same cubic millimetre of the brain and sliced it into more than 25,000 layers, each 1/400th the width of a human hair, and used an array of electron microscopes to take high-resolution pictures of each slice.Finally, another team at Princeton University used artificial intelligence and machine learning to reconstruct the cells and connections into a 3D volume. Combined, the massive data set is 1.6 petabytes in size, equivalent to 22 years of non-stop HD video.“Inside that tiny speck is an entire architecture like an exquisite forest,” said Dr Clay Reid, senior investigator and a neurobiologist at the Allen Institute. “It has all sorts of rules of connections that we knew from various parts of neuroscience, and within the reconstruction itself, we can test the old theories and hope to find new things that no one has ever seen before.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scientists previously thought of inhibitory cells – those that suppress neural activity – as a simple force that dampens the action of other cells. But the latest work found that inhibitory cells are highly selective about which cells they target, creating a network-wide system of coordination and cooperation.Understanding the brain’s form and function could pave the way for a better understanding of brain disorders involving disruptions in neural communication.“If you have a broken radio and you have the circuit diagram, you’ll be in a better position to fix it.” said Dr Nuno da Costa, associate investigator at the Allen Institute. “We are describing a kind of Google map or blueprint of this grain of sand. In the future, we can use this to compare the brain wiring in a healthy mouse to the brain wiring in a model of disease.”The findings are published in a series of papers in the journalNature.Explore more on these topicsScienceNeurosciencenewsShareReuse this content"

Dog faeces can also leave scent traces and affect soil chemistry and plant growth.Thecarbon footprint of petsis also significant. A2020 studyfound the dry pet food industry had an environmental footprint of around twice the land area of the UK, with greenhouse gas emissions – 56 to 151 Mt CO2– equivalent to the 60th highest-emitting country.The review’s lead author, Prof Bill Bateman of Curtin University, said the research did not intend to be “censorious” but aimed to raise awareness of the environmental impacts of man’s best friend, with whom humans’ domestic relationship dates backseveral millennia.“To a certain extent we give a free pass to dogs because they are so important to us … not just as working dogs but also as companions,” he said, pointing to the “huge benefits” dogs had on their owners’ mental and physical health. He also noted that dogs played vital roles in conservation work, such as inwildlife detection.“Although we’ve pointed out these issues with dogs in natural environments … there is that other balancing side, which is that people will probably go out and really enjoy the environment around them – and perhaps feel more protective about it – because they’re out there walking their dog in it.”Angelika von Sanden, a trauma therapist and the author of Sit Stay Grow: How Dogs Can Help You Worry Less and Walk into a Better Future, said she had observed that for many clients the companionship of a dog was often “literally the only reason to survive, to get up, to still keep going”.“It gives them a reason to get up, a reason to get out, a reason to move around and be in contact a little bit with the world outside,” she said.“Dog owners can get a bad name if they are not aware of the surroundings they are in and of other people around them.”Throw a dog a bean: how to reduce the carbon footprint of your petsRead moreIn the review, the researchers attributed the extent of the environmental impacts to the sheer number of dogs globally, as well as “the lax or uninformed behaviour of dog owners”.A simple way to mitigate against the worst impacts was to keep dogs leashed in areas where restrictions apply and to maintain a buffer distance from nesting or roosting shorebirds, the paper suggested.“A lot of what we’re talking about can be ameliorated by owners’ behaviour,” Bateman said, pointing out thatlow compliancewith leash laws was a problem.“Maybe, in some parts of the world, we actually need to consider some slightly more robust laws.”He suggested that dog exclusion zones might be more suitable in some areas.Bateman also raised sustainable dog food as an option to reduce a pet’s environmental paw print, noting however that “more sustainable dog food tends to cost more than the cheap dog food that we buy which has a higher carbon footprint”.“If nothing else, pick up your own dog shit,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDogsAnimalsPetsPollutionWildlifeGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

They are: maintaining a healthy weight and regularly taking part in physical activity; prioritising fruit, vegetables and foods containing fibre; lowering consumption of red and processed meat and sugar-sweetened beverages; and avoiding alcohol and smoking.Dr Dora Romaguera of the Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands, said: “Globally, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. This report provides clear evidence that by looking at our whole diet and the way we live, there are clear steps to recommend to women to lower their breast cancer risk.“Importantly, this work highlights the greatest benefit is found when adhering to most aspects of a cancer-preventative pattern simultaneously. By looking out our whole diet and the way we live, there are clear steps we can take to minimise our risk of breast cancer.”The WCRF’s fourth recommendation – avoiding alcohol completely – appears to be at odds with current UK and global guidance.The UK government’s guidance advises consuming no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, spread across three days or more. The WHO only says “harmful use of alcohol” raises the risk of breast cancer.Cancer Research UK says sticking to “low amounts of alcohol” reduces the risk of breast cancer.Sally Kum, the associate director of nursing at Breast Cancer Now, a UK charity, said: “Many different things affect the risk of getting breast cancer, some that cannot be changed and some that can.“Current national guidance states that people [should] consume no more than 14 units of alcohol a week spread across three days or more to minimise health-related impacts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Special government employees, which also include many members of Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge),serve a limit of 130 daysand are exempt from some financial disclosure rules.“Those who step up to serve our country should do so because they want to contribute to the betterment of our nation – not because they stand to benefit from their public service at the expense of taxpayers,” Shaheen told the Guardian.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Senate Republicans, who hold the chamber’s majority, haveshown little interestin backing any attempts to rein in Musk’s power or compel more transparency into his actions, however, while Trump hasrepeatedly defendedMusk against criticism.Democrats and ethics watchdog groups havefrequently objectedto Musk’snumerous conflictsas he serves as the de facto head of Doge and a senior adviser to the president. Musk’s companies, most notably SpaceX and the satellite communications service Starlink, haveextensive and expanding tieswith government agencies as well as contracts worth billions of dollars.As Musk and his team have rapidly moved to dismantle entire federal agencies and cut government services in recent months, former government employeeshave also warnedthat the world’s richest person is laying groundwork for his own private companies to further entrench themselves. Musk’s Starlink is reportedly up for potential contracts with several federal agencies, and was alreadydonated for useacross the White House complex – a move that this week prompted Democrats on the House oversight committee to express “deep concerns”in a letterto the administration.Trump makes rare admission of Musk’s conflicts of interest after Pentagon visitRead more“Donations such as this raise considerable red flags as to whether Mr. Musk is using his position in the federal government to benefit his companies,” the letter stated.Musk’s conflicts also extend beyond his contracts with the government.

They said a decades-long culture of silencing victims was getting worse inFrance, amid a sense of “collective denial”. They described an “ambient sexism” as well as racism in the sector.The lawmakers made almost 90 recommendations, including better protections for actors and models aged under 18, and improved regulation of actors’ agents and casting procedures.They also proposed banning the sexualisation of minors on screen and in fashion photos. They said compulsoryintimacy coordinatorsshould be present for any scene of intimacy involving minors, and that intimacy coordinators should be suggested as compulsory for cinema, TV and theatre.Women working on film sets told how, in the course of their daily work, senior male crew members would make sexual comments such as demands for oral sex. Young women described being pushed up against a wall and sexually assaulted while at work. One assistant director described being summoned to see an actor and finding him waiting with his trousers down.Thereportfound that sexual assault was common during the casting process. Scenes of sex or nudity were also found to have been a place for sexual assaults and rape to occur. One film worker said she realised that a female actor had been raped during a bedroom scene, but the director took no action when it was reported to him.The report found children were particularly vulnerable and subject to abuse in cinema and the performing arts.One actor described how, aged 10, she had to appear in a rape scene, but was prevented from meeting the actor first and was taken by surprise when she was grabbed by him. “I was petrified,” she said. Another teenager was pushed and verbally abused during a romantic scene with an actor decades older. One young child had his trousers pulled down on set when he did not want to perform in only his underpants. One director reminded another child of his father’s death just before a scene, to get the right look of emotion for a shot.Film-maker Paul Schrader accused of sexually assaulting personal assistantRead moreThe politicians called for better regulation of music schools, acting schools and choirs after hearing allegations of a music teacher telling a young girl “to look more like a whore” while playing the flute. They also heard allegations of a choir master kissing girls on the neck.Rousseau said what struck her in testimony from the film industry was how young some actors were when sexual harassment began. She said: “For some, it started in childhood, in school, at castings and went on all the way through their careers.”The actor Sara Forestier, who started working in film aged 13, told the inquiry that at her first casting she was asked to take off her underwear and throw it on to someone’s plate. Throughout her career she repeatedly had to say “no” to directors who wanted to have sex with her and who threatened to take roles away if she refused.“In our country, there’s a cult of talent and creative genius,” Balanant said, adding that some star directors and actors felt they could act how they pleased.The report comes weeks after the Paristrial for sexual assault of the French film star, Gérard Depardieu. He denies the charges against him, and the verdict will be announced next month.The actor and director Judith Godrèche, who became aleading voice in France’s #MeToo movementand called for the inquiry, said Wednesday’s report was “terrifying”. She has filed complaints against the directorsBenoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillonfor sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Both have denied the allegations.Explore more on these topics#MeToo movementGenderEuropeFilm industryFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

But the scene hasundergone further revisionswith the two firing at nearly the same time, then finally at the exact same time.Another unpopular change was the CGI addition of the giant slug-like Jabba the Hutt, who originally was not seen on screen until the final film in the original trilogy, 1983’s Return of the Jedi. In the added sequence, based ona deleted clip featuring a human actor, the vile gangsteryelps as Solo steps on his tail.James Bell,senior curator of fiction at the BFI National Archive, said: “One of the ambitions of the BFI Film on Film Festival is to screen original release prints that transport audiences back to the moment a film was first released – to give audiences of today the special emotional connection that comes when viewing the very same object seen by a film’s original audience.“In the case of Star Wars, the festival screening is a unique opportunity to present the film to audiences in exactly the same form as they would have watched it in 1977.”The BFI said Lucasfilm and Disney had granted permission for the original version to be screened. There are no plans to show the original cuts of The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi.Explore more on these topicsStar WarsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kleiner added that they hoped series co-creator and writer Stephen Graham, who plays the boy’s father, as well as writerJack Thorne, would return for a second season.Graham and his wife and producing partner, Hannah Walters, have already hinted at a second outing for a show designed as a one-off, though nothing has been confirmed. “Possibly, let’s see how the figures are,” Graham toldVarietywhen asked about a follow-up. “But yeah, there’s the possibility of developing another story.” Walters said she would happily work with Netflix “all day long”, but that “it’s hard” to follow up a success like Adolescence.The show has become an international hit for the global streaming platform,amassing 114.5 million viewerssince its release on 13 March. It became the first streaming show to top weekly ratings in the UK and set a new Netflix record for a limited series with 66.3 million viewers after two weeks. This week it also became the platform’s fourth biggest English-language series ever.Its themes of online extremism, violence and complicitystruck a cultural nerveacross countries, speaking to fears about online misogyny pitched to children. Netflix has made the series available to all secondary schools in the UK.A second season would presumably focus on different characters in a different setting, at least according to Thorne. “Jamie’s story is finished,” he said in an interviewwith ITVfrom late March. “I don’t think there’s anywhere more we can take Jamie, so I don’t think there is a series two.‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead more“Our aim was to try and tell Jamie’s story as fully as we possibly could, and maybe trying to tell [Katie’s] story would dilute that in some way and maybe we would be inadequate for that task,” he added.Barantini, the director, also initially dismissed the idea of a second season. “I don’t personally [think there should be another series], I think it’s a package of this moment in time, and I think personally, that’s how I feel about it,” he toldthe Independentin March.Speaking to Deadline, Gardner said Barantini’s one-take style was “essential” to the show’s success. “Phil’s style of doing the episodes in one take is not a gimmick. It’s very much in conversation with the subject matter,” she said. “In that kind of prismatic way of viewing, you can duck the issue. So our theory was, what would happen if you couldn’t look away? And will that make the subject embed in you in a different way? That was a thrilling thing.”Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceBrad PittNetflixDramaStephen GrahamnewsShareReuse this content"

The answer is almost certainly yes.“It’s a situation that’s unjust, but also risks reshaping our national history in favour of what survives, versus what is lost.”In Sheffield, locals are divided over the building. Hayley Glover, 43, who owns the cafe opposite, Kollective Coffee & Kitchen, thought the building should stay open to the public as she fondly remembers it being built 26 years ago.View image in fullscreenHayley Glover, owner of the Kollective Cafe, located near the Sheffield Hallam University student union building.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer“I think it’s a shame that it’s sat there empty, and whilst it’s empty the square on the opposite side of the road is getting a lot of undesirables in there.“So obviously, footfall getting in and out the building for us is a good thing. It would be a shame for it to be closed.”The building was bought in 2004 by Sheffield Hallam University and was used as its students’ union, but is now due to be vacated, with questions hanging over its future. The university is not ruling out knocking it down entirely.Cory Anson, 30, a sales worker, thought the building had some aesthetic appeal:“It’s a beautiful building. I did a course there once, it’s just a really nice building. I think it’s a staple of Sheffield as well, to be honest. Like everybody knows about the kettle building.”The four giant stainless steel drums that make up the structure surround an atrium with a glazed roof.For Molly Mallette, 26, who works supporting women in the criminal justice system, and her boyfriend, Louis Binns, 25, who works at the university, the building elicits some debate.To Mallette it is “hideous”. She added: “I think it’s a real eyesore in the area, to be honest. I don’t really know what it’s meant to be. I’ve got no other word for it, I just don’t think it’s very attractive.”View image in fullscreenSheffield Hallam University alumni Louis Binns and Molly Mallette (right) outside the student union building.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverBinns disagreed, however. “It’s interesting to look at,” he said. “From working at Hallam Help, when directing students it’s incredibly easy because it obviously stands out.”Kristina Drmic, 24, a former student who now works at the students’ union, pointed to the unmissable nature of the building.“It’s very easy for students to find us because the description of it is very unique. Some people call it the alien-shaped building, some people call it the four kettles.“I think the shape of it is part of the Sheffield culture and I think it should stay and shouldn’t get demolished.”Anthea Page, 58, who works in communications, said the building was redundant and she would gladly welcome its closure.“It doesn’t serve its current purpose,” she said. “It’s used for the Hallam students’ union and it’s not well used, it’s not very well placed.

The next day, Ratliff’s son Lochlan uses the blender – which still contains leftovers of the poisonous mixture – to prepare a protein shake,which nearly results in his death.Daniel Jhung, president of the Nestlé USA coffee and beverage division, told theWall Street Journalthis week that the marketing team behind Coffee-Mate was notably unaware of the plot involving piña coladas before the episode aired.“We didn’t know that piña colada was such a featured part of the last episode,” Jhung said. “I will say that in hindsight, we were showing the different flavors, and the fact thatThe White Lotusteam was like, ‘Oh, you know, piña colada is a really good idea, you should go in that direction’ – it now kind of makes sense.”The company launchedthe limited edition The White Lotus-themed flavored creamersin partnership with Warner Bros ahead of the show’s third season, which premiered on 16 February.Jhung said that Sunday night’s episode took the Coffee-Mate team by surprise, and that the team quickly devised a social media plan to react, sharing the “awkward” post on Instagram.“The ‘awkward’ post got picked up quite a bit by consumers, by other brands, because it was so perfect with the show’s ending,” Jhung said.Jhung told the Journal that it’s still too early to determine whether the episode impacted sales of the flavored creamers since they won’t receive consumption data for another week.“We’ll probably see next week how it did this week,” he said, adding that “the show going on week by week is helping drive buzz for the flavors. So they’re both doing really well in market through the first quarter.”Jhung said that he suspects that next week, when the sales data comes in, that the piña colada flavor “will see a bit of a lift as people try it, just for the novelty aspect”.The essence of limited-time offers, Jhung added, is about “mysterious flavors, intriguing flavors that are not typical in the coffee set, and so it kind of fits well with the show, which is about mystery and intrigue”.On TikTok, some fans of the show have made videosreacting to the finale and the flavored coffee creamer collaboration.One TikTok usershared a videoof the piña colada creamer in their fridge, with the caption “I got this back in February being like wow what a random flavor for the Thailand season,” adding: “NOT MIKE WHITE MAKING OUR COFFEE AN EASTER EGG.“PSA EVERYONE WASH YOUR BLENDERS BEFORE RE-USING PLZ,” the user added.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusFood & drink industryCoffeeFoodUS televisionTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

If you have the self-discipline not just to scoff it all immediately in a mound of butter, here are nine simple steps to turn it into a perfect seasonal soupFelicity CloakeWed 9 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareSoup is rarely on the menu when I spot those first spindly green spears of the season – after nine asparagus-less months, I’m barely able to contain my impatience long enough to boil them and slap on some butter, let alone anything a bit more involved. But once the initial frenzy has abated, this is a great recipe for thicker, woodier stems, or for the bases of those for which you’ve used the tips elsewhere.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4500g trimmed asparagus– tips optional, if you’d prefer to use them for something else6 spring onions50g butter, or oil1 tbsp flour –gluten-free is fine, if need beSalt and black pepper2 tbsp double cream, or creme fraiche (see step 9) – dairy-free is fine1 A note on the asparagusView image in fullscreenSelect the thickest stalks available (slender ones aren’t a problemper se, but you may prefer to use them in a dish where their tender elegance will be better appreciated; you may also prefer to remove the feathery tips and use them elsewhere). If the bases are very dry and brown, trim them, then weigh what’s left; you need roughly 500g.2 Trim the asparagusBoil a litre of water in a kettle or bring it to a boil in a saucepan (unless you have one of those fancy taps). Remove the woody ends from the stalks. It’s easiest to do this by bending them individually, because they should snap at just the point where they become too fibrous to cook through in the same time as the slimmer tops.3 Cook the basesView image in fullscreenCut off the tops and set aside for now. Roughly chop the tougher bases, and drop them into the pan of boiling water. Bring to a simmer, then cook for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, trim the whiskery root ends and dry tops off the spring onions, and roughly chop the rest, both green and white parts.4 Drain the asparagus endsImportant! Bearing in mind that you need to save the cooking water rather than the asparagus bases, strain the contents of the pan through a colander or sieve and into a heatproof jug (alternatively, scoop out the ends and keep the water in the pan, if you don’t need it to make the soup). Discard the spent cooked asparagus ends.5 Make the soup baseView image in fullscreenMelt the butter in a medium pan on a medium-low heat, then briefly soften the sliced spring onions (if you’d prefer to keep this plant-based, use oil instead – I’d suggest olive oil here for its flavour).Stir in the flour (gluten-free flour will work fine), and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring so it doesn’t burn.6 Add the flavoured cooking waterView image in fullscreenSlowly pour in the reserved asparagus cooking water bit by bit, whisking as you do so, first to make a paste and then to loosen the paste with the rest of the liquid, so you don’t end up with lumps. Bring to a boil.While you wait, roughly chop the tops of the stalks; if you’re using the tips, set those aside for now.7 Add the remaining chopped stemsView image in fullscreenAdd the chopped stem tops to the pan, turn down the heat slightly and simmer gently for eight minutes.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, if you’re using the tips, cook these separately in boiling, lightly salted water for three minutes, then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water so they retain their colour. Drain and dry the cooked tips.8 Blend the soup mixView image in fullscreenTake the soup off the heat, then puree until smooth, either with a stick blender or in a jug blender. (If using the latter, leave the soup to cool slightly first, because putting it in when it’s too hot can cause steam to build up in the jug, and the lid to pop off, spraying soup all over your kitchen).9 Finishing touchesReturn the soup to the pan and stir in the cream (you can use a plant-based alternative, but make sure it’s not sweetened; I’d also recommend steering clear of coconut, which doesn’t work well here). Season to taste, divide between bowls and garnish with the drained tips, if using.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassSoupStarterVegetablesSpring food and drinkBritish food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I lived with my partner and two stepchildren in a Victorian terrace house inBristol. We’d met when her kids were four and eight, so I had not experienced the early baby stages, the sleepless nights, nappies and bottle-feeding.But that was about to change.On 15 March, I parked my car outside the house as usual, but rather than bowling inside to shower and eat, I unclipped the car seat and carried a baby gorilla into the lounge. Afia had been born by emergency C-section at Bristol zoo after her mum, Kera, developed pre-eclampsia. I first took her home when she was four weeks old.On the couch, she nestled in the crook of my arm and clutched my thumb with a delicate fist of wrinkled grey fingers. The trust in her dark eyes snapped awake an instinctive devotion in me – the foundation of the bond that grew between us.I worked with a family group of seven western lowland gorillas at the zoo. Classified as critically endangered, they are at imminent risk of extinction in the wild. The captive population is managed collectively across Europe by a specialist team: zoos don’t own the species they keep, or sell them, but rather they maintain the genetic diversity within the population by moving animals from one collection to another. I followed industry-wide husbandry guidelines, but what we were doing with Afia had never been tried in the UK before. As a gorilla keeper, I was now part of the team that would hand-rear her.Hand-rearing is a rare part of zoo keeping and the goal is always to reunite the baby with its own kind as quickly as possible. As gorillas rely on their mother’s milk for three years, the aim with Afia was to try to get her back with her mother or, failing that, train one of the adult females to become her surrogate mum. Afia would need to be acting like a normal gorilla infant by the time we introduced her into the troop; if we could achieve this within a year, she wouldn’t remember travelling in the car each night or sleeping in a bed with a duvet.Baby gorillas develop more quickly than humans, so my parenting ride lasted just seven months. I wore a string vest, to replicate a gorilla’s fur, as the first thing Afia needed to learn was to hang on to me wherever I went. She slept on my chest at night, clung to me in fear at unexpected noises, and I helped with her first stiff-legged steps.View image in fullscreenAlan with Afia when she was two weeks old.Photograph: Ryan WalkerBy day, we spent time with the adult gorillas, particularly with Kera, Afia’s mum. Adult gorillas are dangerous animals, which meant we would never go into the enclosure with them. Kera remained separated from the rest of the group and struggled to recover from the C-section. Our interactions were through grilled windows and doors in the gorilla house, but Kera was so sick and unresponsive that no maternal bond with Afia could be formed.Soon, Afia began to ride on my back, furry arms clamped around my neck. She could climb and was trying to master swinging from one rope to another. I recognised her facial expressions – sleepy, solemn, inquisitive – and she had full trust in me, knowing that I would keep her safe. At six months, she was running around the lounge and throwing her toys about. My favourite expression was her play face, a grin that we both knew meant diving off the sofa and wrestling. I would take up my regular spot on the floor and wait for Afia to push the coffee table up against the couch so she could climb on to it more easily. She would spend the next hour leaping on to me or the cushions she’d chucked nearby.My own family group had to be hands off, as part of the hand-rearing protocol. The kids mentioned later they felt waves of irrational jealousy. When I was rolling around on the floor, Afia chuckling with gorilla laughter, my partner said: “I can see now what sort of parent you’d have been for the kids at that age.”We ate dinner together as a family, Afia on my lap, enthusiastically drumming her hands on the kitchen table and making grabs for the cutlery. The gorilla troop eats together at the same time, so sharing meals needed to be the norm for Afia, and she would look around the table at us all, squishing fistfuls of steamed sweet potato through her fingers. After dinner, she’d slump across me on the couch, asleep, briefly waking up for a bottle-feed before bed, where she would snuffle and belch cheesy milk breath over me. In bed, Afia had started off sleeping on my chest, but now she was older, she would slide off to snuggle next to me, or roll over and throw a hairy arm over my partner instead.That’s how the routine went, until we arrived at our final night together. Afia sensed my sadness and slept with her head wedged under my chin. For the first time, I felt as if I’d lied to her. Kera had recovered, but as she continued to show no maternal instinct towards Afia, we were about to begin introducting her to a surrogate mum, an older female with plenty of experience.My sped-up baby and toddler experience had fast-tracked me to a point that I’d yet to go through with the human kids: a taste of how it will feel when they, too, leave home. It changed the way I thought of my own family, with a realisation that the troop as we know it will disperse, our roles as parents steadily replaced by a desperate and fragile hope: that you’ve done all you could, and that life will be kind to them.Gorillas in Our Midst by Alan Toyne is published on 10 April (Summersdale Publishers, £10.99).

On a recent visit, I hatched a plan to get him in the ocean againGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailWed 9 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTShareIt’s a delicate moment. My father’s a proud man. I don’t want to be condescending, so I tell him to let me know the level of help he needs. “I’ll take my cues from you,” I offer quietly. With a default formality I still find endearing, he tells me he’ll require assistance at two stages of the process: getting in and getting out.I’ve travelled from my home in northern New South Wales to Perth to spend 10 days with my father, while his second wife, my stepmum, is in Melbourne visiting their two adult sons and new grandsons.After Dad died I dressed like an extra from The Matrix. Now I’m blooming again like the flowers on my psychedelic new vest | Nick BuckleyRead moreDad’s 91. I’ve just turned 60. Getting reacquainted is always part of these sporadic visits across the continent. We’ve lived most of our lives in different states, even countries, so I’ve cherished the wisdom he’s offered along the way. One that has stuck with me is his daily routine, which he calls six by six.He says if he starts the day at 6am with a swim at North Cottesloe and finishes with a glass of wine while listening to classical music at 6pm, he can deal with pretty much whatever happens in between.But it has been two years since he has felt the kiss of his beloved Indian Ocean. Bladder cancer, the fitting of a pacemaker, a hip replacement, prostate cancer and cataract surgery, atop the usual ravages of old age, have robbed him of his daily ocean fix. I’m managing a prostate cancer diagnosis of my own – not the father/son bonding I would’ve chosen, but a bonding nonetheless.I am soon gripped by an ambitious plan: to get him in the ocean againHe’s in remarkable shape for all this – mentally sharp, admirably mobile – and I am soon gripped by an ambitious plan: to get him in the ocean again.I’m a lifelong surfer. Dad shepherded me into the ocean as a small child. I learned to swim in the kiddy pool that once adorned the beach at Cottesloe. My surfing life began on a polystyrene board called a Little Nipper at a patch of Cottesloe Beach known as Slimy Reef. Barely a surf break at all, the tiny surge of whitewater is like a scale model of a proper wave.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsOn day three of my visit, I tell him my plan. Dad’s sceptical. He fell in the shore break on one of his last visits.“No pressure,” I say. I tend and water the seed I planted by walking alone to Cottesloe early each morning, and returning filled with joie de vivre.He eventually concedes we could try. There’s a longing to this quiet utterance. On day four, he agrees to accompany me to North Cott. “I’m not sure I’ll go in,” he says.View image in fullscreenBaby Tim Baker and his dad, Ian, in 1965We drive to save him the walk. I slow to his shuffling pace, close by his side as we descend a gentle ramp to the change rooms where he was once a regular. A couple of familiar faces greet him warmly and acknowledge that it’s been a while. A different Ian Baker had recently appeared in the West Australian newspaper’s death notices. Dad has fielded phone calls inquiring if he’s still with us. His reappearance at the beach after a two-year absence must seem like an apparition.The old boys in the North Cott change rooms get their gear off with admirable abandon. I’m more circumspect than any of them – changing under a towel. I’m self-conscious about the ravages of hormone therapy, the frontline treatment for prostate cancer, rather than old age – the lack of body hair, the breast swelling, the side-effect that dare not speak its name (genital shrinkage – there, I said it). I’m not sure if all this elderly male nudity is shocking or beautiful. Probably both.Dad seems undeterred by his own physical decline. The blots and blemishes that decorate his rice paper skin. Webs of dark blue and purple veins like crude tattoos, his legs a topographical map of bruises and swelling and sores. Dad’s always been an understated character, so I’m surprised to see him gingerly step into the most colourful pair of swimmers I’ve seen in quite a while. There’s a hint of showbiz about this otherwise tentative comeback.It’s a steep set of stairs down to the beach. He’s concerned about the final step on to the sand. “Sometimes there’s quite a drop off,” he says. But the beach gods are kind: a sand drift has formed right up to the base of the stairs so there’s no drop off at all. I ditch my towel, strip off my T-shirt. The ocean’s right there, only a few paces away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

The beach drops at an angle to the water’s edge so traversing this slope is tricky, even for me. We only get 100 metres or so before he pauses, slowly shuffles 180 degrees and says it is probably enough.We’re soon back where we dropped our towels. He faces the ocean, takes a few halting steps towards it. I stick closely by his side, extend my right arm at chest height, bent at the elbow. A human handrail. He grips my forearm with his left hand as we take slow, baby steps until the water is lapping at our ankles.“Let’s wait for this one,” I suggest. A little shore break lurches and expires at our feet. Beyond it the ocean beckons, calm, blue, gleaming. Its chill creeps up our legs as we advance. The bottom is uneven, with ripples of sand, an abundance of shells and small outcrops of rock. He grasps my forearm more tightly as the water pulls around our knees and his balance wavers.He emerges, grinning like a kid, eyes wideOnce, my father carried me into the ocean, sure and strong, and my infant mind knew with absolute certainty I was safe. Now, as he stumbles slightly and leans more of his weight on me, I know with that same certainty my own body – compromised by years of cancer treatment – is suddenly rock-like, immoveable. I can’t recall the last time I felt so sure of my own physicality. Soon the water is about our waists and provides a steadying force.“I think I’ll be right from here,” he says.

He emerges, grinning like a kid, eyes wide.I tell him I might swim out a little, and he tells me to go for it.

Treading through his homeland of the Lake District more than two centuries later, on a radiant early spring day, sunbeams casting through the bare branches to anoint the daffodils, it’s a compelling edict.As a founding father of England’s Romantic poetry movement, Wordsworth’s legacy is synonymous with the rolling, rugged landscapes of the Lakes. He and his contemporaries Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey were collectively known as the “Lake Poets”, and to gaze on the region’s deep, still waters and scrabble across its fells is to understand the source of his artistic inspiration, centuries on.Wordsworth walk mapThat, at least, is the aim of a new walking route dedicated to the literary giant’s life and work.The Wordsworth Way– which was unveiled on 7 April to celebrate the poet’s 255th birthday – threads strands of pre-existing footpaths together to form a signposted 14-mile trail stretching from the shores of Ullswater to the tourist town of Ambleside. It’s a region that Gordon Lightburn, Chair of Friends of the Ullswater Way, which delivered the project with partners including Wordsworth Grasmere and the University of Cumbria, refers to as “the cradle of the Romantic literature movement”. The route contemplates the former poet laureate’s “plain living and high thinking” philosophy by connecting places linked to his verses and his personal history, as well as those of his friends and family.“The idea is to get people experiencing the Lakes the way the Romantics did, by slowing down, noticing the details in the landscape, and reflecting on nature,” says Jade Cookson, a University of Cumbria alumnus who wrote a guidebook on the new route. “It’s about seeing the world through Wordsworth’s eyes and understanding why this place meant so much to him.”View image in fullscreenRydal Water.Photograph: Nicky Beeson/AlamyThe Wordsworth Way can be enjoyed as a 14-mile point-to-point walk, or a more leisurely 21-mile route involving three other circular walks, with convenient public transport links at either end. The walk itself offers a mix of bracing fell walking around Grisedale Tarn, and civilised strolling through the village of Grasmere to provide a sweeping overview of the poet’s life and influence, while paintings and pencil sketches featured in the guide bring to life the views as they would have looked in Wordsworth’s day.I stock up on Grasmere gingerbread for my trek towards the commanding Sour Milk Ghyll waterfall, a favourite spot of William and DorothyKicking things off, walk one is an 8.3-mile yomp from Glenridding village up towards Grisedale Tarn and the craggy horizons of Helvellyn. Considering the poet’s formative years, it takes in poignant sites such as the Brothers Parting Stone, a memorial immortalising a goodbye between Wordsworth, his sister Dorothy and his brother John, who would go on to die at sea. The indistinct-looking weather-beaten rock, which is signalled by a metal plaque, bears an inscription from Wordsworth’s poem In Memory of My Brother, in which he probes his grief. Its exposed location high on the fells, surrounded by nothing but grass, rocks and rolling hills, hints at the loneliness the words depict.View image in fullscreenThe Wordsworth Graves at St Oswald’s church in Grasmere.Photograph: Dave Porter/AlamyTodayI’m picking up the route at the start of walk two in Grasmere, where the adult Wordsworth and his brood lived for almost 15 years. A contemplative pause at the family graves, which lie in the churchyard of the historic St Oswald’s, in the shade of a series of yew trees planted by the poet, offers a sense of his community-mindedness. I’m distracted, though, by the heady scent of Cumbrian rum butter drifting through the moss-covered headstones: the school house that Wordsworth’s children attended is now home to the oldest gingerbread shop in the UK,Sarah Nelson’s Grasmere Gingerbread. I stock up on the crumbly, chewy biscuits for my trek under the midday sun over the flat fields towards the commanding Sour Milk Ghyll waterfall, a favourite spot of William and Dorothy. I tackle the steep climb to a solitary lookout bench at Greenhead Gill, whose “tumultuous brook” and “upright path” is immortalised in Wordsworth’s lyrical poem Michael. Pausing for breath at the bench at the edge of the slope, I’m surprised at how dramatic the drop is, but the peaceful valley seems mostly unchanged since the day he wrote: “The mountains have all opened out themselves / And made a hidden valley of their own.”Continuing on, I pick up walk three at Wordsworth’s former home ofDove Cottageon the edge of the village, which has been preserved, along with its charming fellside garden, as an ode to his daily life with Dorothy alongside his growing family. It is well worth a pit stop, as is the adjacent museum offering detailed context of his creative life. From here, I take the path that rises gently to meet a historic and occasionally scrabbly coffin route offering serene views over a tranquil-looking Rydal Water, which ends atRydal Mount, another house rented by Wordsworth.View image in fullscreenThe ascent to Greenhead Gill.Photograph: Shanna McGoldrickThis section of the route focuses on family, leading me to discover the hushed enclave of John’s Grove, where William and Dorothy would remember their brother, and later to Dora’s Field, a daffodil-covered patch of land that Wordsworth bought to remember his eldest daughter, whom he outlived. From there, I continue on to walk four, which examines the impact of his legacy by exploring the homes and lives of additional literary figures connected to Wordsworth and the Lakes. It weaves on easy footpaths to Ambleside, taking in houses formerly occupied by Thomas De Quincey and Harriet Martineau, and concludes at the site of the famous “Wordsworth steps” at what used to be the residence of his relative Dorothy Harrison, and is now part of the University of Cumbria’s Ambleside campus.Dorothy Wordsworth often takes centre stage on this walk, her words appearing frequently in Jade Cookson’s guidebook to bring anecdotes and places to life. As the reader approaches the Sour Milk Ghyll waterfall, for example, a passage from Dorothy’s diary recalls “the valley of its winter yellow, but the bed of the brook still in some places almost shaded with leaves”; while a stop at the Rectory, another Wordsworth residence en route, relates to excerpts from a tragic letter that Dorothy wrote to Thomas De Quincey to describe the death of William’s young daughter Catherine, which occurred during the family’s time at the house. “Part of doing this is to try to give her a little bit more recognition as well; the recognition that she deserves,” says Lightburn. He asserts boldly: “Her prose is far better than William’s, and her poetry is just as good.” Cookson was also keen to highlight her role in the Wordsworth story: “His huge body of work was a team effort,” she says. “His sister, Dorothy, and wife, Mary, played a big role in shaping his work.”View image in fullscreenRydal Mount, one of Wordsworth’s homes on the route.Photograph: Gordon LightburnIt’s hard not to wonder what Wordsworth, who was steadfastly opposed to tourism in the area, would have made of the Lake District today, with its luxury hotels and traffic constantly snaking between Windermere and Ambleside. “He’d probably have mixed feelings,” says Cookson. “He’d likely object to the crowds and infrastructure, but might appreciate efforts to conserve the landscape.” That said, as the Wordsworth Way proves, opportunities to turn off the beaten path and take a more meditative direction still abound.For more information, seeullswaterheritage.org/wordsworth-way.

Shortly after she moved out in the summer of 2022 she was contacted by ScottishPower about a £1,000 debt.Given it was a pay-as-you-gometer, we questioned how this was possible. But instead ofinvestigating, the debt was passed to a recoveryfirm, which started chasing her for money in March 2023.The debt collection firm told us the £1,090 debt had built up between December 2017 and July 2022. In 2017, my daughter was still at school and living at home. She only lived in the flat from November 2020 to July 2022.Because she wasstudying, I offered to sort this out. I went back toScottishPower to raise a complaint and threatened to contact the Energy Ombudsman.Finally, last July, 16 months later,ScottishPower confirmed there had been an error during an IT upgrade.It said the debt had been recalled and the payment default removed from my daughter’s credit file.I thought that was the end of it until last month when I started getting emails and texts from a different debt collection agency. I contactedScottishPower but it didn’t respond.Even if I get this new caseclosed, how can I be sure that the debt has really been cancelled and that any “black marks” have been removed from her credit file?JL,PerthScottish Power billed my late-grandfather for power he didn’t useRead moreMy goodness, what a saga – and one that is genuinely Kafkaesque, given the flat had a prepayment meter that only allowed her to go £5 into the red.In your full letter you correctly point out that under back billing rules, a supplier cannot charge for energy used more than 12 months ago if you were not correctly billed for it. But along the way there have been numerous red herrings.When I asked ScottishPower to investigate, it confirmed the “debt” was written off last year. The issue resurfaced because it then sold written-off debts to a third party. Your daughter’s account was among them even though her case should have been dealt with as a billing adjustment.ScottishPower has now eventually established that payments made by your daughter and her flatmates were being credited to a closed account in the landlord’s name and this was £106 in credit. It is refunding this sum along with a goodwill gesture of £250.A spokesperson for ScottishPower said: “We have withdrawn all action and apologise for the inconvenience this has caused. We’ve issued a goodwill payment in recognition of the customer’s experience and can confirm there will be no adverse effect on her credit rating.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

The passage of nearly half a decade has dimmed neither the fear nor the threat.Mohammed Ibrahim, now in hiding with his wife, Amina, and two children, Daniel and Helene, is a target of the Taliban because he worked on behalf of the Australian government.0:18'An honour': Mohammed Ibrahim describes his work for Australia – audioBetween 2011 and 2015 in republican Afghanistan, he was employed by the international NGO Save the Children on a program known asChildren of Uruzgan. It was funded by Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.The program built and ran schools for children in one of Afghanistan’s poorest provinces, aiming to establish 50 kindergartens across a part of the country where six in 10 children never set foot inside a classroom. It taught girls to read and vaccinated children who never visited a hospital. The program trained dozens of doctors in neonatal care in the country with the highest infant mortality rate in the world.A video loop of a woman cooking on an open fire in front of snowy mountainsFootage shot by Ibrahim in his home provinceIn the middle of it all was Ibrahim, quietly travelling from village to village, translating for Australian aid workers as they spoke with village elders, delivering vaccines to doctors, distributing cash to rural women.Ibrahim was proud of his work and the difference it was making in the forgotten corners of Afghanistan: “Working on those projects was an honour for me to serve my country and also help the Australian government.‘If you want us to die, we need to know’: hundreds of thousands of Afghans are waiting for visas to Australia – and time is running outRead more“But later my connection with the Australian government and work experience with Save the Children became a danger for me and my family’s life. Because the Taliban think we are infidels and need to be killed because we worked and helped foreigners.”That Ibrahim’s work on behalf of Australia has made him a target has been recognised by the Australian government. He has been granted locally engaged employee (Lee) certification – a formal recognition for those who worked with and for Australia“and are at risk of harm as a result of their work”.But Ibrahim is still stranded.‘Infidels’Kabul fell with a terrifying swiftnesson the morning of 15 August 2021. Two decades of Afghanistan’s flawed and fragile republican experiment collapsed with barely a whimper after a calamitous withdrawal dealDonald Trump signed with the Taliban.International hopes for a reformed Taliban, that their desire for international legitimacy would restrain the most grotesque of their tendencies – their silencing of women, their brutality towards minorities – were short-lived. The Taliban were unrepentant, unreformed.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThose who had served the former administration and the western infidels who had backed it, or those who were members of ethnic minorities such as the Hazara, were cowed back into the shadows.Ibrahim – both – was forced to flee.Outside his work Ibrahim had used his burgeoning multimedia skills to film short videos of life in the mountainous villages of his home province, posting them online as a celebration of Hazara music, art and culture. But the footage shows music and poetry performances, women playing sport and with their faces uncovered: further antagonising the fundamentalist Taliban.In the long years since, he and his family have led a precarious, peripatetic existence, skipping from his home province to remote mountain villages to the capital, Kabul, and back and forth over the country’s dangerous borderlands.“Taliban visited my house … and asked my neighbours, ‘Where are your infidel neighbours? We have to find them, we must arrest them because they are infidels.’ And my neighbours told [them] that I ran away and they don’t know where I escaped to.”View image in fullscreenTaliban soldiers stand guard at a checkpoint in Kabul.Photograph: Ali Khara/ReutersIbrahim hoped Kabul’s size might offer protection. But even there were Taliban who knew his history.“We had to change our location every day and week so they could not find us,” he says.Patrols prowled the streets, stopped people and demanded documents. Gunmen followed others to their homes. Dozens crowded into tiny, dark apartments, too frightened to go out.“Everywhere was Taliban … I will never forget those difficult days we spent hungry and thirsty with a lot of fear there because Taliban were searching for us and we were not able to even go to a shop to purchase food.”0:36'With food, water and blankets we stand until morning in the middle of thousands of people' – audioIbrahim and his family set out on foot for Torkham, the mountainous border crossing intoPakistan.

I was very worried because … four or five children died in front of my eyes on the border.”This time they made it across. Pakistan was a sanctuary of sorts. The Taliban’s reach was weaker, though not extinguished. But among thousands of Afghan immigrants, Ibrahim and his family were at the mercy of unscrupulous landlords who exploited their lack of connections and temporary documents. When their visas expired, they were expelled back into Afghanistan.Since then, the unhappy dance has continued. Sometimes every few days, Ibrahim and his family will pick up and leave, careful not to compromise anybody with information about where they might be headed.Occasionally, too rarely, they get a few weeks of quiet, of relative stability. But always with the knowledge it could end without warning – with a flash of recognition on a street corner, a suspicion insufficiently appeased.A video loop of a buildings in the snow, then a dog greeting women and childrenLife in a remote mountain village filmed by IbrahimGuardian Australia is not revealing where – not even which country – the family are now sheltering.‘Delays, double handling’Trying to get to Australia is a two-step process. The first, obtaining Lee certification, is a reflection, the government says, of “Australia’s view of its moral obligation to current and former employees who have provided valuable support to Australia’s efforts in Afghanistan”.Alone, it counts for little – it’s not much more than another compromising document should it fall into Taliban hands.Let me explain, my dear son, why I left you in Afghanistan.

(A Lee program review found the two-step process“causes delays, double handling and confusion, and imposes an administrative burden on applicants”. It heard numerous Lee candidates had been “left behind” in danger in Afghanistan.)Ibrahim’s Lee certification means the family’s application for humanitarian visas will be prioritised – a recognition that it is their connection to Australia that has brought them into danger.But there are barriers still. Ibrahim’s application for a humanitarian visa has sat with the Department of Home Affairs since 2022.0:29'If the Taliban find us they will kill us' – audioStranded in Afghanistan, Ibrahim has found himself caught in a bizarre catch-22. The Australian government told him it could not progress his visa application from within Afghanistan but, at the same time, advised him not to leave the country.A letter from Dfat told him: “Due to the closure of panel doctors in Afghanistan, we are currently unable to invite applicants to undertake medicals if located in Afghanistan.“The department is unable to assist clients to travel outside of Afghanistan, and do not advise travel due to safety concerns.”‘Serious mess’Ibrahim has a web of support that stretches around the world. He has letters of recommendation from former colleagues as far afield as Singapore and the US.From Australia, he has offers of housing and community support, even employment.A video loop of a woman tending plants on a hillside with a wildflower in the foregroundIbrahim is keeping his children warm through a bitter winter with the hope that spring may bring better newsGovernment figures provided to Guardian Australia show that to the end of January, 2,427 Afghans have been Lee certified: 674 by Dfat, 1,741 by the defence department and 12 by Australian federal police.Barely a third of them have reached Australia – 817 have travelled to Australia on class XB visas (with 2,368 immediate family members), while 82 have been granted visas (with 321 family members) and 116 applications for humanitarian visas are before the Department of Home Affairs.“The former Liberal government failed to adequately plan for the evacuation of Afghan LEE and former ministers, including Peter Dutton, oversaw a program plagued by inconsistent and irregular decision making and poor communication with applicants,” said a spokesperson for the foreign affairs minister,Penny Wong.Since Wong took office in 2022, more than 500 applicants have been certified under Dfat’s program –including Ibrahim – more than all previous foreign ministers combined.“The Albanese government is focused on cleaning up the serious mess left by the Morrison government and we remain committed to doing what we can to assist those who helped Australia’s mission in Afghanistan.”Ibrahim is planning the next move with his family. The plan is uncertain, contingent on what is possible, on the squeeze-and-release of the Taliban’s capricious rule.He is keeping his children warm through a bitter winter with the hope that spring may bring better news.“I would like to come to Australia,” he says quietly. “Because I and my family will be safe from being arrested and killed by the Taliban.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumAfghanistanMigrationSouth and central AsiaAustralian politicsPenny WongfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Back in January, US president Donald Trump threatened to imposea tariff of 10%on Chinese imports. Less than three months later,the rate is now 125%.China has condemned the tariffs. As well as applying its ownreciprocal tariff of 84% on US imports, Beijing has been fighting a war of words.“When challenged, we will never back down,” said China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian. The commerce ministrysaid: “China will fight to the end if the US side is bent on going down the wrong path.” Further countermeasures have been promised by Beijing.The tit-for-tat measures could spark fears of a race to the bottom, with ordinary people suffering as prices rise and a fears of a global recession grow.But although China’s economy has in recent years beenbeset by its own challenges, when it comes to tariffs specifically, Beijing is unlikely to blink first.“For President Xi, there is only one politically viable response to Trump’s latest threat: Bring it on! Having already surprised domestic audiences with a forceful 34% reciprocal tariff, any appearance of backing down would be politically untenable,” says Diana Choyleva, founder and chief economist at Enodo Economics, a forecasting firm.One of the most helpful factors in Beijing’s favour is the fact that the US is far more dependent on Chinese imports thanChinais on the US.The main items that the US imports from China are consumer goods, such as smartphones, computers and toys. Last week, analysts at Rosenblatt Securities predicted that the cost of the cheapest iPhone available in the US could rise from $799 to $1,142 – and that was when Trump’s China tariffs were just 54%. “Trump cannot credibly deflect blame on to China for these economic hardships,” Choyleva says.In contrast, the goods that China imports from the US are industrial and manufacturing supplies, such as soya beans, fossil fuels and jet engines. It is much easier for price increases in these commodities to be absorbed before a consumer gets their wallet – or in the case of China, their smartphone – out to pay.China US trade chartPlus, this is not China’s first rodeo. Since Trump’s first trade war with China in 2018, China has ramped up trade with other countries, making it less dependent on the US. Between 2018 and 2020, Brazil’s soya bean exports to China increased by more than 45% compared to the 2015-2017 average, while US exports declined 38% over the same period. China is still the largest market for US agricultural goods, but the market is shrinking, hurting American farmers. In 2024, the US exported $29.25bn of agricultural products to China, down from $42.8bn in 2022.China has other measures up its sleeve. On Tuesday, two influential nationalist bloggers publishedidentical listsof possibleChinese retaliations, based on sources. China’s foreign ministry declined to comment on the articles but did not deny their content either.The suggestions included suspending cooperation onfentanyl control, investigating US companies’ intellectual property gains in China, and banning Hollywood films from China. On the final point, a top-down embargo may not be necessary. China has in the past allowed online nationalists to whip up grassroots boycott campaigns. In 2017, Chinese consumers participated in amass shunning of the South Korean supermarket chain Lotte, in response to the conglomerate’s involvement in a deal that allowed a US missile defence system to be installed in South Korea, which China saw as a security threat. Nearly half of the company’s more than 100 stores in mainland China were forced to close.China’s strategic advantages do not make it totally immune from a trade war. The stock markets in China and Hong Kong are falling. Beijing has not yet figured out a way to meaningfully boost domestic demand, something that economists say is essential to truly tariff-proof the economy.The political impact of Trump’s tariffs, coupled with the fear that the US is trying to turn other countries against China, is pushing US-China relations to an all time low. “I do not remember ever being this pessimistic about the trajectory of US-China relations,” wrote China analyst Bill Bishop in a newsletter. “The trade relationship is the linchpin between the two countries, and as it breaks we should probably expect other areas to see more stress.” But as the Trump administrationtalks of“Chinese peasants” and suggests that China is playing with a weak hand, Beijing is unlikely to back down anytime soon.Explore more on these topicsChinaTariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpXi JinpinganalysisShareReuse this content"

But Sergei was arrested during a routine check-in – and everything has changedMaanvi SinghWed 9 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 11.40 EDTShareSergei and Marina escapedRussiathree years ago under threat of arrest after protesting against the Ukraine war, seeking asylum in the US. Now their best chance of remaining together, as a family, is to flee again.In a whirlwind three weeks, the couple’s plans to rebuild their lives in the US were abruptly upended.On 27 March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) called Sergei into the agency’s San Francisco office for a seemingly routine administrative appointment – and arrested him. They transferred him to a detention center 250 miles (400km) away from his family, and cut off his asylum claim. He could reapply, but he’d have to remain in detention indefinitely, and risk being deported to a country that has brutally cracked down on anti-war protesters.So Sergei and Marina are asking the US government to let them leave, along with their two-year-old daughter, on their own terms.“It’s kind of crazy, because we have to start life from point zero once again,” she said. “But it’s much better than being separated, or worse.”Was the supreme court’s deportation ruling a win for Trump or immigrants?Read moreSince leaving Russia in 2022, Sergei and Marina had adhered to every requirement in the US’s labyrinthine immigration process. (The Guardian is not printing their full names to protect them from potential reprisals in theUS immigrationsystem, and in Russia.)When they first arrived at theUS-Mexico border, they made an appointment with immigration officials, and they had explained how Marina – who was pregnant at the time – had been arrested and fined for speaking out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They explained that she feared she would be arrested again, and detained in brutal conditions. Sergei could face a draft, and be forced to either fight in a war he didn’t support, or serve a prison sentence.They had been waiting ever since for an immigration judge to hear their case. When Ice summoned Sergei, the couple thought it was strange, but figured they’d need to sign some more documents – they never expected arrest.“I left home so that I wouldn’t be afraid to be put into prison again,” said Marina. “When I came here, I thought, worst case they can refuse us asylum. But I didn’t expect that something like this could happen. Not again.”Ice asked Marina to come back and check in again, as well – and she has been terrified she will be arrested too, and separated from her daughter, who is a US citizen. “If both the parents are in prison, will they put my daughter in a foster family?” she askedThat is why the couple decided that their best option would be to leave. They asked their lawyer to petition the government to release Sergei, so he, Marina and their daughter could depart the US and head toSerbia.They would be leaving behind many friends, including ones who had become like family, inCalifornia. “But I don’t want us to keep struggling here,” she said. “I came here for a normal life. I wasn’t ready to keep struggling.”More than 8,300 Russian nationals have applied for asylum in the US since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to homeland security (DHS) data aggregated by the Transactional Records Clearinghouse (Trac), a group that tracks immigration data. About 85% of Russians who applied for asylum were granted it in 2024, according to Trac. But immigrantadvocates and lawyers have said thatsince mid-2024, asylum seekers from Russia and other post-Soviet counties are increasingly being detained while their cases are in process.And since the Trump administration took office, lawyers and advocates said they have also noticed a larger trend where immigrants with pending cases and appeals or parole, who were complying with requirements to check in with immigration officials, are increasingly being detained.View image in fullscreenSergei and Marina on a hike.Photograph: SuppliedIn an analysis of arrest data from the first four weeks of the Trump administration, the Guardian approximated that about 1,400 arrests, or about 8% of the nearly 16,500 arrests in the administration’s first month, may have occurred during or right after people checked in with the agency. Such arrests happened during the Biden administration as well – on average per month in 2024, about 821 arrests occurred potentially during or right after check-ins.But Ice under Biden had been instructed to focus on arresting and detaining people with criminal histories, who might pose a threat to public safety. Even when immigration officers issued citations, they used their discretion to release immigrants on supervision. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has broadened Ice’s priorities to target anyone who is in the US without a permanent legal status.When Ice detained Sergei, an immigration official told him he had missed a summons the agency mailed to an old address last year. But Ice would not provide his lawyer a copy of that document. Besides, the couple had notified the Executive Office for Immigration Review each time they changed addresses.The DHS does not usually comment on individual immigration cases.“We have never broken any rules,” Marina said. “It’s easier to take someone who doesn’t break any rules. If you ask him to come, he will – and you can just take him.”****Marina has told her two-year-old that her dad is on a little trip, that they’ll all be together soon. But the toddler has noticed her mother’s distress, Marina said. “She’s even been patting my head, trying to comfort me.”For Marina, the fear and uncertainty feel familiar. “Actually, the fear I feel here is nothing compared to what I experienced back inRussia,” she said.IRS agrees to share tax information of undocumented immigrants with IceRead moreThe couple had departed Russia in a frenzy.Marina had been working as a photographer for stock photo agencies – but in her free time, she began documenting her adventures in keeping and breeding pet frogs, collecting a sizable following on her personal blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube. Sergei had been gaining quite a reputation as well, working with auto bloggers and influencers to build tricked-out, bespoke cars.When Russia invadedUkrainein 2022, Marina decided to leverage some of her social media influence to advocate against the war. “My blog was about animals, not politics, but it didn’t matter,” she said. “I wanted to speak out.”Then, the Russian government began enacting war censorship laws, banning public protests and imposing stiff sentences on journalists who called the military operations in Ukraine a “war” or an “invasion”. Marina tried to get more creative with her advocacy, but she was apprehended for holding flyers with anti-war messages. “I hadn’t even posted them up,” she said. “But the judge wasn’t interested in hearing it.”Not long afterwards, she realized she was pregnant. “It was so crazy – I was 34 and this was my first pregnancy. I had really wanted to have babies,” she said. But authorities had repeatedly warned her that if she was arrested again, she would face prison time. Loyalists in her parents’ neighborhood had threatened to report her. “We had to flee as soon as possible.”The couple flew to Mexico, and landed in Reynosa – across the border from McAllen, Texas – and from there secured an appointment for an interview with immigration officials, and later registered their application for asylum. “We didn’t break any rules, and we didn’t have any problems,” she said.A few months later, she gave birth to her baby daughter. They had moved to California because they knew some friends there, and Sergei found good work at an auto shop. Marina, meanwhile, began rebuilding her photography business – pivoting from animal photography to family portraits.She started volunteering at the San Francisco zoo’s frog conservation program, and began keeping and breeding hundreds of frogs of her own, once again. The family found a nanny they love, who’s teaching their now two-year-old daughter little bits of Mandarin. “California really became home for us,” she said.But they had to quickly accept that if they wanted to remain together, as a family, they will have to leave it all behind.View image in fullscreenMarina has been considering who might want to adopt the more than 300 frogs she has been keeping.Photograph: Supplied“Given everything that’s happened, we’ve stopped being upset that America sees people like us as undesirable,” she said. “All we want is to be together again.”Within days of Sergei’s arrest, the couple began debating – over static-y phone calls Sergei made from the detention center – what they could do. Their lawyer explained that Ice was unlikely to release him, and that the family could remain separated for months while Sergei submitted a fresh asylum claim and waited for his case to be heard in a deeply backlogged asylum system.‘We will persist’: Mahmoud Khalil’s wife says pro-Palestinian voices won’t be silencedRead moreThe detention center in McFarland, California, in the state’s rural central valley, where Sergei is now wasn’t that bad, he said. Everyone there was, like him, an asylum seeker or immigrant, hoping for a chance to remain in the US. But Marina was terrified he could be transferred elsewhere – to one of the more notorious detention facilities that had been in the news.And the couple’s biggest fear was that Sergei would be deported to Russia. He has already received summons to serve in the military – and even if he tries to evade the draft, he thinks he’ll be banned from leaving the country. Marina cannot return; she fears she is likely to be imprisoned immediately if she does.Two and a half weeks after Sergei’s arrest, the couple decided that Serbia was their best option. Russian nationals have been able to get work visas there quite easily – and tens of thousands have registered for temporary residence in Serbia since the war started.Over the weekend, Marina began looking at flights, and at options on how to end the family’s apartment lease. She’s been considering who might want to adopt the more than 300 frogs she has been keeping, and wondering how she’ll sell the couch.“I am crying all the time,” Marina said. “And I am making lists of everything I have to do.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationRussiaUkraineSerbiaEuropeCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now health workers fear they will surge in Africa as USAID-funded drug distribution programmes are cutSupported byAbout this contentKat Lay, Global health correspondentWed 9 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 04.24 EDTShareSince 2013, for around two weeks each year, Sulaiman Tarawallie has pulled on his community drug distributor (CDD) uniform and gone from household to household in his remote farming community to hand out medication to fightriver blindnessandlymphatic filariasis. Once he has completed the rounds of his village, he heads further out to take the drugs to even more remote homes – keeping the diseases that had plagued generations at bay with a handful of pills.But this year, Tarawallie, who works as a community health worker and primary school teacher in Sierra Leone’s northern Bombali district, will not be making his annual trip.He is one of 30,000 CDDs in the country out of a job after the cancellation of USAID’s work on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It represented a tiny fraction of USAID’s budget, but had a huge impact, aid workers say.The World Health Organization recognises about 20 NTDs, debilitating conditions typically found among poor communities in tropical areas. USAID work focused on five of the most common:lymphatic filariasis,trachoma, onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness),schistosomiasisand intestinal worms. They can be brought under control – and in time eliminated – via mass drug distribution in communities. Everyone takes the pills, whether they show symptoms or not.The programme worked with the private sector, with every $1 of US government funding leveraging $26 in donated medicines for mass treatment campaigns.View image in fullscreenTarawallie with his mother, wife and children. Until the cuts he worked on disease-prevention projects tackling onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis and malaria.Photograph: Alpha Sesay/courtesy of Helen Keller Intl.A fact sheet prepared by USAID’s NTD team shortly before it was dismantled sets out the programme’s achievements: treatments have been delivered to 1.7 billion people across 31 countries. In almost half of those countries, at least one NTD has been eliminated as a public health problem, meaning millions of people no longer require treatment for diseases including lymphatic filariasis, trachoma and river blindness.The programme was on track to repeat its success – 15 countries were expected to eliminate at least one NTD within five years, and 14 countries were in the middle of developing sustainability plans that would integrate NTDs into the wider health system.Tarawallie credits the US government for providing the drugs to defeat onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, commonly called elephantiasis. Now people in his community in Makeh, on the outskirts of Makeni city, are free of them.“Before, [these diseases] were wreaking havoc on people,” Tarawallie says. In onchocerciasis, a parasitic worm causes severe itching, bumps under the skin and blindness. In lymphatic filariasis, parasites damage the lymphatic system leading to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain and disability.Four of his relatives were affected. “They felt shame and stigma, and didn’t want to mingle with [other] members of the community,” he says.For such a little amount, we’ve been able to reach so many people, and we could finally get rid of some of these diseasesDr Angela Weaver, Helen Keller IntlTarawallie also took part in a US-funded programme that hands out bed nets and sprays mosquito breeding grounds with insecticide to cut malaria cases. That too has been halted, he says.Dr Angela Weaver, vice-president of the NTD portfolio at Helen Keller Intl, was the USAID team’s first employee in 2006 when it launched. She remains proud of “the greatest thing you’ve never heard of”. The spending of about $112m (£87m) a year was almost “a rounding error” compared with USAID’s bigger programmes tackling diseases like HIV and malaria, she says.“For such a little amount, we’ve been able to reach so many people and we could finally get rid of some of these diseases that have been around since for ever. I mean, some of them were referenced in the Bible,” she says. “To have that all put at risk is really devastating. Just in our programme alone, there’s over 100 million people that are now going to be at risk.”Helen Keller Intl implements the USAID programme in six countries in westAfrica, including Sierra Leone. Its work is currently suspended.“These six countries are ones that have been in the programme the longest, so that we’re starting to see the real impact of what happens when you actually invest continuously over time in these diseases,” she says.Pain, organ damage, infertility: the neglected disease that leaves millions of women in agonyRead moreIn Mali, “the entire population was at risk for developing irreversible blindness because of trachoma, and two years ago, we were able to celebrate its elimination”. In January, Niger became thefirst country in Africa to eliminateonchocerciasis.For 2025, according to calculations by NGOs, the pharmaceutical companies that donate drugs had committed $975m worth of medication. “Some of them had already begun to ship those drugs, and some were planned for shipment, and now everything’s on hold,” says Weaver.Some drugs and diagnostic tests “will end up expiring if not used”, she adds. Some pharmaceutical companies were hesitating to ship supplies because they feared they would go to waste, others had suggested they might need to close down drug production lines “if we stay in this state”.There are pockets of Africa that have yet to receive any mass drug administration, Weaver says. And even in the countries that have successfully suppressed the diseases “they can still come back – we haven’t changed the basic factors that make them possible”. That would amount, she says, to a waste of previously spent US taxpayer money.With organisations across global health reeling from widespread cuts, Weaver says she fears that NTDs will “suffer from what we’ve always suffered from: that it’s diseases that people don’t know about, they don’t understand, they’re hard to pronounce, and they’ve just not been the priority when pitted against other diseases that kill people”.Tarawallie pleaded for a reversal of the decision. “Thanks to this programme, you can never find someone who has these diseases in my community. But my worry now, if this programme is stopped, is the worst might happen.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthUSAIDSierra LeoneAfricaHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And in Gainesville, that message seems to have worked – for now.“Make America great again,” said Justin Godwin, an electrical contractor in Ocala, Florida, just south of Gainesville. “We are not the world police, nor are we the global providers of welfare.”Kim Roberts Rogel, a retiree in Lakeland, Florida, added: “Go, Trump. He’s a businessman and knows exactly what he is doing.”Samantha Gore, a stay-at-home mom in Interlachen, Florida, just west of Gainesville,repeateda claim from Trump that Canada has 250% tariffs on some products, though the truth is more complicated: there are also zero tariffs on thousands of metric tons of US dairy that Canada imports, thanks to a deal brokered by Trump in his first administration, and the US dairy industry isn’t reaching the levels of import quotas on any dairy products to receive the maximum tariffs from Canada.“Why is it OK for the rest of the world to charge us, but when we start doing the same, everyone has a fit? This is a short-term sacrifice for long-term gain,” Gore said. “The gain will be for the American people because this will bring back better-paying jobs, better-quality goods, not China-sweatshop or slave-labor goods, and it will keep our money in our economy instead of sending it overseas.”But others are worried. And nationally, consumer and small-business confidence isfallingas the tariffs loom.Gainesville, home to the University of Florida, with a population of just more than 145,000, is a blue dot surrounded by counties that voted for Trump.

Our margins at the importing and roasting point in the supply chain are quite slim in normal times, and I know no one who will or can absorb these tariff costs on behalf of the next point in the supply chain,” said Bill Harris, chief financial officer of Sweetwater.Harris explained the company had been in the process of adding $0.60-$1.20 per pound of coffee to wholesale prices before the tariffs, noting the tariff taxes will have to be passed along, with at least $1-$3 per pound added for high-tariff origin coffees from Indonesia, Laos and Nicaragua.Coffee can only be grown intropical climatesand is often sourced from developing countries, several of which havereceivedhigher tariff rates, such as Indonesia at 32%, Nicaragua at 18% and Laos at48%.“Everyone that I have spoken to about these tariffs in our industry feels that this administration’s chaotic ‘liberation day’ tariff rollout is only hurting importers, roasters and thousands of coffee shops across the country, which were already struggling due to the unprecedented rise in coffee prices and the uncertainty and disruptions created by this administration’s first three months in office,” added Harris.“The net result of our president’s short-sighted tax grab is inflation for consumers, destabilizing our supply relationships and added stress on thousands of coffee businesses that were already struggling.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsFloridaUS politicsEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus: a heart-pounding season of films by Black womenNesrine MalikWed 9 Apr 2025 07.16 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 07.30 EDTShareHello and welcome to The Long Wave. This week, I dig into one of my biggest travelling bugbears. Why is it so circuitous, expensive, time-consuming and exhausting to travel withinAfrica?Africa’s aviation challengesView image in fullscreenCircuitous … the logistics of pan-African travel can be a turbulent experience.Illustration: Guardian PicturesHere are some of the routes that are available for travel within Africa. Buckle up. The shortest option from Johannesburg to Dakar is 14 and a half hours over two stops through Gabon and Togo. If you would prefer fewer stops, you have the option of leaving Africa altogether – flying to Istanbul and returning to the continent, which takes a “quick” 26 hours and five minutes. Port Sudan to Kampala, a mere 1,860 miles away, is a nine-hour flight via Addis Ababa. And if you want to hop over from sub-Saharan Africa to north Africa, you are likely to end up in Paris or Amsterdam, which I have done, and felt that sailing around the Cape of Good Hope might have made more sense. And cost less. The minimum you’ll pay for such trips is US $1,000 return.Few carriers – and no cheap onesPart of the problem is that there are only a few large airlines on the continent.KenyaAirways, Ethiopian Airlines and EgyptAir dominate Africa, and travellers are subject to those carriers’ regional concentration, decisions on which direct routes to service, and the prices they can set, given the lack of competition.The result is that European airlines such as KLM, Air France and Turkish Airlines mop up the rest of the journeys, and therefore hurl travellers out of the continent to their connecting hubs. I asked a Kenyan aviation expert why it was so hard for African airlines to expand their coverage, and he said: “Every plane isn’t just a plane. It’s insurance, it’s parts, it’s maintenance.” The bar is very high for an additional route. And so while it would be great to pop over from Nairobi to N’Djamena, there just isn’t enough traffic to justify the cost.There might be, if the prices were lower. Air travel remains a huge luxury in Africa, and there are no low-cost regional equivalents to budget carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair, as a result of everything from lack of demand to the high capital required to establish a new airline. However, there is a chicken-and-egg element here: pan-African travel for leisure is considered prohibitively costly and cumbersome, and so the infrastructure required to support it, as well as domestic tourism markets, are discouraged.There is another reason that raises a deeper question about how high the barriers are between countries that often share borders, languages and even tribal and ethnic relations.The visa problemView image in fullscreenHigher barriers … Dusk at Nairobi Jomo Kenyatta airport. Kenya Airways was founded in 1977, after the dissolution of East African Airways.Photograph: Ashley Cooper/AlamyIt is an enduring travesty that in most parts of Africa, it is easier to gain entry if you have a western passport than an African one. My travel within the continent opened up vastly afterI received a British passport, and it always feels like an uncomfortable colonial throwback to produce it for admission, rather than my Sudanese one. There are strong regional groupings, such as the Economic Community of West African States, and Kenya has recently declared that itwill soon allow visa-free travel for all Africans– a bold announcement that has no launch date.Other barriers linger, and some are getting higher. Ahistoric free travel treaty between Sudan and Egyptwas scrapped after the start of the war in Sudan to stanch the flow of refugees. This year, the African Unioncalled for acceleration of visa-free movementto boost regional integration, and officials blamed enduring travel restrictions for not only the blocking of the goal of a united Africa but for hampering growth and development. Part of that slow growth is the stagnation of the aviation industry. Free movement, said the vice-president for regional development, “must be the backbone of our integration”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Established in 1961 by a collective of west African Francophone countries and two French airlines, Air Afrique flew to 56 destinations, 35 of which were in Africa. As a marker of how much travel is crucial to fostering connections, it became more than just an airline anddeveloped into a cultural powerhouse, sponsoring film festivals and establishing style standards (in a nod to this years after the airline closed, a Parisian art collective created anAir Afrique installationat men’s fashion week in 2022).After dominating African travel for four decades, Air Afrique succumbed to bankruptcy in 2002 as a result of mismanagement and the challenges of the aviation industry after 9/11. And there is a lesson there on how economic and political shocks such as recessions and pandemics are hard to manage, even by the most established players. It is understandable why airlines and policymakers may choose to be conservative.But the case for increased African and African diaspora travel routes is becoming ever more persuasive. Three years ago, Kenya announced that it would be partnering with South Africa to launcha new pan-African carrier. AndNigeria is in talksto launch direct flights to Jamaica and Barbados.There is clearly much infrastructure, investment and liberation of visa regimes needed to turn these ambitions into reality. But there is now such a vast disconnect between the growing cultural and political links between many countries that share so much, that the business case for extending them through air travel should eventually become obvious. And just think of the airline stewards’ uniforms.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsKenyaThe Long WaveAirline industryAir transportAfricaCaribbeanBlack British cultureRacenewslettersShareReuse this content"

In an extract from her new book, the writer reveals how that is changing – and what more needs to be doneByFrances RyanWed 9 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 05.31 EDTShareIwould like to be able to start this story with a stellar anecdote about how exactly my life imploded. “I was walking down Sunset Boulevard and Harry Styles ran me down in a Ferrari.” “I was dancing on a podium in Ibiza when a falling speaker semi- decapitated me.” In reality, it was much more mundane, as these things inevitably tend to be. I went to the pub and I caught the flu. That was it.I spent Christmas 2017 with what I thought was a regular illness. By February, I was unable to breathe or move. Flu had become flu complications and I was strapped to a ventilator mask. My energy had all but disappeared to the extent that even breathing was a high-end task. In my bedroom, alone, plastic casing enveloped my skin. I looked like Darth Vader, if Darth Vader spent a lot of time in Primark pyjamas. The cliche for this sort of thing is to say that the months that followed were a blur. But as anyone who has ever been through anything knows, really, it is the opposite. You wish it was a blur. You would pay good money for a haze, to black out for as long as it takes to get through the worst and re-emerge fabulous, like a contestant in a Netflix makeover show.The days did not blur. Each minute was sharpened, as if I was living in a new reality that had been cut out with lasers. I couldn’t leave my house, I could barely get out of bed, and I didn’t understand any part of that.Fatigue is hard to comprehend until you have it. I learned abruptly that it was not being tired from a big night out or burnout after a stressful spell at work. It was all-consuming, as if my body were wearing a weighted blanket that I couldn’t shake off. Getting up from the toilet was enough to make my knees buckle, pills and dignity draining down the bottom of the sink. For a while, I was surviving off cookies; my narrowed oesophagus refusing to swallow anything else, every muscle now apparently a toddler in a tantrum.Born with a muscle weakness, I was familiar with my body falling short of society’s standards. I had used a wheelchair since I was old enough to reach the wheels and had grown up happy and accomplished. I always thought that meant I had a pretty good handle on my health but it turns out I was merely a novice. If my body was a domestic appliance, I would have been asking to speak to the manager at this point.As the months went on, I waited for “recovery” – that thing that is meant to follow falling ill. I looked out the window each day, twitching the curtain when recovery began to run late. It never came. Instead, the fatigue and pain hung around, like a noxious smell. There was some improvement – my legs no longer buckled when asked to stand – and yet not enough. In bed, I looked through photographs on my camera-roll for evidence of my former life. Just a few months earlier I had been out at midnight singing at a gig with an old friend. Now, I had a “pill basket” and knew the weights of gateway opioids. In the four walls of my bedroom, my days had shrunk to fit inside. Seasons passed, the sun crept through the blinds, and I blinked into tomorrow. I’d barely hit 30 and it felt as if my life had ended.When your entire world feels like it has fallen in on itself, you tend to cling to any hint of normality. For me, it was my job. Working as a journalist became something to focus on, a lost part of myself I could still find in the dark. I don’t want to call it delusion but there was probably a fair hint of that. Besides, I needed to feel something other than sickness. I needed to believe there was going to be more to the rest of my life than simply being ill. I made a plan. I would try writing for 10 minutes in a morning. Then 20. If I got dizzy, I would stop.Frances Ryan: ‘I’ve often sat for seven hours sipping one drink in a pub because there is no accessible toilet.’Photograph: Courtesy of Frances RyanTwo years after falling ill, I had an award-winning column in this newspaper,my first book was published to critical acclaimand I was named one of Britain’s most influential disabled people. It had also been so long since I had washed my hair that my scalp was forming its own paste. Perhaps I was a fraud. Perhaps I was in denial. Or perhaps – go with me here – life is much more complicated than they tell you. Perhaps boxes such as “normal” and “success” are tricks to trap us and a day can be meaningful, hard and funny all at once. Perhaps it is possible to have a body that is unruly, broken, bruised and to actually be OK. To be bloody spectacular. To pick the shards of the broken vase off the floor and superglue life back together, marvelling at the scent of the flowers (and then find a plaster for the blood).No one really talks about it. No one really talks about what it is to be a disabled woman, especially a young one. To go through something transformative before you can drink legally. To experience pain or exhaustion or to feel 92. To navigate all the standard parts of life – exams, careers, relationships – but with a body that is different from everyone else’s. If we do ever share this, we are expected to sanitise it, to dress up disability and sickness in a palatable bow. Even as I write this I am reticent to share the details of my own experience, not simply because it is private but because it runs against how disabled women are told to speak. We learn early on which parts of ourselves can be shared with the world and which parts we must hide, lest we be pitied, rejected or shamed. We are allowed to talk about our disabled bodies only if and when we have managed to make them appear like “normal” ones. Everyone wants to share the TikTok of the girl rising from her wheelchair to dance at the school prom, not when she feels the music pinprick her skin as she sits. I think it’s time that changed.When I grew up as a disabled teenager in the late 1990s, I knew no other disabled women like me. I’d seen barely a handful on television and next to none in films. Women’s mags portrayed perfection, and sickness and disability seemingly had no part in that. In some ways, it doesn’t feel much better now. It’s estimated that disabled people make up only2.5% of people on our TV screensand3.4% of children’s books have a disabled main character.The exclusion of disabled women is not simply representational – disabled women are, quite literally, physically shut out of everyday life. Despite the UK having anti-discrimination laws that give rights to disabled people, society is still too often designed for non-disabled bodies. Nearly a third of disabled people say they find using public spaces difficult “all the time” or “often”, according to theUK Disability Survey in 2021. Only9% of English housingprovides the most basic features for people with physical disabilities. In the last 30 years, not a single friend or family member’s home has been accessible to me.It is not as if life outside the home for disabled people is more welcoming. Just 15% of restaurants and shops in the UKhave hearing loopswhile only 1% ofspace at sporting venues is made available for disabled fans. I have regularly sat for seven hours sipping one drink in a pub because there is no accessible toilet. I have missed a friend’s wedding because the venue had no lift. I have sat outside restaurants eating in the cold because the website falsely said a wheelchair user could get inside. I would like to say there is outrage each time but, as I think we all know, nothing happens. The lesson for disabled women comes early and it comes often: the problem is not how society is built – the problem is your body.It isn’t only infrastructure that we’re shut out of – it’s a decent income too.Nearly half the people in poverty in the UK are disabled or live with a disabled person. We are, on average,paid less than non-disabled people, more likely to beturned down for a joband less likely to begiven senior roles at work, all while shouldering theextra costs of disabilitywith often insufficient orno support from government. Even a Labour governmentcuts disability benefits.On top of this, disabled people routinely face negative attitudes from the public. Research by the disability charity Scope in 2022 showed that a quarter of disabled people had been accused offaking their conditionor not really being disabled, while a third had experienced people making assumptions about them or judging their capabilities based on their disability. This idea that disabled people are inherently different to “normal people” is startlingly common: separate research byScopeshows more than one in 10 non-disabled people “hardly ever” or “never” think of disabled people as the same as everyone else.The lesson for disabled women comes early and often: the problem is not how society is built – the problem is your bodyGrowing up, I surveyed a world around me that was not made for people like me, and worse, actively kept us out. I had no idea what it was to be a disabled woman, or that it was possible to be happy, to have a career or relationships. This only increased when I got sick. It’s no wonder.Womenare routinely fed the message that we must be perfect; any hint of fallibility or difference – a career misstep, an anxious mind, a diet that includes gluten – means we are somehow failing. Every open-mouthed stare at a club when you laugh from your wheelchair, every comment from a stranger that they would rather die than be like you, sends a painfully clear message about how life with a disability is “meant” to be. We are taught from an early age that good health is the precursor to a positive existence, even more than wealth or social prestige. “At least you’ve got your health!” the adage goes. But what if you haven’t? It is hard to imagine the world has wonderful things to offer you when it routinely tells you it doesn’t.This is not because there aren’t many of us. Almosta quarter of people in the UK have some sort of disability– be it a physical impairment, mental health condition or chronic illness. Look at the global picture and the scale is even more vast: theWorld Health Organization estimatesthere are 1.3 billion people globally who have “significant disabilities”. What is more, the “disabled club” is not an exclusive one: any one of us can develop a long-term health condition at any point in our lives and find ourselves part of this community. That’s even more the case if you’re a woman: theWorld Health Surveyestimates that the prevalence of disability among women is 60% higher than our male counterparts. Disabled women are by far the biggest minority group in the world but we are still the least visible. Where are our voices? Why aren’t we part of the conversation?View image in fullscreenMaking waves … Billie Eilish, left, has Tourette syndrome; Selena Gomez has lupus and bipolar disorder.Composite: Getty/APThis doesn’t mean we aren’t contributing. Far from it. Disabled women are making waves like never before, ushering in societal change through politics, business, acting, science, sport, music, journalism and more. Some of the most famous and influential women in the world today have a long-term health condition, from Greta Thunberg (autism), Billie Eilish (Tourette syndrome), Greta Gerwig (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), Selena Gomez (lupusandbipolar disorder), to Lady Gaga (fibromyalgia). We are winning Oscars, leading communities and legislating in parliaments. We are topping the charts, campaigning for equality and winning gold medals. Imagine what it would be like if these stories were put front and centre of mainstream culture. Imagine what it would feel like if women’s disabilities were not just acknowledged, but celebrated. This is in many ways why I wrote a book about life for disabled women in Britain today, including interviewing more than 70 well-known women and experts with physical and mental health conditions. I wanted to take a subject – and a section of society – that is still shrouded in stereotypes and shame to shine a light on it, in all its glory, nuance and pain.Years on from that night in the pub, I’m still sick. I’m still disabled. But I’m proud of my body, achieving, and laughing. Also occasionally, weeping. This is not the narrative society is used to. They don’t make Hallmark movies about someone never learning to walk again. But I think it is a much more important story. It is easy to be celebratory when you have made it to the top of the mountain, much harder when you’re stuck halfway, freezing your tits off. One thing makes that mountain easier, though: knowing it’s not just you on it. If there is any crumb that I hope you take away from my experience – and those I collected – it is the feeling that there are many women in the world who are experiencing the same things you are.On my more philosophical days, I think of bad health as something that happens naturally to living things. The pink peonies that brown at the edges. The honey bee that stings only to fall, depleted, through the air. Human beings are no different, really. The difference is that, for us, it is not the end. The clocks don’t stop. The music still plays. We go on. In a society that greets disability with low expectations or outright prejudice, and demands perfection from the mess of modern existence, I will share a secret: it is entirely possible to be happy and fulfilled and disabled or sick, and to proudly carve out your own path.

Richard Partington reportsJust after midnight on Tuesday, EDT time, the wall of tariffsDonald Trumpannounced last week came into effect. The new system upends decades of precedent from the world’s strongest economy and has sent global markets reeling.The Guardian’s senior economics correspondent,Richard Partington, explains toMichael Safithe dynamics of a market crash and a trade war and how together they may contribute to the onset of a global recession. However, as he makes clear, the world is not yet in that worst-case scenario and steps can still be taken to minimise the risk.Partington explains that even if the tariffs were reversed, decisions being made by governments and businesses have already moved the world into a new economic era – one in which China may make gains and where many workers at the bottom of shifting supply chains are likely to lose out.Finally, the pair discuss whether all of this global economic turbulence may, in fact, be part of Trump’s plan.Photograph: Ole Berg-Rusten/EPAExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsToday in FocusStock marketsTariffsEconomicsDonald TrumpInternational trade"

Half of Sudan’s population are judged to be desperately short of food, with 11 million people internally displaced.The initiative holds risks for the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, since it may require him to place pressure on some of the UK’s Middle Eastern allies to make good on their promises no longer to arm the warring parties.The UK along with Germany and France, which are co-hosting the conference, have not invited to London the two warring parties, the Sudanese Armed Forces or the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), aparamilitary group that has attacked non-Arabic groups in Darfur.The two sides are judged to be a long way from seeking peace and it is thought diplomatic energy is best placed on securing a consensus among rival external backers that a ceasefire must be demanded and impunity for war crimes will end.‘No one recognised him, even as he said his name’: last video of rescued man shows horror of Sudan torture campsRead moreSudan’s foreign minister, Ali Youssef, has written to Lammy to protest against his exclusion. Youssef also criticised invitations to the conference for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Chad and Kenya, which he termed “stakeholders in the war”.Sudan’s government has accused the UAE, a close UK ally, of complicity in genocide by covertly arming the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti. The UAE has condemned as a publicity stunt the Sudanese government’s decision to take on 10 April its claim of UAE complicity to the international court of justice, saying Abu Dhabi helped the RSF commit genocide against the Masalit tribe in West Darfur.The Sudanese government, itself backed by another UK ally Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt, has also been accused of war crimes. Both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF have formally been accused by the UN of using starvation as a weapon of war.A harsh spotlight is also very likely to fall in London on the impact of USAID cuts on the provision of humanitarian aid in Sudan as well as the withdrawal of funding from academic groups that have been monitoring war crimes and the build-up of famine.NGOs such as Human Rights Watch are also urging the ministerial conference to emphasise the importance of civilian protection, independent of a ceasefire.At an event previewing the conference, Kate Ferguson, the co-director of the NGO Protection Approaches, said: “The conference comes at a critical moment for civilians in Sudan as areas of control under various armed forces rapidly evolve and civilians face an increasing spectrum of varied attack.”She added: “A new vehicle is needed to take forward civilian protection. This is a moment here to create something new that is desperately needed – whether that is a coalition of conscience or a contact group.”Ferguson added that “citizens were facing an unimaginable triple threat of armed conflict, identity-based atrocity crimes and humanitarian catastrophe”.Shayna Lewis from Avaaz said: “The solution that can yield the greatest impact for civilian protection is the restoration of telecommunication networks. More than 25 million people are cut off from the internet and cannot send texts or make phone calls. This is the equivalent of half of England’s population being cut off from the outside world and that explains why it is so difficult for the media to cover Sudan.”Explore more on these topicsSudanMiddle East and north AfricaDavid LammyAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

SourceMaterial’s analysis identified 38 active datacentres owned by the big three tech firms in parts of the world already facing water scarcity, as well as 24 more under development.Map of the world with kahki-colored areas representing areas of water scarcity, and green and pink circles representing data centresDatacentres’ locations are often industry secrets. But by using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel and Data Center Map, SourceMaterial compiled a map of 632 datacentres – either active or under development – owned by Amazon, Microsoft andGoogle.It shows that those companies’ plans involve a 78% increase in the number of datacentres they own worldwide as cloud computing and AI cause a surge in the world’s demand for storage, with construction planned in North America, South America,Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.A grid of pink and green rectangles growing from a horizontal baselineIn parts of the world where water is plentiful, datacentres’ high water usage is less problematic, but in 2023Microsoft saidthat 42% of its water came from “areas with water stress”, whileGoogle said15% of its water consumption was in areas with “high water scarcity”. Amazon did not report a figure.Now these companies plan to expand their activities in some of the world’s most arid regions, SourceMaterial and the Guardian’s analysis found.“It’s no coincidence they are building in dry areas,” as datacentres have to be built inland, where low humidity reduces the risk of metal corrosion, while seawater also causes corrosion if used for cooling, Jaume-Palasí said.‘Your cloud is drying my river’Amazon’s three proposed new datacentres in the Aragon region of northernSpain– each next to an existing Amazon datacentre – are licensed to use an estimated 755,720 cubic metres of water a year, roughly enough to irrigate 233 hectares (576 acres) of corn, one of the region’s main crops.In practice, the water usage will be even higher as that figure doesn’t take into account water used to generate the electricity that will power the new installations, said Aaron Wemhoff, an energy efficiency specialist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.Between them, Amazon’s new datacentres in the Aragon region are predicted to use more electricity than the entire region currently consumes. Meanwhile, Amazon in Decemberaskedthe regional government for permission to increase water consumption at its three existing datacentres by 48%.Opponents have accused the company of being undemocratic by trying to rush through its application over the Christmas period. More water is needed because “climate change will lead to an increase in global temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events, including heat waves”, Amazon wrote in its application.“They’re using too much water. They’re using too much energy,” said Aurora Gómez of the campaign group Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “Your cloud is drying my river” – which has called for a moratorium on new datacentres in Spain due to water scarcity.View image in fullscreenAn Amazon datacentre in Stone Ridge, Virginia.Photograph: Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSpain hasseenrising numbers of heat-related deaths in extreme weather events linked by scientists to the climate crisis. Last month, Aragon’s government asked for EU aid to tackle its drought.Farmer Chechu Sánchez said he’s worried the datacentres will use up water he needs for his crops.“These datacentres use water that comes from northern Aragon, where I am,” he said. “They consume water – where do they take it from? They take it from you, of course.”With 75% of the country already at risk of desertification, the combination of the climate crisis and datacentre expansion is “bringing Spain to the verge of ecological collapse”, Jaume-Palasí said.Asked about the decision to approve more datacentres, a spokesperson for the Aragonese government said they would not compromise the region’s water resources because their impact is “imperceptible”.Water offsettingAmazon does not provide overall figures for the water its datacentres use worldwide. But it does claim that it will be “water positive” by 2030, offsetting its consumption by providing water to communities and ecosystems in areas of scarcity elsewhere.Amazon says it is currently offsetting 41% of its water usage in areas it deems unsustainable. But it’s an approach that has already caused controversy inside the company.“I raised the issue in all the right places that this is not ethical,” said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at Amazon. “I disagreed quite a lot with that principle coming from a pure sustainability background.”Microsoft and Google have also pledged to become “water positive” by 2030 through water offsetting, as well as finding ways to use water more efficiently.Water offsetting ca not work in the same way as carbon offsetting, where a tonne of pollutants removed from the atmosphere can cancel out a tonne emitted elsewhere, said Wemhoff, the Villanova University specialist. Improving access to water in one area does nothing to help the community that has lost access to it far away.“Carbon is a global problem – water is more localised,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAmazon should pursue water accessibility projects “because it’s the right thing to do”, not to offset the company’s usage and make claims about being “water positive”, Wangusi said.In March, Amazon announced that it would use AI to help farmers in Aragon use water more efficiently.But that is “a deliberate strategy of obfuscation” that distracts from the company’s request to raise water consumption, said Gómez, the campaigner.Amazon said its approach shouldn’t be described as offsetting because the projects are in communities where the company operates.“We know that water is a precious resource, and we’re committed to doing our part to help solve this challenge,” said Harry Staight, an Amazon spokesperson. “It’s important to remember many of our facilities do not require the ongoing use of water to cool operations.”‘Extreme drought’Amazon is by far the biggest owner of datacentres in the world by dint of its Amazon Web Services cloud division, but Google and Microsoft are catching up.In the US, which boasts the largest number of datacentres in the world, Google is the most likely to build in dry areas, SourceMaterial’s data shows. It has seven active datacentres in parts of the US facing water scarcity and is building six more.A grid of pink and green rectangles growing from a horizontal baseline“We have to be very, very protective around the growth of large water users,” said Jenn Duff, a council member in Mesa,Arizona, a fast-growing datacentre hub. In January, Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, opened a $1bn datacentre in the city, and Google is developing two more.The surrounding Maricopa county, where Microsoft also has two active datacentres, is facing “extreme drought”, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In June 2023, Arizona state officials revoked construction permits for some new homes there due to a lack of groundwater.Drought has not halted Google’s plans for a second Mesa datacentre, while its first centre has a permit to use 5.5m cubic metres of water a year – about the same quantity used by 23,000 ordinaryArizonans.“Is the increase in tax revenue and the relatively paltry number of jobs worth the water?” said Kathryn Sorensen, an Arizona State University professor and a former director of Mesa’s water department. “It is incumbent on city councils to think very carefully and examine the trade-offs.”Google said it won’t use the full amount of water in its Mesa permit as it plans to use an air cooling system.“Cooling systems are a hyperlocal decision – informed by our data-driven strategy called ‘climate-conscious cooling’ that balances the availability of carbon-free energy and responsibly sourced water to minimise climate impact both today and in the future,” said Google spokesperson Chris Mussett.StargateIn January at the White House, Trump announced “Project Stargate”, which he called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”.Starting in Texas, the $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, the American software companyOracle, Japan-based SoftBank and Emirati investment firm MGX will finance datacentres across the US.The day before the Stargate announcement, Trump’s inauguration date, the Chinese companyDeepSeeklaunched its own AI model, claiming it had used far less computing power – and therefore less water – than its western rivals.More recently, Bloomberg hasreportedthat Microsoft is pulling back on some of its plans for new datacentres around the world. Microsoft has alsopublished plansfor a “zero water” datacentre, and Google has said it will incorporate air cooling to reduce water use – though it isn’t yet clear how its systems will work.“I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Jaume-Palasí. “Most datacentres right now are going from air cooling to water cooling because liquid is more efficient when you try to cool down high-density racks, which are the ones that are mostly being used for AI.”And while theTrump administrationhas pledged to fast-track new energy projects to power these new datacentres, it has so far said nothing about the water they could use up.“Neither people nor data can live without water,” said Gómez. “But human life is essential and data isn’t.”Quick GuideMethodologyShowThe locations of the datacentres were compiled using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel andData Center Map. Of the 632 datacentres analysed, we were unable to determine the “active” or “developing” status for 16. Areas with water scarcity were defined as places where water is 10 times as scarce as the world’s average, according to ametricdeveloped by academics for the United Nations.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Additional reporting by Eleanor GunnExplore more on these topicsWaterAmazonMicrosoftGoogleTrump administrationDesertificationDroughtnewsShareReuse this content"

One man in Texas is HIV-positive and fears lacking access to medical care if deported.Ice director says deportations should be run like ‘Amazon Prime for human beings’Read moreJudge Fernando Rodriguez Jr signed a temporary restraining order in Texas while Judge Alvin K Hellerstein said at a New York hearing that he planned to sign a temporary restraining order as well to block removals while the court challenges proceed.The actions came after civil liberties lawyers in Texas and New York sued in defense of the Venezuelans who are at risk of removal from the US under the the 18-century Alien Enemies Act.All five men were identified by the government as belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang.The men were identified as gang members by physical attributes using the “alien enemy validation guide”, in which an Ice agent tallies points by relying on tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti and manner of dress, according to the ACLU. Experts who study the gang have told the ACLU the method was not reliable.The lawsuit sought class action status to affect others who were detained and faced similar deportation. The ACLU had requested a temporary restraining order to keep their petitioners in the US and for the judge to declare the Alien Enemies Act, which theTrump administrationis invoking, unlawful.In New York, Hellerstein set a hearing for 22 April to decide whether a temporary restraining order he planned to sign on Wednesday would be turned into a preliminary injunction. The case pertains to two Venezuelan men who also face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. Civil liberties groups have sued the government on behalf of the two men, one 21 the other 32, who were being held by immigration authorities at a jail about 45 miles (72km) north-west of New York City.The Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times in the past, during the war of 1812, the first world war and the second world war, when it was used to justify the mass internment of people of Japanese heritage while the US was at war with Japan.The United States is not at war with Venezuela, but Donald Trump’s administration has argued that the US was being invaded by members of the Tren de Aragua gang.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She believes he is trapped under the stage, but alive, after hearing his voice on a social media video post shared by a survivor.“We checked hospitals and the National Institute of Forensic Sciences (INACIF), and he’s not there. So he’s still here, and I know he’s alive,” she said.Altagracia Maldonado, who was outside the nightclub on Wednesday morning waiting for news about her missing friend, said three of her friends had been at the club. One died, another is missing, and one escaped unharmed.About 370 rescue personnel combed mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets for survivors.The popular Dominican merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing at the nightclub when the collapse occurred shortly after midnight on Tuesday, was one of those killed, according to his manager.Also among the dead were the former Major League Baseball playersOctavio Doteland Tony Blanco. Dotel, who was 51, was rescued alive but later died of his injuries, local media reported.Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when the roof collapsed at about 12.44am on Tuesday. The club had capacity for about 1,700 people.View image in fullscreenPeople check lists of the dead and injured outside the Jet Set nightclub.Photograph: Orlando Barría/EPAPérez was on stage when there was a blackout and the roof came crashing down, according to witnesses. Pérez’s daughter Zulinka told reporters she managed to escape after the roof collapsed but he did not.The Dominican president, Luis Abinader, said the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, was also killed. Abinader has declared three days of national mourning.By early Wednesday, the preliminary death toll had reached 98, said Juan Manuel Méndez, the director of the Emergency Operations Center. “No people have been found alive since 3pm,” Méndez said in his latest update.He said: “As long as there is hope for life, all authorities will be working to recover or rescue these people.”Later on Wednesday, authorities said the death toll had risen to 124.Zoilo Antonio Ramos said two of his cousins, aged 30 and 27, had sustained multiple but not serious head injuries and were being treated at the Doctor Dario Contreras hospital, in the Dominican capital, where they were expected to be discharged today.“They were standing near the club’s exit door, and when they noticed sand subtly beginning to fall, they had a bad feeling and said: ‘Let’s get out of here.’ Then part of the roof collapsed, but they managed to escape,” he said.The journalist and TV host Dániel Lajara said he had lost friends in the incident. “This has been even more shocking for me because I have to cover the … show,” he said. Reporting from the site of the nightclub, he said: “People are desperate, searching for answers for their families whose whereabouts and condition are unknown.”Another journalist and TV host, Camila Garcia, described “collective mourning” and “a sense of helplessness” across the country. “We all had someone there, a friend, family, people, this is a really small country … we are half an island. So we all know each other,” she said, adding that the saddest part was that so many of the people who died were “super young”.“There are a lot of people that are still declared as missing … We don’t have a proper rescue operations,” Garcia said.View image in fullscreenPeople wait for news about missing loved ones in Santo Domingo.Photograph: Erika Santelices/ReutersHelicopter images revealed a large hole where the club’s roof once was.

The 42-year-old molecular biologist was travelling and conducting research in South America after working in London for eight years.The mayor of Santa Marta, Carlos Pinedo Cuello, said a £9,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the death of the Italian national.In a statement posted on X, Pinedo Cuello said: “This crime will not go unpunished. The criminals must know that crime has no place in Santa Marta. We will pursue them until they are brought to justice.”Santa Marta, which is surrounded by beaches and mountains, is a gateway to some of Colombia’s most popular tourist destinations, including the village of Minca, the Tayrona national park and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains.View image in fullscreenThe Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains in Colombia. Coatti’s body parts were found in a suitcase in the nearby town of Santa Marta.Photograph: Nadège MazarsA hotel worker who spoke to the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo said Coatti had inquired about visiting Minca, which is famous for its organic coffee and varied birdlife, and was conducting research on local animal species, the Associated Press reported.Coatti, who did his master’s degree at University College London, was described as “funny, warm, intelligent” by former colleagues at the RSB, where he worked for eight years first as a science policy officer before being promoted to senior science policy officer. Coatti was among RSB representatives who appeared before parliament in June 2022 to discuss the future regulation of UK genetic technologies.He left the RSB at the end of 2024 to volunteer in Ecuador and travel in South America.“He was a passionate and dedicated scientist, leading RSB animal science work, writing numerous submissions, organising events and giving evidence in the House of Commons,” the RSB said in a statement. “Ale was funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with and will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him.“Our thoughts and best wishes go out to his friends and family at this truly awful time.”Coatti had previously talked about his passion for his work on social media. On LinkedIn, he explained he was “focused specifically on ethical research and innovation topics, particularly in the animal and biomedical fields”.Discussing his move into policy in a February 2022 interview published on the RSB website, he described being motivated by a longstanding “passion for science” and “a new passion for community building and stakeholder engagement”, adding: “I have discovered I really like the mediation and negotiation part of the role. You have to listen to people with different views and try to understand their thoughts, what their interests are and how you can reach a consensus.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

People will make their own judgement.”Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new US-financed dock at the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama president, José Raúl Mulino, Hegseth said the US will not allowChinaor any other country to threaten the canal’s operation.“To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades,” he said.Hegseth alluded to ports at either end of the canal that are controlled by a Hong Kong consortium, which is in the process of selling its controlling stake to another consortium including BlackRock Inc.“China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” Hegseth said. “That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.”Hegseth met with Mulino for two hours on Tuesday morning before heading to the naval base that previously had been the US Rodman naval station.On the way, Hegseth posted a photo on Twitter/X of the two men laughing and said it was an honor speaking with Mulino. “You and your country’s hard work is making a difference. Increased security cooperation will make both our nations safer, stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote.The visit comes amid tensions over Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that the US is being overcharged to use the Panama canal and that China has influence over its operations – allegations that Panama has denied.Shortly after the meeting, the Chinese embassy in Panama slammed the US government in a statement on X, saying the US has used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama … and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in”.“The US has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United State’s own geopolitical interests,” the embassy wrote.After Hegseth and Mulino spoke by phone in February, the US state department said that an agreement had been reached to not charge US warships to pass through the canal. Mulino publicly denied there was any such deal.The US president has gone so far as to suggest the US never should have turned the canal over to Panama and that maybe that it should take the canal back.The China concern was provoked by the Hong Kong consortium holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that lease was being audited and late on Monday concluded that there were irregularities.China criticises Hong Kong firm’s sale of  majority stake in Panama portsRead moreThe Hong Kong consortium, however, has already announced that CK Hutchison would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc, in effect putting the ports under US control once the sale is complete.Secretary of state Marco Rubio told Mulino during a visit in February that Trump believes China’s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the US to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the US-built canal.Mulino has denied that China has any influence in the operations of the canal. In February, he expressed frustration at the persistence of the narrative. “We aren’t going to speak about what is not reality, but rather those issues that interest both countries,” he said.The US built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on 31 December 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by Jimmy Carter.“I want to be very clear, China did not build this canal,” Hegseth said on Tuesday. “China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations through the deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsPete HegsethChinaPanama canalAmericasUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Still, he did say Beijing must have been aware some people were joining another country’s military in return for payment.“We record that they [China] knew about it,” Zelenskyy said. “We record that these are Chinese citizens, they are fighting against us, using weapons against Ukrainians on the territory of Ukraine. Their motivation, money or not, politics, etcetera, is not yet known to me. But it will be known.”Zelenskyy said he believed the US was “very surprised and believes that this is unacceptable” at a time when Washington and Beijing have become embroiled in a tariff trade war.Compiled by Ukrainian intelligence, one of the documents pictured 13 Chinese soldiers aged between 19 and 45, with their passport details; while the second document listed names, dates of birth, their Russian unit and in some cases information about where they had been recruited.Two Chinese nationals caught fighting for Russia in Ukraine, Zelenskyy saysRead more“The ‘Chinese’ issue is serious. There are 155 people with names and passport details – 155 Chinese citizens who are fighting against Ukrainians on the territory of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said, adding: “We believe that there are more, much more.”Comments from Chinese officials earlier on Wednesday suggested people were joining up on their own initiative, though officials in Beijing added the idea that significant numbers were involved in the war was “totally unfounded.”Lin Jian, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said: “The Chinese government always asks Chinese citizens to stay away from conflict zones, avoid getting involved in any form of armed conflict, and especially refrain from participating in any party’s military operations.”China says it is a neutral party in the conflict, though Russia makes heavy use of Chinese-made components in its arms industry, as doesUkraine. Both sides deploy Mavic drones from the Chinese manufacturer DJI, though Kyiv is trying to reduce its dependence on kit from Beijing.Russia was seeking to recruit Chinese fighters by openly advertising on TikTok and other Chinese social networks, Zelenskyy said, arguing that “Beijing is aware of this”. They then travelled to Russia, typically Moscow, where they were first given medical examination over a three- to four-day period, he added.The recruits are then given one or two months of training and asked to fight on occupied Ukrainian territory. They received official migration cards from the Russian authorities and were given access to an official payment system to receive money, Zelenskyy said.Kyiv also named the two Chinese prisoners that previously had been announced as being captured on the battlefield on Tuesday as Wang Guangjun, born in 1991, and Zhang Renbo, born in 1998, and said it would be willing to exchange them for Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia.Ukraine’s relationship with the US had become fraught as Donald Trump tries to persuade Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a ceasefire to halt their three-year war, but Zelenskyy may be hoping that the US president’s antipathy to China will improve his negotiating position.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyChinaRussiaEuropeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Germany’s Dax index fell by about 3% and France’s Cac 40 was down 3.3%.The S&P 500, the Wall Street benchmark stock index, dropped by 0.4% in early trading, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%. However, US markets later recovered some ground as the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, indicated that America was open to trade agreements with allies and a subsequent group deal with China.In his first comments since China’s 84% tariff announcement, Trump posted on Truth Social: “This is a great time to move your company into the United States of America, like Apple, and so many others, in record numbers, are doing. Zero tariffs, and almost immediate Electrical/Energy hook ups and approvals. No Environmental Delays. Don’t wait, do it now!“Be cool! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!”Before the announcement , China’s government said it was unwilling to fight a trade war but “will never sit idly by and watch the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be damaged and deprived”.The global economy has been rocked since sweeping 10% US tariffstook effect over the weekend, prompting dramatic market sell-offs worldwide and sparking recession fears.The falls in Europe followed another tumultuous day on some Asian markets. Japan’s Nikkei benchmark index closed down almost 4%, while Taiwan’s benchmark stock index was 5.8% lower. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index recouped some earlier falls to close 0.4% down, and South Korea’s Kospi 200 index dropped by 1.8%.However, China’s stock markets rose, appearing to weather the storm after government interventions. The SSE composite index in Shanghai ended the day 1.1% higher, while the Shenzhen SE composite rose 2.2%.Markets graphicSpeaking after a speech in Washington on Wednesday, Bessent said: “We can probably reach a deal with our allies … they’ve been good military allies, not perfect economic allies. And then we can approach China as a group.”Oil prices fell for a fifth day in a row on Wednesday, to the lowest level in four years, since February 2021, over concerns that a global trade war would dampen demand and dent economic growth. Brent crude oil futures prices dropped to as low as $58.47 (£45.82).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But many business experts and economists question how quickly – if ever – this can take place, warning of higher inflation as the tariffs raise prices.Bessentsaid the new tariffs were at “maximum” levels, and expressed confidence that negotiations would bring them down.“I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits [with the US] come forward very quickly,” he told CNBC, the financial news network, on Tuesday. “If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals.”The US administration has scheduled talks with South Korea and Japan, two close allies and major trading partners, and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, is due to visit next week.“These are tailored, highly tailored deals,” Trump said at a White House event. “We’ve had talks with many, many countries, over 70, they all want to come in. Our problem is, can’t see that many that fast.”timelineTrump’s top trade official, Jamieson Greer, told the US Senate that Argentina, Vietnam and Israel were among those who had offered to reduce their tariffs.Trump originally announced a 34% additional tariff on Chinese goods. However, after China announced its own 34% counter-tariff on American products, he vowed to pile on another 50% duty. Counting existing levies imposed in February and March, that would take the cumulative tariff increase for Chinese goods during Trump’s second presidency to 104%.The new US tariffs imposed on 57 target countries, territories and blocs include rates of 20% on the EU, 26% on India and 49% on Cambodia.The EU has sought to cool tensions, with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, warning against worsening the trade conflict in a call with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang.Von der Leyen stressed stability for the world’s economy, alongside “the need to avoid further escalation”, an EU readout said.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called on Trump to reconsider, adding that if the EU was forced to respond then “so be it”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsMarket turmoilGlobal economyDonald TrumpTrump administrationChinaStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s our fear and reality,” he said.The comment was an apparent reference to a 2015 incident in which Dutton, while immigration minister, was overheard on a hot mic joking with then-prime minister Tony Abbott about delays during a visit to Papua New Guinea, saying “time doesn’t mean anything when you’re about to have water lapping at your door”. Duttonlater apologised for the incident.View image in fullscreenThen-immigration minister Peter Dutton shares a joke with former prime minister Tony Abbott about rising sea levels on Pacific Islands in 2015.Photograph: ABCIn an earlier interview with Guardian Australia, Whipps said leaders should heed the results of a Lowy Institute survey that suggested70% of the population supported Labor’s proposalfor the country hosting the Cop31 climate summit late next year.Dutton last week told journalists that hosting the annual UN conference wouldcost “tens of billions of taxpayers’ dollars”and describing it as “madness” and “not something we’re supporting”.Whipps, who was re-elected as leader of the US-aligned western Pacific nation in November and is in Australia to speak at a SmartEnergyCouncil conference on Thursday, said it did not make sense to say Cop31 would cost billions – “maybe they need to retool the math” – and that whatever was spent should be seen as an investment.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“It’s an investment in your Pacific brothers and sisters, it’s an investment in ensuring that we have a healthy planet, it’s an investment in ensuring that we build that Pacific solidarity and partnership that we need to have,” he said.“Australia is the biggest island in the [Pacific Islands Forum] and needs to take that leadership role, and I’m hoping that the Australian public will continue to support us. I know it’s easy these days to look inwardly, and any dollar spent sometimes we think is a waste of money, and it’s important that we scrutinise – but at the same time let’s be fair and use facts and really weigh the benefits.”Palau is an archipelago of more than 500 islands north of West Papua and east of the Philippines with a population of about 20,000. It is due to host a Pacific Islands Forum meeting three months before next year’s Cop. Asked what its people would think if Australia decided not to bid for the event after three years of lobbying under Labor, Whipps said: “I think we would be deeply disappointed.”He said countries in the Pacific were a “civic family” and Australia was like “an older sibling who is taking the lead and supposed to be caring for all of us”. “We have common challenges and it’s so important that we support each other in whatever endeavours that we’re doing,” he said.Australia is vying with Turkey to host Cop31. A decision is due by the Cop30 summit in the Brazilian city of Belem in November, and possibly earlier. Australia has had broad support within a group of 29 largely western European countries responsible for deciding next year’s host but the negotiation is a consensus process and Turkey hasresisted significant pressure to withdraw its bid.It is not clear which city would host the event if the Pacific were successful. The South Australian government haslaunched a campaign that it should be in Adelaide, suggesting it would draw more than 30,000 people and could be worth $500m to the state. Sydney is also a possible candidate.Whipps said he hoped a Pacific Cop would help trigger investment in renewable energy across the region similar to the increase in Australia’s main grid from about 20% to nearly 50% over the past five years. Labor has a goal of 82% of the country’s electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030.

Palau gets about 20% of its power from solar energy but Whipps said it would need support to expand further and overcome challenges in integrating it into their system.“I think it would be fantastic to push for 100% renewable energy in the Pacific,” he said. “We know the cost of diesel for us is much higher than coal.“If we can have renewable energy at competitive rates to coal, as you have already demonstrated is possible in Australia, that seems like a win-win.”Some critics have said Australia should not host aCop31due to it being one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel exporters. Whipps said his view was that countries that sold coal and gas were meeting a global demand and if they wanted to host a climate summit “we should embrace them and we should help them because they’re trying to be part of the solution”.“It’s a good thing that Australia will be willing to host because this is their opportunity to lead and show the world that there are alternatives,” he said.In his speech at the conference, he urged whoever was leading the Australian government after the election “to take the next steps and stop approving new fossil fuel projects and accelerate the phase-out of coal and gas”. “This is not just a technical issue. It’s a moral one,” he said.Whipps said if the bid were successful he hoped a “Pacific champion” would be appointed to promote the region and the challenges it faces as the planet heats, including the importance of what is happening in oceans. “We should look at how we can ensure that we have these healthy oceans, which are so critical to the survival of the planet,” he said.The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, last month said Labor hoped to host a climate summit and he would have “more to say about that in the campaign”.Explore more on these topicsPacific islandsPalauAustralian election 2025Cop31Asia PacificCoalitionPeter DuttonnewsShareReuse this content"

It found the 54% level would likely be met in 2028. Stopping industry expansion at that level would result in nearly 29 gigawatts of new large-scale solar and windfarms not being built.2:19Dutton's WFH backflip and Albanese's mental health pledge - TLDR: Election 2025 – videoThose developments would be expected to lead to 37,700 full-time-equivalent construction jobs and 5,000 ongoing jobs in operations and maintenance.The CEC’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said the Coalition’s position would cost “real dollars for farmers, real dollars for country towns and real blue-collar jobs that pay Australians’ bills”.“The clean energy sector injected $40bn in essential electricity infrastructure into the national economy over the past five years alone,” Thornton said. “We need all sides of politics to embrace this private-sector investment into regional Australia.”Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThe analysis was released ahead of a debate between the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the opposition shadow minister, Ted O’Brien, on Thursday.The Coalition has said it would cover the gap created by slowing renewable energy construction by using more fossil fuel energy. It says it would extend the life of coal-fired power plants and use more gas power until it could build taxpayer-owned nuclear plants at seven sites, mostly after 2040.It has not said it would limit renewable energy to 54% but it has said it would not support as much solar and wind energy, and would scrap Labor’s $20bn rewiring the nation fund to build transmission links across the country.Labor has released separate analysis ahead of the debate arguing the Coalition’s nuclear policy could lead to blackouts, costing the economy billions, because of a reliance on ageing coal-plants, some of which have suffered outages in recent years.It said energy department advice provided to the government before the election was called showed on average 22% of the country’s coal-fired capacity was unavailable last year due to shutdowns or reduced operations. More than 60% of Australia’s capacity is more than 40 years old and approaching the end of its life. The energy department advice said a two-hour blackout across the national grid would cost the economy about $2.8bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Landlords would not be able to refuse except under certain conditions, including restrictive body corporate rules, engineering challenges or local energy congestion issues.The Greens have proposed that the program would be paid for through a new $10bn fund established through the Snowy Hydro, and the panels would be listed as an asset on the public agency’s balance sheet. Landlords could choose to either pay for the panels when the property was sold or earlier.Bandt said the policy was “good for renters, good for the environment”.“There are seven million renters in Australia and they deserve to be able to cut their power bills and reduce their emissions, just like homeowners can,” he said.He said Labor had effectively adopted a Greens policy this week by promising a 30% subsidy for household batteries. “I hope they adopt our renters’ right to solar, too,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerAustralian election 2025EnergyRenewable energyAustralian politicsCoalitionLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

In contrast, households in Anthony Albanese’s now wealthy inner-Sydney electorate of Grayndler will be $200 worse off in the next financial year as a result of the modelled changes enacted during the 47th parliament.Map showing how households in different electorates will benefit (or not) from Labor’s policy changes. Inner city seats are worse off, while outer suburban and regional seats are better off.In an upcoming research paper, ANU academics – Ben Phillips, Cukkoo Joseph, Richard Webster and Matt Gray – estimate that the policy changes over Labor’s four budgets will add $7.5bn to households’ disposable incomes in the coming financial year.Those policies include an extra $2.5bn from personal income tax changes (including the modified stage-three tax relief), while higher jobseeker rates will add about $1.1bn, commonwealth rent assistance $1.2bn, parenting payment $1.1bn, and increased childcare subsidy about $2bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This compares households in 2025-26 under the new policies with a scenario without the new policiesThe ANU researchers noted that 14 of the 20 electorates with negative outcomes or smallest gains were all within greater Sydney, including Warringah, Bradfield, Wentworth, North Sydney and Mackellar.“The likely driver of the substantial hit to these regions is their lack of gain from welfare payments, and the re-jigged stage 3 tax policy in 2024 providing substantially less tax cuts than was the case relative to the 2022 policy of the previous government,” they wrote.The biggest losers are households in Warringah in Sydney’s northern beaches, held by the teal independent Zali Steggall, where incomes would be on average nearly $1,000 lower, the modelling shows.The wealthy Sydney north shore suburbs in the marginal Liberal-held seat of Bradfield are the next worse off, where the average household income will be $850 lower.In all, households in 13 of the 151 electorates have been left worse off under Labor’s policy changes – and seven of those held by teal MPs, mostly by small margins.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Labor partyCoalitionTaxCost of living crisisSydneyAdelaidenewsShareReuse this content"

An official audience had previously been removed from the royals’ schedule due to the pontiff’s ill health.The Vatican said in a statement that during the meeting the pope expressed his best wishes to Charles and Camilla on their 20th wedding anniversary, which they celebrated on Wednesday, while they wished for his “speedy recovery”.Buckingham Palace said Charles and Camilla “were delighted the pope was well enough to host them – and to have had the opportunity to share their best wishes in person.”Francis was discharged from Rome’s Gemelli hospital, where he spent five weeks being treated for the life-threatening pneumonia, on 23 March. His medics said he would need to convalesce at home for at least two months.The meeting on Wednesday came after Charles became the first British monarch to address a joint session of the Italian parliament, surprising many politicians with his Italian language skills.The king joked that he hoped he wasn’t “ruining” the language of Dante to the point that “he would not be invited toItalyagain”.“Italy is a country very dear to my heart and to that of the queen, as it is to many British people,” he said.The couple met the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, earlier on Wednesday and are being hosted by President Sergio Mattarella for a state banquet at the Quirinal Palace on Wednesday night.

And it is also a clear signal to our partners in the European Union,” said Merz during a news conference with his coalition partners.“Germany is back on track,” he added.The compromise package, which Merz had aimed to have completed by Easter, must still win majority approval among the SPD’s 357,000 members via an online ballot as well as from the leadership of the CDU and CSU, known as the Union parties.Assuming those hurdles are cleared by the end of April, Merz could be sworn in before the Bundestag in early May, realising adecades-long dreamfor the longtime rival of the veteran leaderAngela Merkel.The agreement includes tax breaks for low- and moderate-income households, phased-in tax reductions for corporations, subsidies for electric cars to help the ailing auto industry and further reform of the “debt brake” seen as hobbling public investment.On border policy, a pivotal issue in the campaign aftera series of attacks blamed on asylum seekers, Merz said Germany would “effectively put an end to irregular immigration” and aim to cooperate with neighbours to turn back people at the frontier.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz is Germany’s prospective chancellor, and the longtime rival of Angela Merkel, hoping to be sworn in to the Bundestag in early May.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesBut the SPD co-leader Lars Klingbeil, who is expected to become vice-chancellor, insisted the government would work on the principle that the “basic right to asylum remains inviolable” and that “Germany is a country of immigration” that benefits socially and economically from newcomers.He said the coalition would lead a modernisation drive in a nation often criticised as slow to change. “The excavators have got to get to work and the fax machines must go,” Klingbeil said.Germany has been in protracted political limbo since the chancellor, Olaf Scholz of the SPD, whose fractious three-way coalition was deeply unpopular, in Novemberannounced the collapse of the governmentand called for an early election.In the 23 February pollthe CDU/CSU came out on topwith 28.5%, ahead of the anti-immigration, pro-Kremlin Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) on 20.8% – the strongest showing for a German far-right party since the second world war.The SPD turned in a dismal 16.4% result but became Merz’s only potential partner in a two-way coalition given a pledge by the centrist parties to lock out the AfD.That do-or-die situation strengthened the Social Democrats’ hand in the coalition negotiations, leading Merz towater down a number of campaign pledgesincluding strict fiscal discipline, major tax breaks for corporations and wealthy individuals, and an uncompromising line on immigration.The SPD extracted a pledge to keep pensions at the current rate until 2031, and will have control of powerful briefs including the finance and defence ministries.The Union will take over the foreign and interior ministries. The latter steers immigration and domestic security policy – core issues for the conservatives as they scramble to fend off the far-right challenge.Merz, a wealthy former corporate lawyer, largely stuck to a pledge during the month-long talks to avoid the spotlight despite a deluge of troubling economic news, leaving an opening for AfD leaders to hammer the mainstream parties as unfit to steer the ship through the storm.The far right has only gained in support since the election, withone poll on Wednesdayshowing the AfD in first place with 25%, ahead of Merz’s CDU/CSU on 24%.“The AfD has become the strongest force in Germany for the first time in the polls!” the party co-leaderAlice Weidelcheered on X. “Citizens want political change and not a more-of-the-same coalition between the Union and the SPD!”Turmoil on global markets and fears for the postwar order of transatlantic cooperation have also taken a toll on Merz’s personal popularity, with many Germans doubting his leadership abilities in a time of converging economic, diplomatic and security crises.A Forsa institute poll released on Monday showed thatonly 32% thought Merz was the right person to be chancellor, down from 40% in early March, with 60% saying they disapproved of him.Germany’s lengthy political vacuum amidan extended economic slumphas also frustrated allies looking to the European heavyweight to show leadership in the face of Donald Trump’s erratic course on trade and defence and an emboldened Russia.Merz has pledged to maintain Germany’s strong backing for Ukraine while mending frayed ties with neighbours including France and Poland and fostering “independence” from Washington under Trump.He has already encouraged many partners by agreeing last monthto a historic pact to loosen rules on running up debtto allow for steeper defence spending and boost sorely needed investment in infrastructure.The move to release the “debt brake” has, however, met with criticism from within his own conservative camp and drawn attacks from the AfD as breaking with German fiscal orthodoxy.Merz on Wednesday acknowledged his centrist government must use its four-year term to address voters’ growing disillusionment or risk the AfD coming out on top at the next general election.“That is our mission: to show that problems can be solved by the political centre of our country,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzDonald TrumpInternational tradeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They said a decades-long culture of silencing victims was getting worse inFrance, amid a sense of “collective denial”. They described an “ambient sexism” as well as racism in the sector.The lawmakers made almost 90 recommendations, including better protections for actors and models aged under 18, and improved regulation of actors’ agents and casting procedures.They also proposed banning the sexualisation of minors on screen and in fashion photos. They said compulsoryintimacy coordinatorsshould be present for any scene of intimacy involving minors, and that intimacy coordinators should be suggested as compulsory for cinema, TV and theatre.Women working on film sets told how, in the course of their daily work, senior male crew members would make sexual comments such as demands for oral sex. Young women described being pushed up against a wall and sexually assaulted while at work. One assistant director described being summoned to see an actor and finding him waiting with his trousers down.Thereportfound that sexual assault was common during the casting process. Scenes of sex or nudity were also found to have been a place for sexual assaults and rape to occur. One film worker said she realised that a female actor had been raped during a bedroom scene, but the director took no action when it was reported to him.The report found children were particularly vulnerable and subject to abuse in cinema and the performing arts.One actor described how, aged 10, she had to appear in a rape scene, but was prevented from meeting the actor first and was taken by surprise when she was grabbed by him. “I was petrified,” she said. Another teenager was pushed and verbally abused during a romantic scene with an actor decades older. One young child had his trousers pulled down on set when he did not want to perform in only his underpants. One director reminded another child of his father’s death just before a scene, to get the right look of emotion for a shot.Film-maker Paul Schrader accused of sexually assaulting personal assistantRead moreThe politicians called for better regulation of music schools, acting schools and choirs after hearing allegations of a music teacher telling a young girl “to look more like a whore” while playing the flute. They also heard allegations of a choir master kissing girls on the neck.Rousseau said what struck her in testimony from the film industry was how young some actors were when sexual harassment began. She said: “For some, it started in childhood, in school, at castings and went on all the way through their careers.”The actor Sara Forestier, who started working in film aged 13, told the inquiry that at her first casting she was asked to take off her underwear and throw it on to someone’s plate. Throughout her career she repeatedly had to say “no” to directors who wanted to have sex with her and who threatened to take roles away if she refused.“In our country, there’s a cult of talent and creative genius,” Balanant said, adding that some star directors and actors felt they could act how they pleased.The report comes weeks after the Paristrial for sexual assault of the French film star, Gérard Depardieu. He denies the charges against him, and the verdict will be announced next month.The actor and director Judith Godrèche, who became aleading voice in France’s #MeToo movementand called for the inquiry, said Wednesday’s report was “terrifying”. She has filed complaints against the directorsBenoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillonfor sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager.

The only way forward is negotiations, not retaliation,” Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, wrote on social media.The EU decision came after China announced it was hittingall US goods with 84% tariffsfrom Thursday, up from the 34% previously announced.The EU measures are a response to theUS tariffs on steel and aluminiumannounced by the US president in February. The EU has chosen goods that can be easily sourced from elsewhere, while some targets are intended to inflict political pain on key Republican states.The tariffs include US soya beans, grown abundantly in Louisiana, the home state of the House of Representatives speaker, Mike Johnson.Ahead of the vote, analysis of theleaked list of customs codesby Politico found that EU duties would hit up to $13.5bn (£10.6bn) worth of exports from red states, including beef from Kansas and Nebraska, cigarettes from Florida and wood products from North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.The commission has said that the second phase of the EU’s response – retaliatory measures in response totariffs on carsand the sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” announced on 2 April – would be presented “early next week”.The EU is facing calls to target US tech firms or banks in future retaliation, a potent but politically explosive target, as the US runs a €109bn (£94bn) trade surplus with the EU in service industries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

EU officials acknowledge that options for retaliatory tariffs that are relatively pain-free for Europeans are narrowing. This week, theEU dropped plans to target bourbonafter lobbying from drinks-producing nations France, Italy and Ireland, which feared their wine and spirits industries being hit by Trump’s threat of 200% countertariffs.The commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, revealed on Monday that the White House had been offered a “zero-for-zero” trade deal. She went public with the offer after the billionaire businessman and Trump adviser Elon Musk mused about zero tariffs between the EU and US over the weekend, in a sign of dissent with the administration.Theoffer of zero tariffson cars and industrial goods was first made on 19 February when Šefčovič met his US counterpart, Howard Lutnick, but the idea dates back to a previous effort to persuade Trump todrop tariffs in 2018.The outlook for negotiations is uncertain, amid questions over whether Trump’s goal is to create leverage over other countries – suggesting tariffs could be rolled back – or to raise revenues and reindustrialise the US, which points to their longevity.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsEuropeInternational tradeGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Areport from Stanford Universitythis week said 40 “notable AI models” – meaning influential – were produced by institutions in the US in 2024, compared with 15 in China and three in Europe (all French).Ina separate 2024 report, Stanford found that no EU country made the top five for “vibrancy” in AI, a metric that considered private investment, patents and research. It ranked the UK in third place behind the US and China, with France in sixth place and Germany eighth.The EU has already embarked on a plan to build 13 AI factories – sites with supercomputers and datacentres, where researchers develop and test AI models.The new AI “gigafactories” would be much larger, targeting what the commission called “moonshots”: significant innovations in healthcare, biotech, industry, robotics and scientific discovery.While the best-performing AI factories have supercomputers equipped with up to 25,000 advanced AI processors, a gigafactory would exceed 100,000 AI processors, the strategy document said.Thesepower-hungry facilities, which can requirehuge amounts of water for cooling, should run “as much as possible” on a green energy supply, an EU official said, with plans for “recycling” water if it was used.Last year 47% of electricity generated in the EU came from renewable sources, but campaigners fear that power-hungry datacentres could undermine Europe’s climate ambitions.“Europe has made some strides towards fully renewable electricity, and still has a long way to go, but this could all be undone by ballooning energy consumption,” said John Hyland, a Greenpeace spokesperson. “Every power-guzzling datacentre risks being a lifeline to polluting power plants, well illustrated in Ireland where they consumeover a fifthof the electricity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The commission is seeking to raise €20bn, using public money to incentivise private investors, via a facility provided by the European Investment Bank. The bloc is also seeking to develop European-made AI semiconductors, advanced chips that are vital for AI factories.But the commission faced criticism for indicating an openness to rethink its AI Act. The regulation, which aims tocontrol the risks posed by AI, was approved by the European parliament only last year and will not be fully applicable until August 2027. On Wednesday, the commission said it was launching a consultation on “possible simplification” of the AI Act, as part of a widerdrive to cut redtapeamid concerns about Europe’slagging economic growth.The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) said the commission needed to focus on the implementation and enforcement of the AI Act.“Much of the AI Act does not even apply yet but the commission is already signalling that it is open to cutting some of its requirements. When we know that consumers worry about how AI could be used to harm them, the commission should instead be trying to reassure consumers,” said Frederico Oliveira da Silva at BEUC.Virkkunen said the commission was “very committed” to the risk-based approach and the main principles of the AI Act, but was looking at whether there were some administrative burdens or reporting obligations that could be cut to make life easier for businesses.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)European UnionEuropean CommissionComputingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas does not and never has posed a threat to Britain, despite the latter’s ongoing complicity in the genocide of our people.”The Home Office said it did not comment on proscription matters.Hamas’s military wing, Hamas IDQ, was proscribed by the UK in 2001. In 2021, its political wing which runs Gaza, was also proscribed, with the UK government describing the distinction between the two wings as “artificial” and labelling Hamas “a complex but single terrorist organisation”.If an organisation is proscribed as a terrorist organisation it is a criminal offence to, among other things, belong to it, show or express support for it, and wear clothing or carry or display articles in public which would arouse reasonable suspicion that the individual is a member or supporter of it.In a document provided to Drop Site summarising its legal arguments, Hamas’s legal team reportedly said it represented the group pro bono because it would be illegal to accept payment. It quotes the lawyers as saying: “Hamas does not deny that its actions fall within the wide definition of ‘terrorism’ under the Terrorism Act 2000. Instead, it notes that the definition also covers all groups and organisations around the world that use violence to achieve political objectives, including the Israeli armed forces, the Ukrainian army and indeed the British armed forces.”Terrorism is defined in the act as the use of or threat of action, including serious violence against a person or damage to property, where it is “designed to influence the government or an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and must be undertaken for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause”.Hamas is represented by Riverway Law. The lawyers state: “Rather than allow freedom of speech, police have embarked on a campaign of political intimidation and persecution of journalists, academics, peace activists and students over their perceived support for Hamas. People in Britain must be free to speak about Hamas and its struggle to restore to the Palestinian people the right to self-determination.”They argue proscription is contrary to Britain’s obligations under international law to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity, and endIsrael’s illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories. It says Hamas is the “only effective military force resisting” such acts.Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “Hamas is an evil Iranian-backed terrorist organisation, which kidnaps, tortures and murders people, including British nationals. They pose an ongoing threat to our security and to the peace and stability of the Middle East and they have weapons and training facilities that put lives at risk and threaten our interests. They show no respect for human rights, life and dignity and have oppressed people living in Gaza for too long.”Explore more on these topicsHamasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelCounter-terrorism policyIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli military said the strike targeted a seniorHamasmilitant.According to the UN, nearly 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes or shelters since Israel decided to abandon a two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas, cutting off aid, food and fuel on 2 March and resuming large-scale bombing two weeks later. A total of 1,500 people have been killed and 3,700 injured since then, according to the local health ministry.Earlier this week, Hamas fired its strongest volley of rockets into Israel since the ceasefire collapsed, aiming 10 projectiles toward the southern city of Ashkelon that injured 12 people.Israeli officials say the renewed military campaign is aimed at pressuring Hamas into releasing Israeli hostages. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued sweeping evacuation orders amid a vow from the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to “divide up” and seize large swathes of the territory.On Wednesday, the Israeli dailyHaaretzreported that the IDF was preparing to incorporate the entire city of Rafah and its surroundings – one-fifth of the entire Gaza Strip – into the new “Morag corridor” between Rafah and Khan Younis. Such a move would cut off Gaza from Egypt and turn the territory into an enclave completely surrounded by Israel.The report has renewed fears of permanent displacement for the strip’s 2.3 million residents and inflamed worries that Israel intends to establish permanent control of the Palestinian territory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed more than 50,000 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.Mediators have since attempted to bring the sides to a bridging agreement that would again pause the war, free hostages and open the door for talks on ending the conflict, but Netanyahu, under pressure from rightwing allies, says Israel will not agree to stop fighting until Hamas is defeated. Hamas wants the war to end before it frees the remaining 59 hostages it holds, 24 of whom are believed to still be alive.Netanyahu this week travelled to the US – Israel’s most important political and military ally – to meet Donald Trump, who has said he wants the war to end. He has suggested expelling Gaza’s population either voluntarily or by force.

Similar to a spending review, it could be published as a public government document, debated in parliament, and be subjected to select committee scrutiny.Labour MPs launch campaign for digital IDs to crack down on illegal migrationRead moreThe suggestion comes as the government prepares to release an immigration white paper, while facing competing demands for lower overall migration and more visas from businesses, the NHS, universities and social care.Reports earlier this week claimed that the white paper was delayed following rows between the Home Office and education ministers over proposed student numbers.The Home Office has tended to focus on limiting migration. For other departments – including the Treasury, the Department of Health and Social Care, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Business and Trade – migration is an economic lever with which to secure workforces and promote exports.Sachin Savur, IfG researcher and author of the report, said: “For too long, governments have failed to set out what aims they have for migration policy and a realistic route to achieve them.“They have been tempted to make kneejerk changes in response to net migration and labour market statistics.“Adopting an annual migration plan would allow ministers to get on the front foot and set out a genuinely cross-government agenda for immigration that takes into account the government’s wider priorities, evidence and interests.”Net migration – the measure for the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the country –hit a record high of 906,000 in June 2023, in a period covering the premierships of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.Rights groups urge Starmer to dial down anti-migrant rhetoricRead moreThe figures prompted dismay and allegations that the Tories had failed to “take back control” of the UK’s borders following Brexit.According to the report, an annual plan would give the government’s immigration policy credibility by:Allowing for a more honest assessment about the pros and cons of migration.Ending the antagonistic relationship between the Home Office and other departments.Creating a more coordinated approach that weighs up interests and evidence across government to produce a collectively agreed strategy.Ensuring a predictable approach to developing policy which gives certainty to employers, universities and trade associations.An arbitrary annual cap on net migration would be impractical, but more specific targets, set by route, could be more realistic if an annual plan was implemented, the IfG said.The Home Office has been approached for a comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

The proportion of secondary leaders cutting teachers has gone up from 38% in 2024 to 51%, while 50% reported cuts to teaching assistants, up from 41% last year.“State schools are overwhelmed with financial pressures and many are rapidly heading towards breaking point,” said Nick Harrison, the chief executive of the Sutton Trust, which is calling for a new national strategy to close the attainment gap.“This is having a devastating impact on their ability to provide the support that the most disadvantaged pupils need, with almost half of secondary school leaders forced to use funding intended for poorer pupils to plug budget holes. If action isn’t taken, we will be failing the next generation.”The proportion of school leaders having to reduce GCSE choices rose from 29% to 33%, while at A-level it went from 23% to 29%.

Di’Iasio said: “And the government is set to make the situation even worse by its proposal to implement a teachers’ pay award for 2025-26 without the funding necessary to enable schools to afford those costs.”James Bowen, the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “We’ve heard of schools having to fundraise for basics like paper, online learning resources and school trips – this can’t be right. While public finances may be tight, it remains essential that children’s education and futures are prioritised, and it’s vital this is reflected in the three-year spending review in June.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “This government has protected key education priorities through our plan for change. In 2025-26, we are putting a further £3.2bn into schools’ budgets and increasing pupil premium to over £3bn to provide additional support for those children that need it most.”Explore more on these topicsSchool fundingTeachingSecondary schoolsSchoolsEnglandTeacher shortagesGCSEsnewsShareReuse this content"

The black, chequered lid is in fact solar panels that power the scanner.The postbox’s extra-large opening hatch offers a new way for the postal service to cash in on a roaring parcel trade. While letter volumes are in steep decline, Britain is in the grip of a secondhand selling boom as consumers use sites such as Vinted to make extra cash.In a process that will be familiar to those withside hustles, the postboxes can be used to drop off packages that have barcoded postage. Once customers have scanned their code – the postbox’s batteries store energy to power its scanner when there is no sun – the drawer on the front opens. They can then use the Royal Mail app to request “proof of posting”.View image in fullscreenThe parcel hatch opens when a valid barcode is scanned.Photograph: Royal MailWith competition fierce among delivery services,Royal Mailsaid the redesigned postboxes would make it easier and more convenient for customers to use its network. There are 115,000 postboxes in the UK, and the company flagged the potential to adapt “thousands” to accept larger parcels.The red pillarbox has a storied history, with the author Anthony Trollope proposing their introduction in the 1850s when he was working as a surveyor’s clerk for the Post Office. The design was not standardised until 1859 when two sizes with a cylindrical shape, painted green, were settled upon. However, people complained that green was difficult to spot and, in 1874, the distinctive red colour was chosen to replace it, although it took 10 years to repaint them all.The Royal Mail’s chief executive, Emma Gilthorpe, said that “in an era where letter volumes continue to decline and parcels are booming, we are giving our iconic postboxes a new lease of life on street corners across the nation”. You may have to wait for one near you, though, as the trial involves just five in the Ware, Hertford and Fowlmere areas of Hertfordshire andCambridgeshire.News of the postbox pilot comes before the imminent sale of Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services, to the Czech energy billionaireDaniel Křetínský’s EP Groupin a£3.57bn deal.At the same time, Royal Mail is grappling with a shake-up of postal service rules it must follow. As part of a modernisation plan drawn up by Ofcom, it would only have to deliver second-class letters onalternate weekdays. However, the regulator also wants to set new reliability targets requiring 99.5% of first-class letters to be delivered within three days, and 99.5% of second-class letters within five days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(On Monday, the price of a first-class stamp increased by 5p to £1.70, while second-class stamps went up by 2p to 87p.)The company also called for the rules to be changed so it could offertracking on all parcelssent first- or second-class around the UK.

Labour’s leadership is under pressure to offer new policies for party councillors in England to sell on the doorstep as they gear up to fight local elections on May Day.Starmer will say that visible policing has fallen dramatically over the past decade and will reiterate plans to put 13,000 more officers into neighbourhood policing roles by 2029.“For years, crimes such as shoplifting and antisocial behaviour have wreaked havoc on our neighbourhoods,” he will say. “Policing has become reactive, picking up the pieces after crimes have occurred.“Britain deserves better. It should not matter where you live – everyone deserves local, visible policing they can trust.”Officials said every neighbourhood in England andWaleswill have dedicated teams “on the beat” with guaranteed police patrols at peak times such as Friday and Saturday nights. There will also be a dedicated antisocial behaviour lead officer in every force, working with residents and businesses to develop tailored action plans, a statement said.The model announced by Starmer is inspired by an initiative launched two years ago by Greater Manchester police (GMP), which the force said had helped reduce burglary by a third, vehicle crime by a quarter and led to the conviction of about 100 shoplifters a week.As well as having a named officer for every area, GMP has sent more resources – both visible and undercover – into problem areas such as particular local supermarkets and parks, in part based on data identifying crime hotspots.Ch Insp Stephen Warriner, of GMP, admitted that police in recent years had “lost the confidence of our businesses and our communities to report crime to us”.As part of its neighbourhood policing drive, GMP is known to have placed undercover officers in shops wearing supermarket uniforms in an attempt to catch thieves in the act.Warriner did not deny the force used this approach when asked by reporters in Manchester this week, saying only: “We will certainly do our utmost to blend in as part of the community.”Darryl Stuart-Cole, the manager of a Co-op supermarket in Withington, south Manchester, said his store was targeted 20-30 times a week by shoplifters and that some of his staff now feared coming to work. “Most of the offenders walk in, fill their bags and walk out,” he said, adding that four or five regular offenders were responsible for the vast majority of thefts.In its 2024 general election manifesto, Labourpromised 13,000 more police officerson the frontline, made up of fully warranted officers, community support officers and volunteer specials. The announcement will include the first tranche, about one-third, of the promised officers.Forces will have some say in the mix between fully warranted officers, police community support officers, specials, and potentially employing police staff to free up officers in back office jobs to return to front-facing roles.A senior police source said: “It’s welcome money. We’d rather take the money with no strings attached and invest in other things. But no police chief is going to turn down more police officers if they are being offered.”From 2010 the Conservative government cut budgets and officer numbers by 20,000 as part of their austerity programme. Then, in the run-up to the 2019 election, they announced a hiring spree of 20,000 new officers.The government set aside £200m to fund neighbourhood policing this financial year, which comes out of the central police settlement. However, several forces have warned that existing funding levels mean they will still have to make cuts.Crime is expected to be a key battleground in the local elections, with the latest YouGov tracker poll showing that 63% of the public believe that the government is handling crime in the UK badly.In response to Starmer’s announcement, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “The previous Conservative government delivered record police officers, but law and order is taking a backseat under Labour.“They must urgently get a grip to ensure our police have the resources they need to cut crime and keep the British people safe.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceCrimeEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

found guilty of breaching UK sanctionsDmitry Ovsiannikov transferred funds to UK bank account while brother also convictedPA MediaWed 9 Apr 2025 17.02 EDTFirst published on Wed 9 Apr 2025 15.46 EDTShareA former Russian government minister who was appointed as a governor in illegally annexed Crimea by Vladimir Putin has been found guilty of circumventing sanctions, in the first case of its kind.Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, the former governor of Sevastopol, was accused of deliberately avoiding sanctions by opening a Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) account and having tens of thousands of pounds transferred to it by his wife, Ekaterina Ovsiannikova.He was found guilty at Southwark crown court on Wednesday of six out of seven counts of circumventing sanctions between February 2023 and January 2024.The jury failed to reach a verdict on the final charge.The 48-year-old, wearing a navy suit, did not visibly react as the verdicts were read out.His brother, Alexei Owsjanikow, 47, was convicted of two counts of circumventing sanctions by paying school fees of £41,027 for his sibling’s children.The case is the first prosecution in the UK regarding a breach of sanctions under the Russian Regulations 2019, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.Under the original asset freeze, Ovsiannikov – who also served as the Russian Federation’s deputy minister for industry and trade before he was dismissed and expelled from the ruling United Russia party in 2020 – was not even allowed to buy groceries.His wife was cleared of four counts of circumventing sanctions by assisting with payments totalling £76,000 to her husband in February 2023.His brother was cleared of a further three counts of breaching sanctions, namely by buying a Mercedes-Benz worth £54,500 and arranging car insurance for Ovsiannikov, and by making a Barclays bank account available to him.During the trial, it was largely accepted that the defendants engaged in the relevant activities, but their lawyers denied this amounted to the charges.They claimed their clients either did not know Ovsiannikov was a designated person or were unaware he was barred from receiving the financial help.All three defendants, who had denied the charges, are Russian nationals and hold Russian passports, while Ovsiannikov and Owsjanikow also hold British passports by virtue of their Bradford-born father.Ovsiannikov was also convicted of possessing and using criminal property.The trial heard that in a “high-profile political appointment”, Putin appointed Ovsiannikov as the governor of Sevastopol in Crimea on 28 July 2016,two years after Russia illegally annexed the region from Ukraine.Prosecutor Paul Jarvis KC said it placed Ovsiannikov “in charge of a strategically significant city so far as the Russian annexation of Crimea was concerned”, meaning he was an “important political figure within the Russian Federation”.Ovsiannikov was elected as governor of Sevastopol in an election organised by Russia in September 2017.View image in fullscreenOvsiannikov briefly served as governor of Sevastopol, in Crimea.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesOn 21 November 2017, the EU made Ovsiannikov a designated person under its sanctions legislation, saying that his work had compromised or threatened the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.This restricted him from entering or accessing funds in member states.At the time, this meant he was also a designated person in the UK as the country was still in the EU.Ovsiannikov resigned as the governor of Sevastopol on 11 July 2019 and returned to work as the Russian deputy minister for industry and trade.On 4 August 2022, Ovsiannikov made an online application from Turkey for a UK passport, having travelled from Russia to Turkey three days earlier, the court heard.His wife was granted entry clearance for the UK on 7 August 2022 on the basis she was the parent of a child studying there.Jurors were told she first entered the UK on 13 August 2022 with her two youngest children.The court of justice of the European Union ordered that Ovsiannikov’s designation should be annulled on 26 October 2022, but that did not happen for some months.However, Ovsiannikov remained subject to sanctions in the UK by virtue of being a designated person under the Russia Regulations.On 27 January 2023, Ovsiannikov was issued with a British passport and he arrived in the UK on 1 February 2023 – five days before his name was formally removed from the EU sanctions list.The trial heard that on 7 February 2023, he had emailed the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office requesting the revocation of his designation under UK law.The prosecution said this was a “significant moment” as he “would not have applied to cancel his UK designation unless he knew that he was designated under UK law”.On 24 February 2023, HBOS froze Ovsiannikov’s account after they discovered that he was on the UK sanctions list.Jarvis told jurors there was “ample evidence” to show Ovsiannikov was aware of his status as a designated person from the moment of his arrival in the UK.In a statement after the verdicts, Julius Capon, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “The sanctions regime was introduced against key individuals to encourage Russia to cease military action because it was hoped those with power will be hampered in their normal international business dealings.“Dmitrii Ovsiannikov was a high-profile official who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin as the governor of Sevastopol after Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia.“He knew he had been on the UK sanctions list since 2017 but chose to ignore this.“Another member of his family sought deliberately to breach the sanctions to live their own lavish lifestyle and showed complete disregard for the law.“We hope this sends a clear message that the CPS and NCA (National Crime Agency) investigators will work closely together to seek the convictions of sanction busters.”The CPS will start criminal proceedings in order “to get back illegally obtained cash and assets”, they added.Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said: “Mr Ovsiannikov thought he could hide from our sanctions. Today’s verdict proves otherwise.“We are resolutely committed to increasing pressure on Putin, his cronies, and all those who aid his barbaric war in Ukraine.“When this government came to office, we made clear we were committed to making sure sanctions were used most effectively – and crucially, robustly enforced.“We have been working tirelessly with colleagues across government to ensure our sanctions enforcement regime is both effective and efficient, and to give the right tools to our law enforcement agencies to be able to take robust action when necessary.”Graeme Biggar, director general of the NCA, said: “These convictions demonstrate not only that designated individuals are on our radar, but so are those who enable breaches of the regulations.”Ovsiannikov and Owsjanikow will be sentenced at the same court at a later date.Explore more on these topicsRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Before and after the change of government, unions have been urging the department to take more action.The letter,first reported by the Guardianin November 2023, included claims that women had been propositioned, groped and touched repeatedly by male colleagues in a workplace culture the civil servants said was “hostile to women as equal and respected partners”.Since then, more women have come forward to Prospect and other unions, including one MoD civil servant who told of being subjected to three separate incidents of sexual assault by male colleagues.Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of Prospect, said:“More than a year has passed since a series of disturbing revelations about the extent of sexual harassment in the MoD and wider defence sector, and women do not feel that anything has changed. In fact, in a number of respects things have worsened.“Nothing less than a wholescale, top-down culture change will make this a sector that women feel safe working in. Our view is that an independent, solutions-focused inquiry is the best way to deliver the shock the industry needs to change.“The international situation has not been this perilous in a generation. We need the best people working in defence and we need to get the best out of them.“That is not going to happen if 50% of the population are being made to feel ill at ease due to the culture of misogyny and harassment.”The Prospect data found that 57% of respondents were not aware of any action having been taken in the past 12 months to raise awareness of the harms of sexual harassment at work, and 46% of workers surveyed said their employer had taken no action to tackle sexual harassment in the past year.Confidence in the effectiveness of action taken to deter sexual harassment fell from 47% in January 2024 to 39% in February 2025. The fall is sharpest at the MoD arm’s-length bodies, where confidence has fallen from 46% in 2024 to 29% in 2025.Confidence in reporting incidents of sexual harassment fell in all organisations. In 2024, 65% of respondents felt confident to report an incident of sexual harassment, which dropped to 58% in 2025. In the MoD, confidence fell from 63% to 55%, in MoD arm’s-length bodies from 61% to 56%, and in the private sector from 72% to 67%.A majority of respondents still viewed behaviours in the defence sector as toxic and inappropriate, but this was down from 65% in 2024 to 58% in 2025.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Trump’s election in 2016, he joined the homeland security department, eventually becoming chief of staff to the secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.But in 2018, under the pseudonym “Anonymous”, he wrotea columnin the New York Times newspaper under the headline “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration”. Trump demanded that the Times reveal his identity, tweeting: “TREASON?”Taylor subsequently quit the administration and followed up with a book,A Warning, attributed to “Anonymous: A Senior Trump Administration Official”, again portraying the president as unfit for office. Taylor made his identity publicin October 2020.On Wednesday, Trump, who campaigned with a promise of “retribution”, signed a presidential memorandum accusing Taylor of leaking classified information, stripping him of any active security clearance and ordering the Department of Justice to investigate his activities.Sitting in the Oval Office, the president said he could barely remember Taylor:“I said, who the hell is Miles Taylor? And he made a living on going on CNN talking about the president. And I think what he did – he wrote a book, Anonymous, said all sorts of lies and bad things. I think it’s like a traitor. It’s like spying.”Trump added: “I didn’t know anything about him and he wrote a book, Anonymous, and I always thought it was terrible … We’re going to find out whether or not somebody is allowed to do that. I think it’s a very important case and I think he’s guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but we’ll find out.”Taylor responded on social media that Trump had proved his point by using the justice department to pursue revenge. Hewrote on X: “I said this would happen. Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path. Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.”Asked by the Guardian whether he had concerns about his civil liberties were officials to seek to prosecute him, Taylor said in a text message: “Well, if they do that, all Americans should be worried about their own.”Trump also took action against Krebs, who served as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the homeland security department. Krebs was responsible for coordinating efforts to secure the 2020 presidential election and countered false claims of voter fraud. Trumpfired him two weeks later.Wednesday’s memorandum accused Krebs of weaponising his position against free speech in the context of the election and the Covid pandemic, again addressing his clearances and ordering the justice department to investigate.Trump repeated his bogus claims of a “badly rigged election”, which have been widely debunked by courts and experts. He said: “We’re going to find out about this guy, too, because this guy’s a wise guy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No, this was a disaster and frankly we should go to paper ballots, same-day voting, voter ID and one other thing: a vote, you should get a little certificate that says you’re a citizen of our country.”The president added: “I think he said this is the safest election we’ve ever had and yet every day you read in the papers about more and more fraud that’s discovered. He’s the fraud. He’s a disgrace. So we’ll find out whether or not it was a safe election and, if it wasn’t, he’s got a big price to pay, and he’s a bad guy.”The actions against Taylor and Krebs came amid a flurry of executive orders and memoranda signed by Trump, who was flanked by cabinet members including the treasury secretary,Scott Bessent, the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick and the interior secretary, Doug Burgum.One executive order was aimed at reviving US shipbuilding and reducing China’s grip on the global shipping industry. Trump told reporters that he would be spending “a lot of money on shipbuilding” because the country had fallen “way behind” in the sector.Another launched a review of procurement programmes at the Pentagon. The order aims to modernise the structure at the department to ensure the US is “getting value for the money [and] to ensure that we’re getting the best possible systems in the field”.One of the orders ends what was billed as Joe Biden’s “war on showers” by deregulating water pressure from shower heads and household appliances. “In my case I like to take a nice shower to take care of my beautiful hair,” Trump mused. “I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes till it gets wet.

It comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.”The White House said in astatement on the executive order: “By restoring shower freedom, President Trump is following through on his commitment to dismantle unnecessary regulations and put Americans first.”Some appliance experts have found Trump’s continued focus on American water pressure notable.“It was very striking that the White House memo included toilets and shower heads as a presidential priority. It really was something,” Andrew deLaski, executive director at the Appliance Standards Awareness Project,told the Guardian in January. “But I think Donald Trump’s concerns are somewhat out of date, to tell you the truth.”Trump’s comments on Wednesday echoed remarks he has made many times before. Heclaimed in 2019that “people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once” as a result of insufficient water pressure. “When you go into these new homes with showers, the water drips down slowly, slowly,” he said in 2023.During his first term as president, Trump rolled back stricter energy-efficiency standards for lightbulbs, again citing consumer choice as the reason for the change. At the time, Xavier Becerra, then attorney general of California,called it“another dim-witted move that will waste energy at the expense of our people and planet”. The first Trump White House also created loopholes for less efficient appliances such as dishwashers and showers, moves that were later reversed by Joe Biden.“Biden undid this progress and the shower wars continued,” the White House said on Wednesday, claiming that Trump’s new executive order would “make America’s showers great again”.Oliver Milman contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her family had reported her missing on 3 April after she was last seen outside her downtown home on 25 March.Windsor added that after firefighters detected Zhou’s phone in the Beeler Canyon Road region, they removed maintenance hole covers “and just [kept] going until they could either hear her or see her”. They were eventually able to hear Zhou moaning from underground.With Zhou in sight, first responders conducted a confined space rescue.“Units entered into the sewage system into what we call a confined space. They went through all the processes to permit it to make a safe entry, and then firefighters were literally inside the sewage or storm drain, crawling on their stomachs to try and locate the victim,” Windsor toldABC News San Diego. Using “a system of ropes and pulleys”, he added, they “lowered personnel down into the storm drain”.After a search that lasted about an hour-and-a-half, rescuers moved Zhou to the surface and into a waiting ambulance. Paramedics determined she was in serious condition and transported her to a local hospital where Windsor said she underwent “lifesaving measures”, according toNBC San Diego.First responders have not yet shared additional details, citing privacy law and Zhou’s family’s desire for privacy, but Windsor said the case was “very unusual”.“It is very possible from what I’m hearing that she’s been there for days,” he said. “What she was doing in there, what drove her in there, how she came to be in there, we are unclear, and again, I will let our partners from the police department address that if they know anything. But it is very unusual to have somebody in there.”Windsor said no open maintenance hole covers had been discovered in the region, raising questions as to how Zhou became trapped.“It is possible that she entered into the storm drain system from one of the outlets, which would naturally be open where water would flow out into the creek, or some other way,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSan DiegonewsShareReuse this content"

They were getting yippy.”As Beijing prepared to slap punishing 84% tariffs on US goods from tomorrow, however, Trump said he would raise US tariffs on Chinese exports to 125% effective immediately.“More than 75 countries” had contacted the US federal government “to negotiate a solution” since Trump unveiled plans for steep tariffs on their exports, the US president claimed in a post on Truth Social.Stock markets soared after the announcement. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 rallied by 9.5% – its biggest single-day increase since 2008 – and the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 7.9%.The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite climbed 12.2% – its best day since 2001 – as shares in tech giants like Apple and Nvidia surged.Graph of markets in German, China, the UK, Canada, the US and Japan since 17 January 2025.The rapid recovery drew a line under days of turbulent trading. US government bonds – traditionally seen as one of the world’s safest financial assets – had suffered a dramatic sell-off before Trump’s climbdown.Trump held firm on plans to target Beijing, however. “At some point, hopefully in the near future,Chinawill realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” he wrote, as he unveiled the latest US tariff assault on China.“BE COOL,” he had declared earlier on Wednesday. “Everything is going to work out well.”Ultimately, he opted to back down – setting the stage for three months of frantic negotiations with dozens of countries.Trump had been considering the move “over the last few days”, he told reporters in the Oval Office. “We don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt. And they all want to negotiate.”While administration officials initially claimed Mexico and Canada would also be hit with a 10% US tariff, escalating tensions with the US’s closest trading partners and neighbors, it was later clarified that this was not the case.Never miss global breaking news.Download our free app to keep up with key stories in real timeChina has pledged to retaliate against Trump’s latest salvo from Thursday, increasing tariffs on US exports from 34% to 84% and branding the US president’s decision to escalate the trade war “a mistake on top of a mistake”.EU member states, meanwhile, approved retaliatory 25% tariffs on up to $23bn in US goods – targeting farm produce and products from Republican states – from next week, in response to sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed by Trump last month.Trump announced his decision to abruptly pause tariffs above 10% on dozens of countries during a congressional hearing featuring Jamieson Greer, his US trade representative.“It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you,” the Democratic representative Steven Horsford of Nevada told Greer. “This is amateur hour, and it needs to stop.”For days, Trump’s insistence that his tariffs would be permanent – and confusion over whether they might be lifted by mooted deals – had intensified concerns over the potential impact on consumers and companies around the world.In the UK, two Whitehall sources sounded increasingly downbeat about the prospect of getting any tariffs on British exports mitigated in a deal with the US, withKeir Starmer, the prime minister, repeatedly emphasizing on Wednesday that they were “not a passing phase”.Asked by ITV’s Robert Peston whether the 10% tariffs were here to stay, and whether the 25% car tariff could be negotiated down, Starmer said: “Look, I don’t know. We are negotiating and we hope to improve the situation.”Recession is a “likely outcome” of the current turmoil, the JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential figures on Wall Street, suggested before Trump announced the 90-day pause.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Walmart, one of the world’s largest retailers, cautioned that its profits would be “harder to predict” as it grapples with the impact of new tariffs on costs and customer spending.Delta pulled its annual financial guidance, citing uncertainty and fading consumer confidence, with the CEO, Ed Bastian, telling the financial news network CNBC: “We’re acting as if we’re going to a recession.”As the White House insisted the president was standing up for “everyday Americans”, and accused his predecessors of “selling out American workers to foreign countries”, some of the leading export markets for US firms detailed plans for tariffs of their own.China led the way, pledging to match Trump’s aggression by hiking its own tariffs on US exports from Thursday.“The US’s practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China’s legitimate rights and interests and seriously damages the rules-based multilateral trading system,” the Chinese finance ministry said in a statement.The EU plans to introduce 25% tariffs on scores of US goods, from almonds to yachts, with the first duties being collected from 15 April, while the bulk apply from 15 May and the remainder from 1 December.While these tariffs are retaliating against Trump’s duties on steel and aluminum, the European Commission indicated that the second phase of the EU’s response – retaliatory measures against US tariffs on cars, and the blanket tariffs rolled out this month – are due to be presented “early next week”.“The EU considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,” the commission said. The EU’s retaliatory tariffs on the US “can be suspended at any time”, it added in a statement, “should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome”.Before Trump’s announcement, the FTSE 100 closed down 2.9% in London. The Hang Seng clawed its way out of the red to finish up in 0.7% in Hong Kong. The Nikkei 225 declined 3.9% in Tokyo.Trump has repeatedly moved in recent days to assure his supporters that his strategy is the right way forward – and even declared late on Tuesday that he would expand his trade assault “very shortly” to include a major tariff on pharmaceutical imports.“I know what the hell I’m doing,” he told political donors at the National Republican congressional committee’s annual fundraising dinner in Washington. “I know what I’m doing. And you know what I’m doing, too. That’s why you vote for me.”Democrats have accused the president of economic havoc for which millions of Americans will pay the price.“Donald Trump has spectacularly failed at the one thing people wanted him to do,” said Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader. “Instead of lowering inflation, he’s made it much worse. Instead of strengthening the economy, he has singlehandedly teed us up for a recession.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpChinaTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

And in Gainesville, that message seems to have worked – for now.“Make America great again,” said Justin Godwin, an electrical contractor in Ocala, Florida, just south of Gainesville. “We are not the world police, nor are we the global providers of welfare.”Kim Roberts Rogel, a retiree in Lakeland, Florida, added: “Go, Trump. He’s a businessman and knows exactly what he is doing.”Samantha Gore, a stay-at-home mom in Interlachen, Florida, just west of Gainesville,repeateda claim from Trump that Canada has 250% tariffs on some products, though the truth is more complicated: there are also zero tariffs on thousands of metric tons of US dairy that Canada imports, thanks to a deal brokered by Trump in his first administration, and the US dairy industry isn’t reaching the levels of import quotas on any dairy products to receive the maximum tariffs from Canada.“Why is it OK for the rest of the world to charge us, but when we start doing the same, everyone has a fit? This is a short-term sacrifice for long-term gain,” Gore said. “The gain will be for the American people because this will bring back better-paying jobs, better-quality goods, not China-sweatshop or slave-labor goods, and it will keep our money in our economy instead of sending it overseas.”But others are worried. And nationally, consumer and small-business confidence isfallingas the tariffs loom.Gainesville, home to the University of Florida, with a population of just more than 145,000, is a blue dot surrounded by counties that voted for Trump.

Our margins at the importing and roasting point in the supply chain are quite slim in normal times, and I know no one who will or can absorb these tariff costs on behalf of the next point in the supply chain,” said Bill Harris, chief financial officer of Sweetwater.Harris explained the company had been in the process of adding $0.60-$1.20 per pound of coffee to wholesale prices before the tariffs, noting the tariff taxes will have to be passed along, with at least $1-$3 per pound added for high-tariff origin coffees from Indonesia, Laos and Nicaragua.Coffee can only be grown intropical climatesand is often sourced from developing countries, several of which havereceivedhigher tariff rates, such as Indonesia at 32%, Nicaragua at 18% and Laos at48%.“Everyone that I have spoken to about these tariffs in our industry feels that this administration’s chaotic ‘liberation day’ tariff rollout is only hurting importers, roasters and thousands of coffee shops across the country, which were already struggling due to the unprecedented rise in coffee prices and the uncertainty and disruptions created by this administration’s first three months in office,” added Harris.“The net result of our president’s short-sighted tax grab is inflation for consumers, destabilizing our supply relationships and added stress on thousands of coffee businesses that were already struggling.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsFloridaUS politicsEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They come as the US president proposes $5tn in new tax cuts that would again lower the corporate tax rate, and likely lead to more buybacks.PepsiCo,Comcast, United Healthcare, personal care giant Kimberly Clark and the other companies have collectively recorded nearly $500bn in profits since the last cuts. They enacted $463bn in buybacks and paid just $140bn in federal taxes.The figures are “startling”, said Liz Pancotti, a study co-author and director of policy with the Groundwork Collaborative, and highlight how the cuts incentivize buybacks.“The companies are now throwing massive amounts of money at investors who are largely already wealthy people,” Pancotti added. “This is how you get the staggering wealth inequality in this country.”Buybacks are a company’s purchase of its outstanding stock shares, which reduces the number of shares available on the market. That juices the stock’s value and investors’ wealth. By one estimate, publicly traded companies now collectively spendas much as90% of their earnings on buybacks instead of reinvesting to keep prices down, or raising workers’ wages.The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act nearly halved the effective corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and was among Trump’s most unpopular initiatives because it largely benefited the wealthy and corporations.Undeterred, Trump is now proposing lowering the corporate rate to 17%, which could generate a $50bn annual windfall to the 100 largest US corporations.Food prices have shot up since the last cuts,in part driven byprice gouging during and after the pandemic and Ukraine war.General Mills and PepsiCo, two of the biggest packaged food and beverage companies, have returned $66bn to shareholders and paid just $16bn in taxes since the cuts.As inflation hit its peak, the two companies drew ire as they increased prices and shrunk some of their product sizes. The tax cuts and price hikes have been good for their bottom lines: compared with the two years prior to the tax cut’s enactment, PepsiCo’s effective tax rate is now 11% lower and profits are up 58%.Similarly, personal good giants Kimberly Clark and Procter Gamble have together returned $125bn to shareholders and paid just $18bn in taxes. They’ve seen their profits soar by at least 70% as they raise prices across their multitude of brands and consumers pay about one-third more overall on personal goods.The two companies control up to 80% of the diaper market. The average US family in 20204 paidabout $1,000 more each yearper child than prior to the pandemic, prompting some state governments to start covering the costs under Medicaid.But Republicans are proposing to in part pay for the next round of tax cuts by slashing Medicaid and other social service programs, which disproportionately benefit lower- and middle-income families. The cuts create a massive transfer of wealth from the lower and middle classes to the upper, Pancotti said, and companies are incentivized to spend their earnings this way.“If you get to keep a larger piece of the pie because Uncle Sam takes even less and, then, it’s a lot more fun to rake in these profits and distribute them to the shareholders,” Pancotti said. “Now Trump is planning to reward them with even more tax cuts for doing just that.”Housing costs have soared in recent years, in part fueled by a 30% jump in the price of new builds since the last tax cut. DR Horton and Lennar, the two largest US homebuilders, have returned $17bn to shareholders and paid $13bn in taxes.Similarly, Comcast has blasted customers with a torrent of base price increases and new junk fees, even as it returned billions to shareholders. Its effective tax rate is 12% lower and its profits are 88% higher than prior to the cuts.Meanwhile, AutoZone’s effective tax rate is now 37% lower and profits are 116% higher, and it used the windfall to triple the level of returns to shareholders.The spending is part of the larger pattern, said Lenore Palladino, a University of Massachusetts economist who has authoredseveral paperson the issue. She said buybacks are a symptom of the larger problem: “shareholder primacy”.“It’s the legal fact that corporations exist solely to make money for shareholders – that’s their purpose,” Palladino said, labeling buybacks “legal manipulation” of stock price. “It’s weird that it’s totally legal because we have all these other rules against manipulating the price of stocks.”Executives’ compensation is tied to stock price, and higher share prices keep activist shareholders at bay, so there’s plenty of reason for company leadership to enact them.While lawmakers have proposed solutions that nibble around the edges, anything short of a ban on buybacks, or limits similar to those in other countries’ advanced stock markets, won’t address the problem, Palladino said.“In today’s political climate, calling attention to how much these practices contribute to widening economic inequality and how buybacks are a huge waste of money is important,” she said. “When we have the political will to do policy … we need at a bare minimum bright line limits on these.”This article was amended on 9 April 2025. The previous version incorrectly said that the corporations in the analysis spent more than three times more on buybacks than taxes, instead of three times as much.Explore more on these topicsUS taxationTrump administrationPepsicoComcastHousingUS healthcareFood & drink industryShareReuse this content"

SourceMaterial’s analysis identified 38 active datacentres owned by the big three tech firms in parts of the world already facing water scarcity, as well as 24 more under development.Map of the world with kahki-colored areas representing areas of water scarcity, and green and pink circles representing data centresDatacentres’ locations are often industry secrets. But by using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel and Data Center Map, SourceMaterial compiled a map of 632 datacentres – either active or under development – owned by Amazon, Microsoft andGoogle.It shows that those companies’ plans involve a 78% increase in the number of datacentres they own worldwide as cloud computing and AI cause a surge in the world’s demand for storage, with construction planned in North America, South America,Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.A grid of pink and green rectangles growing from a horizontal baselineIn parts of the world where water is plentiful, datacentres’ high water usage is less problematic, but in 2023Microsoft saidthat 42% of its water came from “areas with water stress”, whileGoogle said15% of its water consumption was in areas with “high water scarcity”. Amazon did not report a figure.Now these companies plan to expand their activities in some of the world’s most arid regions, SourceMaterial and the Guardian’s analysis found.“It’s no coincidence they are building in dry areas,” as datacentres have to be built inland, where low humidity reduces the risk of metal corrosion, while seawater also causes corrosion if used for cooling, Jaume-Palasí said.‘Your cloud is drying my river’Amazon’s three proposed new datacentres in the Aragon region of northernSpain– each next to an existing Amazon datacentre – are licensed to use an estimated 755,720 cubic metres of water a year, roughly enough to irrigate 233 hectares (576 acres) of corn, one of the region’s main crops.In practice, the water usage will be even higher as that figure doesn’t take into account water used to generate the electricity that will power the new installations, said Aaron Wemhoff, an energy efficiency specialist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.Between them, Amazon’s new datacentres in the Aragon region are predicted to use more electricity than the entire region currently consumes. Meanwhile, Amazon in Decemberaskedthe regional government for permission to increase water consumption at its three existing datacentres by 48%.Opponents have accused the company of being undemocratic by trying to rush through its application over the Christmas period. More water is needed because “climate change will lead to an increase in global temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events, including heat waves”, Amazon wrote in its application.“They’re using too much water. They’re using too much energy,” said Aurora Gómez of the campaign group Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “Your cloud is drying my river” – which has called for a moratorium on new datacentres in Spain due to water scarcity.View image in fullscreenAn Amazon datacentre in Stone Ridge, Virginia.Photograph: Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSpain hasseenrising numbers of heat-related deaths in extreme weather events linked by scientists to the climate crisis. Last month, Aragon’s government asked for EU aid to tackle its drought.Farmer Chechu Sánchez said he’s worried the datacentres will use up water he needs for his crops.“These datacentres use water that comes from northern Aragon, where I am,” he said. “They consume water – where do they take it from? They take it from you, of course.”With 75% of the country already at risk of desertification, the combination of the climate crisis and datacentre expansion is “bringing Spain to the verge of ecological collapse”, Jaume-Palasí said.Asked about the decision to approve more datacentres, a spokesperson for the Aragonese government said they would not compromise the region’s water resources because their impact is “imperceptible”.Water offsettingAmazon does not provide overall figures for the water its datacentres use worldwide. But it does claim that it will be “water positive” by 2030, offsetting its consumption by providing water to communities and ecosystems in areas of scarcity elsewhere.Amazon says it is currently offsetting 41% of its water usage in areas it deems unsustainable. But it’s an approach that has already caused controversy inside the company.“I raised the issue in all the right places that this is not ethical,” said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at Amazon. “I disagreed quite a lot with that principle coming from a pure sustainability background.”Microsoft and Google have also pledged to become “water positive” by 2030 through water offsetting, as well as finding ways to use water more efficiently.Water offsetting ca not work in the same way as carbon offsetting, where a tonne of pollutants removed from the atmosphere can cancel out a tonne emitted elsewhere, said Wemhoff, the Villanova University specialist. Improving access to water in one area does nothing to help the community that has lost access to it far away.“Carbon is a global problem – water is more localised,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has seven active datacentres in parts of the US facing water scarcity and is building six more.A grid of pink and green rectangles growing from a horizontal baseline“We have to be very, very protective around the growth of large water users,” said Jenn Duff, a council member in Mesa,Arizona, a fast-growing datacentre hub. In January, Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, opened a $1bn datacentre in the city, and Google is developing two more.The surrounding Maricopa county, where Microsoft also has two active datacentres, is facing “extreme drought”, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In June 2023, Arizona state officials revoked construction permits for some new homes there due to a lack of groundwater.Drought has not halted Google’s plans for a second Mesa datacentre, while its first centre has a permit to use 5.5m cubic metres of water a year – about the same quantity used by 23,000 ordinaryArizonans.“Is the increase in tax revenue and the relatively paltry number of jobs worth the water?” said Kathryn Sorensen, an Arizona State University professor and a former director of Mesa’s water department. “It is incumbent on city councils to think very carefully and examine the trade-offs.”Google said it won’t use the full amount of water in its Mesa permit as it plans to use an air cooling system.“Cooling systems are a hyperlocal decision – informed by our data-driven strategy called ‘climate-conscious cooling’ that balances the availability of carbon-free energy and responsibly sourced water to minimise climate impact both today and in the future,” said Google spokesperson Chris Mussett.StargateIn January at the White House, Trump announced “Project Stargate”, which he called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”.Starting in Texas, the $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, the American software companyOracle, Japan-based SoftBank and Emirati investment firm MGX will finance datacentres across the US.The day before the Stargate announcement, Trump’s inauguration date, the Chinese companyDeepSeeklaunched its own AI model, claiming it had used far less computing power – and therefore less water – than its western rivals.More recently, Bloomberg hasreportedthat Microsoft is pulling back on some of its plans for new datacentres around the world. Microsoft has alsopublished plansfor a “zero water” datacentre, and Google has said it will incorporate air cooling to reduce water use – though it isn’t yet clear how its systems will work.“I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Jaume-Palasí. “Most datacentres right now are going from air cooling to water cooling because liquid is more efficient when you try to cool down high-density racks, which are the ones that are mostly being used for AI.”And while theTrump administrationhas pledged to fast-track new energy projects to power these new datacentres, it has so far said nothing about the water they could use up.“Neither people nor data can live without water,” said Gómez. “But human life is essential and data isn’t.”Quick GuideMethodologyShowThe locations of the datacentres were compiled using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel andData Center Map. Of the 632 datacentres analysed, we were unable to determine the “active” or “developing” status for 16. Areas with water scarcity were defined as places where water is 10 times as scarce as the world’s average, according to ametricdeveloped by academics for the United Nations.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Additional reporting by Eleanor GunnExplore more on these topicsWaterAmazonMicrosoftGoogleTrump administrationDesertificationDroughtnewsShareReuse this content"

Plus: a heart-pounding season of films by Black womenNesrine MalikWed 9 Apr 2025 07.16 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 07.30 EDTShareHello and welcome to The Long Wave. This week, I dig into one of my biggest travelling bugbears. Why is it so circuitous, expensive, time-consuming and exhausting to travel withinAfrica?Africa’s aviation challengesView image in fullscreenCircuitous … the logistics of pan-African travel can be a turbulent experience.Illustration: Guardian PicturesHere are some of the routes that are available for travel within Africa. Buckle up. The shortest option from Johannesburg to Dakar is 14 and a half hours over two stops through Gabon and Togo. If you would prefer fewer stops, you have the option of leaving Africa altogether – flying to Istanbul and returning to the continent, which takes a “quick” 26 hours and five minutes. Port Sudan to Kampala, a mere 1,860 miles away, is a nine-hour flight via Addis Ababa. And if you want to hop over from sub-Saharan Africa to north Africa, you are likely to end up in Paris or Amsterdam, which I have done, and felt that sailing around the Cape of Good Hope might have made more sense. And cost less. The minimum you’ll pay for such trips is US $1,000 return.Few carriers – and no cheap onesPart of the problem is that there are only a few large airlines on the continent.KenyaAirways, Ethiopian Airlines and EgyptAir dominate Africa, and travellers are subject to those carriers’ regional concentration, decisions on which direct routes to service, and the prices they can set, given the lack of competition.The result is that European airlines such as KLM, Air France and Turkish Airlines mop up the rest of the journeys, and therefore hurl travellers out of the continent to their connecting hubs. I asked a Kenyan aviation expert why it was so hard for African airlines to expand their coverage, and he said: “Every plane isn’t just a plane. It’s insurance, it’s parts, it’s maintenance.” The bar is very high for an additional route. And so while it would be great to pop over from Nairobi to N’Djamena, there just isn’t enough traffic to justify the cost.There might be, if the prices were lower. Air travel remains a huge luxury in Africa, and there are no low-cost regional equivalents to budget carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair, as a result of everything from lack of demand to the high capital required to establish a new airline. However, there is a chicken-and-egg element here: pan-African travel for leisure is considered prohibitively costly and cumbersome, and so the infrastructure required to support it, as well as domestic tourism markets, are discouraged.There is another reason that raises a deeper question about how high the barriers are between countries that often share borders, languages and even tribal and ethnic relations.The visa problemView image in fullscreenHigher barriers … Dusk at Nairobi Jomo Kenyatta airport. Kenya Airways was founded in 1977, after the dissolution of East African Airways.Photograph: Ashley Cooper/AlamyIt is an enduring travesty that in most parts of Africa, it is easier to gain entry if you have a western passport than an African one. My travel within the continent opened up vastly afterI received a British passport, and it always feels like an uncomfortable colonial throwback to produce it for admission, rather than my Sudanese one. There are strong regional groupings, such as the Economic Community of West African States, and Kenya has recently declared that itwill soon allow visa-free travel for all Africans– a bold announcement that has no launch date.Other barriers linger, and some are getting higher. Ahistoric free travel treaty between Sudan and Egyptwas scrapped after the start of the war in Sudan to stanch the flow of refugees. This year, the African Unioncalled for acceleration of visa-free movementto boost regional integration, and officials blamed enduring travel restrictions for not only the blocking of the goal of a united Africa but for hampering growth and development. Part of that slow growth is the stagnation of the aviation industry. Free movement, said the vice-president for regional development, “must be the backbone of our integration”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Established in 1961 by a collective of west African Francophone countries and two French airlines, Air Afrique flew to 56 destinations, 35 of which were in Africa. As a marker of how much travel is crucial to fostering connections, it became more than just an airline anddeveloped into a cultural powerhouse, sponsoring film festivals and establishing style standards (in a nod to this years after the airline closed, a Parisian art collective created anAir Afrique installationat men’s fashion week in 2022).After dominating African travel for four decades, Air Afrique succumbed to bankruptcy in 2002 as a result of mismanagement and the challenges of the aviation industry after 9/11. And there is a lesson there on how economic and political shocks such as recessions and pandemics are hard to manage, even by the most established players. It is understandable why airlines and policymakers may choose to be conservative.But the case for increased African and African diaspora travel routes is becoming ever more persuasive. Three years ago, Kenya announced that it would be partnering with South Africa to launcha new pan-African carrier. AndNigeria is in talksto launch direct flights to Jamaica and Barbados.There is clearly much infrastructure, investment and liberation of visa regimes needed to turn these ambitions into reality. But there is now such a vast disconnect between the growing cultural and political links between many countries that share so much, that the business case for extending them through air travel should eventually become obvious. And just think of the airline stewards’ uniforms.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsKenyaThe Long WaveAirline industryAir transportAfricaCaribbeanBlack British cultureRacenewslettersShareReuse this content"

A venue and tournament that takes itself so seriously applies a heavy weight of expectation to competitors. This is totally phoney in a way, ridiculous in fact, but the Masters “thing” exists. Nobody feels that burden more acutely thanRory McIlroy, who on Thursday afternoon will begin his 11th attempt to march into the pantheon of golfing greats. Psychology matters in McIlroy’s quest to complete a career grand slam, not technical ability. It is the inches between McIlroy’s ears that are far more significant than 7,500 yards of picture-perfect golf course. Augusta’s great paradox is that beauty and splendour play such menacing tricks on the mind.The theory of now or never in relation to McIlroy and the Masters is a prevalent one. He landed in Georgia with two wins in the calendar year, in itself a first. The 35-year-oldwon at Pebble Beachand Sawgrasswhile playing considerably short of his best, proof not only of his outrageous talent level but maturity. In a non-tribal environment, the foot traffic following McIlroy’s every move over Tuesday and Wednesday this week has been quite the sight.Augusta National chair defends allowing Cabrera to return to MastersRead moreAn added layer to the McIlroy story is that so many peoplewanthim to reach his holy grail. Perhaps only when – and it is, for now, fair to say when – he gets there will McIlroy expand on the scale of his torment sincea painful capitulationin the Masters of 2011. The extent of veneration towards McIlroy in a Green Jacket promises to be as spectacular as the outpouring of emotion from the man himself. More broadly, this sport would benefit from McIlroy glory. It has waited long enough for it.More curious than the fact McIlroy has not prevailed at Augusta National since the trauma of 14 years ago is the fact he has not placed himself in pole position to do so. It would be genuinely intriguing to see how he reacts with, for example, a two-shot lead nine holes from home. The world No 2 rails against any suggestion the golfing gods owe him one. It was supposedly written in the stars that Greg Norman and Ernie Els would win the Masters. Neither ever did.The problem with golf is that there is precious little opportunity to damage your fellow competitors. Muhammad Ali could thump George Foreman. Roger Federer could batter serves past Rafael Nadal. McIlroy could play fantastically well at Augusta and still fall short, courtesy of an opponent he is not in direct combat with. Yet peak McIlroy still takes quite some stopping. His demeanour this week is of a man perfectly comfortable with what he can produce over 72 holes.View image in fullscreenLudvig Åberg was second on his Masters debut in 2024 and has won on the PGA Tour this year.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesThe draw may not favour the four-time major winner. His Thursday tee time is in the fourth-from-last group, meaning umpteen decent scores are likely to have been posted before he strikes a ball in anger. McIlroy has spoken before of the tricky feeling of playing catch-up here. The flipside is that he has scope to study the precise challenge of round one at Augusta National before entering the fray. The quick turnaround between late Thursday and early Friday offers opportunity to lay down markers. McIlroy would relish a fast start; he has not broken 70 in a first round of the Masters since 2018.Scottie Scheffler remains the man to beat. That much is patently obvious. The world No 1’s iron play is among the finest in the history of golf, a key strength at a course where approach shots have to be so precise. The record books suggest successfully defending a Masters is a troublesome project; only three golfers have achieved it. You could, though, whack Scheffler around the face with a wet kipper and receive next to no reaction. An uncluttered mind is one of his key attributes. The 28‑year‑old will pay no heed to the experiences of others. Going by his pre-tournament comments, hay fever may be the prime threat to him this week.Augusta provides a president-free oasis amid the Trump maelstromRead moreAmerican golfers hold all four majors, a matter the European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald will be keen to see change. McIlroy aside, there should be European faith in Shane Lowry, Robert MacIntyre and Ludvig Åberg.The Mastersafforded Joaquin Niemann a special invite; it would be no shock to see the Chilean respond with a title charge.Nine is the lucky number. Over the last 20 years, the champion has, on average, been playing in his ninth Masters. Notables in that group this time are Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Bryson DeChambeau. We are overdue a thrilling Masters Sunday. Tiger Woods and 2019 was the last occasion for genuine, jaw‑dropping excitement against the backdrop of azaleas. There has been no Masters playoff since 2017.0:50Rory McIlroy's four-year-old daughter Poppy sinks putt at Augusta – videoThere have, as ever, been pre‑tournament peculiarities. Fred Ridley called a Monday press conference for a grand announcement regarding a project involving Woods, without the five‑time Masters champion turning up himself. This had the effect of making Augusta National appear smaller than Woods. Cameron Smith, the former Open champion, sent drives down the practice range on Wednesday wearing a suit jacket.Ridley later reflected on the horrific impact of Hurricane Helene on the Augusta community before confirming an underground car park had been completed at this course between the tournaments of 2024 and 2025. A new player clubhouse will be fully operational by next year, offering facilities Ridley insisted will be “unlike anything in sport”. The haves, the have-nots.The US is now a nation where so many have developed an obsession with foreign criminals.

For Exhibit A, see Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s preposterous strike, a flash of lightning that helped to secure for PSG a deserved advantage heading into the second leg of this quarter-final.Exhibit B was a beauty, too, Désiré Doué cracking a rasping strike in off the woodwork after Morgan Rogers gave Villa a shock first-half lead. The killer goal, for both teams, came in stoppage time, Nuno Mendes making it 3-1. By the end it was 29 shots to seven and tempting to wonder quite how many full-backs Unai Emery would require to cage PSG’s ravenous front three of Kvaratskhelia, Ousmane Dembélé and Doué, the prodigious teenager. Frankly it is hard to envisage PSG not scoring at Villa Park.‘It’s not done yet’: Emery and Rogers defiant despite first-leg defeat at PSGRead moreAs the flag with which a few fans posed on the Pont d’Iéna, opposite the Eiffel Tower, several hours before kick-off declared, this was Emery in Paris and drama was a given. It is why the Prince of Wales was compelled to be here, with his eldest son in tow. “I want George to experience a night out away from home in a big European competition,” the royal Villa supporter said before kick-off.And they do not get much bigger than this. Villa’s first quarter-final on this stage since 1983, when they exited to Juventus, had the feel of a big-ticket event. It also represented their first monstrous away tie in the competition this season, a European behemoth in a fitting arena. The PSG ultras in the Auteuil stand unravelled a giant tifo of a flat cap perched on a skull, a nod to the Peaky Blinders as the players emerged. “By order of the Paris SG fans,” read a giant banner in the lower tier, though they seemingly ignored the television show is set in Small Heath, round the corner from Villa’s arch‑rivals Birmingham City.View image in fullscreenKhvicha Kvaratskhelia (right) celebrates on the turf with Achraf Hakimi (centre) and Ousmane Dembélé after his stunning strike for PSG.Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPAThe L’Équipe front-page headline Viser Juste (aim accurately) spoke to what promised to be an absorbing subplot. Could PSG find a way past Emiliano Martínez, persona non grata in these parts long beforetravelling to Paris in a capshowing off Argentina’s World Cup triumph against France and a rooster, the national symbol. Had Martínez strayed into coq of the walk territory? The thing with Martínez is he tends to back up his brashness, and the mind games and dark arts usually pay off. His first touch invariably was heavily jeered and the locals took great delight in his first kick smacking the advertising hoardings.From there PSG assumed control. Martínez made a superb save to thwart Dembélé and the goalkeeper then smothered when Achraf Hakimi made tracks towards the byline. Vitinha sent a shot over. Kvaratskhelia was too hot to handle and Villa shifted to a 5-4-1 out of possession to soak up pressure. PSG appeared comfortable so it was a shock when Villa seized the lead in the 35th minute. Until that point Villa had 23% of possession and their sole shot – from their captain, John McGinn – billowed into the stands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rashford spotted Youri Tielemans on the overlap and his ball across the six-yard box was converted by Rogers at the back post. Emery clenched both fists in celebration but kept his arms by his side.But the game quickly reverted to type. Martínez somehow prevented a Doué shot, via a post, from creeping over the line but what happened next was unstoppable. Doué was undeterred. The 19-year-old drove inside off the left flank, past Rogers, and promptly sent a blistering right-foot strike into the goal off the underside of the crossbar. Doué tested Martínez and spooned another effort over before half-time.PSG carried on where they left off. The only difference was now it was Axel Disasi, a half-time replacement for the cautioned Matty Cash, who had to live with PSG’s devastating attack. Kvaratskhelia quickly got to work, annihilating Disasi, once of Paris FC, four minutes into the second half. The Georgia forward surged at Disasi, darting infield before ripping in the opposite direction to send the Chelsea loanee stumbling. Kvaratskhelia still had work to do but made light of an awkward angle and blasted a vicious strike inside Martínez’s near post.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Now this stadium was bouncing. Emery turned to Marco Asensio, who entered to face his parent club, but it was one of those ahead of him in the pecking order who stole the show. Kvaratskhelia nutmegged McGinn and then released Doué, who burned down the left and found Hakimi infield. Martínez made a fine save down to his right. Eventually Mendes made it 3-1 in stoppage time, feinting to fool both Ezri Konsa and Martínez, before chopping inside and finishing in style.Fresh from clinching Ligue 1 for a fourth successive season, PSG have their eyes on a bigger prize, one which eluded Emery during his time here. On this evidence, it may not for much longer. “We want to make history in Paris,” Luis Enrique said.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

LA28 will feature 22 more medal events than Paris 2024, while maintaining a total athlete quota of 10,500 across 31 sports.“These additions reflect our commitment to innovation and gender equality,” an IOC spokesperson said. “They offer thrilling new moments for athletes and fans alike.”‘It’s a privilege’: Boris van der Vorst, the man who saved Olympic boxingRead moreThe sprint swimming events bring pure speed to the Olympic pool, with the 50m backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly offering fast-paced races that are already staples at the world championships but have never featured on the Olympic stage. Track and field’s new 4x100m mixed relay adds to the growing lineup of mixed-gender events across the Games, while artistic gymnastics will feature its first mixed team competition – blending male and female routines into a single event.Several of the new and returning events will unfold in some of Los Angeles’ most prominent venues. Swimming will be held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, where 38,000 seats will make it the largest natatorium in Olympic history. Gymnastics will take place at Crypto.com Arena, home of the NBA’s Lakers, in downtownLos Angeles. Basketball will be played at the LA Clippers’ Intuit Dome, while track and field will remain at the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.Six new mixed events have been added, including those in golf, rowing (coastal beach sprint), table tennis and archery. Sport climbing will also see its boulder and lead disciplines split into separate medal events after previously being contested as a combined format.The LA Games have articulated a priority in gender equality. For the first time in Olympic history, the number of female athlete quota spots (5,655) will surpass male quota spots (5,543). The Games will also feature full parity in all team sports, withwomen’s soccer expanding to 16 teams– four more than the men’s tournament – and water polo adding two women’s teams to match the men’s 12.Boxing will also achieve full gender parity with the addition of a seventh women’s weight category, equalizing the number of men’s and women’s divisions. In 3x3 basketball, the number of teams per gender will expand from eight to 12.The IOC received 46 new event proposals from 24 of 31 international federations. The final program was shaped by guiding principles set in 2023, which emphasized global appeal, cost-efficiency, athlete focus and gender balance.Five sports proposed by the LA28 Organising Committee – baseball/softball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash – will return or debut in Los Angeles, contributing an additional 698 athlete quota places.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their captain, Raphinha, refused to admit as much, flashing a knowing smiling as he said so, but a second Champions League semi-final in a decade is virtually secure already after all three of their fantastic forward line scored en route to a 4-0 victory againstBorussia Dortmundat Montjuic. The last was taken by a 17-year-old who may already be considered the best player on the continent. And if he is not, perhaps it’s because a teammate is.After all, while Lamine Yamal completed a near-perfect Barcelona performance with a gorgeous 14th goal of the season, Pedri continues to glide across a different plane and Robert Lewandowski, 20 years Lamine’s senior, scored his 39th and 40th. At 37, the Pole is the Champions League’s second top-scorer; the man above him is Raphinha, who also scored here as Barcelona reached 144 goals this season and almost certainly the next round, and perhaps beyond. They will take some stopping, that’s for sure.PSG 3-1 Aston Villa: Champions League quarter-final, first leg – live reactionRead moreDortmund couldn’t do it. Paris-Saint Germain or Aston Villa should prove a sterner test than the German side, who only momentarily got close on a night that began withBarcelonain control and ended that way too. Lamine Yamal drew the first of five saves from Gregor Kobel and then bamboozled Ramy Bensebaini before bending past the post before Raphinha teed up Lewandowski. Six minutes in and it was already Barcelona’s third sight of goal. Dortmund were being asphyxiated, shown space beyond a daringly high back line but denied time or room to reach it.Pedri and Frenkie de Jong dominated. Fermín López impressed. Raphinha never stopped running, although his best move was more about subtlety than speed, disappearing behind the goal and reappearing again at the other post, almost catching Dortmund with a sneaky short corner. That didn’t come off, but the next set play did, giving Barcelona the lead.View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Lamine Yamal (left) celebrates with Raphinha after scoring the fourth goal.Photograph: Pedro Salado/Getty ImagesKarim Adeyemi caught Jules Koundé’s hair and from the clipped free-kick, Iñigo Martínez headed down. Pau Cubarsi, Barcelona’s other extraordinary 17-year-old, turned it goalwards. It was going in anyway but, sliding in, Raphinha got the final touch on the line – which led to a VAR wait. “I was worried: I said sorry to Pau,” he admitted but to his relief he wasn’t offside and his team had a lead that might have been doubled when Lamine Yamal failed to find him sprinting clear soon after.The game was shifting a little, though, Dortmund finding a way through that first wave to threaten. Koundé had to block Serhou Guirassy, who then had an extraordinary chance only to miss Carney Chukwuemeka’s pass entirely and fall over by the penalty spot. Already on the floor, Wojciech Szczesny watched in happy disbelief as the ball dropped into his hands.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The next time Dortmund broke, the referee Espen Eskas accidentally stopped them, but they kept flowing through. Twice Chukwuemeka had shots blocked, Szczesny saved from Jamie Gittens, and a fantastic ball from Adeyemi just evaded Guirassy.

Pedri spread another expertly weighted ball wide and what came next was like something from the volleyball court: three men, three touches, a flawless sequence. Up, across and down. Lamine Yamal’s perfect, almost gentle looping ball reached Raphinha at the far side of the net and the Brazilian provided the set. Leaping, virtually on the line, he headed back across, over and past the man protecting the net, and there was Lewandowski to finish the move.Dortmund were done – and the third followed fast if not immediately. By the time Fermín and Lamine Yamal set up Lewandowski, it was their fourth chance in as many minutes and Fermín had hit post and bar. Those came on 62min and 64min. Between them, Kobel denied Lewandowski. Now he could not, the ball squeezing under his body. It was another superb goal, a move that began inside Barcelona’s area, executed with speed and precision.There would be more, too, Raphinha sprinting free and bending into Lamine Yamal’s path. He controlled and guided in a toe-poke as if he was still on the playground and it was easy.

He said he was talking trash back and forth with a fan, but the officials thought he was directing abuse at a referee and he was ejected after picking up a second technical foul.‘He has two major flaws’: Luka Dončić’s biographer on the Lakers starRead more“If [the fan is] going to talk, I’m going to talk back, like always,” said Dončić. “That had nothing to do with the ref. So I didn’t really understand.”The crew chief, Tony Brothers, said Dončić had “looked directly at an official and used vulgar language.”The fan in question, Jeremy Price,told ESPNhe believed Dončić was shouting at him rather than a referee. “During the game within the game, I mentioned that he was short [on his shot] and he missed it, and he turned around and he shot an expletive back and [the referee] happened to see it and, at that point, T’d him up,” Price said.The ejection affected the trajectory of the game. The Thunder outscored the Lakers 29-12 the rest of the way.“I mean, it was tough,” Dončić said. “I mean, we were right there. I think we fought the whole game. … We came back in the third quarter. We were fighting, man. So it was tough to see that with this kind of situation to happen. And you know, that’s on me too, so I can’t let my team down like that.”Now, Dončić can focus on the Mavericks – the team he led to the NBA finals just last season after winning the scoring title. The five-time All-Star was among those who were shocked when he wastraded for Anthony Davis in February.Though Dončić says he has bonded with his new teammates, he looks forward to being back in Dallas.“Of course that’s going to be a lot of emotion for me,” he said. “Like, how do we know what to expect? I don’t know how I’m going to feel, honestly. I’m looking forward to being back in Dallas. Obviously, with the fans, seeing my teammates – ex-teammates – it’s going to be a very emotional for me, for sure.”Dončić is averaging 27.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.6 assists in 26 games with the Lakers. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd is well aware of the damage the versatile guard can inflict.“He’s playing incredible, but that’s Luka,” Kidd said. “Luka’s one of the best players in the world. You’ve got to be able to show different defenses, and that’s even hard. When you look at what he’s doing – he’s shooting the 3, he’s getting to the rim and to the free-throw line and he’s setting the table for his teammates. Our defense will be tested.”LeBron James, who has had a few returns throughout his career, said he expects Dončić to be received warmly.“I think he’ll get a standing ovation and they’ll clap and cheer,” James said. “You’ll hear his name a lot. That’s what I’m expecting.”James said the team is prepared to help Dončić work through the unusual circumstances.“Whatever he needs,” James said. “I think winning will be the best solution.”Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićLos Angeles LakersNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Deal or no deal. They win the Premier League title. But they sell Bukayo Saka.It was posted by the @goalglobal TikTok account at the start of last season and the reactions of those in front of the camera shone a light on just how loved Saka is atArsenal. The consensus was no deal. It would not be worth it because some things just mean more. “That’s our star boy, that’s like your son,” one of the supporters said. The video was liked by 3 million people.Declan Rice’s double rocket sinks Real Madrid to put Arsenal in dreamlandRead moreRewind to the summer of 2021 when Saka reported for pre-season training after his penalty shootout miss for England in the European Championship final defeat against Italy. He had receivedhorrific online abusebut he was led to a wall of supportive messages from the Arsenal community, hundreds and hundreds of them. One young fan invited Saka for a kickaround in the park and promised to “let him win”.A few days later, Saka played in a friendly against Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. There is no such thing as a friendly between these rivals and yet the Spurs fans applauded Saka. Had they ever done such a thing for an Arsenal player?Every Premier League club has its heroes. But it is perfectly possible that none have one quite like Saka at present, not only a symbol of pretty much everything – an academy product, a supporter himself – but a player who has been on board throughout an exciting journey, one that began at a low ebb when Mikel Arteta took over as the manager in December 2019.Saka, who made his debut under Arteta’s predecessor Unai Emery, has been one of the principal drivers as Arsenal have moved up the league, into the knockout rounds of the Champions League, re‑establishing themselves as one of the top clubs in Europe, even if they have only been able to win one trophy under Arteta –the FA Cup in his first season.Arteta likes to talk about positive energy, a synergy between the Arsenal crowd and the team, and there is nobody who finesses it like Saka. Witness the basic buzz whenever he receives the ball. A major plank of Arteta’s strategy is to get Saka one v one against his full-back, to get Martin Ødegaard up the inside-right channel to help draw the defensive numbers away from Saka, to allow him to make his moves. If it does not work right away, it does not matter. Just keep giving him the ball. Because he will make it happen.All of which is to say that when Saka was out for alittle over three monthswith the hamstring rupture sustained at Crystal Palace on 21 December, Arsenal were not the same team. It has been a season of adversity for themon the injury front, numerous key players missing significant chunks, those from the same departments often going down at the same time.View image in fullscreenMartin Ødegaard thrives when he has Bukayo Saka on the right-wing.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSaka was the greatest missing link. Without him, Arsenal won seven of 12 league matches, theirtitle challenge turning to dust. They lost three out of three in thedomestic cups. Before the injury, Saka had 23 goal involvements in 24 appearances – in other words, combined goals and assists. That number is still higher than any other Arsenal player.And so to reintroduce him now, with Arsenal’sChampions Leaguecampaign at its defining point, has been a boost of extraordinary intensity. You could feel it in his comeback game last Tuesday against Fulham in the league, his mere presence among the substitutes at the outset electrifying the occasion. It was a moment of communion when he came on in the 66th minute, a collective release. And as for his goal just seven minutes later …The hope at Arsenal was they would see off PSV in the Champions League last 16 without Saka, which is what they did. And then, if he could return for the quarter-final against Real Madrid, who knew?In the first leg against the defending champions at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday, there were moments from every Arsenal player. From the David Raya block that thwarted Kylian Mbappé on the half-hour to Mikel Merino’s goal for 3-0 in the 75th minute.If Myles Lewis-Skelly was sensational, then Declan Rice stole the show with his two free‑kicks, the undoubted man of the match. He had never scored from a direct free-kick in more than 400 games for club and country. “It’s the first time I’ve seen a good free-kick from Dec,” William Saliba said, with a smile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He did not start that well. There was a loose touch which led to a Vinícius Júnior break. There was a scuffed cross. But he kept going. It is what he does.Saka won an early free-kick off Luka Modric, having shown him the ball before jinking inside and away. It is a trademark of his; the sharp change of direction. He prefers to cut inside but he can also go the other way. Which is what he did in the 38th minute at a point when Madrid were increasingly comfortable.View image in fullscreenArsenal's Bukayo Saka gets a shot away despite pressure from Real Madrid's David Alaba.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSaka is not theatrically fast, like Mbappé or Vinícius Júnior. He does not draw gasps with his acceleration. But he remains routinely capable of sliding past his marker. He is quick, of course, but it is about the economy of his movement, the weight of his touches when dribbling.Saka’s Arsenal return sinks Fulham but Gabriel and Timber add to injury crisisRead moreIsolated one v one against Jude Bellingham, the Madrid player looked to have him covered. Then Saka shook his hips and had the yard of space. When he took another touch, he was two yards clear. All this in the blink of an eye. Frustratingly, no Arsenal player read the dangerous low cross. Moments later, there was a give-and-go with Ødegaard, another cross; again, nobody was there. But Saka had mainlined the energy back into the crowd.There would be another lull after the interval, not much happening for 12 minutes or so, until Saka sliced inside to win the free-kick from which Rice opened the scoring. Saka was fouled for Rice’s second goal, too.The countdown to the return leg at the Bernabéu next Wednesday has started, with the messaging from the Arsenal camp extremely clear. “We go there to win,” Saliba said. He made the point four times during a short interview and Rice said the same thing, Arteta as well. With Saka back, the possibilities are tantalising.Explore more on these topicsArsenalBukayo SakaChampions LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is understood that suitors who looked at buying Delap from City last year were informed of the need to meet specific financial and contractual conditions during talks over a deal.

But Kieran McKenna’s side are 12 points behind 17th-placed Wolves with seven games to go and their hopes of a bigger fee for the England Under-21s international will be hit if they go down.The issue for Ipswich is not only that City have a 20% sell-on clause. Delap’s release clause dropping to £30m in the event of relegation is likely to cause a stir atChelseaand United, with both sides looking to bolster their attacking options. United have Delap high on a shortlist that also includes Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres, Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike and Napoli’s Victor Osimhen. Chelsea, who have a policy of signing young players on heavily incentivised deals, are also very much in the running and will have a chance to watch Delap when they host Ipswich on Sunday.Jason Wilcox, United’s technical director, knows Delap well from his time at City. Chelsea also have several staff members who were at City and could use those links to their advantage. Gyökeres and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko have also been tracked by Chelsea.Newcastle and Liverpool have also been credited with an interest in Delap. City have a buyback option but are unlikely to trigger it. Delap wants regular football and would be behind Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush if he were to rejoin City.Explore more on these topicsIpswich TownManchester UnitedChelseaTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

The midfielder said: “I respect everyone but to say that then you need to get the answer. If you are one of the worst goal­keepers in Man United’s history you need to take care what you are talking.”Matic compared the 29-year-old unfavourably with three of United’s first-choice goalkeepers before Onana. He said: “If David de Gea or Peter Schmeichel or [Edwin] van der Sar said that then I will ­question myself but if you are one of the statistically worst goalkeepers in Man United’s ­modern history then he needs to show that before he says, so we will see.”Onana had said when discussing the challenge of Lyon after the goalless draw with Manchester City on Sunday: “Of course it’s not going to be easy but I think we are way better than them.”On Wednesday he responded to Matic’s comments by posting on social media a picture of himself with the FA Cup and writing: “I would never be disrespectful to another club. We know that tomorrow will be a difficult game against a strong opponent. We focus on preparing a performance to make our fans proud. At least I’ve lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can’t say the same.”Ruben Amorim attempted to play down the spat. “Tomorrow this will not matter,” United’s head coach said with reference to the game. “If you see the full quote of André Onana, it’s quite different. The first sentence is Lyon is a very good team, so sometimes the players or the coaches don’t always listen to the full quote and sometimes it’s just a misunderstanding.”Amorim referenced his knowledge of Matic, a former Benfica teammate. “All the quotes [from Onana], you can’t see disrespect there, just respect but trying to give confidence and to show confidence in the team, especially this year,” he said. “Everybody can talk bad things aboutManchester United… I know Nemanja Matic, what a good guy he is. Tomorrow Onana is going to play.”Kobbie Mainoo is in the squad after injury, having not played since United’s FA Cup victory against Leicester on 7 February. Amorim indicated Mainoo would not start. “We have to be careful with Kobbie,” he said.United, 13th in the Premier League, are the only remaining unbeaten team in Uefa’s club competitions.

There’s got to be more in it for us, and for us what is the most important thing as a group is that we’ve been through a really tough time but we’re still in a position where we can make an impact.“We’re in a quarter-final and I don’t know how many times the club has been in a quarter-final in European competition.

Johnson won the spot‑kick and looked deflated after the ball was handed to Tel, whose successful conversion put Spurs 3-1 up.“It’s incredible, it’s just literally turning gold into crap when it’s ­Tottenham,” Postecoglou said. “Seriously. If we’re 2-1 up tomorrow night and get a ­penalty in the last minute, I want the best penalty taker to take it. The one slight against this club is ­apparently it hasn’t been a winner.

Reading risk being suspended from the league and potential expulsion if Dai does not sell the club this month.Couhig, an American businessman and lawyer who was an integral part of Wycombe winning promotion into the Championship for the first time, wants to buy Dai’s shares in the club, the stadium and the training ground. Reading have been formally for sale for approaching 600 days and Couhig’s previous deal to buy the club collapsed in September.In a statement on Wednesday Reading said: “Negotiations between the parties are proceeding in a professional and positive manner, with full recognition from all concerned of the need to bring a sale of the club to a conclusion for all stakeholders, including players, staff and supporters.”Last month Couhig said: “Reading is a challenge of much bigger proportions than most people realise, when you start to turn the rocks over there are lots of snakes there … it has all the assets necessary to be a club that is customarily in mid-table of the Championship, with the potential of being in the Premier League.”Reading are targeting promotion via the playoffs.

Emery said defeat “was not the best but not the worst” and acknowledged his former club showed their class after magnificent goals by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Désiré Doué and Nuno Mendes propelled PSG to a first-leg victory.Mendes completed the scoring in second-half stoppage time but Emery was adamant the goal does not significantly alter Villa’s target. “The last goal is a little bit disappointing for us because it was in the last minute but it is not changing much, or our belief,” the Villa manager said.Late Nuno Mendes goal hurts Aston Villa hopes and stretches PSG’s advantageRead more“It is not changing a lot because at 2-1 we were thinking, in the next match, we have to play to win. With 3-1, it is still the same. We need to win the next match, and not only [score] one goal but [at least] two.“We were close to getting a good result. At the end with this goal it is still more or less the same because we still need to win next week. Villa Park is our home and hopefully we can be stronger and win more of our duels. They showed their power and individual qualities. The result is not the best but it’s not the worst. There are still 90 minutes to play, a second leg, and maybe extra time.”Morgan Rogers, who scored Villa’s goal to earn them a shock 35th‑minute lead, said: “There’s loads of belief in the changing room. We have nothing to lose, nobody thought we’d win the tie in the first place. Why not just go for it? We’ve definitely got the quality to turn things around. It’s not done yet.”PSG dominated the match, averaging 75% possession and the Ligue 1 champions had 29 shots compared to Villa’s seven, with 10 and two on target respectively. But Luis Enrique was reluctant to consider it job done.“If we look at what happened yesterday during theChampions League[Arsenal beating Real Madrid 3-0], I don’t think it’s fair to talk about favourites,” the PSG head coach said. “What does [being] ‘favourites’ mean? The only goal we have is to win the match in Birmingham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 2023 World Cup was the last time Stokes featured in an England white-ball team, his recent focus tied to the long form while dealing with various injuries.The Spin | In praise of cricket’s dibbly-dobbler: once a familiar sight, now an endangered speciesRead moreBrook, however, would welcome a Stokes comeback to the shorter forms should a packed itinerary allow for it. “With the schedule, he’s not going to be available all the time,” the 26-year-old said. “But he’s one of the best players in the world and we’d be stupid to turn a blind eye to him.”Jonny Bairstow, who has not played for England since the T20 World Cup last year, remains in contention too, according to Brook. “We’ve all seen that he can put the best bowlers in the world under pressure from their best balls and manipulate the field and score big runs. There’s no reason why he can’t get selected again.”Brook’s own schedule will surely require management, his appointment marking a break from the past. Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler, his most recent predecessors, were out of the Test picture during their periods in charge, unlike Brook.“Missing the odd series wouldn’t be a stupid thing,” the new captain said. He also voiced his excitement at a busy winter schedule: a white‑ball tour of New Zealand is followed by the Ashes, before a visit to Sri Lanka and India for bilateral commitments and the T20 World Cup. “It’s a lot of cricket, and I’m looking forward to all of it.”A brief tour of Ireland this September could be one from which to rest, but Brook did not want to rule himself out. “I might want to play, because it’s my first year, I might want to try to keep around the lads and keep them in high spirits.”If something has to give, it is franchise life for the time being. Brook pulled out of his £590,000 Indian Premier League deal with Delhi Capitals last month to focus on international cricket, leaving him at the mercy of the tournament’s new rules: withdrawals unrelated to injury or illness prompt a two-year ban.“That’s the rules, so if I do get banned, fair play,” Brook said. “I’m completely committed to playing cricket for England – if that means franchise takes a step back for a little while, so be it.”Asked if he could envisage any amount of money coming before playing for England, Brook replied: “Definitely not at the minute. I just want to play cricket for England, represent my country like I have done over the last few years and hopefully have a big impact on the side moving forward.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A three-match one-day international series against West Indies, Brook’s first assignment in charge, begins just four days later.“I’m going to be myself, as much as I possibly can be. Be relaxed, be calm, try to have a lot of fun and enjoy it. If you’re playing cricket for England, we’re all living that dream. As a 10-year-old looking at yourself now, you’d be absolutely buzzing and over the moon.

Cabrera’s reappearance has drawn criticism from women’s rights campaigners.Cabrera is technically entitled to play in the Masters for as long as he wants, as a past winner. Whether Augusta should have honoured that entry condition has been widely questioned after the Argentinian spent 30 months in jail. Cabrera was found guilty of assault, theft and intimidation against former girlfriends in 2021 and 2022.McIlroy’s Augusta quest more about psychology as Scheffler lies in wait | Ewan MurrayRead more“It seems as long as male athletes can excel at hitting a ball, we excuse those same men hitting women,” said Jamie Klingler, co-founder of the Reclaim These Streets campaign group.Ridley was asked for a response during his traditional pre-tournament press conference, at Augusta National on Wednesday. “We certainly abhor domestic violence of any type,” Ridley said.“As it relates to Ángel, Ángel has served the sentence that was prescribed by the Argentine courts, he is the past champion and so he was invited.”Ridley had no apparent desire to expand on the situation. A year ago,he labelled Cabrera “one of our great champions”while expressing hope the golfer could return to this major. Cabrera, who was in attendance for the Masters champions dinner on Tuesday evening, has been remorseful in public about his past behaviour. The 55-year-old won on the PGA Champions Tour on Sunday.“I’m very grateful and obviously the people of the golf world are very great with me and I just appreciated the way they treated me,” Cabrera said of his reception back at Augusta. “Everybody has their own opinion and I respect that.“Life has given me another opportunity. I have got to take advantage of that and I want to do the right things in this second opportunity. There was a stage in my life of four, five years, that I wasn’t doing the right things I should have done. Before that I was OK, so I just have to keep doing what I know I can do right.”Explore more on these topicsThe MastersGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

The Chilean had beaten the world No 5 on clay in Rome last year and built on a solid start to the second-round match before securing a 6-3, 6-4 win in just under an hour and a half on Court Rainier III.‘I can be dangerous on this surface’: Alex de Minaur finally grows to love clay courts | Simon CambersRead moreTabilo, ranked 32 in the world, broke twice in the opening set, with Djokovic looking rather subdued playing his first match on clay sincewinning Olympic goldlast summer. Djokovic’s wayward returns continued to prove costly as Tabilo – who beat Stan Wawrinka in the first round – built on an early break in the second before closing out an impressive victory to take his place in the last 16.“I expected myself at least to have put in a decent performance. Not like this. It was horrible,” Djokovic told the ATP’s official site. “I knew I’m going to have a tough opponent and probably play pretty bad. But this bad, I didn’t expect. A horrible feeling to play this way, and just sorry for all the people that have to witness this.”Tabilo will next face 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov, who recovered from a set down against wildcard Valentin Vacherot to claim a 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 victory. Djokovic’s wait for a 100th ATP Tour title goes on, having lost to the teenager Jakub Mensik inlast month’s Miami Masters final.“I just tried to remember what I did well last time,” Tabilo said in his courtside interview. “Thankfully I served well today and it helped me a lot. It was an unreal match.”Carlos Alcarazhad earlier battled to a first Monte Carlo win as the world No 3 recovered after losing the opening set to beat Francisco Cerundolo 3-6, 6-0, 6-1. Alcaraz had lost his previous two matches, in the Indian Wells semi-finals to Jack Draper and then in Miami against the veteran Belgian David Goffin.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz plays a backhand during his 3-6, 6-0, 6-1 win over Francisco Cerundolo.Photograph: Mateo Villalba/Getty ImagesThe 21-year-old, already a four-time grand slam champion, regrouped for the second set, before Cerundolo’s serve faltered in the decider.“I didn’t start well. I made a lot of mistakes and I let him play inside the court, dominating the points,” Alcaraz said. “I just knew that I had to do something else, play more aggressively, and play my own tennis: drop shots, going to the net. I tried to return closer to the line and push him.”Alcaraz will playDaniel Altmaierin the third round after the German qualifier beat Richard Gasquet 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 on what was the veteran Frenchman’s last appearance in the event before his intended retirement after the French Open.Casper Ruudhad little trouble as the fourth seed dispatched the veteran Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 6-1, whileAlejandro Davidovich Fokinabeat Argentina’s Tomás Martín Etcheverry 7-6 (2), 6-3 and will next play Jack Draper, the British No 1.Andrey Rublev, the tournament winner in 2023, marked his first match under his new coach, Marat Safin, with a straight-sets 6-4, 7-6 (2) win over Gaël Monfils whileAlex De Minaur, France’s Arthur Fils and Lorenzo Musetti of Italy were other seeds to win on Wednesday.De Minaur joined fellow Australian Alexei Popyrin in a notable comeback triumph as both players offered glimpses they could enjoy their best seasons yet on the surface as they both came from a set down.In the year afterDe Minaur finally began to feel like a clay-courterby reaching the French Open quarter-finals, the world No 10 produced an emphatic comeback to subdue Czech Tomas Machac 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 and set up a last-16 clash withDaniil Medvedev.Medvedev took 12 minutes short of three hours to book his place in the next round, defeating Alexandre Müller 7-6 (6), 5-7, 6-2, but 14th seed Frances Tiafoe bowed out, beaten in three sets by Popyrin.Explore more on these topicsTennisNovak DjokovicCarlos AlcaraznewsShareReuse this content"

We’re all very, very close, so to have the kids out there and them having fun is the most important thing.”“It’s a really nice way to end the preparation going into what is the serious part of the week. So it’s nice to be able to get out here and do this,” added McIlroy, who is seeking his first green jacket to finally complete a career grand slam of majors.“We’re waiting nine months from the last major so to end your preparations with such a fun afternoon is great,” said the 35-year-old. “If you’re not ready by now, you don’t have a chance. Let’s have fun, go home, have dinner and rest and relax for Thursday.”Other wholesome moments in the traditional curtain-raiser included Jordan Spieth, the 2015 champion, telling his young daughter Sophie not to eat the grass. Spieth was also accompanied by his wife, Annie, who caddied for him as he played alongside Max Homa whose two-year-old son, Cam, also took part in an all-white caddy outfit.View image in fullscreenMax Homa's young son, Cam, seems happy with the putter brought along by Wyndham Clark.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APHoma had asked his compatriot, Wyndham Clark, to bring a children’s putter to Georgia as he didn’t have room in his luggage. “I felt like I was carrying the most important thing ever,” Clark told ESPN+ after delivering the club. Jon Rahm’s son, Kepa, took a more direct approach – almost kicking the ball in from 30 feet.Nico Echavarria won the Par Three Tournament, beating the American JJ Spaun on the second hole of their playoff. It may not help the Colombian’s chances this weekend – since it began in 1960, nobody has won the Par Three and then gone on to win the Masters on Sunday. It was alsoanother painful playoff lossfor Spaun, after he lost to McIlroy at last month’s Players Championship.The US Ryder Cup captain, Keegan Bradley, and five-time major winner Brooks Koepka both made holes-in-one on the sixth, with fellow American Tom Hoge recording an ace on the fourth.

Alyssa Thompson was tackled after a surging run from the left, and Macario pounced on the loose ball before ramming it past Brazil goalkeeper Natascha, who was making just her fourth start. It was Macario’s 10th goal for the national team.Brazil drew even with Kerolin’s goal from distance in the 24th minute. It was just the ninth goal that the United States had allowed since Emma Hayes took over as coach last May.Gutierres, who came off the bench in the second half, scored off a cross from Luany deep into stoppage time. It was the first victory for a Conmebol team over the Americans on US soil. Brazil had not defeated the Americans since December 2014.“I feel like in the first half we had a lot of chances that we could have put away,” Thompson said. “I think the game got away from us in the second half. In the second half, we needed to get more control of the ball and kind of take the momentum away from them.”McGlynn was making her third start for the national team. Hayes started Phallon Tullis-Joyce in the first match against Brazil, as she evaluates goalkeepers followingthe retirement of Alyssa Naeher.“We just kept Brazil hanging in it, and obviously with a very passionate team, they take it all the way,” McGlynn said. “I think we could have been a little more front-footed all the way through the second half.”Trinity Rodman, whoscored in Saturday’s 2-0 winat SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, did not dress for the match at San Jose’s PayPal Park as a precaution after returning from a back injury. Rodman was part of the team’s formidable front trio nicknamed “Triple Espresso” at the Olympics. Sophia Smith, who now goes by her married name Wilson, is on maternity leave and Mallory Swanson is not with the team for personal reasons.Alyssa and Gisele Thompson started together for the second time.

SourceMaterial’s analysis identified 38 active datacentres owned by the big three tech firms in parts of the world already facing water scarcity, as well as 24 more under development.Map of the world with kahki-colored areas representing areas of water scarcity, and green and pink circles representing data centresDatacentres’ locations are often industry secrets. But by using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel and Data Center Map, SourceMaterial compiled a map of 632 datacentres – either active or under development – owned by Amazon, Microsoft andGoogle.It shows that those companies’ plans involve a 78% increase in the number of datacentres they own worldwide as cloud computing and AI cause a surge in the world’s demand for storage, with construction planned in North America, South America,Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.A grid of pink and green rectangles growing from a horizontal baselineIn parts of the world where water is plentiful, datacentres’ high water usage is less problematic, but in 2023Microsoft saidthat 42% of its water came from “areas with water stress”, whileGoogle said15% of its water consumption was in areas with “high water scarcity”. Amazon did not report a figure.Now these companies plan to expand their activities in some of the world’s most arid regions, SourceMaterial and the Guardian’s analysis found.“It’s no coincidence they are building in dry areas,” as datacentres have to be built inland, where low humidity reduces the risk of metal corrosion, while seawater also causes corrosion if used for cooling, Jaume-Palasí said.‘Your cloud is drying my river’Amazon’s three proposed new datacentres in the Aragon region of northernSpain– each next to an existing Amazon datacentre – are licensed to use an estimated 755,720 cubic metres of water a year, roughly enough to irrigate 233 hectares (576 acres) of corn, one of the region’s main crops.In practice, the water usage will be even higher as that figure doesn’t take into account water used to generate the electricity that will power the new installations, said Aaron Wemhoff, an energy efficiency specialist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.Between them, Amazon’s new datacentres in the Aragon region are predicted to use more electricity than the entire region currently consumes. Meanwhile, Amazon in Decemberaskedthe regional government for permission to increase water consumption at its three existing datacentres by 48%.Opponents have accused the company of being undemocratic by trying to rush through its application over the Christmas period. More water is needed because “climate change will lead to an increase in global temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events, including heat waves”, Amazon wrote in its application.“They’re using too much water. They’re using too much energy,” said Aurora Gómez of the campaign group Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “Your cloud is drying my river” – which has called for a moratorium on new datacentres in Spain due to water scarcity.View image in fullscreenAn Amazon datacentre in Stone Ridge, Virginia.Photograph: Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSpain hasseenrising numbers of heat-related deaths in extreme weather events linked by scientists to the climate crisis. Last month, Aragon’s government asked for EU aid to tackle its drought.Farmer Chechu Sánchez said he’s worried the datacentres will use up water he needs for his crops.“These datacentres use water that comes from northern Aragon, where I am,” he said. “They consume water – where do they take it from? They take it from you, of course.”With 75% of the country already at risk of desertification, the combination of the climate crisis and datacentre expansion is “bringing Spain to the verge of ecological collapse”, Jaume-Palasí said.Asked about the decision to approve more datacentres, a spokesperson for the Aragonese government said they would not compromise the region’s water resources because their impact is “imperceptible”.Water offsettingAmazon does not provide overall figures for the water its datacentres use worldwide. But it does claim that it will be “water positive” by 2030, offsetting its consumption by providing water to communities and ecosystems in areas of scarcity elsewhere.Amazon says it is currently offsetting 41% of its water usage in areas it deems unsustainable. But it’s an approach that has already caused controversy inside the company.“I raised the issue in all the right places that this is not ethical,” said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at Amazon. “I disagreed quite a lot with that principle coming from a pure sustainability background.”Microsoft and Google have also pledged to become “water positive” by 2030 through water offsetting, as well as finding ways to use water more efficiently.Water offsetting ca not work in the same way as carbon offsetting, where a tonne of pollutants removed from the atmosphere can cancel out a tonne emitted elsewhere, said Wemhoff, the Villanova University specialist. Improving access to water in one area does nothing to help the community that has lost access to it far away.“Carbon is a global problem – water is more localised,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has seven active datacentres in parts of the US facing water scarcity and is building six more.A grid of pink and green rectangles growing from a horizontal baseline“We have to be very, very protective around the growth of large water users,” said Jenn Duff, a council member in Mesa,Arizona, a fast-growing datacentre hub. In January, Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, opened a $1bn datacentre in the city, and Google is developing two more.The surrounding Maricopa county, where Microsoft also has two active datacentres, is facing “extreme drought”, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In June 2023, Arizona state officials revoked construction permits for some new homes there due to a lack of groundwater.Drought has not halted Google’s plans for a second Mesa datacentre, while its first centre has a permit to use 5.5m cubic metres of water a year – about the same quantity used by 23,000 ordinaryArizonans.“Is the increase in tax revenue and the relatively paltry number of jobs worth the water?” said Kathryn Sorensen, an Arizona State University professor and a former director of Mesa’s water department. “It is incumbent on city councils to think very carefully and examine the trade-offs.”Google said it won’t use the full amount of water in its Mesa permit as it plans to use an air cooling system.“Cooling systems are a hyperlocal decision – informed by our data-driven strategy called ‘climate-conscious cooling’ that balances the availability of carbon-free energy and responsibly sourced water to minimise climate impact both today and in the future,” said Google spokesperson Chris Mussett.StargateIn January at the White House, Trump announced “Project Stargate”, which he called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”.Starting in Texas, the $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, the American software companyOracle, Japan-based SoftBank and Emirati investment firm MGX will finance datacentres across the US.The day before the Stargate announcement, Trump’s inauguration date, the Chinese companyDeepSeeklaunched its own AI model, claiming it had used far less computing power – and therefore less water – than its western rivals.More recently, Bloomberg hasreportedthat Microsoft is pulling back on some of its plans for new datacentres around the world. Microsoft has alsopublished plansfor a “zero water” datacentre, and Google has said it will incorporate air cooling to reduce water use – though it isn’t yet clear how its systems will work.“I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Jaume-Palasí. “Most datacentres right now are going from air cooling to water cooling because liquid is more efficient when you try to cool down high-density racks, which are the ones that are mostly being used for AI.”And while theTrump administrationhas pledged to fast-track new energy projects to power these new datacentres, it has so far said nothing about the water they could use up.“Neither people nor data can live without water,” said Gómez. “But human life is essential and data isn’t.”Quick GuideMethodologyShowThe locations of the datacentres were compiled using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel andData Center Map. Of the 632 datacentres analysed, we were unable to determine the “active” or “developing” status for 16. Areas with water scarcity were defined as places where water is 10 times as scarce as the world’s average, according to ametricdeveloped by academics for the United Nations.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Additional reporting by Eleanor GunnExplore more on these topicsWaterAmazonMicrosoftGoogleTrump administrationDesertificationDroughtnewsShareReuse this content"

Areport from Stanford Universitythis week said 40 “notable AI models” – meaning influential – were produced by institutions in the US in 2024, compared with 15 in China and three in Europe (all French).Ina separate 2024 report, Stanford found that no EU country made the top five for “vibrancy” in AI, a metric that considered private investment, patents and research. It ranked the UK in third place behind the US and China, with France in sixth place and Germany eighth.The EU has already embarked on a plan to build 13 AI factories – sites with supercomputers and datacentres, where researchers develop and test AI models.The new AI “gigafactories” would be much larger, targeting what the commission called “moonshots”: significant innovations in healthcare, biotech, industry, robotics and scientific discovery.While the best-performing AI factories have supercomputers equipped with up to 25,000 advanced AI processors, a gigafactory would exceed 100,000 AI processors, the strategy document said.Thesepower-hungry facilities, which can requirehuge amounts of water for cooling, should run “as much as possible” on a green energy supply, an EU official said, with plans for “recycling” water if it was used.Last year 47% of electricity generated in the EU came from renewable sources, but campaigners fear that power-hungry datacentres could undermine Europe’s climate ambitions.“Europe has made some strides towards fully renewable electricity, and still has a long way to go, but this could all be undone by ballooning energy consumption,” said John Hyland, a Greenpeace spokesperson. “Every power-guzzling datacentre risks being a lifeline to polluting power plants, well illustrated in Ireland where they consumeover a fifthof the electricity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The commission is seeking to raise €20bn, using public money to incentivise private investors, via a facility provided by the European Investment Bank. The bloc is also seeking to develop European-made AI semiconductors, advanced chips that are vital for AI factories.But the commission faced criticism for indicating an openness to rethink its AI Act. The regulation, which aims tocontrol the risks posed by AI, was approved by the European parliament only last year and will not be fully applicable until August 2027. On Wednesday, the commission said it was launching a consultation on “possible simplification” of the AI Act, as part of a widerdrive to cut redtapeamid concerns about Europe’slagging economic growth.The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) said the commission needed to focus on the implementation and enforcement of the AI Act.“Much of the AI Act does not even apply yet but the commission is already signalling that it is open to cutting some of its requirements. When we know that consumers worry about how AI could be used to harm them, the commission should instead be trying to reassure consumers,” said Frederico Oliveira da Silva at BEUC.Virkkunen said the commission was “very committed” to the risk-based approach and the main principles of the AI Act, but was looking at whether there were some administrative burdens or reporting obligations that could be cut to make life easier for businesses.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)European UnionEuropean CommissionComputingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In extreme cases, Ofcom also has the power to block access to a site or app in the UK.Ofcom, which is not naming the forum under investigation, said it was focusing on whether the site had put appropriate measures in place to protect UK users, whether it had failed to complete an assessment of the harms the site could cause, as required under the legislation, and whether it had responded adequately to a request for information.“This is the first investigation opened into an individual online service provider under these new laws,” said Ofcom.TheBBC reported in 2023that the forum, easily accessible to anyone on the open web, had been connected to at least 50 deaths in the UK and had tens of thousands of members with discussions including methods of suicide.Last month, obligations came into force under the act requiring the 100,000 services under its scope – from small sites to big platforms such as X, Facebook and Google – to implement safeguards that take action against illegal harms. The legislation lists 130 “priority offences”, or illegal content, that tech companies must tackle as a priority by ensuring their moderation systems are set up to deal with such material.“We’ve been clear … that failure to comply with the new online safety duties or adequately respond to our information requests may result in enforcement action, and that we would not hesitate to take swift action where we suspect there may be serious breaches,” said Ofcom.The Molly Rose Foundation, an internet safety charity, called on Ofcom to act “quickly and decisively” andshut down the site. MRF was established by the family of Molly Russell, aBritish teenager who took her own lifeafter viewing online content related to suicide, depression and self-harm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But opting to fix an old or damaged device as a way to save money may not avoid a higher bill.“We do expect that we’ll have to increase our own parts prices some, too, unfortunately,” said Elizabeth Chamberlain, the director of sustainability at the device repair company iFixit. “We’re actively looking for sources of harvested parts from within the US. Even with higher prices on parts, however, repairs will still be much more economical than buying new.”Donald Trump’s tariffs are likely to drive up the cost of smartphone repairs because of the globalized supply chain that produces the devices’ components. The vast majority of parts for popular phones from Apple and Samsung are produced outside of the US. iPhones are primarily manufactured and assembled in China, where businesses that export to the US are bracing for a tariff of over 100%. India, where Apple has shifted some of its production and where Google in part manufactures its Pixel line of phones, is facing a 26% tariff. Samsung’s supply chain is largely based in South Korea, which may see a 25% tariff if the government isn’t able to reach a deal with Trump’s administration. The companies did not respond to requests for comment on potential price increases.Trump says ‘I know what I’m doing’ before stepping back from global tariffsRead moreTariffs may increase demand for phone repairs because a single part, even at a higher price, will remain cheaper than a complete device. The tariffs could drive up the final price of the latest iPhone by nearly $300, according to theWall Street Journal, which makes repairing the devices people already own a more viable alternative, Chamberlain said.“It’s a bit too soon to say whether the tariff news is driving more repair demand, but fixing what we’ve got makes more sense than ever, now that buying new will be more expensive,” she said. “We expect the tariffs might also drive demand for refurbishing and parts harvesting. The repair world is full of business models that don’t rely on importing stuff from overseas.”Increasing price of partsRepair shops big and small are preparing for the prices of imported parts to go up. A manager of a Brooklyn location of a national repair chain, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said that his business is anticipating a 20% increase for many of the parts required to repair devices.Dan Fernando, the owner and operator of Technesia, an independent repair shop run out of his Philadelphia home, said he is already seeing some price fluctuations for parts like a particular hard drive he often uses to repair computers. Within the past few days, Fernando has seen the price of the one-terabyte drive rise by $10, an increase that will be passed down to his customers, he said. The electronics repairman charges a flat service fee for each repair, and customers are expected to pay for the cost of a part if they need to get a replacement, a common business model in electronics repair. Fernando sources the parts from a phone repair supplier called MobileSentrix, which imports parts to the US from China and other countries.“For a screen replacement on phones, I charge $50 flat for the service plus the cost of the screen,” he said. “The customer can expect to pay $80 to $90 for a screen replacement. With the new tariff increase, it will maybe cost 50% more.”Fernando is also concerned customers will turn to shops that offer cheaper repairs that may begin to use lower grade parts to maintain their profit margins, leaving his business in the lurch. “Some people get it from eBay or Amazon. I don’t use it because I don’t know their quality,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The biggest sellers on sites for pre-owned electronics are phones two or three generations behind the latest. At the moment, the best selling devices on Swappa are the iPhones 13 and 14, according to the site’s founder and CEO, Ben Edwards.“My expectation is that, if these tariffs do remain in place and we do see even further rise in cost of new devices, I think that’ll really drive a lot of new buyers to Swappa and similar sites,” said Edwards. “I’m not sure there’s enough technological advantage with the newest generation.”But even Swappa may see prices on refurbished devices increase. The site allows sellers – which include both individuals and companies – to set their own prices and provides them with data on previous sales and current demand. When the cost of the newest smartphones go up, sellers often raise the prices of these used devices in response, Edwards said.“Essentially, demand is ultimately going to kind of dictate the price,” Edwards said. “On Swappa, because of the nature of our marketplace, where we’ve got a lot of different sellers who can each set their price independently, it’s really just market dynamics that are going to dictate the price. If somebody comes in and prices aggressively, they’re going to sell more quickly and that’ll reflect itself in the data.”In other words, if a consumer is in the market to buy a used device, Edwards advised: “I wouldn’t wait.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyiPhoneAndroidAppleGoogleSamsungMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is difficult for Americans to understand what exactly the administration is trying to do and how it will affect them. It has been simultaneously a colossal remaking of the US state and the entire global order, but also seemingly haphazard, with significant policy decisions such as spending cuts and tariff rates clearly made withlittle thoughtor preparation. Analysts and commentators of all stripes have speculated on the motives and strategy behind the Trump administration’s huge overhaul of society. But what is the Trump administration’s plan for the US?The primary moves the administration has made are major cuts to federal government capacity through the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and now an unprecedented tariff regime that has sent financial markets into a free fall. Some view these changes as part of a grand overarching strategy to rebuild some version of an imagined past America: globally hegemonic and able to exercise power nakedly over other countries, economically self-sufficient with a large manufacturing base, and a reassertion of the previous social norms and order around gender, race, and sexuality. But a deeper dive into the Trump administration’s explanation of their policies and vision reveals that rather than a single, coherent ideological project, theTrump administrationis sclerotic and being used as a vehicle for more than one competing ideological project.While the first Trump administration had no real ideological project, with Donald Trump’s surprise win being based on a personalist coalition without the backing of an organized movement, and different factions within the administration battling for control over policy and favor from the president, the second Trump administration was backed and is staffed by two major ideological projects, representing different segments of capital: the oft-discussed “national conservatism” of the Claremont Institute, the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025, and tech capital, which has used Trump as a vehicle for its own priorities.Corporate America won’t stop Trump’s tariffs. Here’s why | Alex Bronzini-VenderRead moreThese two overarching political projects and visions both see Trump as able to advance their goals, but these projects are competing with each other. Both have accepted thatRepublicanswill lose the midterms in 2026, as the president’s party nearly always does, and are thus trying to radically reshape society in that time in ways that can’t easily be reversed. They have deeply different visions for the future, and whether one wins out or both of their incompatible sets of policies are carried out will have enormous implications for the lives of Americans and people around the globe.On tariffs, the administration has offered multiple, mutually exclusive visions: with some viewing tariffs as primarily a way to rebuild US manufacturing by incentivizing producers to build in the US; some viewing tariffs as primarily a way to raise revenue, cut the deficit, and in the long-term replace the income tax entirely; and some viewing tariffs primarily as a negotiating tool to force countries to make concessions to the US on a variety of issues.Trump personally has suggested that the US become an autarky, with no trade of any kind with the outside world. It’s unclear which of these will be the plan because they each have dramatically different implications for how the tariffs are structured in the long-term, how long they will last, and their effects on US workers.In the first two views, the tariffs are a part of the national conservative project of returning the US to a previous social order. They view the nation-state as the primary actor in a zero-sum anarchic global order of competing nation-states seeking to dominate each other.Tariffsare then a way of reasserting US national power relative to other states. This fits in with Trump’s rhetoric about the US, taking the country back and reasserting American nationhood, and is the primary way analysts and commentators have viewed the administration.The tech capital that oversees Doge, however, has a different project entirely. Elon Musk, who has personally overseen the large-scale slashing of the federal government, rejectstariffs entirely. The Doge project and the tariff project are at odds. The Doge project is cloaked in the rhetoric of retro America First nationalism that would seem on its face (and is understood as by its supporters) to be precisely the opposite of what it is in practice: the outmoding of the nation-state entirely.It’s notable that the first target for Doge’s cuts were not the New Deal programs conservatives have long wanted to cut, but instead the cold war-era nodes of American state power: scientific research, funding for education and the arts, foreign aid, and other programs that were created to allow the US to outcompete the Soviet Union and other countries. Musk does not care about American great power competition, such as with China, as Trump does. Indeed, Musk has close ties with the Chinese state.For Musk and his cohorts, the US must progress past the nation state model – where the state exist to project power against other nation states and part of this bargain is keeping a certain social compact of living standard with citizens – to the vendor state model where international firms are paramount and states exist instead to compete for their favor. The Doge project ofSilicon Valleytechnolibertarianism aims to sublimate the state to capital entirely and to outsource state capacity to transnational tech firms. This is, rather than an end of globalization as the national conservatives want, the final conclusion of globalization, where international capital exists above and beyond the bounds of the nation-state.Spare a thought for the poor billionaires who backed Trump — and hate tariffs | Marina HydeRead moreThis is the reason large swathes of tech capital reversed course on Trump during theBiden administrationand became his biggest financial backers. For them, Trump exists as a vehicle for their overall project.Both of these projects are disastrous for the American people on their own, but both being partially implemented in opposing ways is even worse and will lead to disaster for US workers and our society’s basic capacity to function.While the tariffs by themselves are devastating to US consumers and could lead to a major economic crisis, the Doge cuts strip state capacity that would be needed to implement the most positive vision of tariffs returning manufacturing jobs. While tariffs drive up prices on things like semiconductors or electric vehicles, the government is simultaneously slashing the programs designed to encourage these goods to be manufactured domestically. And while the Doge cuts have slashed the state and led to the direct capture of swathes of the state by tech capital, their overall project of global tech hegemony cannot progress in a world where international trade has broken down completely.Trump and the national conservative’s dream of a return to a pre-financialization manufacturing-based economy, where the US has security through economic self-reliance, and the tech right’s commitment to creating shareholder value at all costs, and whose entire model is based entirely on the result of financialization, are incompatible and on a collision course. Different sections of capital – tech on the one hand, and the revanchist small capital class who form national conservatism’s base on the other – have different and competing interests and control of different sections of administration policy. The consequences of this intranecine competition are enormous, but either way, the next four years look dire for the American working class. The damage may take generations to fix.Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC.

But it sees a bigger, more promising story of US hegemonic declineWed 9 Apr 2025 14.11 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 14.17 EDTShareNo one, least of all consumers and workers, will win theferocious trade warthat Donald Trump has unleashed. This is “a game of who can bear more pain”, in the words ofone analyst. And because trade is at the heart of US ties with its biggest tariff target, China, the rest of the bilateral relationship is likely to deteriorate. That too is concerning.Yet China, despite theeconomic strugglesof recent years, may see a longer-term opportunity in the current crisis. Beijing’s response to the initial US tariff announcements was measured. Now it vows to “fight to the end” and has imposed an additional 50% tariff on US goods – taking the totalto 84%– in retaliation for tariffs that Mr Trump now says will hit 125%.Do not expect itto falter first. Concessions would likely be taken as a sign of weakness, encouraging the US to turn up the pressure. Xi Jinping is also a strongman who has dialled up nationalism as economic growth has slowed. Backing down would be humiliating, especially when the US vice-president, JD Vance, speaks dismissively of “Chinese peasants”.Beijing is already allowing the yuanto weaken, though a major devaluation is thought unlikely. And it has been preparing for this moment. The end of its demographic boom, Mr Xi’s vision for his nation, the impact of the pandemic, Mr Trump’s first term and the bipartisan US turn against China (for which Beijing itself deserves much of the blame) have all begun to reshape the economy. China has diversified agricultural imports and found new markets for its goods – though exports to the US still account forjust under 3% of its GDP. Last month, itannounced plansto “vigorously boost” domestic consumption, though previous action on that long-held ambition has not matched the rhetoric.Mr Trump’s abrupt announcement on Wednesday that he is suspending punitive tariffs on other countries for 90 days highlights an apparent underlying intention to make them distance themselves from China and stop them being used as a conduit for its goods. But if he goes ahead, high rates risk pushing them towards Beijing instead. Mr Trump’s erratic policy may also reflect growing anxieties about the impact of these tariffs, not least among his own supporters. China is confident that Mr Trump will come under growing pressure to rethink frombillionaire backers, ageing workers watching their retirement fundsdive,farmers, employeesfearing for their jobsand consumerscontemplating costlier iPhonesand groceries. A bilateral deal is not impossible.Beijing does not like what lies ahead. But in the longer term, it has more confidence in its trajectory. It looks back to the 2008 financial crisis, when it “saved the world” with its massive stimulus package, and looks ahead with new self-assurance after January’s AI “Sputnik moment” with itsDeepSeekplatform.Above all, Beijing believes that when this storm has passed, few will regard the US as a dependable economic or security guarantor, and China will appear a more predictable, if not more likable, partner. At February’s Munich security conference – where Mr Vance’s sneering attack on European allies made the headlines – China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi,pledgedthat China would be “a steadfast constructive force” and “factor of certainty in this multipolar system”. Some countries may feel forced to live with Beijing’s own trade and investment restrictions, and its use of economic coercion for political purposes. Others may simply drift from America’s orbit.This is a transformational moment in the global order.Chinaexpects to suffer. But it will not be entirely unhappy as it watches the US advance its own decline.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It underscores the judiciary’s commitment to the first amendment, and it suggests that standing up for one’s principles may not be just a gesture made in vain.Here’s what the US district court judge Trevor McFadden – a Trump appointee – had to say about the AP’s beingdenied accessto White House news events because of the organization’s editorial decision tocontinue using the termGulf of Mexico instead of Gulf of America:Donald Trump has transformed the American story | Osita NwanevuRead more“The Court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists – be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere, it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints. The Constitution requires no less.”The Trump administrationis appealing the ruling. It is not clear that a higher court will not overrule McFadden.But what is clear is that Julie Pace, the AP’s top editor, was right when she made the argument in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that more was at stake here than the name of a body of water. “It’s really about whether the government can control what you say,” Pace wrote.This administration wants to do that – and it is willing to punish those who don’t fall in line.Yet, courageous voices are out there. And sometimes, they make a difference.When Jaime Cook, the school principal in Sackets Harbor,New York, put out a heartfelt public statement about three students and their mother being abruptly taken to a Texas detention facility by federal agents, her words required the same kind of guts.“Our 3 students who were taken away by ICE were doing everything right,” Cook wrote. “They had declared themselves to immigration judges, attended court on their assigned dates, and were following the legal process. They are not criminals.”Others found their voices, too. In this tiny town of fewer than 1,400 people – which happens to be a vacation residence of the US “border czar”, Tom Homan – nearly 1,000 people came out to protest last weekend. This week, the mother and three children were on their way back home.Courage mattered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Too many lines had been crossed, he said; he had no choice.“The day after I resigned,” Crosswell testified, “my sister had her first daughter and I want my niece to know the same democracy that I’ve known. That’s worth any cost.”None of this is easy. After all, Trump and those around him are famously vindictive. It’s not hard to understand why law firms, universities, school officials, news organizations and so many others have decided to avoid the fight and to rationalize the decision to give in or remain silent.Two visions within Trump world are battling for primacy. Which will win? | Ben DavisRead moreBut those mentioned here chose to act on principle. In so doing, they have the power to inspire the rest of us, which is likely to be important in the long run.Do brave words or principled resignations or expensive, possibly fruitless lawsuits really accomplish anything? Will they keep America’s teetering democracy from falling off a cliff?Maybe not. But everyone who cares about fairness, freedom and the rule of law ought to be grateful nonetheless for these demonstrations of integrity.

The boast sounded better before the US whacked 40%-plus tariffs on countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia, the manufacturing source of many of the trainers and “athleisure” apparel in the shops.JD’s answer to the tariff question was a big dunno. “At this stage, the outcome of these developments is uncertain,” said the company, stating the bleedin’ obvious. Even its forecast that pre-tax profits this year will be between £878m to £982m came with the enormous qualification that it “excludes any potential impact from changes to tariffs”, which makes the prediction meaningless.But one can’t blame Schultz for such vagueness. Trying to model this stuff is genuinely pointless when US tariffs on China, for instance,can double in a day. In JD’s case, it isn’t sourcing most of its US products directly from overseas, but is buying from those who do – Nike, Adidas, New Balance and so on. On the safe assumption that Nike et al won’t volunteer to absorb 100% of the tariff impact in their profit margins, the first big question is how the arm-wrestle between manufacturer and retailer plays out. JD starts from the position of being the biggest on its side on the table; on the other hand, it is in a market where brands reign supreme.Then there is a huge unknown of what price increases US consumers will swallow, and what happens to consumer confidence along the way, including in the two-thirds of JD’s business that is not in the US. It may be at least six months, one suspects, before it is able to offer useful reports on the real-world effects. Even then, it may be hard to separate the tariff whack from other factors – the sports fashion world, for example, has been slowing for at least two years, especially in the UK.Yet another variable is the extent to which manufacturers with global supply chains can play the tariff rate card game of switching between locations. It is a fantasy to think many shoe and garment factories will migrate to the US but Turkey, with a baseline 10% tariff, may be an alternative to Asia.The multiple uncertainties are a downer for investors but one also understands why JD’s shares rose 10% on (another) big down for the FTSE 100 index. At 69p, JD – after a rocky few years ofprofit upsetsand heavy spending on logistics and IT systems – is rated at just six times earnings and is currently generating enough cash to afford a £100m share buy-back.In normal circumstances, you’d call that cheap. It isn’t cheap if a proper Trump-inspired deep global recession is on the cards – trainers are the ultimate deferrable purchase. But the bit we don’t know is how retailers and supply chains will adapt and automate. The pass-through effects of US tariffs probably won’t be straightforward.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsNils Pratley on financeJD Sports FashionInternational tradeDonald TrumpTariffsNikeRetail industrycommentShareReuse this content"

They have deeply different visions for the future, and whether one wins out or both of their incompatible sets of policies are carried out will have enormous implications for the lives of Americans and people around the globe.On tariffs, the administration has offered multiple, mutually exclusive visions: with some viewing tariffs as primarily a way to rebuild US manufacturing by incentivizing producers to build in the US; some viewing tariffs as primarily a way to raise revenue, cut the deficit, and in the long-term replace the income tax entirely; and some viewing tariffs primarily as a negotiating tool to force countries to make concessions to the US on a variety of issues.Trump personally has suggested that the US become an autarky, with no trade of any kind with the outside world. It’s unclear which of these will be the plan because they each have dramatically different implications for how the tariffs are structured in the long-term, how long they will last, and their effects on US workers.In the first two views, the tariffs are a part of the national conservative project of returning the US to a previous social order. They view the nation-state as the primary actor in a zero-sum anarchic global order of competing nation-states seeking to dominate each other.Tariffsare then a way of reasserting US national power relative to other states. This fits in with Trump’s rhetoric about the US, taking the country back and reasserting American nationhood, and is the primary way analysts and commentators have viewed the administration.The tech capital that oversees Doge, however, has a different project entirely. Elon Musk, who has personally overseen the large-scale slashing of the federal government, rejectstariffs entirely. The Doge project and the tariff project are at odds. The Doge project is cloaked in the rhetoric of retro America First nationalism that would seem on its face (and is understood as by its supporters) to be precisely the opposite of what it is in practice: the outmoding of the nation-state entirely.It’s notable that the first target for Doge’s cuts were not the New Deal programs conservatives have long wanted to cut, but instead the cold war-era nodes of American state power: scientific research, funding for education and the arts, foreign aid, and other programs that were created to allow the US to outcompete the Soviet Union and other countries. Musk does not care about American great power competition, such as with China, as Trump does. Indeed, Musk has close ties with the Chinese state.For Musk and his cohorts, the US must progress past the nation state model – where the state exist to project power against other nation states and part of this bargain is keeping a certain social compact of living standard with citizens – to the vendor state model where international firms are paramount and states exist instead to compete for their favor. The Doge project ofSilicon Valleytechnolibertarianism aims to sublimate the state to capital entirely and to outsource state capacity to transnational tech firms. This is, rather than an end of globalization as the national conservatives want, the final conclusion of globalization, where international capital exists above and beyond the bounds of the nation-state.Spare a thought for the poor billionaires who backed Trump — and hate tariffs | Marina HydeRead moreThis is the reason large swathes of tech capital reversed course on Trump during theBiden administrationand became his biggest financial backers. For them, Trump exists as a vehicle for their overall project.Both of these projects are disastrous for the American people on their own, but both being partially implemented in opposing ways is even worse and will lead to disaster for US workers and our society’s basic capacity to function.While the tariffs by themselves are devastating to US consumers and could lead to a major economic crisis, the Doge cuts strip state capacity that would be needed to implement the most positive vision of tariffs returning manufacturing jobs. While tariffs drive up prices on things like semiconductors or electric vehicles, the government is simultaneously slashing the programs designed to encourage these goods to be manufactured domestically. And while the Doge cuts have slashed the state and led to the direct capture of swathes of the state by tech capital, their overall project of global tech hegemony cannot progress in a world where international trade has broken down completely.Trump and the national conservative’s dream of a return to a pre-financialization manufacturing-based economy, where the US has security through economic self-reliance, and the tech right’s commitment to creating shareholder value at all costs, and whose entire model is based entirely on the result of financialization, are incompatible and on a collision course. Different sections of capital – tech on the one hand, and the revanchist small capital class who form national conservatism’s base on the other – have different and competing interests and control of different sections of administration policy. The consequences of this intranecine competition are enormous, but either way, the next four years look dire for the American working class. The damage may take generations to fix.Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC.

I arrived with all my belongings contained in two suitcases, and just enough cash to cover the first month’s rent on a small apartment. But I also had something of greater value: an offer to work and train in one of America’s top biomedical research laboratories, a chance to participate in the revolution that is modernbiological science.In the years that followed, I became an American scientist and raised an American family. Now, I lead a laboratory in one of the US’s great universities. I am a member of America’s National Academy of Sciences. From a scientist’s perspective, I have lived the American dream.My story is not unusual. Many of the best scientists in the world are drawn to the US, joining many Americans who choose to build a career in science. This attraction to American science is because more so than any other country, America values unfettered scientific enquiry. In the US, scientists have greater resources to pursue their work, and scientists are an integral part of a culture that has innovation and dynamism at its core.Simply put, the US is the best place in the world to be for smart, ambitious people to make discoveries, advance knowledge and improve people’s lives. Consequently, the US leads the world inscience, by any measurable criterion. Twenty of the world’s top 30 universities are American, most Nobel prizes in science are won by Americans, half the world’s medicines are invented in the US. When “American exceptionalism” is spoken of, scientists, perhaps more so than any other profession, know exactly what is meant.The vast majority of fundamental scientific research in the US is funded by American taxpayers, through bodies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation, that make grants to universities and research institutes. These grants support scientific infrastructure, pay scientists’ salaries and fund specific research projects. While charities and individual donors also make contributions, these are dwarfed by federal support.Public funding for science is essential because most endeavors in science cannot be directly commercialized, and fundamental science is rarely done by the for-profit sector. Moreover, science, by definition, requires trial-and-error experimentation at the edge of knowledge – its outcomes are unpredictable. Therefore, science is, in a sense, inherently inefficient.Nonetheless, science is the only way to generate the foundational knowledge that enables technology, medicine and an understanding of how the world works, that can be applied for the benefit of humanity. The knowledge uncovered by taxpayer-funded science underpins American innovation and exceptionalism.The extraordinary success that has been American science makes it especially distressing to now witness its destruction. The public investment that has made American science exceptional also makes it dependent on political support.For the most part, both sides of the political divide have recognized the obvious value of American science to society and have broadly supported public investment in it. But this no longer appears to be the case.As I write, American science is being throttled. Funds promised for ongoing research projects are being withheld by the new administration. Executive orders of dubious legal basis have been issued that will slash resources for science. Some colleagues have already been forced to terminate the employment and training of the next generation of scientists, as funds previously promised to them are denied. Many more colleagues will need to take similar steps in the coming weeks and months as their research grants are withheld.Many science graduate schools are not accepting new students, many are rescinding earlier offers, and others are dramatically reducing their intake. Make no mistake, the scientific workforce is being gutted. The withholding of scientific resources as a form of punishment for certain high-profile universities has been widely publicized, but it is actually happening in nearly every American biomedical research institution. The US’s capacity to do science, and its ability to draw and retain scientific talent is being discarded.In addition to the withholding of resources, American science is being further corroded by the installation of leadership that does not value or even understand science, and is clearly incapable of effectively leading it.In the past, American science was led by distinguished scientists and administrators who grasped its foundational role in a society whose lifeblood is innovation. Under the new administration, science leadership roles have been assigned to those without notable achievement, whose only real distinction is infamy. We would never have heard of these individuals were it not for their ludicrous pronouncements, poor science or outright quackery.These new leaders are targeting specific areas of great scientific importance for elimination. They have commanded that NIH grant applications be screened for particular scientific terms; for example, projects on vaccines using a particular exceptionally promising technology, that is disfavored based on a whim of the leadership, are being weeded out. Entire programs that are intended to better prepare the US and the world for future pandemics are being terminated.As an example, in my own laboratory, a peer-reviewed and approved NIH project to devise ways to make better vaccines has been prematurely ended, without scientific justification. Meanwhile, the new leadership will embark on studies of their own inclination, ostensibly to address questions of vaccine safety. These issues are already long settled but will be re-examined by individuals with a track record of bias, appointed by leaders with a track record of bias.Finally, within the past few days, a purge of scientists at the NIH has commenced, including the capricious firing of distinguished individuals in management roles. This is clearly and obviously not how science should be done, and this is clearly and obviously not how science should be led. Science in the US is entering a phase resembling the Lysenko era in the Soviet Union.While the destruction of science will not immediately affect many Americans who are not scientists, the impact of its demise on all our children and grandchildren will be dire. Economic development is dependent on scientific innovation, and if the US does not lead the way in science, other countries will take the leadership role. In medicine, consider the impact of science done in decades past on American lives today; the survival of nearly all American children to adulthood is a fairly recent phenomenon that is largely attributable to fundamental scientific discoveries of the recent past.If we continue the destructive course plotted by this administration, medicines that would otherwise have saved lives in future generations, will not be invented. Technologies that would have ensured future employment and prosperity in the US will not be devised. Solutions that allow the generation of power while causing less damage to the environment, will never be developed. Clearly, if we decline to nurture science, the lives of future Americans will be shorter, sicker and poorer. Science may not be the only thing that makes the US great, but it is surely a cornerstone of American exceptionalism, and it is being destroyed by this government.Paul Darren Bieniasz is a British-American virologist whose main area of research is HIV/Aids.

Ever since, especially sincethe Enlightenmentand the scientific revolution of the 17th century, there has been a long, centrifugal process, with discipline after discipline making its distinctive contribution and marking out its methods and its domain of inquiry. Raphael’s paintingThe School of Athensdisplays this perfectly, with the two great philosophers Plato and Aristotle in the centre. Yet even here, Raphael points at the specialisation of knowledge that is about to explode. Plato points upwards, symbolising his interest in the timelessness of metaphysics. Aristotle gestures downwards, emphasising his interest in the empirical.Today, at university, students and researchers focus on a single sub-branch of, say, modal logic, labour economics or organic chemistry. Knowledge has accumulated and fragmented. Renaissance men (or women) are almost nonexistent.Hand in hand with this, especially in the last century, we have seen ever more rigorous academic standards and an ever sharper emphasis on evidence and logic, and the importance of separating these from opinions. As a senior member of Oxford University put it to me recently, from the start he was taught to distinguish the positive from the normative, and that, in the words of his tutor, “we only do the positive”.This is correct 99% of the time, and the new chancellor of Oxford was fully on target when he said a universitydid not need a foreign policy. However, the central question about universities – all universities – is whether they can be and should be neutral with respect to everything. Should we avoid the normative all the time? Absolutely not.Return to the Raphael painting. Aristotle and Plato have different approaches, but they are entirely agreed about one thing: the subject of their inquiry is the cosmos. Or, as Ludwig Wittgenstein put it, “The world is all that is the case”. We in universities, in every discipline, have an interest in investigating the universe as it is. This can and should include writings about human imagination or our dreams or fantasies. But our investigations cannot take seriously claims about the world that we know not to be the case. Evolution and creationism are not to be compared, one with the other, any more than we should take someone seriously who believes the Earth is flat. In universities, beliefs are to be examined, not taken as God given.None of this means that there is anything as simple asthe truth. The truth is almost always partial, debatable and context dependent. Yet, as Bernard Williams argued so convincingly inTruth and Truthfulness, academics must be truth-tellers. We cannot be neutral with respect to fake news, misinformation or outright lies. No matter where these come from, they must be called out. If a university does not believe this and does not act accordingly, it does not deserve to be a university.WithColumbia having capitulated, and withHarvardandPrincetonunder pressure to follow suit, every university, not just across the US, but around the globe, must unite in standing up for truth-telling.Andrew Graham is a political economist, former master of Balliol College, Oxford and former director of theScott TrustExplore more on these topicsUniversitiesOpinionAcademicsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

That said, he has undoubtedly thrust the US back into history ⁠– and not just through his assault, in recent days, on the global economic order.About 50 years ago, the tumults of the late 1960s and early 1970s began giving way to a quietude that would carry us through the end of the cold war. Tested as we may have been by conflict, scandals and crises economic and not, we entered this new century ⁠– and met the uncertainties of a new world we’d forced into being ⁠– surer of ourselves than ever before. The towers fell, yes, but the US’s sense of purpose was as much of a settled fact in the world as American power. The American people were divided, true, but for all but an impertinent and implacable few, the major questions of American identity had been resolved. The meaning of American values, the contents of the American dream, the members, in good standing, of American society ⁠– these things were known and known so deeply, we supposed, that they hardly needed articulation.In 2008, the election of Barack Obama offered impatient readers a place to close the book on the American story for good. And many did ⁠– as though everything that followed the first Black presidency would be epilogue. But the triumphalism of that moment gave way to doubt almost immediately. Donald Trump barrelled into political conversation,four yearsbefore he launched his first run for the presidency, as the loudest proponent of the theory that Obama had actually been born in Kenya ⁠– a foreign invader perhaps backed by shadowy forces threatening the American way of life. It wasn’t difficult to see where this rhetoric would lead the right if left unchecked. It also wasn’t surprising, for those who knew the American right well, to see the Republican party, including its establishment nominee for the presidency,Mitt Romney, elevate and embrace him anyway.A little over a decade on, and just over two months into Trump’s second term, the book has been thrown back open. Who we are, what we are, where we are going as a country ⁠– everything is up for grabs again. And the president is going in for it all with both hands. After two or three years of resigned concessions from Trump’s putative critics to his framing of the immigration problem, the solution we’ve chosen is barbarism ⁠– women in a Miami detention facility,for instance, sleeping 27 to a cell on concrete floors that are also their only toilets, or innocent men being flown over to goons in El Salvador.Who we are, what we are, where we are going as a country ⁠– everything is up for grabs againThere, it’s been reported that many of the new prisoners at the “Terrorism Confinement Center” were labeled by our immigration authorities as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua for having tattoos – including a man bearing one forReal Madridand another man with one forautism awareness. On 15 March, a photojournalist for Timecapturedthe intake of a man who said he was a gay barber. “A sea of trustees descended on the men with electric shavers, stripping heads of hair with haste,” he wrote. “The guy who claimed to be a barber began to whimper, folding his hands in prayer as his hair fell. He was slapped. The man asked for his mother, then buried his face in his chained hands and cried as he was slapped again.” This week, the administrationadmittedthat a Maryland father had been deported to El Salvador by mistake. The administration also said that it would not be returning him to the United States ⁠– as he is now in the custody of El Salvador.A French scientistbarredfrom entering the county after criticisms of the administration were found on his phone. A Canadian actordetainedfor nearly two weeks over permit paperwork. Apermanent residentfrom Germany, stripped naked, interrogated and detained by immigration officials upon returning from Luxembourg. No one with sense expected Trump to act judiciously here; the prejudices and paranoia driving immigration hardliners are no longer news. But seemingly every day, the dragnet constructed by the administration manages to surprise. Many of the most telling anecdotes still to come will be from our campuses. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who was confirmed with the support of every Democrat in the Senate, hastoldthe press that many of the more than 300 visas department officials have evoked since he’s taken office had belonged to student “lunatics”. The detentions of two of the students in question ⁠have already made headlines: Columbia’sMahmoud Khalil, guilty, per the administration, of the crime of organizing against Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, and Tufts’sRumeysa Ozturk, taken into federal custody apparently for writing an op-ed about the same.The images from thevideoof her arrest ⁠may mark this era as indelibly as the frames of George Floyd’s murder and stills from the attack on the Capitol four years ago ⁠– masked agents of the state, appearing from nowhere, surrounding and snatching a frightened woman off the street for having expressed an opinion. Nothing could seem more irrelevant, as you watch her being led into an unmarked car, than the debate over whether Trumpism constitutes fascism as a technical matter, though it is surely a point in the “it’s fascism” camp’s favor that the administration may not allow the debate to continue. Nine billion dollars infederal grantsto Harvard, a rhetorical target of the conservative movement since time immemorial, have been placed under review with the tissue-thin pretext that the university has not done enough to fight antisemitism ⁠– which the US president is something of an expert in given hisstancethat the American Jews worthy of respect are the ones who’ve proven themselves sufficiently loyal to the Republican party and its objectives. Grants to other institutions have already been suspended on the same grounds, including $400m in grants toColumbia, which appointed anoverseerto monitor its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies department for wrongthink in response to the administration’s demands.View image in fullscreen‘Here, finally, after years of elite hyperventilation on the subject, an extraordinary, concrete, and non-conjectural threat to free speech on and off campus has arrived.’Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHere, finally, after years of elite hyperventilation on the subject, an extraordinary, concrete and non-conjectural threat to free speech on and off campus has arrived. And many of those who branded themselves warriors in its defense, making sweeping and lucrative generalizations about some of the Americans now in the administration’s sights to that end ⁠– student activists and advocates for Palestinian rights, transgender people broadly speaking ⁠– have yet to speak out. According toIn These Times, only 24% of those who signed on to Harper’s Magazine’s Letter on Justice and Open Debate in 2020 ⁠– a courageous stand against the brutal tyranny of sophomores and sensitivity readers, akin, we were so often told, to the terrors of Mao’s China ⁠– have publicly condemned the administration’s moves against colleges and dissident students. Perhaps that’s due to broad agreement among speech pundits: just days after Ozturk was carted off to a detention facility, a New York Times op-ed by Greg Weiner, president of Assumption University,claimed the prevalence of progressive beliefson campus constituted a threat to free expression “comparable” to state censorship.The word for this is acquiescence and we’re seeing it all around. Major law firms responding to the president’s formalized thuggery with offers to do its biddingpro bono. Companies and non-profits pre-emptively doing away withdiversity initiativesand any other activities that may raise the hackles of an administration that, per anexecutive orderon “restoring truth and sanity to American history”, has officially rejected the view “that race is not a biological reality”. One could make a little game of guessing each day which leaders and institutions might fold to the new regime and how. That isn’t to say some aren’t stretching themselves in opposition. This week, Cory Booker, out of sheer, sweaty ambition and a sense of political opportunity that has eluded most Democrats,brokeStrom Thurmond’s record for the longest speech in the Senate’s history with a 25-hour jeremiad against the administration and the material havoc its policies are already wreaking across the country. This beats the huffy indignation about the violation of governing norms many Democrats have been given to over the last few weeks ⁠– though there is also a potent argument about the form Trump’s misgovernance is taking and the precipice he’s brought the country to that’s actually worth making.On 19 April will be the250th anniversaryof the beginning of the war that founded this country ⁠– a war that, as we would do well to remember, was animated in large part by an ideal that stands undiminished by time and unmarred by the sins of our past. Human beings are not made to bear arbitrary, capricious and unaccountable rule. Whatever our social standing or economic status, whatever side of national borders we happen to fall upon, we have rights that should prohibit others from abusing us to their narrow ends and entitle us to governance that allows us to pursue our own. In the time since the founding, we’ve come to commit ourselves to this ideal more deeply and sincerely than those who first arrived at it. And those of us who remain committed to defending it have reached a point of decision and decisive action. What we face now, at the juncture in history we’ve been dragged to, is nothing less than the end of the American republic. And the chief danger to it, we should insist, is something much larger than the third term the president is considering to thelaughterof elected Republicans, something that will outlast this administration and outlive Trump if we allow it. It is the ideology that brought Trump to power to begin with.Even now, many are keeping to the idea that Trump’s rise was an aberration, as though the country had merely wandered off a path towards progress that our leaders ⁠– Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative ⁠alike – were leading us down with a common purpose, despite their disagreements. When Trump finally leaves the political arena, Democrats such as the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, haveinsistedpublicly and privately, the US will find and walk that sunny path again, strengthened by the Republican party’s remorse. At the heart of this delusion is a refusal to understand the nature of the Republican project: a refusal to understand that US conservatism has been built upon the idea that men like Trump ought to control our government and our society.National disintegration at the hands of the Republican party or a future where power is held by the many and not a dangerous few ⁠– this is the choice that must be presented to the American peopleTo be a conservative is to believe that a natural order rightly produces winners and losers ⁠– rulers and the ruled – and that the meddling hands of government or those who hope to change society shouldn’t interfere in that sound and sacred process ⁠or upend the hierarchies it produces on the basis of abstract principle. This is the ideological basis of the right’s attacks upon the right to vote and the democratic process ⁠– the reason why even some of Trump’s critics on the right can be heard musing aloud aboutrestricting the franchiseto the worthy and intelligent. It is why animus towards immigrants and minorities ⁠– for getting more resources and sympathy than they deserve, for the ways they might unduly influence our culture and values ⁠– will always find receptive audiences within the conservative electorate.And it is why conservative policymakers have worked for the last half century to build a political economy where executives and investors can accrue unlimited returns to their supposed genius and daring ⁠– in the millions, billions and soon trillions ⁠– unrestrained by government or organized labor. The candidacies and now presidencies of Donald Trump, an autocratic bigot and billionaire, sprang from this ground as predictably as a jack in the box. And as troubled as they seem by the material and political costs of his trade agenda, Republican policymakers and donors have surely taken heart in how totally the conservative agenda has succeeded elsewhere under Trump’s leadership. Federal programs and federal employment are being slashed, federal regulations are being dismantled, the renewal of a major tax cut is around the corner, undesirables are being punished and discouraged from entering the country, and even our universities and other pillars of liberal civil society are being brought to heel in keeping with conservative social objectives.As a young man, I fell in love with the US. The country’s soul is still there, despite Trump’s best efforts to destroy it | John HarrisRead moreAs difficult as it might be to imagine that whatever follows Trump might be even worse, we have ample reason to believe it could. In ways he hardly intends, Elon Musk, who purchased control of the federal bureaucracy with$260min contributions to Donald Trump’s campaign, is a vision of the future being created for us ⁠– rule by a class of madmen with messianic pretensions, deranged by their own wealth into a confidence that dominion overthe heavensand eveneternal lifeare within their reach. But the wealthy aren’t gods entitled by providence or some holy and immutable laws of nature or commerce to dominate us. In fact, Donald Trump and Elon Musk are, by some distance, the stupidest men ever to hold executive power in this country, inferior in character and intelligence to the very workers they’ve spent the last two months driving out of government ⁠– researchers, scientists, humanitarians whose efforts have saved the lives of millions across the globe⁠, all sent packing by an administration so captured by idiocy it has announced it intends to seek trade remedies against two uninhabitedislandsnear Antarctica.Humiliation, immiseration, chaos and more of all to come ⁠– this is what the US’s promise is being traded for, thanks to a Republican party that, plainly, poses the greatest threat to the endurance of this country since the Confederacy. The policies it pursues will materially ruin us as thoroughly as the ideology motivating it has morally coarsened and corroded us. And the constitutional order so many are still appealing to in our collective defense has only aided and abetted it ⁠– in anti-democratically bringing Donald Trump to office in the first place, making his removal functionally impossible and structurally empowering the most conservative parts of this country so deeply that the right has been substantially insulated from paying the electoral price of its extremism. We will be judged harshly by history the longer we delay in coming to terms with these truths and building the political response the moment demands of us ⁠– not a set of strategies or rhetorical approaches aimed merely at victory in the next few elections or a drive to restore our norms and institutions, but a movement aimed at defeating the US right decisively and completing the still unfinished project of US democracy.National disintegration at the hands of the Republican party or a future where political and economic power are held by the many and not a now dangerous few ⁠– this is the choice that must be presented to the American people. This is the fight we’re now in.Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpBarack ObamaMitt RomneyRepublicansUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

I have a theoryWed 9 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 12.30 EDTShareExcuse me for a moment while I clamber on top of my high horse to deliver an important public safety announcement:stop buying enormous cars!Please, for the love of God, pedestrians and my tiny chihuahua that is just trying to cross the road, stop this cycle of car-brained insanity.I write this from the US, where everything (including the presidential ego) is supersized and where going for a walk means having to constantly peer around one enormous truck to make sure you’re not going to get hit by another enormous truck. Still, at least in the US the big cars have big roads to drive down. The trend for bloated vehicles is spreading to places where they’re even more unsuitable. New research has found thatmore than 1m carsthat are too big to fit in parking spaces are being sold in the UK each year.It’s wrong to call these supersized vehicles sport utility vehicles (SUVs): a large proportion of them are not used for anything sportier than a supermarket run. Rather, we seem to have crossed over into emotional support vehicle (ESV) territory. A lot of the tanks I see on the road appear to serve no other purpose than making their owner feel better about their insecurities.Large car enthusiasts may protest that this isn’t true and bigger cars are the safer choice. And I can certainly see how it feels dangerous to be the smallest car on the road nowadays. But this obsession with ESVs is proving deadly. “For every life that the heaviest 1% of SUVs and trucks save, there are more than a dozen lives lost in other vehicles,” arecent analysisby the Economist found. The analysis also found that “the heaviest US vehicles are responsible for 37 deaths in the other car per 10,000 crashes compared with 5.7 for median-weight cars and 2.6 for the lightest cars”. Car bloat is part of the reason pedestrian deaths in the UShave been rising.Still, perhaps this problem is now in the rear-view mirror. Trump’s tariffs are about to make cars – along with everything else –even more expensive. It’s going to be hard to justify a giant car when dinner consists of one $30 egg. It would be a shame if it took an economic crash to trigger it, but there’s a tiny chance the US, forced to tighten its belt, may find itself falling back in love with smaller cars.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMotoringOpinionRoad safetyAutomotive industryUS politicsTariffsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But apparently we will have to wait until after the election for theReserve Bank of Australiato bother doing anything.In 2020, when the Covid pandemic took hold in Australia, the Reserve Bank boardmet on 3 Marchto cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.5%. Within a week it was clear this was not enough. The world had changed and waiting until April would be negligent. And so the RBA board meton 19 March, cut rates again and also announced further measures.ASX 200: Mining companies hit hard as Australian shares plunge on US-China trade war fearsRead moreThis is the great thing about monetary policy – the Reserve Bank doesn’t need to spend weeks negotiating with crossbenchers or drafting the legislation. Nor does it have to worry about budget cycles or an expenditure review process.It can meet and cut rates in response to events.Last week we had an event. A big one. One that no one on the RBA board or executive has ever experienced.That’s because no one has ever experienced a US administration so divorced from reality that it apparently thoughtusing the same formula as ChatGPTto set tariffs on every import in the US was a smart way to do things.No one has ever experienced a US president so surrounded by selfish and incompetent advisers that not one even thought to ponder why the US was placing atariff on penguins.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterNo one has ever experienced a global recession where we know precisely which individual on the planet is to blame.How utterly changed are things?Well last Tuesday after the RBA put outits statement saying everything was uncertainso it may as well do nothing, investors thought the likelihood of a rate cut in May was no better than 39%. By Friday last week that was up to 70% and on Monday it hit 96%:If the graph does not display click hereEven more, consider that back in February after the RBA cut rates the market peered into its crystal ball and thought the RBA was pretty much done with rate cuts and we may get only another two over the next 18 months. By Tuesday last week this was changed to perhaps three, but don’t bet your mortgage on it.Now five rate cuts by the end of the year is on the cards:If the graph does not display click hereAnd this was before Donald Trump decided to puta 104% tariff on imports from our biggest export destination, China. It was not a shock on Wednesday morningthe ASX 200 fell 2% in the first 30 minutes.So much for worries about inflation; now the worry is that Trump – who appears to think a trade deficit is the same as a tariff – is going to keep tariffs in place and send the world into a recession.The maths is pretty simple – Trump’s tariffs make things more expensive for Americans, which means businesses and households in the US will buy less stuff (both imports and domestic).China also has responded with more tariffs, andso too has the EU.So around the world people and businesses will pay more for things. Their incomes have not increased, so everyone will buy less, which means less gets made, which means fewer people employed to make things, and … well … welcome to recession town.

That’s exactly what he’s doing.”That may be the most deluded statement I’ve heard from a major party leader for a long while.The only reason the RBA may cut rates is because the person who got control of the Oval Office decided to make everyone poorer.The amount of LNP Kool-Aid you would need to drink to think this is Anthony Albanese’s fault is beyond the stomach capacity of most.But what will either leader do should Trump continue to display the economic understanding of a piece of navel lint?Would Dutton or Albanese contemplate stimulus measures such as what occurred during the GFC (which worked, and which is why in Australia we call it the global financial crisis, while in the UK and US they call it the Great Recession)?Trump flags ‘major tariff on pharmaceuticals’ as trade chief says US ‘running up score’ on AustraliaRead moreOn Tuesday, Dutton said his government would always “live within its means”. OK, but in a recession that means austerity, so is that what he is saying?But even more urgent is what will the RBA do, and why isn’t it doing it now?Last Friday, in my role as chief economist of the Australia Institute, I called for the RBA board to act like it did in the pandemicand call another meeting. Why are we waiting until 20 May to respond to tariffs that are having an impact now?Why did the RBA board meet last Monday and Tuesday when they knew Trump was announcing his tariffs on Thursday morning? Why not delay the board meeting until after that, given things would have been a lot less certain than was the case just two days earlier?Monetary policy is meant to be nimble and yet our central bank is acting as though it has to abide by fixed dates.Yesterday the Treasury held a meeting with the heads of the RBA, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

The British government is finally outragedOwen JonesEighteen months of slaughter in Gaza has resulted in little more than tepid official letters. It’s taken diplomatic humiliation to cause real angerWed 9 Apr 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 08.58 EDTShareWhat does it take for the British government to express genuine outrage over the conduct of Israel? The extermination of tens of thousands of civilians, many of them children, did not cross that particular threshold. What Donald Trump flippantly summarised as “a civilisation has been wiped out in Gaza” did not qualify either: to be specific, the obliteration of almost all civilian infrastructure, such as homes, hospitals, schools, libraries, mosques and universities. Deliberatestarvation; repeated forced displacements; the butchery ofmedics,aid workers,journalists; overwhelming evidence of industrialisedtortureandsexual violence– none of this merited much more than our foreign secretary issuing a tweet or, at best,penning a letterto “urge” Israel’s government to do something he knows it will not do.So what has finally drivenDavid Lammyto direct real, righteous anger towards Israel – to describe its actions as “unacceptable, counterproductive and deeply concerning”? Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, being denied entry to Israel and deported.My objection is not to Yang and Mohamed, subjected to this diplomatic humiliation because they were en route to visit the illegally occupied West Bank, where a UN special rapporteurhas warnedof mass ethnic cleansing by Israel. It was their past criticisms of Israel’s violations of international law that led to their removal, after all. Israel’s authorities knew they would speak the truth about what they would witness, rather than regurgitate propaganda: the authorities claim Yang and Mohamed sought to “document Israeli security forces and spread anti-Israel hatred”. (But really, they needn’t worry: Starmer’s goonsblacklist Labour MPswho speak out about Israel’s crimes quicker than Lammy’s speechwriter can think up meaningless platitudes.)A shellshocked parliamentary Labour party decided that this time Israel needed to face the consequences: namely, a few dozen MPsposing in a photoshootalongside Yang and Mohamed, all staring down the barrel of a camera looking very stern indeed. Tel Aviv’s rulers haven’t quaked so much since Lammy last sent a disappointed missive on headed paper.The two deported MPs have every right to feel aggrieved. Yet it is not an attack on them to point out that they are now being showered with more heartfelt emotion by their insipid colleagues than has been offered up for all the Palestinian women, men and children slaughtered in 18 months of genocidal depravity.“This is no way to treat British parliamentarians,” cries Wes Streeting, the health secretary who was nearly unseated by the then 23-year-old British-Palestinian wunderkind Leanne Mohamad at the last election, not least because of his failure to take a stand against genocide. Streeting’s colleagues suffered embarrassment and inconvenience; asnew reportsunderline, Palestinian detainees held without charge and trial – including children – have been beaten with batons, subjected to electric shocks, denied access to medical care, sprayed with tear gas in cells, menaced by dogs, deprived of food and water, had their toenails removed, been dunked in chemicals, set on fire and sexually abused. In Westminster, there is not even a fraction of the uproar at this barbarism, but then the victims do not have the grand imprimatur of “British parliamentarians” – they are mere Palestinians.In truth, the unpleasant treatment of Yang and Mohamed could have been worth it if it achieved what thousands of Palestinian children being burned alive and crushed under rubble has not: forcing the UK government to cease its complicity in some of the worst crimes of our age. Alas, it will not.Remember thethree British aid workersslaughtered by the Israeli state in Gaza almost exactly a year ago? Don’t feel embarrassed if not, given how swiftly the World Central Kitchen attack was memory-holed by British politicians and media outlets alike. Six western aid workers and their Palestinian colleague set off in a convoy of vehiclesclearly markedwith huge WCK logos. They had coordinated their movements with the Israel Defense Forces on a pre-approved route. The Israeli army then methodically attacked the vehicles one by one in direct, targeted strikes, killing all seven aid workers. British politicians even let Israel get away with massacring our own citizens – do you really think the Israeli authorities are going to blink at whisking two backbenchers back to Heathrow Terminal 4?No amount of photoshoots featuring Labour MPs with hammed up indignation on their faces will erase the central fact. This government is helping to facilitate genocide. Under legal pressure, it has suspendedfewer than 9% of arms export licencesto Israel, and continues to sendcrucial components for F-35 jetsto rain death and destruction on Gaza’s traumatised survivors – something Mohamed hascommendably criticised. As research by Action on Armed Violence has uncovered,the Royal Air Forcehas conducted well over 500 surveillance flights above Gaza since December 2023, with no public explanation.Despite incontestable evidence of Israeli war crimes, the British government refuses to describe them as such – with Lammy’sfleeting objective descriptionof Israel’stotal siegeon Gaza as violating international law swiftly disowned and walked back. No action is therefore taken, whether imposing sanctions on the Israeli state or preventing British nationals from serving in its military. Indeed,a group of lawyers, including the distinguished barrister Michael Mansfield, has submitted a legal complaint to the Metropolitan police alleging war crimes and crimes against humanity against 10 such British people.Yang and Mohamed wanted to report the truth. Too manyLabourMPs, however, are affronted because they believe their collective status as Very Important People has been besmirched. That’s why these two wronged parliamentarians no doubt can’t walk around the House of Commons right now without their frowning colleagues plaintively asking: “Are you OK?”Israel isn’t actually being finally denounced as a rogue state, here. It’s being subjected to an impromptu rendition of our political masters’ favourite anthem – “Do youknowwho weare?” – before yet more F-35 components are dispatched toIsraelso that toddlers can be incinerated in their tents. And the thing is, politicians more offended by their wounded self-importance than by genocide think they’ll get away with it.

This is a terrifying illustration of Germany’s lurch to the rightWed 9 Apr 2025 05.35 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 09.05 EDTShareIn the first week of January, I received a letter from the Berlin Immigration Office, informing me that I had lost my right of freedom of movement inGermany, due to allegations around my involvement in the pro-Palestine movement. Since I’m a Polish citizen living in Berlin, I knew that deporting an EU national from another EU country is practically impossible. I contacted a lawyer and, given the lack of substantial legal reasoning behind the order, we filed a lawsuit against it, after which I didn’t think much of it.I later found out that three other people active in the Palestine movement in Berlin,Roberta Murray, Shane O’Brien and Cooper Longbottom, received the same letters. Murray and O’Brien are Irish nationals, Longbottom is American. We understood this as yet another intimidation tactic from the state, which has alsoviolently suppressed protestsand arrested activists, and expected a long and dreary but not at all urgent process of fighting our deportation orders.Then, at the beginning of March, each of our lawyers received on our behalf another letter, declaring that we are to be given until 21 April to voluntarily leave the countryor we will be forcibly removed.The letters cite charges arising from our involvement in protests against the ongoing genocide in Gaza. None of the charges have yet led to a court hearing, yet the deportation letters conclude that we are a threat to public order and national security. There has been no legal process for this decision, and none of us have a criminal record. The reasoning in the letters continues with vague and unfounded accusations of “antisemitism” and supporting “terrorist organisations” – referring to Hamas – as well as its supposed “front organisations in Germany and Europe”.Germany is now deporting pro-Palestine EU citizens. This is a chilling new step | Hanno HauensteinRead moreThis is not the first instance of Germany weaponising migration law.Since October 2023, the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has unlawfully frozen the processing of all asylum seekers from Gaza. And on 16 April 2025 a federal administrative court in Germanywill reportedly decide on a casethat could set a precedent for the German state to increase deportations of asylum seekers to Greece.These extreme measures are not a sudden shift or solely a fringe rightwing position. They are the result of a more than year-long campaign by the liberal Ampel coalition – the Social Democratic party (SPD), the Free Democratic party (FDP) and the Greens – and the German media, calling for mass deportations, widely seen as a response to the growing pro-Palestinian movement,and targeted predominantly at the Arab and Muslim German population.In November 2024, the deputy parliamentary leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), Beatrix von Storch, granddaughter of Hitler’s finance minister,took to the Bundestag podiumto applaud the passingof the resolutiontitled Never again is now: protecting, preserving and strengthening Jewish life in Germany, drafted by the Christian Democratic Union of Germany/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CDU/CSU), the SPD, the FDP and the Green party. She ecstatically claimed that the new antisemitism resolutiondraws its contentfrom her party’s position.The resolution, adopting the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)definition of antisemitism, identifies immigration from the Middle East and north Africa, and the “anti-imperialist left” as two of the main sources of antisemitism in Germany. Without new legislation, it directs the state and public institutions to maximally wield executive powers, resulting in a massive crackdown on all forms of pro-Palestinian speech and action. Among suggested methods are heavy scrutiny of all cultural and academic funding, screening of all candidates for university teaching positions, unprecedented expansion of disciplinary measures across universities and last, but not least, utilisation of migration law.Put in von Storch’s emphatic words, “to send Muslim antisemites back home aboard an aeroplane.Tschüss und nicht auf wiedersehen![Goodbye and never see you again!]”My deportation order, as well as those of two other EU citizens, openly cites Germany’s Staatsräson (the idea that Israel’s security is part of Germany’s reason of state, or reason for existence) as a basis for our deportation, saying: “It is in the considerable interest of society and the state that this Staatsräson is always brought to life and that at no time – neither at home nor abroad – do any doubts arise that opposing currents are even tolerated within the federal territory.” The Staatsräson, never a genuine attempt to atone for Germany’s past, has now become a way to justify the indefinite suspension of a rights-based order and the unrestrained exercise of executive power.Murray, O’Brien, Longbottom and Iwent public with our casesin order to fight this intimidation. Each of our lawyers has filed a lawsuit against our deportation, and we are now filing a motion of interim relief against the 21 April deadline. Since our deportation orders are a test to see how much more repression the state can get away with, it is hard to know what verdict we can expect.What we do know is thatit is not criminal, but an urgent responsibility to mobilise against the ongoing genocide and for a free Palestine. The plight of the Palestinian peopleshould be enough of a reason for us to stand with them in solidarity. I reject the idea that solidarity is based on fear of something similar happening to us one day.However grave of a precedent these actions set, we can not and will not let them distract us and implore others not to get discouraged. Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza escalates daily. The four of us from Berlin stand in unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian people and their fight for liberation.Kasia Wlaszczyk is a cultural worker based in BerlinThis article was amended on 9 April. An earlier version said that the court case scheduled for 16 April could set a precedent for the mass deportation of Palestinian refugees. However the case will also affect asylum seekers from places other than Palestine.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I had to find a more tolerant alternativeJamie Greene is a Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP for West ScotlandWed 9 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 10.05 EDTShareIjoined the Scottish Conservatives in 2015, back around the timewhen David Cameron was stillhugging hoodies.By that point, he had pushed equal marriage through a sceptical and deeply difficult party, had moved to the middle ground on issues such as the environment, and had, of course, stood arm in arm with Nick Clegg outside No 10, publicly embracing moderate, centrist liberalism as circumstances necessitated. Ten years later, the party has changed enormously, and I have left.For me, it all began well. I was duly signed up by Ruth Davidson to the Scottish party, and elected in 2016 to the Scottish parliament. You may remember her karate-esque political punches,tank-driving photosand, during the Brexit referendum, the wayshe took down Boris Johnsonin front of thousands of people at Wembley Arena.I won’t lie: as a gay man, there was some underlying suspicion of joining the party of section 28, though my trepidation was eased by promises of a party that had changed, andwas now all about fiscal prudence coupled with social liberalism. That worked for me as a media entrepreneur from a working-class background. “Aspiration” was a buzzword that appealed to me.The Scottish Tories became thesecond-largest party in Scotlandin the 2016 election. We overtook Labour with a pro-UK, centrist message, returning a record 31 MSPs. It was a safe vote for people who had never put a cross in the Tory box in their lives. You really could sense change in the party. Who cares, I hear you ask? The thing is, many folks from my background – young, aspirational, unionist and fairly centrist of view – found a home in a party that sat knights of the realm next to survivors of broken families and alcohol-harmed households.The problem with political parties, however, is that they are made up of real people but managed by spin machines. The two don’t always align.Since Davidson leftthe helm of that happy ship, it has become a most unhappy one. The values of many of its people did not change, but those in charge did. I went from being cheered at Edinburgh Pride one year as a Tory showing solidarity, to being escorted off stage by security for my safety the next year. Hostile crowds don’t boo politicians if they’re happy with the party they represent, do they?As time went on, the live societal issues of gender identification, net zero targets and immigration, along with a massive shift in global politics, meant that sooner or later the Tory party would have to decide where it sat on the politicalspectrum. It chose to slip right. Slowly at first, then accelerating as its decline from power became inevitable. The party was hammered at the general election.The rise of Reform UK, once seen as a joke of an outfit, started to create cracks in any veneer of decency left in the Conservative movement. The shine of tolerance and acceptance wore off. The top layer of “big church, broad tent” paint was stripped to reveal what was always underneath: the old-fashioned “nasty party” of 1980s politics. I know this because I have been on the receiving end of it for some time, and it is as disgusting as it is upsetting.The party fails to realise that the road to success lies not in rightwing populism, but in middle-of-the-road decency.Quite simply, by last week Icouldn’t go on. I’ll be honest, I lasted nine years because I felt, and still feel, a lot of respect for the many good people in the party. The One Nation Conservatives who rejected manufactured division. They are still there, but I know that many of them are no longer comfortable. I know this because they are telling me so.The party in which I once found a home has been reduced to Reform-lite. Its agenda is Trumpesque in style and substance. In my resignation letter to the party leader, I warned that “we now run the very serious and immediate risk of becoming once again the party of social division and morality wars”.When the news broke of my departure, I received an email from a Tory supporter that read: “With your perverse views you won’t be missed, good riddance.” Days later, the Tory HR spin machine was spouting that I would “feel at home with gender extremists” and denouncing “nonsense” views and ideologies. The vindictive reaction to my departure from some within the party on social media, quoting Bible verses about Judas, further reinforces myview that getting out was the right thing to do.I joined the ScottishLiberal Democratsthe day after resigning the Tory whip. They treat colleagues with respect and decency. They are upbeat and positive. I’ve felt more tolerance in three days than I have in the past three years. Their political values fall better in line with what Davidson sought to achieve with her version of the Tories: fiscally responsible but socially liberal.

Don’t let short-term market noise take that awayGet ourafternoon election email,free appordaily news podcastWed 9 Apr 2025 02.05 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareAs financial markets continue to see-saw in the face of inflation and the US administration’s attempt to hold the world hostage with their tariffs, Australians nearing retirement are understandably nervous. Seeing your superannuation balance dip just as you’re preparing to retire can feel like a cruel twist of fate.But here’s the truth: now is not the time to panic.History shows that markets go through cycles. Yes, downturns are painful in the short term, but for many retirees, their super is designed to last decades and can continue to grow if it stays invested. The decisions you make now, especially rash ones like switching everything to cash or pulling all of your money out of super, can lock in losses and set you back far more than a temporary market dip.What should you do – if anything – about your superannuation amid market volatility?Read moreWe regularly speak with Australians planning for retirement who are unsure if they have enough saved. The recent volatility has only amplified that anxiety. One of the most common questions we hear is: “Is my super going to last?”The answer depends on two key things: how much you spend in retirement, and how you manage your money over time. For peace of mind, it’s important to get across what you’re likely to need to spend in retirement. A good starting point if you’re near retirement is to figure out what you’re currently spending. Then, you can use one of the online tools available to estimate how close your super, combined with the age pension, is to covering your spending needs.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterAs a group, home-owning retirees report some of the highest levels of financial satisfaction in the community. Our recent research shows a single person who owns their home and lives a typical retiree lifestyle may need around $310,000 in super at retirement to deliver a yearly income of $43,000 until age 90. For a couple in the same situation, it’s around $421,000 to deliver an income of $62,000. For most retirees, the age pension will make up a significant portion of their retirement income and acts as a stable base that kicks in if their super runs low.Of course, for those who don’t own their home or with health issues that affect their spending, the picture can be more complex. But the key is this: retirement planning should be based on your real needs and lifestyle, not fear.Now it’s time to pause. You’ve just figured out some really important numbers in the context of the current market turmoil. For peace of mind you may consider putting savings you might have covering a few years of your expenditure needs (after you’ve taken your age pension payments into account) into a super investment option that is less susceptible to the ups and downs of the market, leaving the rest to benefit from the upside as markets recover. Because you don’t want to spend your next trip to the supermarket thinking about what the ASX is doing that day.This market turmoil is a timely reminder of why we need better investment in independent retirement income guidance in Australia. Too many people are left guessing how much they need, how to draw down their super and how to invest in retirement. At times, advice from the super industry is poor quality and conflicted. And the complexity of the system only adds to the confusion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They should be seen for what they are – a national red flag waved by those at the coalface of a health system being pushed to the edge – and it should concern every single one of us who might one day need care.It was only after I saw the dysfunction of the system up close, when a series of operations left me without 90% of my small bowel and fed by a tube, that I began understanding just how deep those system cracks run. I spent six months in hospital, not just watching the system break down around me but watching it break the people trying desperately to hold it together.Measles is back. Now is the time to bolster Australian public health | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreA junior doctor stood at my bedside, eyes red, trying to hold herself upright after 16 hours on shift. When I gently asked if she was OK, she wiped the tears from her cheeks with the fierce resolve of someone whose mask had momentarily slipped and replied: “Yes. Thank you. How are your pain levels today?”I later found out she hadn’t eaten, hadn’t had an opportunity to rest, and had missed her own health appointment that day – scheduled for a time she was supposed to have finished her shift. That was the moment it hit me: the system designed to heal me was harming her.Through the paper-thin curtains separating the beds on my ward, I started to listen more closely. I heard nurses quietly urged into double shifts. I saw clinicians apologising for delays they had no power to fix. I watched staff stretched too thin, making impossible choices in impossible conditions – bound by a culture that perpetuates the corrosive belief that to practise medicine is to be superhuman.Becoming a doctor in Australia takes at least a decade of study, internship and specialist training. It often comes with more than $100,000 in student debt, years of delayed earning potential and enormous personal sacrifice that can’t be measured in numbers. To imply these workers are “greedy” or “irresponsible” for seeking safe conditions and pay parity with their interstate colleagues is not just insulting – it’s a deflection from the real crisis, one that isn’t limited to NSW.We often praise healthcare workers for their commitment and compassion. But rarely do we acknowledge how the system exploits those very qualities. Their empathy. Their sense of duty. Their refusal to walk away when the work gets hard. In a system built on scarcity, these strengths are turned into vulnerabilities – used to keep the whole thing afloat.Stressed, scared, overwhelmed: the election issues weighing on young Australian votersRead moreThat’s why the strikes in NSW matter. Not just to doctors but to people like me. People whose lives depend on this system working properly. Because every symptom of burnout, every unfilled position, every impossibly long shift – it all adds up. And when doctors suffer, patients do too.This isn’t about politics. It’s about people. And it’s about the basic truth that a healthcare system cannot truly care for its patients unless it also cares for its staff. We cannot build a system on burnout and act surprised when it goes up in smoke.As someone who has witnessed the consequences of health system failure, I want to say this clearly: I do not want care that comes at the cost of someone else’s health. I do not want safety that is built on someone else’s suffering. I do not want to be healed by someone who is being quietly broken in the process.The strikes in NSW should concern us all – because they are not an aberration. They’re a warning.Healthsystems across Australia are facing workforce shortages, chronic under-resourcing, a looming workforce retirement cliff and an ageing population with rising complexity of need.I stand with the doctors and healthcare workers speaking up. I stand with those walking off the job not out of neglect but because they care too much to keep pretending this is sustainable. I stand with them not as a political act but as a human one.This isn’t about choosing sides. It’s about choosing care. And care must never come at the cost of the people who provide it.Not in my name.Juliette McAleer is a health consumer advocate and researcherExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinionNew South WalescommentShareReuse this content"

Painter Richard Wright’s exhibition is opening soon and time is not on their side. Ten people are on the landing off which the galleries open. Huge, elaborate leaded glazed panels have just arrived, the metallic sections forming intricate geometric designs, and they need installing. It is a relatively new departure for Wright, teaming with artisans to work in glass. These panels need to be set precisely to hover just below the roof lanterns, so that light will flood through them and throw a dance of pattern and shape on the walls and floors.View image in fullscreenIllumination … Wright with his Turner Prize-winning work in 2009.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianWright – intense, immensely tall, rapidly and quietly spoken – lets me know by his wry air of forbearance that he wishes they would just do it, and then the rest of the show can go up. In the galleries to either side are books laid on tables, some of them partially drawn or painted over, “illuminated” as he says, borrowing the word used of medieval manuscripts. On the walls there are many drawings and paintings. Some are made by dipping an old-fashioned cartographer’s pen in size (a kind of adhesive) before burnishing the whole surface with gold leaf: the gold sticks to the marks made by the pen, and the rest is shaken away so that a shimmering, fugitive drawing remains. In the main, vaulted gallery, scaffolding climbs up one wall and four people are arrayed on it in perfect symmetry, two below, two above, painting black stars, diamonds, triangles and other shapes into a great design up its back wall. The painters are Wright’s daughter and brother and two longtime assistants. He himself has just clambered down to talk to me, his fingers dotted with disobedient black acrylic.Since 2009, when hewon the Turner prize, Wright has been chiefly known as the artist who makes incredibly labour-intensive wall paintings that are either painted over at the end of an exhibition or left to fade at their own pace. He has painted a ceiling at the Queen’s House in Greenwich, a grand stairwell at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh and a folly at Lismore Castle in Ireland. He has also, most remarkably, painted 47,000 stars on the ceiling of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, a response to the building’s architecture and its decorative motifs. Even allowing for the fact that he has assistants to help, I wonder how this extreme repetition must feel psychologically. “Yes, it is torture,” he says. “You ask yourself, ‘Why are you doing this?’ I suppose the answer would be, ‘Because it’s the only way that it can be done.’”View image in fullscreen‘It’s a way of feeling’ … Richard Wright with his stars painted on the Rijksmuseum ceiling, Amsterdam, in 2013.Photograph: Jerry Lampen/EPA/ShutterstockWright – who, until a fairly recent move to Norfolk, lived in Glasgow for many years – trained in Edinburgh in the late 1970s and early 80s. It was a weird time to be doing painting, and remained so for several decades: it was only about 10 years ago that painting stopped regularly being declared dead. “Being someone who’s pretty passionate about painting, it was hard,” he says. “Hard to be like, ‘Shit, I’m playing the banjo, but everyone else is playing the guitar.’” He moved to Amsterdam and spent several years making what he calls “pretty awful painting”. And then, in 1988 he stopped, abandoned painting altogether. “That sounds sort of dramatic,” he says. “I mean, it was obstacles of life, really: relationship breakdown, studio loss, things that happened that made it very difficult to continue. And also, I suppose I became disheartened; disheartened by painting one bad painting on top of another.”He decided to train as a sign writer. He also moved to Glasgow. Sign writing proved a turning point, a way of seeing everything differently. The kind of painting he had trained in was all about the artist’s touch. But sign painting meant using paint “in a deadpan way”. The idea was to deliver the paint “almost the way it looks in the tin. To put one thing on top of another, that’s it.” He stripped things back to basics. No more figuration. Painting became doing one thing – putting red paint on a canvas, say. In the early 1990s, in Glasgow, he also started wall painting. His scene back then included artists such asDouglas Gordon, and others who had come out of Glasgow School of Art’s environmental sculpture programme, who were thinking about their art as a specific response to places and contexts. He was finding a groove.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a way of feeling’ … Wright’s untitled stained glass work, 2022.Photograph: Keith Hunter/Courtesy of The Artist and The Modern Institute/ Toby Webster Ltd., GlasgowWright’s conversation is peppered with references to art history. He thinks and reads deeply. There was a period between 2008 and 2011 when he painted 1,000 circles, one a day.Paintingthe letter O had been a big part of his sign-writing training. There is a story in Vasari’s Lives of the Artists, that Wright talks about, in which the writer describes Giotto’s brilliance by way of his ability to draw a perfect circle. “This is enough and more than enough,” Giotto was supposed to have said. “I like the idea of it because it is a fact,” Wright says. “A circle is not a horse’s head or a hand or an eye, something of which you could say it was well done but Michelangelo’s was a bit better. All you can say is: this is a circle. It’s a perfect circle. I like the idea of the painting having a kind of factualness, of being somewhere between being a sign and a thing.”It is not just the fact of the circle, though, it is the fact of making the circle. “I don’t want to tell people how to live their lives,” he says, “but I do think everyone should start their day by doing a drawing.” But not everyone has the confidence, or the facility, I say, thinking guiltily of my drawing-free life. “But that’s sort of a misunderstanding what drawing is,” he counters. “All it is is looking.” He thinks, he says, of drawing as a kind of impulse, that might be as simple as your desire to move your pepperpot from one spot on the table to another. He tells a story that American artist John Baldessari told in an artwork. “He describes driving around in LA with his pencil rolling backwards and forwards on his dashboard. One day, he decided to take the pencil out of his car and sharpen it. And he knew that that had something to do with art. And I think that’s what I’m getting at. For some reason he needed to sharpen the pencil. It made the world feel close to him somehow. It made the world feel more complete.” I sharpened my pencils yesterday, I tell Wright. “And did it feel good?” he asks. I say that it did, but I intended to use them for writing, not drawing. Though I would love to be the person who drew every morning. “But it’s not that, is it?” he says. “It’s a way of feeling about things.”View image in fullscreen‘All it is is looking’ … Wright’s ceiling at Tottenham Court Road station.Photograph: GG Archard/Courtesy of The Artist, Gagosian and The Modern Institute/ Toby Webster Ltd., GlasgowTo try to make me understand, he tells me a story about where it all came from, his need to paint. “That’s where it started for me: when I saw aPiero della Francesca. And I wanted one. I wanted one like that – and I could go home and make one. I had the impulse and desire to feelthat thing.” I think, I tell him, that is why he is a painter and I am not: being moved by a Piero does not involve, for me, the desire to make one. “OK, that’s true, and I agree with you,” he says. “I suppose what I’m getting at is that when you say you’re moved by a Piero della Francesca, you are experiencing the joy of the material somehow being transformed, the surface of reality somehow dispersing. And that you’re somehow between heaven and Earth.” He laughs, perhaps to dispel the earnest intensity of the thought, but no, I am with him. We walk through to the large gallery where his colleagues are busy on the scaffold. He picks up a bottle of carbon black acrylic. His wall painting, he says, “is also a certain quantity of this. Probably not even this much. There’s enough paint in here for a lifetime of ideas.”Richard Wright is atCamden Art Centre, London, from 16 April until 22 JuneExplore more on these topicsRichard WrightArtTurner prizePaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anisa is listening to the baby’s heartbeat with a stethoscope. After foreign aid cuts, including Trump’s, she is now out of a job’Interview byAmy FlemingWed 9 Apr 2025 10.09 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareMy home country, Japan, is one of the safest places in the world to give birth: it has one of the very lowest mortality rates in Asia. A few years ago I had the opportunity to work on a story about midwives in Japan, and I became very interested in their role. In November 2023 I travelled to Badakhshan province in the northeast ofAfghanistan, the country with the highest maternal mortality rate in Asia. I wanted to meet midwives there and see how they support women.The Badakhshan province is far from Kabul, with rugged terrain and poor transportation and medical infrastructure. In winter, heavy snowfall blocks roads for months.Womenwho are about to give birth are sometimes carried on donkeys escorted by family members or neighbours on multi-day trips to clinics. The literacy rate for women there is extremely low compared with other provinces – less than 10% – which is partly why there’s a serious shortage of midwives. This combination of geographic, social and cultural factors means there are often delays responding to emergencies, and deaths from complications like excessive bleeding or infection, which might otherwise have been preventable.Some women have 10 children and ask their midwife to help persuade their husbands to use birth controlThis picture was taken in a small village while I was following a mobile health team of six, organised by the United Nations Population Fund. The midwife, Anisa, was giving medical checkups to women who had recently delivered a baby at home. One of these mothers took us to another woman in the neighbourhood who was nine months pregnant but had never had a checkup. Anisa is listening to the baby’s heartbeat with a stethoscope in the picture, and telling the woman: “Your baby is growing well, and if you start having contractions, be sure to call me and I’ll come right away.” Ten days later, Anisa assisted the delivery at her home.After she finished a long day at work, I was in the same car with Anisa. She looked out the window at the narrow mountain road, and I saw a snowy peak in the distance, and said it must be so tough to travel from village to village every day, especially in winter. She replied that, even so, she would continue to do this work in an area where so many women have died – that being able to save a single life at birth is reward enough. I was really touched.Midwives like Anisa are saving pregnant women in many ways – not only helping them give birth but also acting as unofficial therapists. Afghan women are often isolated and disconnected from society, but with the midwives they can share personal problems they would never be able to otherwise, such as struggles with mothers-in-law, or their marriages. Women who have been pregnant for years – some have 10 children – ask their midwives to help persuade their husbands to use birth control. It’s not easy, but they do succeed sometimes.Take your pic! Sony world photography open award winners – in picturesRead moreThe UN team is in charge of 13 villages that don’t have any medical facilities. In conservative rural areas, it was customary for women to be accompanied by male relatives when travelling, even before the Taliban regained power in 2021. Since then, this rule is followed more stringently. This makes it difficult for women to travel to distant clinics.After the Taliban took over, many international donors that had supported Afghanistan’s healthcare system withdrew, and hospitals and clinics have been forced to close amid concern that the maternal mortality rate will worsen. In December 2024, the Talibanbanned the midwifery schools, having already banned women’s wider education. While those who had already graduated could still work, women who had not completed their studies could not.Last month I found out that Anisa has not been able to work as a midwife since January. Since thewithdrawal of international donors and US aidafter Donald Trump’s suspension order to cut US foreign aid for 90 days, the mobile health team can no longer function. Anisa and her husband, who was a vaccinator on the mobile team, are both jobless for now.View image in fullscreenNoriko Hayashi’s CVBorn:Kanagawa, Japan 1983.Trained:Self-taughtInfluences:“My grandmother, who taught me the importance of being positive, and encouraged me to pursue what I am passionate about when I started photography”High point:“Now.

At least, not yet.As you may have seen from a number of bewilderednews reportsover the last few days, A Minecraft Movie has quickly engendered a community of, let’s say, highly engaged and enthusiastic fans. Spurred on by TikTok meme posts, vast portions of the film’s audience are now yelling out key lines of dialogue as they happen and singing along to the songs. In one key moment where a rare character from the game – the zombie chicken jockey – is introduced, they go absolutely crazy, throwing drinks and popcorn around, and in some US cinemas,getting escorted from the screening by police.The reaction was a little more muted in our tiny independent cinema in Frome, but still, there were rows of teenagers who had clearly seen all the TikTok posts telling them which lines to shout along to, and went to throw stuff, and they were extremely excited to be doing so, a few surreptitiously filming their mates’ reactions so they could add to the social media carnage. It was boisterous enough for the cinema to post on Facebook the next day about antisocial behaviour and the illegality of recording during a film.There is much to unpack here about the exclusionary nature of internet culture, cinema etiquette and the migration of online communities into physical spaces. Most of the audience reactions were fine – it’s an intentionally daft movie made for fans, and it is thrilling to celebrate fandom in a crowded space with likeminded peers. The film itself constantly rewards those who are immersed in its fiction – we enjoyed spotting the many Easter eggs (“oh look, it’s Herobrine!”) as well as little cameos from Minecraft YouTubers and even the game’s developers. There are also genuinely funny moments of slapstick and irony, hinging on committed performances from Jack Black and Jason Momoa.View image in fullscreenFlying as high as cinema popcorn … A Minecraft Movie.Photograph: Warner Bros/APBut for Zac, who is 19 and autistic, and for a lot of the smaller children in the auditorium, there were times when the atmosphere was confusing and a little intimidating. There have been comparisons to the wild reactions in screenings of Marvel movies such asAvengers: EndgameandSpider-Man: No Way Home, but those responses were largely prompted by in-film events. We all understood why people cheered when Captain America successfully caught Thor’s hammer, since the moment was painstakingly built into the lore of the series.With A Minecraft Movie, the prompts to audience reaction are largely from memes, that branch of internet comedy that is by its nature arcane: the joke is that you are seen to get the joke by other people who also get the joke. Out of context, a meme is a private gag you’re not in on. Perhaps the closest analogy is the culture around The Rocky Horror Picture Show andits legendary fan screeningsin fleapit cinemas, complete with water pistols and drag attire. But those events were opt-in – everyone knew what they were getting. I’m not sure the same could be said for all of the parents leaving my screening picking popcorn out of their hair.But look, we really enjoyed watching the film. When Zac was young and struggling to communicate, Minecraft was a cherished outlet for him, allowing him to be creative and to make friends. He still plays to this day; it is his comfort blanket and it changed our lives – not least because I ended up writing a novel,A Boy Made of Blocks, inspired by our experiences within the game. Just hearing that baleful piano music in the cinema, sharing those jokes, seeing something that has had a profound positive effect on my family depicted on a huge screen among other fans, was an emotional experience.Of course, teenagers aresupposedto be confusing and intimidating – that’s their job. We can’t just pivot from handwringing over the anxious generation to “let’s ban them from the cinemas because they’re naughty”. Also, in these difficult times for the movie industry, film-makers need to find ways to engage with teen audiences who are going out less, whether that’s due to the expense, social anxiety or the all-encompassing nature of digital culture. A Minecraft Movie is that most perfect unicorn of the entertainment business: areview-retardant, multimillion-dollar blockbuster that’s reaching the most unreachable generation in modern history. A lot of studios are now going to be busy working out how they can capture this meme-soaked magic in a bottle.Perhaps cinema owners will get wise and organise dedicated autism-friendly screenings, or at the opposite end of the scale, embrace the chaos and do special fan nights. They just need to be prepared to pay the cleaning staff a little extra.What to playView image in fullscreenLike an old war comic … Commandos: Origins.Photograph: Kalypso MediaA few hundred years ago (well, 1998), my favourite example in the then-crowded real-time strategy genre was Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, a rip-roaring world war two tactical adventure where you directed a group of variously skilled soldiers through covert missions against German strongholds.Commandos: Originsis a reimagining of the series, modernising the original’s intricately detailed isometric landscapes and retaining its focus on stealth and sabotage. It’s like being in your own interactive version of old war comics such asWarlordandBattle Action, and I am fully prepared to lose hours of my life repeatedly attempting to get the sniper into the guard tower without being spotted by the patrolling Nazis.Available on:PC, PS5, XboxEstimated playtime:20+ hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, there’s a stigma that fighting games are only about pushing buttons and being hyper-competitive. What could developers and players do to break this stigma?”I think this comes from the disconnect between the action of fighting games and their narrative content: usually, all the story happens in cutscenes and pre-fight taunts, so players can feel disconnected from the lore. A few fighting game designers have started to draw the narrative more into the interactivity, using specific locations, costumes and moves to express the story. I thinkInjusticeandBlazbluedo a good job of this, while Namco’s anime-based fightersDragon BallandNarutoreally cram the ongoing plotlines into the fights. Maybe fighting game devs could look at breaking up bouts to let story sequences in, so players are more heavily invested in the story and understand the stakes. As for players, I’ve always found fighting game communities to be extremely welcoming – that’s all they really need to do.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterParents and parentingGame cultureMinecraftFamilyAutismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Flür happily obliged. He said the person told him, referring to Daft Punk: “Without Kraftwerk we would not find our own robot style, being on stage with the helmets”. Believing they were Bangalter, Flür then asked the person if they would like to work on some tracks. The impersonator agreed and sent over demos for the songs, which were worked up into a two new Flür tracks billed as featuring “Thomas Vangarde”, supposedly a new alias of Bangalter.But after the release of the collaborations on the album Times, the moderator of Daft Punk’s Reddit page said Bangalter disavowed the recordings, and sources close to Bangalter have also confirmed to the Guardian that he did not participate in the collaboration (Flür and his label have been approached for comment).This isn’t the first time Daft Punk have had to distance themselves from a fake project: in 2011 a Spanish newspaper reported that Daft Punk would be playing the Arenal Sound festival under a new alter ego, the Third Twin, before the duo said it was “completely untrue”. And it’s not the first time artists and audiences have been the victims of musical hoaxes.Milli VanilliGerman R&B duo Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus, known as Milli Vanilli, have possibly the most toe-curling revelation of fraudulent behaviour. They sold 7m records in the US, with international sales reaching a reported 30m singles, and in 1990 they won a Grammy for best new artist. But during a live performance on MTV, at a theme park in Connecticut, their backing track malfunctioned causing the recording of their song Girl You Know It’s True to skip: a sign that the pair were actually lip-syncing. The deception began unravelling, and eventually their svengali Frank Farian fired the duo and revealed the real singers to be a team of session players. The pair protested they really could sing, they just hadn’t been allowed to by Farian – but their album was deleted by their label and their Grammy award rescinded.The ZombiesEnglish rock band the Zombies parted ways in 1967, but their US label released the group’s Time of the Season single a year later and it became a US hit, reaching No 3. In an era with no internet access, it was hard for audiences to know a band’s whereabouts or what they even looked like, which is how US tours were then successfully booked by management company Delta Promotions, who passed off two other groups as the real Zombies (one of the fake bands even contained two future members of ZZ Top). Chris White from the real Zombies complained the fake versions were “taking money from our fans and dragging down our reputation”, but in 2016, a member of one of the fake bands, Mark Ramsey, was unrepentant: “We were a blues rock band from Texas, a band with plenty of good looks, better than the original Zombies”.View image in fullscreenThe actual Zombies, in 1964.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamySilibil N’ BrainsAfter failed auditions with label bosses in London who laughed them off as “the rapping Proclaimers”, early 00s Dundee rap duo Gavin Bain and Billy Boyd started scheming on ways they could make it big: what if they were no longer from Scotland? Faking their accents and reinventing themselves as California rap duoSilibil N’ Brains, they auditioned again, secured a record deal with Sony Music and a support slot with Eminem’s group D12, and kept up the ruse for four years. But Bain said that maintaining the lie became too difficult, and Boyd decided to go back to Dundee to work in the oil industry. Their story, though, has endured, being told in 2013 documentary The Great Hip Hop Hoax and again as a forthcoming feature film directed by James McAvoy entitled California Schemin’.Classical musicSome of the biggest and most egregious hoaxes have been perpetuated in classical music. Henri-Gustave Casadesus’s early 20th-century quintet became famous for premiering rediscovered works by dead composers including the sons of Bach – but they were actually written by Casadesus and his brothers. There is also pianist Joyce Hatto, who rose to prominence in the 1950s. Later, after she was diagnosed with cancer, her husband passed off other performers’ recordings as her own on more than 100 releases (Victoria Wood adapted the story for the screen as Loving Miss Hatto). There’s an entire Wikipedia page for classical hoaxes, in fact.One of the most extraordinary examples is Japanese composer Mamoru Samuragochi, who claimed he was deaf but could play beautiful melodies on the piano and write his own compositions – his symphony honouring Hiroshima became widely acclaimed in Japan. But doubts began to surface in 2013 when, during an interview, Samuragochi responded to questions before the sign-language interpreter had finished and he stood up to answer a doorbell when it rang. All was revealed in 2014: Samuragochi’s compositions had been ghostwritten by musician and composer Takashi Niigaki, who also claimed Samuragochi was pretending to be deaf. Samuragochi admitted he had partially regained some of his hearing, saying he was “deeply ashamed of living a lie”.Artificial intelligenceMany of the above hoaxes are unlikely to have happened in an era of surveillance and globally disseminated information, but AI could bring about a whole new catalogue of fraudulent music. Last year it was revealed that at least 30 notable metal bands, including While She Sleeps, Bury Tomorrow and Thy Art Is Murder, had fake AI-generated music uploaded to their streaming service accounts without their involvement. And in 2024, a man in North Carolina was charged with fraud after allegedly using AI to create thousands of fake songs – with titles like Zygotic Washstands – by fake bands with rather prog-metal names such as Callous Post or Calorie Screams, that were then “listened to” by bots, to earn royalty payments from streaming services to the tune of $10m.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s our pick of the standout performancesStuart HeritageWed 9 Apr 2025 09.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Apr 2025 10.11 EDTShareWarning: this article contains spoilers.Three seasons ofThe White Lotusare now complete, which means that Mike White has offered us some incredible main characters over the years – and some not so great ones. How do the newest batch stack up against the veterans? Let’s rank the lot and find out.40. Mook (Lalisa Manobal, s3)View image in fullscreenCriminally underused … K-pop star Lalisa Manobal as Mook.Photograph: HBOWhat’s bizarre about Mook isn’t that, as Gaitok’s would-be love interest, she basically only functioned as a not-always-sympathetic ear. No, it’s that she was played by Lisa from K-pop supergroup Blackpink, who is legitimately one of the most famous women in the world. It’s like hiring Lady Gaga and using her as an extra.39. Portia (Haley Lu Richardson, s2)View image in fullscreenTwo-dimensional … Tanya’s assistant Portia.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOTanya’s assistant in the second season was a two-dimensional representation of Gen-Z. She hated work. She had terrible fashion sense and even worse taste in men. That’s about it.38. Jim Hollinger (Scott Glenn, s3)View image in fullscreenHere today, gone tomorrow … Jim Hollinger, left.Photograph: HBO/AvalonJim Hollinger was the man who Rick spent the entire season tracking down. However, when he was found, he simply turned up in that episode and growled, and then turned up in another episode and died. The show heralded his final scene with great portent (the screaming monkey!) but that doesn’t cover for his lack of things to do.37. Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong, s3)View image in fullscreenFrustrating … Gaitok the hotel security guard.Photograph: HBOHas there ever been a television character as constipated as Gaitok? The hotel security guard did little more than stare on paralysed instead of doing his job. What a frustrating man.36. Mark Mossbacher (Steve Zahn, s1)View image in fullscreenJust boring … Mark Mossbacher.Photograph: HBOWant to know how low stakes season one of The White Lotus was? One of the main characters was a fundamentally decent man, rather than a leering caricature of consumer culture. Boring! Next!35. Nicole Mossbacher (Connie Britton, s1)View image in fullscreenCheers … Nicole Mossbacher came across as a crayon sketch at times.Photograph: HBOMark’s wife did have a little more to do, but not much. As a CEO who struggles to let go of the stress of her everyday life when she arrives at the resort, she felt like a crayon sketch of future characters who’d be better defined.34. Piper Ratliff (Sarah Catherine Hook, s3)View image in fullscreenLeast memorable … Piper Ratliff.Photograph: HBOPiper, no! The least memorable of the Ratliff siblings (largely because she didn’t commit incest onscreen) Piper’s arc was a bit of a damp squib. She wanted to become a Buddhist, tried Buddhism, didn’t like it because of the lack of air conditioning, and then went home.33. Olivia Mossbacher (Sydney Sweeney, s1)View image in fullscreenSnarky teen … Olivia Mossbacher, left.Photograph: HBOA cross between Mook and Portia, Olivia was a snarky teen who didn’t meaningfully contribute to the wider story. Also, she was played by Sweeney, an actor capable of much more than this.32. Dominic Di Grasso (Michael Imperioli, s2)View image in fullscreenJust the one orgy …. Dominic Di Grasso.Photograph: HBOSeason two arrived as the Michael Imperioli Season of The White Lotus. After all, if White was going to hire an actor of this pedigree, he must have written something meaty for him. In the end, though, he got one orgy scene and then nothing else.31. Timothy Ratliff (Jason Isaacs, s3)View image in fullscreenFree holiday … Jason Isaacs as Timothy Ratliff.Photograph: HBOLet’s look at this positively. Isaacs got a free luxury holiday, $40,000 an episode and – after his mid-season full-frontal shot – a weird little press cycle about penises in return for basically being catatonic for several hours at a time. He’s had harder jobs, I’m sure.30. Albie Di Grasso (Adam DiMarco, s2)View image in fullscreenSensitive ... Albie on the cusp of embracing his sexuality.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOBy this point, The White Lotus has a clutch of favourite archetypes. Albie fell into the “sensitive young man on the cusp of embracing his sexuality” camp and, unfortunately, was the weakest of the lot.29. Valentina (Sabrina Impacciatore, s2)View image in fullscreenBad boss … Valentina in season two.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOAfter Armond , there was hope that the next member of White Lotus staff depicted onscreen would be given something of comparable juiciness. Instead, Valentina tutted at her employees and her main highlight was comparing Jennifer Coolidge to Peppa Pig.28. Cameron Sullivan (Theo James, s2)View image in fullscreenEntitled bro … Cameron Sullivan makes a call.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOAnother White Lotus go-to archetype is the obnoxious, entitled bro. Cameron hit all the marks he was required to but, compared with his analogues in other seasons, was unsatisfyingly obnoxious and entitled.27. Kitty Patton (Molly Shannon, s1)View image in fullscreenSurprisingly forgettable … Molly Shannon as Kitty Patton.Photograph: PRShannon is such an onscreen force that she’s reliably memorable in almost every role. However, her part in The White Lotus – as an annoying mother-in-law designed to torment Rachel – was one of the more forgettable characters of her season.26. Jaclyn Lemon (Michelle Monaghan, s3)View image in fullscreenLeast likable … Jaclyn Lemon.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOSeason three’s “blonde blob” (as nicknamed by White) – a trio of superficially nice but secretly mean women – were all much of a muchness. Jaclyn got plenty to do on the show (her disgust at being squirted with water pistols by local kids was a masterpiece) but she was the least likable out of the three.25. Kate Bohr (Leslie Bibb, s3)View image in fullscreenReaction time ... Kate Bohr’s main job seemed to be reacting to her friends.Photograph: HBOSimilarly, Kate had her moments – her pyjama-clad eagerness to get the blob’s Big Night Out wrapped up in time for bed was hilarious – butit still felt a little like her main job was to just react to her more interesting friends.24. Sritala Hollinger (Patravadi Mejudhon, s3)View image in fullscreenHotel co-owner … Sritala Hollinger.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOThe hotel co-owner in season three, Sritala drifted in and out of the action, but made her presence known whenever needed. That said, she’s only this far up thanks to the show’s decision to use that incredible clip of Mejudhon singing the traditional Thai song Lam Tad on a 1992 TV show as part of the plot.23. Mia (Beatrice Grannò, s2)View image in fullscreenWannabe singer … Mia is close friends with Lucia.Photograph: HBOFirst and foremost an accomplice to Lucia (who was a better character), Mia gets points for elevating her potentially thankless sex work plot with her desire to sing for a living.22. Paula (Brittany O’Grady, s1)View image in fullscreenSnarky sidekick … Paula was an integral part of season one.Photograph: HBOA character who started out as Olivia’s snarky sidekick, Paula ended up as a fairly integral part of season one. Her discovery that the hotel had been wrongly built on native land went a long way to underscore the show’s jaundiced view of western tourism.21. Rachel Patton (Alexandra Daddario, s1)View image in fullscreenSweet but ambitious … Rachel with her husband Shane.Photograph: HBORachel was a sweet and ambitious woman who had just got married to the world’s biggest jerk. Her slow burn realisation that the rest of her life was going to be awful forms a huge part of the first season.20. Lochlan Ratliff (Sam Nivola, s3)View image in fullscreenCloseup magic … Sam Nivola as Lochlan Ratliff.Photograph: Stefano Delia/HBOWhat a weird arc Lochlan had this year. He stared longingly at his brother while Saxon went into the bathroom to masturbate, then he masturbated his brother, then he was poisoned. Extra marks for his beautifully shot near-death scene. Extra extra points for seducing women via the medium of closeup magic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Laurie Duffy (Carrie Coon, s3)View image in fullscreenAble to articulate … Laurie Duffy.Photograph: HBOThe only distinguishable member of the blonde blob, on the basis that she was actually able to articulate her sadness rather than frantically gloss over it.18. Harper Spiller (Aubrey Plaza, s2)View image in fullscreenTotal conviction … Harper Spiller.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOFor a while it looked like all Plaza would get to do on The White Lotus was roll her eyes at her husband. But then her character slept with Theo James. Or maybe she didn’t. Has any actor managed to play both possibilities with such total conviction?17. Jack (Leo Woodall, s2)View image in fullscreenSeducer … Jack, a magnetically sexy Essex man.Photograph: HBOWoodall can neatly divide his life into the bit before The White Lotus and the bit afterwards. And this is all thanks to Jack, a secretive and magnetically sexy Essex man who seduced Portia, then his “uncle”, then the world.16. Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger, s3)View image in fullscreenA changed man? … Saxon Ratliff.Photograph: HBOCameron Sullivan walked so that Saxon Ratliff could run. Preening, obnoxious and obsessed with sex and smoothies, Saxon started the season as an unbearable bro. But thanks to a combination of drugs, incest and a Pema Chödrön book, he came out of it a changed man. A bit? Maybe?15. Greg/Gary (Jon Gries, s1 to s3)View image in fullscreenEver-present … the mysterious Greg/Gary.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOThe only character to appear in all three White Lotus seasons, Greg/Gary started out as Tanya’s meek and apparently terminally ill love interest, and ended as an all-powerful, obscenely wealthy villain with a weird sex thing. Will this be the last we see of him? Hopefully not.14. Bert Di Grasso (F Murray Abraham, s2)View image in fullscreenTrailblazer … Bert Di Grasso, right, with Dominic Di Grasso.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOOn paper, Bert didn’t have all that much to do during season two. But whatever he was given, he wrung every last drop out of it. Ruder and more sexually forward than most 80-year-olds, Bert blazed a trail through every scene.13. Ethan Spiller (Will Sharpe, s2)View image in fullscreenDoubt and paranoia … Ethan Spiller.Photograph: HBOHarper’s husband, Ethan spent his time on the show experiencing various levels of doubt and paranoia as he watched his wife and best friend flirt in front of him, which Sharpe portrayed with aplomb.12. Rick Hatchett (Walton Goggins, s3)View image in fullscreenKiller death scene … Rick Hatchett.Photograph: HBOAt times Rick felt as if he was shipped in from another, slightly more generic show. His hard-boiled quest for revenge at times felt a bit too straightforward for The White Lotus. However, it was rewarded with a killer death scene and an all-timer reaction meme. But we’ll get to that in a second.11. Daphne Sullivan (Meghann Fahy, s2)View image in fullscreenExtraordinary climax … Daphne Sullivan.Photograph: HBODaphne earns her high spot thanks to her storyline’s extraordinary climax. Ethan tells her that he thinks their spouses had sex. She responds with a mind-blowing silent 25-second reaction shot where wave after wave of emotions pass across her face, then probably has sex with Ethan in retaliation. A star-making performance.10. Frank (Sam Rockwell, s3)View image in fullscreenUncredited … Sam Rockwell as Frank.Photograph: PRAnyway, about that meme. Rockwell’s uncredited appearance was a breath of fresh air in an often turgid season. He drank. He did kung fu. He embarked on a berserk monologue about how he wished he was an Asian girl who could have sex with himself, while Rick boggled at him. Amazing.9. Shane Patton (Jake Lacy, s1)View image in fullscreenPetty and whingy … Shane Patton.Photograph: HBOIn a show full of entitled idiots, Shane Patton was by far the most entitled. A man so petty, whingy and obnoxious that he actually ended up murdering a hotel manager.8. Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood, s3)View image in fullscreenTriple threat … Chelsea was doomed from the start.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOPoor Chelsea. All season long she worried that bad things come in threes. Who knew that the third thing would be her being accidentally shot in the chest after watching her boyfriend kill his dad. The smart money is on Wood being this year’s Woodall, a breakout star with an enormous future ahead of her.7. Quinn Mossbacher (Fred Hechinger, s1)View image in fullscreenTranscending tourism … Quinn Mossbacher ended up staying in Hawaii.Photograph: HBOThe beating heart of season one. He was a sensitive, awkward boy whose family went to Hawaii and argued a lot. He ended up staying there, achieving the greatest honour that The White Lotus can award: transcending tourism and integrating with the local people.6. Belinda Lindsey (Natasha Rothwell, s1 and 3)View image in fullscreenRags to riches … Belinda Lindsey became a millionaire.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOIn season one she was a hotel worker whose heart was broken when a guest befriended her and then left her in the lurch. In season three she returned as half-guest-half-worker who befriended a member of staff and then left him in the lurch. Now she is a millionaire, so God knows who’ll she’ll leave in the lurch in season four.5. Lucia Greco (Simona Tabasco, s2)View image in fullscreenChecking in … Lucia Greco emerged a folk hero.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOA prostitute who electrified every scene she was in, Lucia ran riot through the corridors of the hotel, gleefully ripping off guests left and right as she went. In any other show she’d be a villain. But this is The White Lotus, and everyone is terrible, so she somehow emerged a folk hero.4. Quentin (Tom Hollander, s2)View image in fullscreenThe Quentin Show … sadly Tom Hollander’s role was killed off in season 2.Photograph: HBOHollander is uniformly great in everything. However, he was especially great in the second season of The White Lotus as Quentin, a mysterious British man with intangibly nefarious intent. In a way it’s sad that he died; The White Lotus could have quite happily become The Quentin Show and nobody would have minded.3. Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey, s3)View image in fullscreenBack for a fourth season? … Victoria Ratliff.Photograph: HBOPiper, no! Again! Letting Posey loose on a southern accent with dialogue that required her to massacre words like “Buddhism”, “guru” and “tsunami” was, in retrospect, a masterstroke. Officially Victoria is now broke. But if White can’t find a way to drag her back to a luxury hotel for season four, it’ll be a tragedy.2. Armond (Murray Bartlett, s1)View image in fullscreenWarm welcome … Armond had the best death in season one.Photograph: HBOArmond is the reason why we started talking about The White Lotus in the first place. The entire first season was structured and paced around his transition from pin-sharp hotel manager to gibbering, drug-addled lunatic. Armond also had the best death of the series – visibly defecating in a suitcase and then getting stabbed. He will be forever missed.1. Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge, s1 to s2)View image in fullscreenOne of the greats … the tour de force that was Tanya McQuoid.Photograph: HBOCould it be anyone else? In Coolidge’s hands, Tanya – rich and lost and self-absorbed – became one of the all-time great television characters. Her appearance in the first season gave the show a sad, sweet note. But in the second she was the centre of gravity, forcing the action to orbit around her whims. She was a great character, who had an amazing death. Thank God for Coolidge, thank God for Tanya and boo to everyone who tried to murder her.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They sold them in Woolworths but it wasn’t a normal wig with individual strands of hair – it was vacuum-formed plastic and felt like wearing a crash helmet. When it was on you looked like you had Paul’s hair, but when you took it off you were left with what looked like a scar on your forehead.The Beatles were big in my house but it was the lovable moptop Beatles, the London Palladium Beatles. Once they’d grown their hair and become hippie-ish, my family were always a bit down on them. I remember taking a shoebox and transforming it into a miniature replica of the set of Ready, Steady, Go, the television music show that was like a precursor to Top of the Pops. I cut off the front, drew little exit signs and cut out little Beatles. Looking back, that was when I started using music to create these little worlds.I’m not a very experienced songwriter but I read that John Lennon would sometimes think: “I want to do something like Roy Orbison.” They would quite openly copy genres. So a song like Sweet Illusion, on my new album, is definitely me having a go at a 60s song.I couldn’t do Malcolm Tucker sings Sinatra: ‘Have yourself a merry f***ing Christmas’Another influence you may hear is Frank Sinatra, who my parents also listened to. They didn’t have a big record collection. In fact they never seemed to buy records, so I’ve no idea where these ones came from, but they had a couple of Sinatra albums. After a few drinks everyone in the family would join in singing That’s Life. I didn’t realise it until later because my parents were in the ice cream business and we lived in a tenement, but my family were actually very musical. My father played piano, my uncle played guitar, another uncle played accordion and another uncle sang and did comedy bits. So when they got together at family dos they were a band, and everyone would tear into it. My uncle’s guitar was more like a piece of furniture than an instrument – it had huge strings that you needed big Italian peasant hands to play, but he battered the hell out of it and it sounded great.View image in fullscreenCapaldi playing bass with the Bastards from Hell (later the Dream Boys) in 1978.Photograph: John Rogan/GuardianWitnessI was very lucky not to get into drama school. They said “you’re awful don’t come here” – quite rightfully at the time – so I went to art school instead. It was great. We all turned up dressed like Neil Young circa After the Gold Rush, wearing long hair and cheesecloth shirts. Then, during my first summer there, the Sex Pistols exploded and everyone came back in plastic trousers with cheaply dyed hair. Suddenly there was this ethos that you could be in a band, so I got involved with that. Mine were called the Dream Boys. Our influences were Bowie, Talking Heads and the Cramps, who were like a voodoo-swamp version of the Munsters. For some reason, that seemed like the direction to go in. Perhaps not very wisely.This was around 1977, and back then you could take a tape to a venue and get a gig. The art school had a very staid student body that looked after entertainment. They tended to bring in hippie bands, jazz acts and George Melly. We wanted more aggressive music, so we ended up providing it ourselves. But our shows weren’t full of people spitting. There was quite a schism between London and the rest of the country – I think the people of Glasgow frowned on all the spitting and that kind of nonsense.We always struggled with drummers. It was likeSpinal Tap– some drummer or other would come and sit in for us. Then, one night at a place called the Rock Garden, I asked if anyone knew a drummer who wanted to join our band. A 17 year old in the audience asked if he could have a go and, rather grandly, we said we would audition him – as if we had any idea what we were doing. He turned out to be a brilliant drummer and he was very funny too – you’ll know him now as the comedian and US talkshow hostCraig Ferguson.Peter Capaldi’s band the Dream BoysIt all goes back to that shoebox. At the time I thought I just loved showing off but really what I loved was being able to create a whole world on stage and presenting our ideas to people. We kept at it. We tried and tried but we weren’t getting anywhere. Eventually you run out of steam because you have no money and you’re eating Pot Noodles on Christmas Day. It seemed like everybody else in Glasgow was getting signed or doing a Peel Session and we weren’t. I would get the coach down to London and go round all the record labels but nothing ever happened.Still, all the local bands were very sweet to us and offered us support slots. We supported Altered Images a few times and their singer Clare Grogan had just done the filmGregory’s Girl. One night the director Bill Forsyth was in the audience, and after the gig he invited me to be in his film Local Hero. If someone standing backstage at a sweaty gig tells you they’re making a film in Scotland, you assume it’s going to be a 16mm, half-hour thing without a script. But it turned out to be a proper film. It felt like fate was pushing me towards acting and away from music, so I embraced that.To be honest, I’d never been that interested in writing songs. And I was never the guy at the party who brought out the guitar. But I became friendly with Dr Robert of the Blow Monkeys and heisthat guy at the party with the guitar. He’s a living jukebox, a fantastic singer and player. He would invite me to play along with him, and then he challenged me to write my own material.‘Someone who has dedicated his life to music’ … Peter Capaldi in the video for Lewis Capaldi’s Someone You Loved.I wrote the songs for my debut album St Christopher while I was filmingThe Suicide Squadin 2019. I had so much downtime on set that I thought I’d spend it writing and see what happened. A lot of it was rubbish but some of it was OK. I love the Kinks and live in Muswell Hill so we booked their studio Konk to record it all. But then the pandemic hit and we couldn’t go. Instead we took the GarageBand demos and sent them off to people. Then they would come back with a great sax player on or whatever.There are not many people who release their debut album at the age of 62, but that’s the great thing about technology: anybody can do it. When I was originally trying to be in the music business you had to be signed to Sony or RCA to release something, but now you just need a computer.View image in fullscreenThe album cover for Sweet Illusions.Photograph: Ray BurmistonI wasn’t nervous of putting this music out. It doesn’t matter. It’s not my profession. My friends who are musicians have had extreme ups and downs and maintained their commitment to music through all of that. My cousin’s son isLewis Capaldiand he’s a case in point of someone who has dedicated his life to music. His dad was driving him around Leith and Aberdeen – anywhere with a pub he could stand in with a guitar and sing – because he had to do it. I actually appeared in his video forSomeone You Loved– which was the song of his that exploded, so I was delighted to be in it. He’s fantastic, but he’s in an entirely different league from me. My songs were originally more something I was doing for myself. I thought, OK, if I am going to have a go at making music it has to be music I want to make. I’m not going to do a Peter Capaldi Christmas album. It couldn’t be Malcolm Tucker sings Sinatra: “Have yourself a merry fucking Christmas.”My new album Sweet Illusions is really my way of picking up where I left off 40 years ago as an art school student. It reminds me of Glasgow in 1984, when there were a lot of synths and fuzzy guitars, lots of echo and reverb, and lots of dreamers whose dreams were being crushed. The city has a noir-ish quality to it, a bit like Liverpool and Manchester do. It’s the Victorian city centres and the rain and the night and all that. Very cinematic. You can conjure up images and stories.A lot of the songs deal with aging. Wondering where all the time has gone. Big Guy is about those people who were once full of braggadocio and swagger but are now dribbling on their jumpers. We remember them as something else now.The single Bin Night is a lullaby. I’m a grandparent now so suddenly I have babies and lullabies in my life again. It’s wonderful, but being Scottish there’s always a melancholic streak in me that will seek out the bleak thing about it. In this case it’s the ticking clock. These fabulous children bring all this vigour and chaos into your life, but how long do you have left to spend with them? That made me think of the entropy of the universe and how awful the world is. And how just about the only moment I have any control over is putting the bins out. I don’t know if it’s the only song ever written about bin night but it’s a great subject.Peter Capaldi’s Sweet Illusions is available now on Last Night from Glasgow recordsExplore more on these topicsMusicPeter CapaldiPunkPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nothing had happened to them. But I continued to feel some kind of uncontrollable violence.“An inner impulse told me: ‘You must urgently return to work.’ I turned on the electric violin, put on Tibetan percussion instruments, and began recording,” she says. Then, later that day, she opened the news “and found out what had happened in Israel”.These recordings became Campanelli, Goncharova’s first original album in more than 30 years. Her violin unspools its laments; her melodies unspool like vocal balladry. But Goncharova – framed by bookshelves, wearing a headband and robes – seems frank and unsentimental, even when talking about spiritual matters. “The idea was to convey the life story of a human being; how a person starts their life and how this life ends,” she says, speaking in Russian through a translator. “But when I finished, I understood that it was a story not just of one person, but it was about all of humankind.”View image in fullscreenGoncharova has returned to live performance.Photograph: Priit PoderShe may not have previously completed a new album in three decades, but Campanelli is Goncharova’s fourth release in five years, following twocollections of archive recordingson Ukrainian label Shukai, and Ocean,her epic symphony for electric violin on Hidden Harmony which she began in 1988 and completed in 2022. Since then her music has been reviewed and internationally recognised in the press, and she has played live in cities including London and Berlin. These releases were a long time coming for someone born in Kyiv in the 1950s, who trained in Soviet Russia and has played music all her life.Valentina Goncharova: Recordings 1987​-​1991 Vol 2 review | Jennifer Lucy Allan’s contemporary album of the monthRead moreShe was singled out for her musical aptitude at a young age. “They would say that I had a very good memory, and I had perfect pitch,” she says. She was assigned the violin because of her small hands. She trained in Kyiv, then at the conservatory in what was then named Leningrad (now St Petersburg), and first played with an orchestra aged 12. After their studies, the young musicians were assigned to postings across Russia.There were no free jazz musicians in Tallinn. I needed other ‘voices’, so my husband bought me a tape recorderGoncharova and her friend, the composer and pianist Svetlana Golybina, “asked to go to Mongolia, Ulan-Ude city”, she says. It was then an autonomous Soviet republic, but more importantly, “it had the only Buddhist temple in the Soviet Union. It was the reason I wanted to go. We attended a congress of lamas and the Dalai Lama came. We felt their intentions, their interests. Since then Buddhism has always been very close to me. Traditionally speaking, I’m Catholic, but not strictly – I’m open to other religions and other mystical teachings.”Listen to part one of Goncharova’s Ocean.After a year in Mongolia, Goncharova returned to Leningrad, which gifted another life-changing experience: seeing Vyacheslav Ganelin’s free jazz trio at a festival. It opened her ears to wider sonic possibilities. “It seemed similar to what we studied,” she says, “but it was different. It was more holistic, more organic, more expressive.”She fell in with the Soviet underground rock scene, including the collective Pop-Mechanika, and got to know composers including Sergey Letov. But in 1984 she moved to Tallinn with her husband, Igor Zubkov, and lost her connection to those scenes. “Free jazz wasn’t developed in Tallinn,” she says. “There was no audience and no musicians. I thought, ‘I have to start playing free jazz alone.’ I needed four or five ‘voices’. So my husband bought me a tape recorder.”Goncharova and Zubkov are close collaborators. He is an engineer who helps to realise her musical visions by setting up ways to overdub with basic equipment, electrifying and building her string instruments, and constructing contact mics for them to record the sounds of household objects. She is clear that even with the electronics, she always wanted her violin to sound like a violin, but these bespoke modifications mean the tone of her playing is utterly distinctive, with a tactility like raw silk: fine and luxurious; soft but with grain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Ocean had a cosmic scope, articulating “the source of all forms that receive life within space and time. Ocean was all-encompassing – it was like the universe. So any other idea seemed too small next to it. It was difficult for me to get into a mood where another idea could become worthy – could look as global and as important as those ones.”Composer Oliver Coates on the cello, chaos and connection: ‘The best music is out there in nature’Read moreRelatively speaking, Campanelli’s quest to articulate life as a whole is almost provincial. The title means bells or bell-ringer in Italian (a language Goncharova speaks). It opens and closes with the gentle herald of struck Tibetan bowls, which give way to wavy glissandos and resonant strata of featherlight strings. “When we come to this world, something happens, some kind of contact is established between the highest realm and the physical realm,” she says. “Then when something happens in our life – something important – the sound of bell ringing is what we hear. When we leave this life, maybe that bell will ring a little bit longer, because it has to embody everything: what was at the beginning, what was in the middle and what is at the final stage. It’s not something that stops, it’s some sort of transition, maybe to an eternal life.”Goncharova considers herself a pacifist. “Any war is disgusting to me,” she says when I ask about the ongoing conflict in her native Ukraine. “Over the last three years, I have realised life in the world has changed. It has changed for every person.” I ask if she considers her music to be spiritual. “Yes,” she says decisively. “But if I highlighted this, people might reject [my music]. They wouldn’t accept it. Those people who want it, they can find the spiritual in it. You can’t really live outside of the spiritual if you’re a musician.”Campanelliis out now on Hidden HarmonyExplore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicUkraineinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Kleiner added that they hoped series co-creator and writer Stephen Graham, who plays the boy’s father, as well as writerJack Thorne, would return for a second season.Graham and his wife and producing partner, Hannah Walters, have already hinted at a second outing for a show designed as a one-off, though nothing has been confirmed. “Possibly, let’s see how the figures are,” Graham toldVarietywhen asked about a follow-up. “But yeah, there’s the possibility of developing another story.” Walters said she would happily work with Netflix “all day long”, but that “it’s hard” to follow up a success like Adolescence.The show has become an international hit for the global streaming platform,amassing 114.5 million viewerssince its release on 13 March. It became the first streaming show to top weekly ratings in the UK and set a new Netflix record for a limited series with 66.3 million viewers after two weeks. This week it also became the platform’s fourth biggest English-language series ever.Its themes of online extremism, violence and complicitystruck a cultural nerveacross countries, speaking to fears about online misogyny pitched to children. Netflix has made the series available to all secondary schools in the UK.A second season would presumably focus on different characters in a different setting, at least according to Thorne. “Jamie’s story is finished,” he said in an interviewwith ITVfrom late March. “I don’t think there’s anywhere more we can take Jamie, so I don’t think there is a series two.‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead more“Our aim was to try and tell Jamie’s story as fully as we possibly could, and maybe trying to tell [Katie’s] story would dilute that in some way and maybe we would be inadequate for that task,” he added.Barantini, the director, also initially dismissed the idea of a second season. “I don’t personally [think there should be another series], I think it’s a package of this moment in time, and I think personally, that’s how I feel about it,” he toldthe Independentin March.Speaking to Deadline, Gardner said Barantini’s one-take style was “essential” to the show’s success. “Phil’s style of doing the episodes in one take is not a gimmick. It’s very much in conversation with the subject matter,” she said. “In that kind of prismatic way of viewing, you can duck the issue. So our theory was, what would happen if you couldn’t look away? And will that make the subject embed in you in a different way? That was a thrilling thing.”Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceBrad PittNetflixDramaStephen GrahamnewsShareReuse this content"

But as chinoiserie became more popular and moved more into the realm of everyday commerce, it was women who began to most spectacularly partake in it.‘There’s so much beauty’: artists celebrate California in the wake of tragedyRead moreMoon identifies Mary II, who ruled England alongside her husband William from 1689 to 1694, as a key player in the transition of chinoiserie from male-led collections to the stuff of everyday women.“Mary II really personalized the language of chinoiserie,” she told me. “She makes this consumption of exotic luxury goods a part of her power and presence.”It was while living in Holland that Mary first came upon chinoiserie, developing an extensive collection of the ceramics. When Mary was installed as queen following the Glorious Revolution, she brought this collection back with her, shepherding an entirely new aesthetic to England.“She goes to Holland as a teenager with William, discovers this treasure trove of luxury objects that are being acquired through the Dutch East India Company, and develops her own taste,” said Moon. “By the time she comes back to England to become queen, she makes sure to bring back all of her stuff. She makes this consumption of exotic luxury goods a part of her power and presence.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eileen Travell/Photo by Eileen Travell , courtesy of The MetMonstrous Beauty advances the interesting argument that Mary, who had a series of miscarriages but did not give birth to an heir before her death from smallpox at age 32, birthed something quite different: namely, a style that women throughout England were profoundly influenced by.“I wondered what would it mean to shift that narrative of giving birth, from giving birth biologically to giving birth to a style,” Moon said. “We think of her as giving birth to chinoiserie as a way that women can shift their space by occupying it with all these porcelain vases and lacquers and things.”Through the popularization of the porcelain figures that were a mainstay of chinoiserie, the aesthetic filled women’s lives with images of fantastic beings – goddesses, monsters, sirens and even cyborgs. This contributed to the way that womanhood was constructed in Europe, with consequences down to the present-day.“The ability to acquire luxuries positioned women as consumers and gave them a kind of power,” Moon said. “It was thought of as this unruly desire for foreign goods that didn’t conform to a set standard.”Beyond figurines, one of the ways that chinoiserie was brought to the homes of middle class women was through elaborate tea sets – Monstrous Beauty features numerous beautiful and elaborate teapots, plates, cups with saucers, tumblers, caddies and more.As the exhibition’s catalogue explains, this was in fact a primary way in which tea became synonymous with the British way of life. “Consumption and taste naturalized this foreign commodity into a fully English habit, a process of domestication that took place in parallel with the transformation of porcelain from a coveted luxury good to a part of daily life,” Moon said.View image in fullscreenDoccia Porcelain Manufactory – Two sweetmeat dishes ca 1750–60.Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of ArtBut not everyone was happy about what women were doing to English consumerism. Daniel Defoe denounced the newfound economic energy of women.“Defoe complains about the fact that Mary created this trend for buying porcelain,” Moon explained. “He called it a fatal excess, and said that these women were going to drive their families to financial ruin. He had a whole patriotic discourse about how you should be buying British products, not foreign goods.”Women’s pursuit of porcelain affected more than just the British taste for tea or home decor. Moon makes the interesting point that prior to the era of consumerist chinoiserie, the standard of artistic beauty was the nude female body. Against this dominant aesthetic, chinoiserie brought all sorts of fanciful forms – middle-class dining tables could suddenly be home to elaborate porcelain figurines striking dramatic poses, as well as monstrous creatures, like dragons, chimeras, manticores and others. Moon argues that these pieces shifted the aesthetics of the fine arts and opened up newfound creative potential.“You could get away with saying more uncomfortable and weird things right at this miniature scale,” she said. “What kinds of associations did people make in seeing these figurines while they were eating? I want to reclaim the historical language that had been applied to chinoiserie around the monstrous as a form of artistic empowerment.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eileen Travell/Photo by Eileen Travell, courtesy of The MetBringing these aesthetic debates to the present, Monstrous Beauty also showcases contemporary works that Moon sees as springing out of the legacy of chinoiserie. One such piece is Jennifer Ling Datchuk’s take on how hair plays into beauty standards, Pretty Sister, Ugly Sister, which shows two porcelain plates sprouting black Chinese hair that has been bleached blond and dyed blue. The hair on one plate is copiously long, the other cropped short. Another standout piece is Lee Bul’s remarkable sculpture Monster: Black. “It’s precisely because these works are not chinoiserie that they can illuminate these historical styles,” said Moon. “They’re meant to be a critical lens on to the past, in dialogue visually with the historical works of art.”Artwork of Jane Austen’s older sister to go on show in house where siblings livedRead moreWhile Moon is an expert in chinoiserie and has curated a wide-ranging and complex show into its history and contemporary importance, she is not necessarily a fan. “I don’t actually like chinoiserie,” she told me with a smile. “I’ve always gravitated to the neoclassical.” Yet, she felt that, as an Asian American woman, it was something she had to examine.“I knew I was going to have to confront it on some level and ask why I felt such discomfort around this style. Curating this show, I asked, how do I negotiate my own self in relation to this history of the exotic. And I’m not alone. Chinoiserie has always elicited a strong reaction, from its very inception. There’s very few people who feel neutral about chinoiserie.”Monstrous Beauty: A Feminist Revision of Chinoiserie is on show at The Metropolitan Museum of Art inNew Yorkuntil 17 AugustExplore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsChinaNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The date is “especially meaningful” to the artist, as it is both Mapplethorpe’s birthday and the anniversary of her late husband Fred “Sonic” Smith’s death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The latter focuses on 2016, when Smith’s friend, the producer, manager and rock critic Sandy Pearlman, died, and the musician was confronted with grief for him alongside fears about the rise of populism, the climate crisis, and her impending 70th birthday.“Patti Smith is a living legend,” said Alexis Kirschbaum, head of Bloomsbury Trade, which will be publishing the book in the UK. “While her lyrics and music have inspired generations of listeners, her books have made her one of the most cherished and influential writers of the last 50 years. Bread of Angels confirms her position as a writer.”As well as music and literature, Smith has also created visual art and photography, which has been exhibited globally. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, and has been the recipient of numerous awards including the ASCAP Founders award, Sweden’s Polar Music prize, the PEN/Audible Literary Service award, and France’s Légion d’honneur.Explore more on these topicsBooksPatti SmithPublishingAutobiography and memoirnewsShareReuse this content"

Cassandra was an accomplished artist and for the Austen family her artworks were as important as Jane’s writing.View image in fullscreenCassandra Austen’s copy, in pencil and ink with watercolour, of an engraving entitled Maria, by Peltro William Tomkins.Photograph: Ollie Thompson/Solent News“Her skill was akin to Jane’s own, neat and careful, with delicacy and lightness of touch, so to see them is a pleasure in itself, but more than that, for those interested in Jane Austen, Cassandra’s artworks also remind us of the many paintings and drawings in Jane’s novels.”After Jane died, Cassandra destroyed many of her sister’s letters, an act heavily criticised by later generations of critics angered at being denied insight into the cherished author’s mind.However, many now assert that Cassandra acted to protect her sister’s memory and reputation, as well as her wider family from hearing themselves mocked or criticised. About 160 of Jane’s letters survived Cassandra’s purge out of as many as 3,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The answer is almost certainly yes.“It’s a situation that’s unjust, but also risks reshaping our national history in favour of what survives, versus what is lost.”In Sheffield, locals are divided over the building. Hayley Glover, 43, who owns the cafe opposite, Kollective Coffee & Kitchen, thought the building should stay open to the public as she fondly remembers it being built 26 years ago.View image in fullscreenHayley Glover, owner of the Kollective Cafe, located near the Sheffield Hallam University student union building.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer“I think it’s a shame that it’s sat there empty, and whilst it’s empty the square on the opposite side of the road is getting a lot of undesirables in there.“So obviously, footfall getting in and out the building for us is a good thing. It would be a shame for it to be closed.”The building was bought in 2004 by Sheffield Hallam University and was used as its students’ union, but is now due to be vacated, with questions hanging over its future. The university is not ruling out knocking it down entirely.Cory Anson, 30, a sales worker, thought the building had some aesthetic appeal:“It’s a beautiful building. I did a course there once, it’s just a really nice building. I think it’s a staple of Sheffield as well, to be honest. Like everybody knows about the kettle building.”The four giant stainless steel drums that make up the structure surround an atrium with a glazed roof.For Molly Mallette, 26, who works supporting women in the criminal justice system, and her boyfriend, Louis Binns, 25, who works at the university, the building elicits some debate.To Mallette it is “hideous”. She added: “I think it’s a real eyesore in the area, to be honest. I don’t really know what it’s meant to be. I’ve got no other word for it, I just don’t think it’s very attractive.”View image in fullscreenSheffield Hallam University alumni Louis Binns and Molly Mallette (right) outside the student union building.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverBinns disagreed, however. “It’s interesting to look at,” he said. “From working at Hallam Help, when directing students it’s incredibly easy because it obviously stands out.”Kristina Drmic, 24, a former student who now works at the students’ union, pointed to the unmissable nature of the building.“It’s very easy for students to find us because the description of it is very unique. Some people call it the alien-shaped building, some people call it the four kettles.“I think the shape of it is part of the Sheffield culture and I think it should stay and shouldn’t get demolished.”Anthea Page, 58, who works in communications, said the building was redundant and she would gladly welcome its closure.“It doesn’t serve its current purpose,” she said. “It’s used for the Hallam students’ union and it’s not well used, it’s not very well placed. The entrances aren’t in the right place.”Explore more on these topicsBuildings at riskArchitectureNorth of EnglandSheffieldnewsShareReuse this content"

They had come in with schizophrenia, anorexia or, in a few cases, a youthful waywardness that their parents hoped could be cured. For William Sargant, the psychiatrist in charge, the cure lay not only in prolonged narcosis but insulin shock therapy, ECT and, if need be, lobotomy. Afterwards, the patients had no memory of what had been done to them. The Sargant method was to wipe their minds clean.Celia Imrie, later a famous actor, was admitted to Ward 5 in 1966, when she was 14. To her it was “like being in a prison camp” and her recovery “owed nothing” to the “truly horrifying” Sargant and his “barbaric treatments”. Sara (not her real name) was a year older, just 15, and remembers the “hideous cocktail of drugs” that kept her in a zombified state. Linda Keith, celebrated for her relationship with Jimi Hendrix and at the time, in her own words, “a pleasure-seeking, music obsessed drug addict”, had about 50 sessions of ECT on Ward 5: they left her “hugely mentally incapacitated” and unable to read. She also recalls Sargant coming on to her in his private practice.How persistent a sexual predator he was is unclear, but at least one woman registered a complaint with the General Medical Council, and there’s nothing remotely redemptive in Jon Stock’s lacerating account. A tall, burly “rugger man” who hushed up the mental breakdown he had in his 20s, Sargant was cavalierly mechanistic in his approach, dismissing therapy and Freudian “soft merchants” in his zeal for the liquid cosh and other even tougher interventions; in one of his books he recommended lobotomy, instead of divorce, for unhappy wives. He loved publicity and was occasionally a talking head on the BBC, once appearing on the Third Programme with the singer PJ Proby.The six women who speak out in this book are haunted by what he got up to without their knowledgeHe had the respect of some colleagues – including doctor and future foreign secretary David Owen – and rose to the top of his profession, with a private practice alongside NHS work in London and at the Belmont Hospital in Sutton. His 1957 book Battle for the Mind, ghosted byRobert Graves, was a bestseller, and he could boast many eminent and well-to-do clients – aristocrats, prima ballerinas, overseas royals. Gifts and donations poured in. While working at the Priory shortly before his retirement, a “gorgeous Arabian princess” offered him a Rolls-Royce and sent five along, in different colours, for him to choose from.At his best, he was part of a movement to destigmatise psychiatric units and banish any lingering association with lunatic asylums. To more sceptical colleagues, though, he was “Bill the Brain Slicer”: arrogant, bombastic and “soullessly one-sided”. RD Laing saw his approach as a “regression to barbarism”; Anthony Clare was a critic, too. The six female patients whose personal testimonies form chapters in Stock’s book thought him a monster. So did nurses allocated to the sleep room, whose job was to medicate the patients (usually with chlorpromazine) four times a day, and who hated the spooky ambience and “dark alchemy of drugs and electricity”; it was, one said, “the sort of thing you’d expect in Hitler’s time”. Patient consent didn’t become enshrined until the Mental Health Act of 1983 and the women were repeatedly subject to procedures to which they hadn’t agreed. The side- and after-effects were dire (tremors, chronic fatigue, massive memory loss, etc) but to Sargant, Stock claims, these were “an acceptable trade-off”. He was, Stock adds, “possessed of afuror therapeuticus– a rage to heal – that was more in his own interest than his patients”.The sleep room regime is more than enough to convict Sargant of dubious practice, but halfway through the book Stock veers off to examine his possible involvement with MI5, MI6 and the CIA’s MKUltra programme in mind control. Sargant learned a lot about brainwashing during the second world war, while treating traumatised soldiers, and his expertise found favour with the intelligence services. He also worked in the US for a time, and had close ties with a fellow sleep-room practitioner there, Donald Ewen Cameron, who was funded by the CIA. Stock speculates on what Sargant “could” or “might” have worked on, including LSD trials at Porton Down with MI6. But in the absence of incriminating documents (many of which remain classified) the evidence is inconclusive and, compared with the sleep room chapters, the material looks tangential, however heatedly researched. To say that “he was unquestionably the sort of psychiatrist whom Porton Down – and MI6 – might have turned to” doesn’t really nail him as an opportunistic cold war stooge. And the sensationalist chapter heading “She told me that Sargant killed … a patient”, based on a secondhand, uncorroborated story, feels a bit cheap.Of the thousands of patients Sargant treated, at least five seem to have died during narcosis. Meanwhile, he exaggerated recovery rates and didn’t count relapses. And the six women who speak out in this book are haunted by what he got up to without their knowledge. On the website of the Royal College of Physicians he’scalled“the most important figure in postwar psychiatry … He gave his patients hope.” Those women, along with many former nurses and doctors, would beg to disagree.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

AtProspect Cottage, his black-and-yellow sanctuary squatting in the shadow of the nuclear power station at Dungeness on the Kent coast, Jarman nurtured a garden in the inauspicious shingle; plants thrived between the jagged upturned stones he likened to dragon’s teeth. Thanks to his writings – notably the diaries published asModern Naturein 1991, three years before his death – and the 2020 crowdfunding campaign to preserve the dwelling for the nation, the cottage and its gardens are now familiar and accessible to people who have never seen Sebastiane or Edward II, and may never want to.Film is the flickering backdrop to the Barbican’s evening of music and readings celebrating Modern Nature, rather than its focal point, though Super 8 footage of a youthful Tilda Swinton (Jarman’s muse) provides a neat counterpoint to the pre-recorded sound of her 21st-century voice. Here in person are performers including the musician Simon Fisher Turner – a Jarman collaborator – along with Jessie Buckley, Shaun Evans and Will Young as well as It’s a Sin co-starsOlly Alexanderand Omari Douglas.View image in fullscreenWry … Omari Douglas in Derek Jarman: Modern Nature.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianEach one reads from the journals, their distinct tones suggesting different aspects of Jarman – like the six contrasting Bob Dylans in Todd Haynes’s film I’m Not There. Buckley is piercing, Evans booming, Young cosily avuncular, Alexander coquettish and Douglas wry and rueful. If so low-key an evening could be said to have a scene-stealer, it is the countertenor Nils Wanderer, who blasts in like a gale – appropriately so, given the emphasis on the meteorological.As directed by James Dacre, the readings dwell on the tempests in Jarman’s life: his battles with a failing body (he bought Prospect Cottage in 1986, the year of his HIV diagnosis) and with the state-sanctioned homophobia of Section 28. As the weather at Dungeness worsens, it can all seem like a cold front of symbolism complete with gusts of metaphor. But there is vitality here, too, in this place that the film-maker called the sunniest in all of England, as well as waves of catalysing anger and defiance which will come in handy now that LGBTQ+ people face levels of hostility not seen since Jarman’s day.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreDerek JarmanTilda SwintonJessie BuckleyWill YoungOlly AlexanderreviewsShareReuse this content"

It could be said to presuppose the existence of a good side to allowing, encouraging or coercing young children and early teens to put their lives online for attention and validation (or deliberately creating content to attract subscribers, brand interest and sponsorship deals). But perhaps, you think, I am being hopelessly old-fashioned. Perhaps this is the way forward. Perhaps it is the way things are these days. Who am I to say how youngsters should connect, spend their time, be raised in 2025?I understand this impulse to ignore the past. I almost admire it. It is good for us all, as we get older, to fight against the creeping belief that the past was better. It is a canard, a conflation of the happy memories of childhood, of being young, carefree and ignorant. You simply weren’t aware of the problems of the world, the ugly truths it contained: the past was never better, you simply didn’t know enough about it.If you can keep fighting that fight with any conviction by the end of Bad Influence, however, I would have to invite you to interrogate at what point hope and optimism transform into denial. Because this is very much a story about the now and not a single part of it is better than any aspect of then.The three-parter focuses on the rise and, if not fall, then forcible diversification of child-then-teen social media star Piper Rockelle and her mother and manager, Tiffany Smith. After Rockelle’s success within the bizarre American phenomenon that is the toddler and child pageantry circuit, Smith took her on to social media. To increase her daughter’s appeal and her YouTube channel views and follower numbers, Smith gradually added other children – friends? performers? – to Rockelle’s videos, and they became known and loved by their ever-growing audience as “the Squad”. Smith’s much younger boyfriend, Hunter Hill, would film the videos as she directed. At her peak, Rockelle was making more than half a million dollars a month from her content.In 2022, 11 former members of the Squadfiled a lawsuitagainst Smith and Hill, alleging violations of child labour laws, alongside being subject to “inappropriate, offensive and abusive treatment” including “wildly offensive and sexually explicit comments” from Smith. One former member, Corinne, says she remembers at the age of 12 or 13 going to a post office with Smith, who was sending off what appeared to be a package of Rockelle’s underwear. When she asked why, she says Smith declared: “Old men like to smell it.” Smith and Hill deny all allegations and the lawsuit was settled last year without admission of any liability.Across three episodes, there are interviews with former performers, none of whom look old enough to be long out of their teens – if they are at all. We hear from family members who became increasingly concerned about the filming (and Rockelle’s apparent absence from school from the age of eight), and we meet the mothers of the children who took part. It builds a picture of a woman whose powers of manipulation and business savvy found an ideal home in the shadowy world of online content creation with children. The field operates on the margin between professional and domestic, so nobody can be sure where labour laws, for example, begin or end, or when allowing children to express themselves on camera for fun morphs into monetisation. It is deeply murky as to whether monetisation can ever be anything other than exploitation, or whether children expressing themselves on camera for fun can ever be benign, given what we know about the likelihood of predators in their potential audience. The programme notes a study that found that 60% of content discovered on the computers of people sexually interested in children came from social media sites, and that about 92% of an audience for teen girl influencers is likely to be adult men.Beyond that, of course, there are the shocking allegations about Smith’s sexual behaviour towards the children which, if the claims are true, does not operate at shadowy margins but is clearly wrong in every way. And the programme touches on the power of people with Smith’s apparent gifts for dividing, ruling and gaslighting (“Sometimes you didn’t understand how she was getting you to do these things,” says her niece, Claire) to create cult-like groups that even unsettled adults – soon forbidden to attend their children’s filming sessions – were reluctant to leave for fear of the consequences. That said, it did feel that the question of parental responsibility was slightly glossed over by the film-makers. It doesn’t lessen the magnitude of Smith’s crimes to ask as well where other boundaries lie.Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNetflixDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Holy Cow is the feature debut from director (and part-time farmer) Louise Courvoisier; it’s a social-realist drama that is the opposite of grim and miserable in its warm and often funny telling of a coming-of-age story about a teenager from a struggling family ofcomté-makersin the remote region of Jura. Courvoisier warms things up nicely with her idealism and optimism, and she gets brilliant performances from her non-professional cast, cows included. The opening scene features a calf sitting in the driver’s seat of a car staring out of the window.The full comté: quest to make a semi-hard cheese is French cinema’s breakout hit of the yearRead moreNewcomer Clément Faveau (a poultry farmer in real-life) plays 18-year-old Totone, first shown at a country fair so drunk that he jumps on a table and strips naked. Totone lives with his dad, a cheesemaker who drinks heavily, and his wise seven-year-old sister; no one ever mentions a mum. Totone gets small-town kicks with his mates, riding around on mopeds getting drunk, until something awful happens. Left alone to look after his sister, Totone comes up with a daft get-rich-quick scheme to make €30,000 in a comté competition. How hard can it be to knock out a prize-winning wheel?Faveau gives an amazingly subtle performance; Totone doesn’t say much but his fragility and complexity are all there, humour too in the little shrug of a shoulder. Also terrific is Maïwene Barthelemy, as a teenage dairy farmer Totone falls in love with – and steals from. In what might be the most tender line of the film, she tells Totone, not unkindly: “Stop snivelling and pull your finger out.” Holy Cow is sentimental in the best of ways, with its warmth and hope in human nature. After watching the intensive labour of the cheese-making scenes you may also complain less about handing over a fiver for a little chunk of comté.Holy Cow shows at UK and Irish cinemas from 11 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCheeseFranceWorld cinemaEuropeFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

Damningly, the Barbadian novelist asserted that his father “had only fathered the idea of me”. That notion of children being left mainly, if not solely, the liability of mothers still widely resonates in Caribbean households. In Kit de Waal’s tender novel, The Best of Everything, the protagonist Paulette, a single mother, embraces the role not just of mothering and largely fathering her son, but also selflessly acting as a proxy mother to a child who risks being abandoned.De Waal, who edited the 2019 anthologyCommon People, has long championed working-class lives, “written in celebration and not apology”. In The Best of Everything Paulette is a migrant to Britain from St Kitts, an auxiliary nurse whose disdain for bedpans does not dampen the pleasure she takes from the thought that “it’s nice going home at night knowing you’ve helped people”.At the start of the novel in 1972, Paulette, aged 29, is fervently in love with Denton, a Jamaican building contractor whose ambition is evident in his leather-seated, cherry-red Toyota. Busy, allegedly, with work abroad, his irregular visits heighten his appeal. Denton sleeps with an arm wrapped around her shoulders “like a fur stole”. Paulette scrutinises him, looking for possible faults, but all she finds are “things that make her love him more”.Early on, though, Paulette’s excited plans for their future are shattered when Denton is killed in a car crash. De Waal uses spare, unfussy prose to capture Paulette’s grief, which receives scant recognition even from her friends. “Them with their side-eye … The rough questions with the smooth sympathy … lacing their interrogation with wine.”This beautifully rendered tale extols unfashionably the virtues of kindnessThe Best of Everything is a quiet, mournful book whose title speaks to everything that Paulette has lost: the chance to own a home, to start a family and give her child every scrap of love, to surrender to the man who was forever in her heart, to be “coaxed, kissed and caught”. Fate mocks her and the miniature bottles of Appleton rum that she begins to secretly knock back only partially anaesthetise her pain.The fatal car crash is the animating incident powering the novel with a series of unexpected consequences. In the first instance, Paulette takes comfort from Denton’s best friend, Garfield. Pretty soon Garfield upgrades from sympathetic companion to lover, one who gives Paulette what she has yearned for: a baby.The understated tone of the novel, perfectly judged through the elegant modesty of the writing, reflects the emotional veil that Paulette especially wears in public, with one notable exception. Walking through a park, with Garfield pushing their baby, Bird, in his pram, Paulette sees the elderly man whose dangerous driving led to Denton’s death. To the horror of Garfield and passersby, she leaps on the man and wrestles him to the ground.The assault unsettles Paulette more than the target of her wrath; it’s contrary to her sense of decorum and of self. In demonstrating Paulette’s complexity, De Waal meets the difficult challenge of creating a kind-hearted protagonist who is caught in a conundrum of withholding emotion and surrendering to an internal migration while still being keenly attentive to others.Paulette’s capacity for generosity is further tested later by another extraordinary encounter with the same old man from the park. Frank Bowen is a lost soul who “poured more disappointment into one look than Paulette thought was possible”. Frank mourns his daughter, a passenger in his car during the crash, who suffered a brain injury and died three years later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A disheveled Frank seems barely able to take care of himself, never mind a young boy. Nellie’s pitiful look “nearly splits her in two”, and within a short time she’s regularly inviting the boy into her home.Till this moment, Paulette’s focus had been exclusively on Bird, but by the end of this beautifully rendered tale extolling unfashionably the virtues of kindness, Paulette acknowledges “an extra chamber in [her] heart” where Nellie resides. The admission is emblematic of a quietly unforgettable character, a compassionate, nurturing mother who also fathers the two boys. It’s her maternal Caribbean nature, “and there’s nothing she can do about it”.The Best of Everything by Kit de Waal is published by Tinder (£20).

Donnie and Joe Emerson were two brothers from Washington State who self-recorded an album in their teen years in 1978 called Dreamin’ Wild; it bombed, leaving crippling debts for their poor dad (played by Beau Bridges), who’d taken out bank loans to build them a log-cabin recording studio – but the record is then rediscovered 30 years later by vinyl hipster connoisseurs who can hardly believe the Emerson boys’ untutored rock genius.The film insightfully shows how this deferred fame is not all good news; it has come too late for them really to enjoy it and Donnie (Affleck) has grown into a prickly, demanding creative personality who has been working desperately hard on his music career in the intervening years. He doesn’t know how to feel about being at last feted for a record he now thinks of as immature and outmoded and its belated celebration leaves no room for his wife and musical partner Nancy (Zooey Deschanel). Like many who finally get a break after decades of hard work, he reacts with strange indignation to the fact that he’s had to do without success for so long. As for his brother Joe (Goggins), who was only the humble drummer while Donnie did all the composing and playing and arranging, and now just works on the family farm, the resurgence of interest in Dreamin’ Wild simply re-awakens his inferiority complex.Writer-director Bill Pohlad made the interestingLove & Mercy, about the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson, and this has a similar before-and-after structure. The present day action is interspersed with scenes of the young Joe and Donnie, played by Jack Dylan Grazer and Noah Jupe. Yet however earnest and heartfelt, the film doesn’t tell us nearly enough, or really anything, about Joe. He has real heartbreak in his life and seems on the point of explaining this to a New York Times reporter – but is interrupted at the crucial moment. It is a powerful moment, but for some reason the followup never arrives, perhaps lost in the edit, and Goggins doesn’t have enough to get his teeth into. A shame.Dreamin’ Wild is on digital platforms from 14 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPop and rockCasey AffleckPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Treading through his homeland of the Lake District more than two centuries later, on a radiant early spring day, sunbeams casting through the bare branches to anoint the daffodils, it’s a compelling edict.As a founding father of England’s Romantic poetry movement, Wordsworth’s legacy is synonymous with the rolling, rugged landscapes of the Lakes. He and his contemporaries Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey were collectively known as the “Lake Poets”, and to gaze on the region’s deep, still waters and scrabble across its fells is to understand the source of his artistic inspiration, centuries on.Wordsworth walk mapThat, at least, is the aim of a new walking route dedicated to the literary giant’s life and work.The Wordsworth Way– which was unveiled on 7 April to celebrate the poet’s 255th birthday – threads strands of pre-existing footpaths together to form a signposted 14-mile trail stretching from the shores of Ullswater to the tourist town of Ambleside. It’s a region that Gordon Lightburn, Chair of Friends of the Ullswater Way, which delivered the project with partners including Wordsworth Grasmere and the University of Cumbria, refers to as “the cradle of the Romantic literature movement”. The route contemplates the former poet laureate’s “plain living and high thinking” philosophy by connecting places linked to his verses and his personal history, as well as those of his friends and family.“The idea is to get people experiencing the Lakes the way the Romantics did, by slowing down, noticing the details in the landscape, and reflecting on nature,” says Jade Cookson, a University of Cumbria alumnus who wrote a guidebook on the new route. “It’s about seeing the world through Wordsworth’s eyes and understanding why this place meant so much to him.”View image in fullscreenRydal Water.Photograph: Nicky Beeson/AlamyThe Wordsworth Way can be enjoyed as a 14-mile point-to-point walk, or a more leisurely 21-mile route involving three other circular walks, with convenient public transport links at either end. The walk itself offers a mix of bracing fell walking around Grisedale Tarn, and civilised strolling through the village of Grasmere to provide a sweeping overview of the poet’s life and influence, while paintings and pencil sketches featured in the guide bring to life the views as they would have looked in Wordsworth’s day.I stock up on Grasmere gingerbread for my trek towards the commanding Sour Milk Ghyll waterfall, a favourite spot of William and DorothyKicking things off, walk one is an 8.3-mile yomp from Glenridding village up towards Grisedale Tarn and the craggy horizons of Helvellyn. Considering the poet’s formative years, it takes in poignant sites such as the Brothers Parting Stone, a memorial immortalising a goodbye between Wordsworth, his sister Dorothy and his brother John, who would go on to die at sea. The indistinct-looking weather-beaten rock, which is signalled by a metal plaque, bears an inscription from Wordsworth’s poem In Memory of My Brother, in which he probes his grief. Its exposed location high on the fells, surrounded by nothing but grass, rocks and rolling hills, hints at the loneliness the words depict.View image in fullscreenThe Wordsworth Graves at St Oswald’s church in Grasmere.Photograph: Dave Porter/AlamyTodayI’m picking up the route at the start of walk two in Grasmere, where the adult Wordsworth and his brood lived for almost 15 years. A contemplative pause at the family graves, which lie in the churchyard of the historic St Oswald’s, in the shade of a series of yew trees planted by the poet, offers a sense of his community-mindedness. I’m distracted, though, by the heady scent of Cumbrian rum butter drifting through the moss-covered headstones: the school house that Wordsworth’s children attended is now home to the oldest gingerbread shop in the UK,Sarah Nelson’s Grasmere Gingerbread. I stock up on the crumbly, chewy biscuits for my trek under the midday sun over the flat fields towards the commanding Sour Milk Ghyll waterfall, a favourite spot of William and Dorothy. I tackle the steep climb to a solitary lookout bench at Greenhead Gill, whose “tumultuous brook” and “upright path” is immortalised in Wordsworth’s lyrical poem Michael. Pausing for breath at the bench at the edge of the slope, I’m surprised at how dramatic the drop is, but the peaceful valley seems mostly unchanged since the day he wrote: “The mountains have all opened out themselves / And made a hidden valley of their own.”Continuing on, I pick up walk three at Wordsworth’s former home ofDove Cottageon the edge of the village, which has been preserved, along with its charming fellside garden, as an ode to his daily life with Dorothy alongside his growing family. It is well worth a pit stop, as is the adjacent museum offering detailed context of his creative life. From here, I take the path that rises gently to meet a historic and occasionally scrabbly coffin route offering serene views over a tranquil-looking Rydal Water, which ends atRydal Mount, another house rented by Wordsworth.View image in fullscreenThe ascent to Greenhead Gill.Photograph: Shanna McGoldrickThis section of the route focuses on family, leading me to discover the hushed enclave of John’s Grove, where William and Dorothy would remember their brother, and later to Dora’s Field, a daffodil-covered patch of land that Wordsworth bought to remember his eldest daughter, whom he outlived. From there, I continue on to walk four, which examines the impact of his legacy by exploring the homes and lives of additional literary figures connected to Wordsworth and the Lakes. It weaves on easy footpaths to Ambleside, taking in houses formerly occupied by Thomas De Quincey and Harriet Martineau, and concludes at the site of the famous “Wordsworth steps” at what used to be the residence of his relative Dorothy Harrison, and is now part of the University of Cumbria’s Ambleside campus.Dorothy Wordsworth often takes centre stage on this walk, her words appearing frequently in Jade Cookson’s guidebook to bring anecdotes and places to life. As the reader approaches the Sour Milk Ghyll waterfall, for example, a passage from Dorothy’s diary recalls “the valley of its winter yellow, but the bed of the brook still in some places almost shaded with leaves”; while a stop at the Rectory, another Wordsworth residence en route, relates to excerpts from a tragic letter that Dorothy wrote to Thomas De Quincey to describe the death of William’s young daughter Catherine, which occurred during the family’s time at the house. “Part of doing this is to try to give her a little bit more recognition as well; the recognition that she deserves,” says Lightburn. He asserts boldly: “Her prose is far better than William’s, and her poetry is just as good.” Cookson was also keen to highlight her role in the Wordsworth story: “His huge body of work was a team effort,” she says. “His sister, Dorothy, and wife, Mary, played a big role in shaping his work.”View image in fullscreenRydal Mount, one of Wordsworth’s homes on the route.Photograph: Gordon LightburnIt’s hard not to wonder what Wordsworth, who was steadfastly opposed to tourism in the area, would have made of the Lake District today, with its luxury hotels and traffic constantly snaking between Windermere and Ambleside. “He’d probably have mixed feelings,” says Cookson. “He’d likely object to the crowds and infrastructure, but might appreciate efforts to conserve the landscape.” That said, as the Wordsworth Way proves, opportunities to turn off the beaten path and take a more meditative direction still abound.For more information, seeullswaterheritage.org/wordsworth-way.

Like its regular calabrese cousin, it’s packed full of nutrients, but the taste is nuttier and more complex, while the texture has a wonderful, satisfying bite. Steamed, boiled, stir-fried or roasted, PSB will stand up to all sorts of punchy flavours, from briny anchovies to bold Asian condiments.Spicy sesame purple sprouting broccoli and sausage noodles (pictured top)Sausage, greens, noodles and a speedy, big-flavoured sauce make for a great weeknight supper to cook on repeat.

Pour this over the spring onion mix and stir.Wipe out the pan and heat the oil. Fry the sausagemeat for five to seven minutes, until browned and crisp, then season to taste with a little sea salt and black pepper.While the sausage is frying, bring a pan of salted water to a boil. Blanch the broccoli, then lift out with a slotted spoon and refresh under ice-cold water. Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions – to make things easy, boil them in the same water you used for the broccoli.Pour the spring onion and chilli dressing into the sausage pan, then add the noodles and broccoli, and toss well to coat. Add a squeeze of lime juice, scatter with sesame seeds and serve.Purple sprouting broccoli, ricotta and preserved lemon pieView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s purple sprouting broccoli, ricotta and preserved lemon pie.Light pastry, cheese and a forest full of broccoli makes for a lovely light lunch – feel free to swap the ricotta for some feta, or use a combination of the two.Prep10 minRest1 hrCook1 hr 10 minServes4-6For the dough350gplain flour,plus extra for dustingSea salt andblack pepper5tbspextra-virgin olive oil,plus extra for brushingFor the filling500g purple sprouting broccoli1tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped250g ricotta100gparmesan, gratedRinds of2 preserved lemons,finely choppedGrated zest of1 large lemonStart by making the dough. In a large bowl, combine the flour and a pinch of sea salt, then pour in the oil and180ml water, and knead into a dough that is soft and elastic but not sticky –if need be, adjust with more flour or water. Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for an hour.Meanwhile, make the filling. Chop the broccoli into small, even, bite-sized pieces and cook in salted boiling water for two to three minutes, until tender. Drain well, then squeeze out any excess liquid.In a frying pan, heat the oil over a medium flame, saute the onion until soft and translucent, then take off the heat and leave to cool.In a bowl, stir the ricotta to loosen it, then add the parmesan, preserved lemon rind, fresh lemon zest and broccoli. Season with sea salt and pepper, and mix well.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper. Unwrap the dough and divide it in two. Dust a work surface with flour, then roll out one piece of the dough as thinly as possible into a roughly 27cm-diameter circle. Roll this on to the rolling pin, then unroll it on top of the lined baking sheet and spread the filling all over the top.Roll out the second piece of dough to the same size, then lay this on top of the filling. Join up the edges and fold them towards the centre to close the pie. Pierce the entire surface with a fork, then brush with plenty of olive oil. Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Serve warm or at room temperatureCheesy polenta with charred purple sprouting broccoli, anchovy and lemonView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s cheesy polenta with charred purple sprouting broccoli, anchovy and lemon.This silky, parmesan-rich polenta serves as the perfect bed for toothsome stalks of purple sprouting broccoli. If you don’t have a griddle pan, cook the spears under the grill or roast them in the oven until smoky and charred.Prep15 minCook25 minServes6350g purple sprouting broccoli, trimmed and cut into even piecesSea salt and black pepper2anchovy fillets1garlic clove, peeled and very finely chopped3tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve1½lemons, 1 zestedFor the polenta1litre vegetable stock150g fine polenta80g finely gratedparmesan, plus extra to serve60g unsalted butterBlanch the broccoli in salted boiling water for a minute, then drain and refresh in ice-cold water. In a bowl, use a fork to mash the anchovies into the garlic, then stir in the olive oil.For the polenta, bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan on a medium heat, then gradually pour in the polenta in a steady stream, whisking continuously. Turn down the heat as low as it will go, then simmer, whisking occasionally and, as the mixture thickens, more frequently, for about 15 minutes.Meanwhile, get a griddle pan very hot. Lay the half lemon cut side down on the griddle and leave it to blacken. Season the broccoli with sea salt and drizzle over the anchovy oil, then griddle the broccoli for a minute or two on each side until charred and smoky. Finish the polenta by whisking in the butter and parmesan, and season. Squeeze the charred lemon over the broccoli.To serve, spoon the polenta on to plates and top with some broccoli. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, scatter over a little lemon zest and shave over some extra parmesan.Explore more on these topicsFoodPieCheeseMain courseCereals and grainsVegetablesNoodlesrecipesShareReuse this content"

If you have the self-discipline not just to scoff it all immediately in a mound of butter, here are nine simple steps to turn it into a perfect seasonal soupFelicity CloakeWed 9 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareSoup is rarely on the menu when I spot those first spindly green spears of the season – after nine asparagus-less months, I’m barely able to contain my impatience long enough to boil them and slap on some butter, let alone anything a bit more involved. But once the initial frenzy has abated, this is a great recipe for thicker, woodier stems, or for the bases of those for which you’ve used the tips elsewhere.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4500g trimmed asparagus– tips optional, if you’d prefer to use them for something else6 spring onions50g butter, or oil1 tbsp flour –gluten-free is fine, if need beSalt and black pepper2 tbsp double cream, or creme fraiche (see step 9) – dairy-free is fine1 A note on the asparagusView image in fullscreenSelect the thickest stalks available (slender ones aren’t a problemper se, but you may prefer to use them in a dish where their tender elegance will be better appreciated; you may also prefer to remove the feathery tips and use them elsewhere). If the bases are very dry and brown, trim them, then weigh what’s left; you need roughly 500g.2 Trim the asparagusBoil a litre of water in a kettle or bring it to a boil in a saucepan (unless you have one of those fancy taps). Remove the woody ends from the stalks. It’s easiest to do this by bending them individually, because they should snap at just the point where they become too fibrous to cook through in the same time as the slimmer tops.3 Cook the basesView image in fullscreenCut off the tops and set aside for now. Roughly chop the tougher bases, and drop them into the pan of boiling water. Bring to a simmer, then cook for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, trim the whiskery root ends and dry tops off the spring onions, and roughly chop the rest, both green and white parts.4 Drain the asparagus endsImportant! Bearing in mind that you need to save the cooking water rather than the asparagus bases, strain the contents of the pan through a colander or sieve and into a heatproof jug (alternatively, scoop out the ends and keep the water in the pan, if you don’t need it to make the soup). Discard the spent cooked asparagus ends.5 Make the soup baseView image in fullscreenMelt the butter in a medium pan on a medium-low heat, then briefly soften the sliced spring onions (if you’d prefer to keep this plant-based, use oil instead – I’d suggest olive oil here for its flavour).Stir in the flour (gluten-free flour will work fine), and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring so it doesn’t burn.6 Add the flavoured cooking waterView image in fullscreenSlowly pour in the reserved asparagus cooking water bit by bit, whisking as you do so, first to make a paste and then to loosen the paste with the rest of the liquid, so you don’t end up with lumps. Bring to a boil.While you wait, roughly chop the tops of the stalks; if you’re using the tips, set those aside for now.7 Add the remaining chopped stemsView image in fullscreenAdd the chopped stem tops to the pan, turn down the heat slightly and simmer gently for eight minutes.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, if you’re using the tips, cook these separately in boiling, lightly salted water for three minutes, then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water so they retain their colour. Drain and dry the cooked tips.8 Blend the soup mixView image in fullscreenTake the soup off the heat, then puree until smooth, either with a stick blender or in a jug blender. (If using the latter, leave the soup to cool slightly first, because putting it in when it’s too hot can cause steam to build up in the jug, and the lid to pop off, spraying soup all over your kitchen).9 Finishing touchesReturn the soup to the pan and stir in the cream (you can use a plant-based alternative, but make sure it’s not sweetened; I’d also recommend steering clear of coconut, which doesn’t work well here). Season to taste, divide between bowls and garnish with the drained tips, if using.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassSoupStarterVegetablesSpring food and drinkBritish food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
