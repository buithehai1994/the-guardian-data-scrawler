This was never going to be an easy prime minister’s question for Keir Starmer.The opposition was spoilt for choice. The peers in question – Peter Mandelson and Matthew Doyle – as well as the topics ofMorgan McSweeney,Tim Allan,Wes Streeting… These were just some of the crisis points of the past seven days. Even by the political psychodramas of the past 10 years, it’s fair to say Starmer has had the week from hell. Just one damn thing after another.But even the losers get lucky some time. Starmer knew he was in for a rough half hour. You could see it in the anxious glances he flicked towards the opposition benches. You could hear it in the forced cheers from his own MPs. The weary opening gag about having had more ministerial meetings than usual this week.And yet it wasn’t the bloodbath Keir and his colleagues had anticipated. Compared withlast week’s PMQs disaster, this was a breeze. A few minor flesh wounds at most.You could sense a whispered thank you from Starmer to his opposite number. When he feels the whole world is against him, he is lucky to find himself up againstKemi Badenoch. A woman who believes she is dictating world events. You could put her on a fairground ride and she would still think she was in control of where she was going.Her latest delusion is that she has masterminded the recent crises inside No 10. Without her interventions, none of us would be any the wiser about Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein. Thanks to her, McSweeney resigned and Starmer found his leadership under threat.It hasn’t yet dawned on her that all she is doing is repeating information that had already been published in a newspaper over a year ago. Or maybe she thinks she makes the journalists write the stories.Last week Kemi had kept her delusions simple. Didn’t try to do more than ask the same questions that were on everyone else’s minds. But this week, she couldn’t resist overdoing things a bit. Trying to embellish her sentences with a flourish.It all fell a bit flat. That isn’t to say that Starmer wasn’t on the back foot for some of the exchanges, but he wasn’t as discomfited as he might have been. You could feel the disappointment from Kemi’s backbenchers. They had been hoping for more.Starmer even got the better of the first two questions as Badenoch went for the drop intro. How come he had turned on his staff, she asked. “I accepted responsibility,” Keir replied. Apparently sacking your most trusted and loyal adviser is a sign of accepting responsibility. Go figure. He then bigged up McSweeney’s achievements in producing aLabourlandslide and the smallest Tory party in decades. And what had Kemi done? She had made her own party even smaller.Kemi visibly winced. Struggling for a reply. Keir doubled down by reminding her that she had publicly backed colleagues only days before they had defected. Who was next?Things then got a bit tougher for the prime minister as Kemi finally got round to mentioning Doyle, Starmer’s former director of communications who had been given a peerage despite his friendship with a man who was convicted of possessing indecent images of children.This is a terrible look for Labour. Claiming that Doyle “did not give a full account” of the extent of his friendship doesn’t really cut it. Not only was the relevant information in the public domain, the onus was on Starmer to ensure he was making the right call. Nor was it too late to cancel the peerage when he did find out. At best, Keir looked a bit dopey with lousy judgment; at worst, it felt as if he was running a boy’s club with no consideration of the victims.Even though he had no real answers to Kemi’s questions, Starmer still came out fighting. For days now, the prime minister’s supporters have been saying that we are now going to see “the real Keir” after the recent leadership crisis.Only on Tuesday, Ed Miliband had said that the Keir he knew was “passionate, bold and committed to fighting inequality”. It was a pity he had kept that side of himself hidden from the rest of us.Now was our first chance to see The Real Keir in action. And it turns out that this Keir is pretty pissed off with life. Reckons he has been dealt a duff hand over the past few weeks. That many of his colleagues are less than grateful for all he has done for them. That he is the one true leader who delivered a landslide. He was not going to roll over for anyone. He was going to give as good as he got.Starting with Kemi. The leader of the opposition was rather taken aback. She is used to being the feisty one. The one who dishes it out. Now she was on the receiving end. She had expected Starmer to be more defensive. Apologetic, even.Keir might not have had a lot to say about Doyle but he had plenty to say about all the Tory sleaze over the years and the deadbeat governments we’d had to endure. He made it sound as if there was some kind of competition going on. His MPs seemed to like it, though. This wasn’t the dismantling of their leader they had feared. Maybe the danger was over for now.Ed Davey landed more telling blows on Starmer over Doyle, simply by sounding more normal. More reasonable. But Keir also gave him the same hairdryer treatment. Keir was angry and he wasn’t going to put up with it any more …Still, there was time for nearly everyone to have a good laugh at the end. Ayoub Khan – a Birmingham MP – talked of the rubbish right under his nose. He was standing right behind the Reform cohort. Richard Tice joined in the laughter but Nigel Farage remained stony-faced. He’s more thin-skinned than he lets on. Recess can’t come a moment too soon for everyone.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchHouse of CommonsKeir StarmerLabourKemi BadenochConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

A golden age of dissent, activism and culture ensued – but have we since gone backwards?Micha Frazer-CarrollWed 11 Feb 2026 11.58 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 12.48 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleOne afternoon in 1984, Farrukh Dhondy went for lunch, not realising he was about to become part of British television history. The Indian-born writer was working forChannel 4at the time on breakout multi-ethnic shows such as No Problem!, a sitcom about a family of Jamaican heritage in London, and Tandoori Nights, a comedy about an Indian restaurant. When Dhondy arrived at the Ivy, Jeremy Isaacs, the burgeoning broadcaster’s founding chief executive, ordered an £84 bottle of wine.“I thought, ‘What the hell is this all about?’” Dhondy says. It turned out Isaacs wanted him to be the next commissioning editor for Channel 4. “For God’s sake, I’m not an office job man,” he said. “I’m a writer.” But after a brief conversation with the Trinidadian activist-scholar CLR James, who was living with him while going through a divorce, Dhondy changed his mind.One show from the ‘assimilation era’ instructed Asian women not to barter in supermarketsFor the next 13 years, he was part of a radical wave of British TV that funded and supported ethnic minority storytelling in a way that hadn’t been seen before – or since. A new season at the British Film Institute in London, called Constructed, Told, Spoken, will explore this “counter-history”, screening archival episodes that tell the forgotten story of British multi-ethnic programming.Until the early 1980s, such shows had spoken to audiences of colour without collaborating closely with them. BBC Hindi programmes included Nai Zindagi Naya Jeevan (A New Life, a New Existence) andApna Hi Ghar Samajhiye(Make Yourself at Home), which focused on assimilation into British life after postwar migration.“They were extremely patronising,” Dhondy says, citing programmes that, for example, instructed Asian women not to barter at supermarket counters. BBC and ITV sitcoms such as Love Thy Neighbour and Mind Your Language mocked Caribbean and south Asian accents and cultures, and, Dhondy says, the broadcasters’ coverage of 1960s and 70s protest movements was perfunctory and repetitive.Sarita Malik, professor of media and culture at Brunel University of London, calls that the era of “assimilationist TV”. She explains: “Englishness was always positioned as dominant. [These shows] were geared towards producing a model ‘good minority’. Cultural difference – accent, humour, food, music – was accepted, but political difference was not. [They wanted] a kind of ‘difference without dissent’.”View image in fullscreenEnough is enough … Stuart Hall presents It Ain’t Half Racist Mum in 1979.Photograph: BFIBut dissent they got. Mirroring other anti-racist struggles of the 1970s, activist groups began to draw public and industry attention to racism on TV, with high-profile groups such asthe Campaign Against Racism in the Mediaorganising protests against racist programming including The Black and White Minstrel Show, and the Black Media Workers Association threatening strikes due to racism at the BBC. It was time for Britain’s new communities to join the national conversation – broadcasters could no longer afford to overlook them.Proposed under Labour, Channel 4 was launched in 1982, during Margaret Thatcher’s stint as prime minister, with a radical remit. It had a dedicated multicultural department and, as Britain’s first “publisher broadcaster”, it could commission independent producers who had been excluded from the industry. Mass audience broadcasting was already covered by the BBC and ITV, so the channel chose to serve previously undervalued audiences.With trade union membership still high and anti-racist organising growing, the broadcaster collaborated with grassroots groups, workers’ movements, activist-writers and independent film-makers under its commissioner of multicultural programmes, Sue Woodford. Dhondy, who was heavily involved in the anti-racist magazineRaceToday, the British Black Panthers and the Indian Workers’ association, was well placed to take up this work.Channel 4 adopted a philosophy called “direct speech”, meaning discussion should come directly from communities rather than mediated through industry professionals. TV was a natural medium for it, an it was still an emerging format by comparison with newspapers. To be truly part of national discourse, people of colour needed a life beyond what Dhondy calls “complaint programmes”: those shows about housing, education and employment that simply point out the existence of racism, as if explaining it to white audiences. “Oh, it’s racism, racism, racism,” he says. “It’s boring. Nobody wants to watch it.” Instead, Dhondy believed we needed sitcoms, drama, documentary, the lot.The most famous show to adopt the direct-speech policy in the 1980s was likely Bandung File, commissioned by Dhondy and edited by British-Pakistani writer and film-maker Tariq Ali and Trinidadian British Black PantherDarcus Howe. The documentary and current affairs programme was unique in its attempts to present “third world” and ethnic minority interests to Black, south Asian and white British audiences. Drawing on the political print-reporting of Race Today, Bandung File served communities of colour in practical ways. Programmes took on Black and Asian consumer issues and warned about changes to immigration and naturalisation law.View image in fullscreenChannel 4’s Asian magazine show Eastern Eye.Photograph: BFIAnd the show explored the many facets of racism, beyond caricature. One episode, Too Many Questions, looked at the nuances of racism at Britain’s border, observing that Black people from countries such as Canada are privileged over those from poor, majority-Black countries. The legacy of the show is still precious: Ali last week expressed concern thathe had not been invited to speak at its BFI screeningnext month, fearing the show’s vision would not be communicated (Ali has since been invited).This era also saw Channel 4’s Asian magazine show Eastern Eye and the African and Caribbean show Black on Black. The latter was the first British programme made by Black journalists –and the team included figures who would go on to achieve other firsts, such as Julian Henriques, the director of the first Black British movie musical, and Victor Romero Evans, star of the first Black musical to hit the West End.Dhondy says this kind of career progression was built into Channel 4’s strategy of training Black and Asian people as directors, producers and camera crew, as well as actors and presenters. The broadcaster funded small companies led by people of colour, giving them advice on how to get started in the industry, in a bid to decentralise production and get underrepresented communities working behind the camera.As Channel 4 became famed for its radical programming, the BBC and ITV also diversified their output. The BBC set up a production unit for African-Caribbean shows and launched Ebony, its first dedicated culture review aimed at the Black community. Xavier Alexandre Pillai, curator of the BFI’s season, says part of this interest was economic. “In local markets in the early 80s, programmes were produced to cater to diverse audiences.” When broadcasters were under scrutiny, Pillai says this communicated competence, the feeling “that the appointed broadcaster could be trusted to reach even those audiences considered marginal”.View image in fullscreenDirect-speech philosophy … Bandung File investigates racist border policing.Photograph: BFIBut by the turn of the millennium, around the time Dhondy decided to leave Channel 4, the economic, political and industry context had changed. The introduction of digital TV and Freeview intensified competition between channels, resulting in increasingly populist and sensationalist programming. Under New Labour, “multiculturalism” once again came to mean assimilation, and more politicised understandings of race fell out of fashion. Channel 4disbandedits multicultural programming department soon after Dhondy left, and pivoted towards commercial competition. The BBC and ITV followed similar paths.People today take representation to be the goal. But having mixed-race families in soap adverts solves nothingDespite their ability to provoke pessimism or nostalgia, the broadcasts in the BFI’s season are an important part of British media history, and help contextualise where we are today. When it comes to diversity on TV, broadcasters and critics often reinforce the idea that we are on a steady march towards progress. But this counter-history suggests quite the opposite: that the 80s may be thought of as a golden age for anti-racist TV and that we have, in some ways, gone backwards.Today, ethnic minorities may feel better represented on the small screen, but as of 2020, they made uponly 8%of those working in creative and content production roles, and 9% of those in leadership roles. Dhondy says: “People are taking representation as the ultimate goal. So what you get is Black or mixed-race families doing advertisements selling soap. This doesn’t solve anything.”View image in fullscreenA discussion among Black teachers in Open Door  in 1973.Photograph: BFIThe BFI archive also shows the importance of financial and structural investment. The movement for multicultural TV was successful due to dedicated units, huge levels of investment, and worker organising that directly threatened structures of power. The political landscape is different now. “Since the 1980s and 1990s,” says Malik, “we have seen a creeping depoliticisation of the case for more diverse representation – representation without structural challenge.”Pillai tells me that this is particularly true for nonfiction: “Looking back from the present, it is astounding to see episodes of Ebony where cultural views are unpicked as they interview people of West Indian descent who talk about the complexities of returning to the Caribbean, or TV that provides the historical context of present issues.” He points towards the British media’s failure to contextualise the conditions that led tothe 2011 riotsas a more recent example of a gap in reporting.Black teachers, trans women, cleaners and cons: how the BBC’s Open Door allowed ‘real people’ to let ripRead morePillai adds that too few people are aware that all this existed, and that, without this context, we’re at risk of revising history. “[Contemporary] dramas likeSmall Axeare fantastic, but these historical events are there, captured in real time: interviews with people who were atGrunwick, and coverage of theDeptford fire.”When we don’t acknowledge these accounts as part of our history, we also tend to paint a picture of the past that is unfairly bleak. “When people talk about representation in that era, the first thing they mention is Love Thy Neighbour or Mind Your Language” – two ITV sitcoms that have since become infamous for their racism. “[That’s] like if historians talked about television in the 00s and only mentioned Jeremy Kyle.”The reality is always more complicated. As Dhondy says, television is not just one thing – it reflects the national conversation. That conversation is multilayered, contested and not yet concluded. As the archive shows us, it could change at any moment.Constructed, Told, Spoken: A Counter-History of Britain on TV is atthe BFI, London, until 17 MarchExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTelevision industryChannel 4BFIDarcus HoweStuart HallBritish identity and societyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the case of Van Der Beek, that would be Dawson’s Creek, Kevin Williamson’s soapy drama that ran for six seasons across the millennium.James Van Der Beek, star of Dawson’s Creek, dies aged 48Read moreAnd that would be perfectly justified, since in its time Dawson’s Creek was a genuine sensation. It might be hard to remember, since the show became the water that all teen drama swims in, but Dawson’s Creek had a rare knack for meeting its audience where it was.Shows that were aimed at similar demographics tended to either be too goofy or too moralising, but Dawson managed to find a rare sweet spot. It didn’t talk down to the teens who watched it; in fact, it made a point of making them emotionally self-aware and hyperliterate. If you watched it as a teen, you were watching the version of yourself that you most wanted to be.As the titular Dawson, Van Der Beek had arguably the trickiest role on the show. He was the audience surrogate. While Joshua Jackson’s Pacey got to be cool and funny and dangerous, Dawson was tasked with holding the moral centre. This was tricky because that can be an extremely boring note to play, and so it came to pass. After the show had been on air for a few seasons, viewers started to turn against the sheer wet blandness of the character.View image in fullscreenJames Van Der Beek and Katie Holmes in Dawson’s Creek.Photograph: Globe Photos/ShutterstockFor a lot of actors, this would have been a career-ender. A defining role as a nice guy sap is a straitjacket that few can escape from. But this is where James Van Der Beek got to stretch his muscles. As well as making his name, Dawson gave him something to push against. And this is something he did gloriously.While Dawson’s Creek was still on air, Van Der Beek began stretching the limits of his reputation. There was a cameo in Kevin Smith’s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, where he got to play himself as Dawson, knowingly chewing the scenery through a series of faux-angsty monologues. In the 2002 film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s The Rules of Attraction, he went a step further, playing no less than Patrick Bateman’s little brother; a cold, morally vacant, cruelly indifferent drug dealer. And it turned out that he had much more fun playing the anti-Dawson than Dawson himself.After proving his range, Van Der Beek spent the next few years settling into a steady stream of guest spots and bit parts that traded on his familiarity. He turned up on Ugly Betty, How I Met Your Mother and One Tree Hill. But arguably his greatest role would come in 2012, nine years after the end of Dawson’s Creek, where he got to play himself (again) in the tremendous Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23.James Van Der Beek: a life in picturesRead moreCancelled long before its time, Don’t Trust the B---- was a gleefully nasty little sitcom about a brazen party girl played by Krysten Ritter, who spent her life conning her flatmates out of their rent money. It was funny from start to finish, but it only truly caught fire when Van Der Beek strolled onscreen. This is because the version of himself that he portrayed was as wildly self-lacerating as anything you have ever seen.View image in fullscreenJames Van Der Beek and Krysten Ritter filming Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23.Photograph: Zelig Shaul/ShutterstockThis Van Der Beek had already enjoyed his moment of fame, and was raging against his growing anonymity. He was stupendously vain and endlessly grasping, and determined to shag his way back to the top. It was a piece of performance as self-criticism that only an especially well-adjusted actor can pull off. Nicolas Cage tried something similar a few years ago with The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and spent the entire press run trying to convince everyone that he was nothing like his character. Van Der Beek trusted his audience to figure that out for themselves, and it only made his performance funnier.It also led to one of the most bafflingly brilliant talkshow appearances of all time,when Van Der Beek appeared on The Eric Andre Show in 2013. Halfway through the interview Andre brought out doppelgangers of both of them, and Van Der Beek’s quiet confusion as the encounter collapsed into a nightmarish feedback loop remains the high point of the series.This was all built from Dawson’s Creek, which gave him a platform from which to subsequently warp and twist his persona. But the fact that Van Der Beek managed to cover such a huge spectrum of roles in such a short space of time proves what an undeniable talent he was.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

The 28-year-old Australian actor has scarcely been out of the headlines since hiscontroversial castingin Emerald Fennell’s imminent adaptation of Wuthering Heights. Now, in the week of the film’s release, he’s beinghailedas “the hottest man on the planet”, tipped as a future Oscar winner and household name. Not even mixed early reviews seem to be slowing the momentum.Truly, these heights must seem wuthering to the boy from Brisbane who fell in love with actingafter being castas The Cat in The Hat. “As soon as I was singing and dancing with the big hat on, I knew that that was what I wanted to do,” Elordi said last December. But who is he, and what’s behind his rapid rise?He’s a generation’s go-to crush …Heathcliff might be Elordi’s highest-profile performance to date, but Gen Z has grown up with him on their screens and there’s a case to be made he’s their defining heart-throb. Elordi’s breakout role was in Netflix’s hugely popular Kissing Booth films, in which he played the teenage protagonist’s respectful older love interest Noah Flynn between 2018 and 2021. At the same time, Elordi starred in HBO’s edgy, sex-and-drugs teen drama Euphoria as toxic jock Nate Jacobs. The contrasting roles not only showcased Elordi’s range, but set him up to be a generational crush whether your tastes ran to good guys or bad boys. He is also, famously, 6ft 5in.… but also a serious actorLike Robert Pattinson with Twilight, Elordi has distanced himself from his breakout franchise,panningThe Kissing Booth films as “ridiculous … [and] not universal”, while claiming he “didn’t want to make” them. (Elordi’s co-star – and former girlfriend – Joey King said his comments were “unfortunate”.) Again, like Pattinson, Elordi sought to shake off his teen pin-up image with dark, challenging roles, playing a serial killer in 2023’s He Went That Way and a murdered piano teacher in 2022’s erotic thriller Deep Water. Critics finally took note after Elordi was cast as Elvis in Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla. CoppolasaidElordi and Elvis had a similar “effect on women”: “I mean, he’s striking – so tall.”View image in fullscreenTeen pin-up … Elordi as Noah Flynn in The Kissing Booth 2.Photograph: Marcos Cruz/NetflixHe’snotjusttall. He can also readElordi’s last big role was playing Frankenstein’s monster in Guillermo del Toro’s 2025 film for Netflix – suggesting he’s still battling against the perception of him as really, really good-looking. Good luck, Jacob! Elordi’s appeal is not just that he’s tall, though that cannot be underestimated. He’s alsodeep, as evinced by his frequent name-checking of books. In an educationalinterview with Bustlein 2024, Elordi said he was an “enormous Kerouac fan”, a “huge Sartre fan”, that reading The Odyssey was a “massive joy” and he loved “Shakespeare more than anything”. Donna Tartt also got a look-in, with Elordi declaring of The Secret History: “I believe it to be her best work.” In the same interview, “a bespectacled” Elordi admitted to being “a Moleskine guy” and keeping a notebook for every character he played. He was also at work on some paintings, though he demurred from showing or even describing them to the interviewer: “I worry I might jeopardise what I get out of them.” Paparazzi pictures of Elordi browsing airport bookshops – and, once, carrying a paperback in the lower pocket of his cargo pants – have sent social media into a frenzy. (“I am going feral,”commentedone X user.) If you were being churlish, you could infer that Elordi is the archetypal “performative male” – an archetype widely mocked on social media for their pretentious cultural signalling – but it seems being really, really good-looking gives you a pass.…andhe’s Australian!Also central to Elordi’s appeal is that he is not American, having been born in Brisbane and grown up between there and Melbourne. As such, he is a breath of fresh air in Hollywood. Elordi himself has stressed the cultural differences. “If Australians are like freshwater fish, Americans are saltwater fish,” hetold GQ in 2023. “It kind of looks the same. The water is water, you’re swimming around, but you can’t breathe.” He gave the example of ordering a coffee, “like a standoff” in Los Angeles compared to the “sacred”, easy “mateship” of Australia. That’s not to say it’s always been smooth sailing down under. “From the moment I did a play I was called gay at school,” Elordisaid in a different interview.He rose above it, he added. “I was never worried that my peers would think I was less than a man … I’m spending my weekends with the most beautiful women from the school next door, reading the most romantic words ever written.”View image in fullscreenElordi, bottom left, with Richard E Grant, Archie Madekwe, Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike and Alison Oliver in Saltburn (2023).Photograph: BFA/AlamyHe has a complicated relationship with fameAs much as Elordi has striven to be known for his work and love of literature, he hasn’t been able to dodge the shabby world of celebrity entirely. In the past he’s been romantically linked to his Euphoria co-star Zendaya, Cindy Crawford’s model daughter Kaia Gerber and Olivia Jade, the YouTuber who was infamously involved in the2019 US college admissions scandal. The scrutiny of his personal life and “new-world version of fame … can pain Elordi,” as the GQ interviewer put it. Elordi earned two Bafta nominations for his star-making turn as Felix, a young aristocrat, in Fennell’s 2023 film Saltburn, but his performance was overshadowed by a scene in which Barry Keoghan’s character lustfully drinks Felix’s bathwater. The online furore inspired bootleg merchandise including “Jacob Elordi’s bathwater” and Lush’s “salty, milky” bath bomb. Elordi laughed it off on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, but was later involved in an “incident” with an Australian radio producer who filmed himself asking Elordi for his bathwater. When the man refused to delete the footage, Elordi allegedly pushed him against the wall and grabbed his throat.Police were reportedto be investigating the incident in February 2024, but nothing’s come of it since.Now he’s HeathcliffGiven the scrutiny he received after Saltburn, Elordi has admitted to having second thoughts about returning to Fennell for Wuthering Heights. “Saltburn grew into this thing I didn’t really plan for,” hetold Vogue Australia. “There is this feeling of having to swing for the fences again.” By all accounts, Wuthering Heights only dials up the social media bait and over-the-top eroticism, with the first half of the filmdescribedas “essentially 60 minutes of foreplay”. His co-star and fellow Australian Margot Robbie has certainly been keen to emphasise Elordi as a draw, describing the screening she threw for her friends as “the most unhinged experience” of her life”.View image in fullscreenDark and moody … Elordi as Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: AP“Twenty women were like frothing at the mouth,” shetoldto Jimmy Kimmel. “They were like rabid dogs … when Jacob came on screen, I think it registered on the Richter scale; they screamed so loud.” Later pressed for his response to this anecdote,Elordi hedged(“I don’t know. What do you say to that?”) before eventually allowing that Robbie and her friends were “intense”. Elordi was a controversial choice for Heathcliff, not least because the character is stated in Emily Brontë’s novel to have dark skin. Fennell defended her casting bysayingthat Elordi “looked exactly like the illustration of Heathcliff on the first book that I read”. But even Elordi, it seems, was not immediately convinced. He told Vogue Australia that, for the first three weeks of making the film, he felt “the greatest amount of doubt” he had experienced thus far in his career. “It was the first time I’d been like, ‘I don’t know if I’m good enough’.” His breakthrough came when he realised that he was holding on to the character “so tightly”, Elordi continued. “Like, it’s Heathcliff. It has to be Heathcliff.” Well, sure.

Thousands of police had surrounded the community’sbarricaded entrancesand were preparing to swarm up its streets on foot and in black armoured personnel carriers with firing ports and bullet-cracked ballistic windows.Clouds of smoke fouled the dawn air as drug traffickers torched tyres and cars and opened fire from above.“It was like the shooting was inside our house … like we were in the middle of a war,” said Conceição, who sheltered indoors as her neighbourhood became a battleground.By nightfall, the father of her six children, Ronaldo Julião da Silva, would lie dead in a nearby alley – one of 122 people killed in the deadliest police operation in Brazilian history. Five of the victims were police.View image in fullscreenJuliana Conceição, whose ex-husband, Ronaldo Julião da Silva, was one of those shot dead during the police operation in the Complexo da Penha. Relatives insist he was not involved in crime.Photograph: Alan Lima/The Guardian“It happened just down here,” Conceição said 10 days after the 17-hour raid, as she led the way down the passageway where her ex-husband was found, his skull and hand shredded by gunfire.View image in fullscreenAna Beatriz shows a photograph of her father, Ronaldo Julião da Silva, 46, taken shortly before he was shot dead.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianShe carried a yellow certificate attributing Silva’s death – a day after his 46th birthday – to “cerebral and cardiac laceration [caused by] perforating blunt force”.The bricklayer’s place of death was given as Saint Luke Square, the plaza at the foot of the favela where scores of bodies were dumped after police withdrew. But his life actually ended half a mile away, as he tried to reach his home on the favela’s southern rim. “My dad wasn’t a crook. My dad was a worker,” said his 20-year-old daughter, Ana Beatriz, wiping tears from her eyes.Three months after the carnage of 28 October, many questions remain about Operation Containment, an incursion police chiefs and rightwing politicians celebrated as a historic blow to one of Brazil’s biggest organised crime groups – the Rio-born Red Command drug faction – but which activists, security experts, and even Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,have called a futile massacre.In more than two dozen interviews with community leaders, lawyers, security specialists and bereaved relatives, the Guardian pieced together the story of thebloodiest day in Rio’s modern history.The investigation found that:Of the 117 non-police fatalities, at least one person was not involved in crime, despite official claims that all those killed were traffickers.The list of 100 arrest warrants justifying the operation featured none of the names of those 117 people.In a sign of the Red Command’s rapid spread around Brazil, the majority of those killed were from regions outside Rio such as the Amazon states of Amazonas and Pará, the north-east and midwest.Police refused to disclose the race of those killed but relatives, journalists and sources with knowledge of the forensic investigation said the vast majority were black, reinforcing research showing police violence disproportionately affects Afro-Brazilians.Tracking ‘the Bear’View image in fullscreenLt Kelly Patricia Camara da Silva’s photo of herself at the Bear’s lair.Photograph: Courtesy of Lieutenant Kelly Patricia Camara da SilvaWhen Lt Kelly Patricia Camara da Silva, a 30-year-old member of a specialist high-risk military police unit called the Shock Battalion, woke at 3am on 28 October she had no idea she was about to face the most dangerous undertaking of her three-year career.After 60 days of planning and a year’s investigation, police were preparing to launch a massive assault on the Complexo da Penha, which along with the neighbouring Complexo do Alemão, is considered the Red Command’s “national headquarters”.One hundred arrest warrants had been issued, but the prime target was the local drug boss Edgar Alves de Andrade, AKA “the Bear”.Map of Rio de Janeiro showing Complexo do Penha and Complexo do AlemaoPolice estimated the area was guarded by 800-1,000 traffickers armed with automatic rifles, explosives and grenade-launching drones. To outnumber them, 2,500 officers would be deployed – at least twice as many as in past operations.Silva was the only woman commanding a unit that day and her seven-strong team was among the first groups to enter the Complexo da Penha at about 5am. Their task was climbing the favela’s steep, narrow alleyways to contain armed resistance so colleagues could follow and make arrests.“The higher you go, the riskier it gets,” said Silva, whose target was Vila Cruzeiro, one of 13 communities forming the complex. “These favelas are on hillsides so when we’re at the bottom, we can’t see anything – but [the traffickers] have a full view of us from above.”Barricades blocked almost every route in the Complexo da PenhaBarricades blocked almost every route. Where armoured vehicles could no longer advance, police continued on foot.As Silva’s team progressed past murals honouring fallen Red Command members, many of the Bear’s foot soldiers melted into the bush above the community, apparently hoping to flee to safety in Alemão by crossing the Serra da Misericórdia, the Hill of Mercy, a vast rocky massif covered in Atlantic rainforest.At about 6.50am, dozens of heavily armed criminals wearing black or camouflage outfits almost identical to police uniforms werefilmedclimbing a concrete staircase into a scrubland area known as Vacaria that is part of the Hill of Mercy. Most of them would never be seen alive again.Heavily-armed criminals wearing black or camouflage outfits climb into a scrubland area known as Vacaria‘We’re surrounded!’At around the same time, Erivelton Vidal Correia, a community leader, took advantage of a lull in the shooting and rushed to Vila Cruzeiro’s neighbourhood association near Saint Luke Square.Outside, huddles of women – the mothers, sisters and partners of men involved in the local drug trade – had gathered seeking news. As the battle raged, Correia served coffee and comforted the women as their phones filled with WhatsApp messages from their besieged loved ones:We’re surrounded! We’re trapped! The police are here! See if you can come and find us!One of those looking for her child was Tauã Brito, a 36-year-old salesperson, whose 20-year-old son, Wellington Brito Santos, was hiding in the forest.Brito had raised Santos with help from her grandmother. “I’m a black woman from the favela struggling to raise her kids,” she said. “I always tried to do my best … within my financial situation.”View image in fullscreenErivelton Vidal Correia, a community leader in Vila Cruzeiro, one of 13 favelas that make up the Complexo da Penha.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianBut four years ago Santos joined the gang – and it was he who warned his mother of the police’s arrival. “The operation has started,” he texted her at 4.45am.Ten minutes later she replied, urging him to pray and remember Psalm 91. “Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence,” it says. “He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge.”“Yes Mum,” Santos wrote back.Soon after, Santos was one of the traffickers filmed climbing the staircase towards Vacaria. “You need to get it together,” his mother texted as he hid in the scrub. “I know mum,” he replied at 7.23am.“It feels like I’m going to have a heart attack, Wellington. You don’t need this,” she went on, suggesting they leave the favela and start afresh. “I want to turn 21,” he said.The last message Brito received came an hour later, at 8.22am. “I’m OK. Stay calm Mum,” Santos said.“I’m praying non-stop,” she answered. There was no reply.View image in fullscreenTauã Brito shows the last messages she exchanged with her son, Wellington, before he was killed during the police operation on 28 October. ‘I’m praying non-stop,’ she tells him at 8.59am. There is no reply.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianThe wallAs they took flight across the Hill of Mercy, Wellington and his companions didn’t know there was no way out.Under the cover of darkness, dozens of officers from the elite military police unit Bope – whose troops are called “skulls” for their dagger-pierced skull insignia – had climbed the mountain from the other side.Wearing fluorescent green armbands to distinguish themselves from the traffickers, they took up position at the summit hoping to solve a problem they had faced in dozens of previous operations: whenever police entered Alemão or Penha, the traffickers would simply flee through the forest to other side.Map of the Complexo do Penha and Complexo do Alemao, with positions of barricades, police and criminalsPreviously, police commanders had judged occupying the Hill of Mercy too risky. That day, for the first time, they decided to change tactics.As planned, Sgt Jorge Martins’s team reached the hilltop at dawn to form “a wall”. “But sometimes things don’t always go the way we imagine,” he said.As clusters of traffickers and police did battle on different parts of the mount, the situation began to spiral out of control.At about 8.20am, a member of the dog unit was shot in the leg near a cluster of shacks known as the Promised Land.An hour later, a group of civil police officers were attacked as they chased a group of traffickers into Vacaria. One officer was shot in the hand. A second in the belly. A third in the head.The Bope team abandoned their positions to rescue their colleagues. “When we got there, that’s when things really started to heat up,” Martins said.From then on, “it stopped being an operation to execute warrants and became a full-scale rescue mission”, the Bope commander, Lt Col Marcelo Corbage, later told the public prosecutor’s office.View image in fullscreenAt the headquarters of Rio’s civil police, weapons seized at the house where a resident was taken hostage by 26 traffickers.Photograph: Courtesy of Lieutenant Kelly Patricia Camara da Silva‘Welcome to the jungle’Not far away, Silva’s team had reached part of the favela called Cabaré, just outside the forest, which investigators believed housed one of the Bear’s main strongholds – a place they called his “lair”.In a sign “the lair” was nearby, Silva spotted a mural showing a rifle-toting bear in a bulletproof vest and the warning: “Welcome to the jungle.” She took a selfie. “We knew it was a very hot area, that something could happen there.”Map of the Complexo do Penha. Points show where a police officer was shot and where rifle casing were foundAt about 9.40am it did. Word reached Silva’s team that aresidenthad been taken hostage by 26 traffickers who had stormed her home. Police shot one man dead and Silva began negotiating with the rest, even though her team was badly outnumbered – 14 officers versus 25 criminals. “I don’t think they really understood what was happening … If they’d realised they might have an advantage, the situation could have changed.”Fearing execution, the men forced the homeowner to record theirsurrender. “You can come out, you’re not going to die … no one’s going to shoot,” an officer claimed as a cameramanfilmedthe scene. One by one, shirtless young men emerged and were arrested.Chaos in the woodsBut up on the Hill of Mercy, the gunfire never stopped. “You hear the shots, try to locate them, but then fire comes from the other side and, even with training, you get disoriented and can’t process it,” said Martins.At 4pm, his team ran into a group of traffickers as they advanced through the forest. Martins was struck in the calf and a colleague in the leg. “I thought: ‘If I got hit, the guy can see me.’ So I threw myself down a slope with my colleague and we rolled … It was a serious wound but I thought: ‘I’m not going to die from this one,’” he said.Both men were eventually rescued by an armoured ambulance and survived but two other Bope officers died from gunshot wounds. Three civil police officers also died while 14 police officers were injured. Never before in Rio had so many police been killed or wounded in a single operation. Most were hit on the Hill of Mercy – as were the vast majority of civilians killed.A source close to the investigation questioned police claims that all those killed in the forest died resisting arrest. “If what the police say is true – that they were dealing with criminals who knew the area extremely well, who were hidden and entrenched – how is it possible that … despite the considerable number of officers killed, the number of dead criminals is so disproportionately higher?” they asked.The source could not rule out a story circulating in the favela that, after rescuing their wounded and retrieving their dead, police killed every trafficker they could find on the hill as an act of revenge. The police vehemently deny this account.View image in fullscreenVera Julião da Silva standing on the veranda where she last saw her brother Ronaldo Julião da Silva, shortly before he was shot dead.Photograph: Alan Lima/The Guardian‘Ronaldo’s dead’Ronaldo Julião da Silva, a bricklayer, had spent nearly the whole day at the house of his sister, Vera. He feared being found at home by police and confused with a trafficker, with possibly fatal consequences. “Whenever there’s an operation he comes here to sleep,” said Vera, recalling how Silva passed the time chain-smoking on her roof.At around 4pm Silva’s niece photographed her uncle on the veranda and sent his daughter the picture to show he was safe.By about 7pm – more than 12 hours after the operation began – the shooting had subsided and Silva set off towards his house, near the edge of the forest, about five minutes’ walk away.“He left and didn’t come back,” said Vera, 49, standing on the terrace where she last saw him. Residents say police shot Silva dead in an alley about 500 metres from his home. A friend broke the news to relatives: “Ronaldo’s dead.”Authorities have insisted all of the 117 fatalities were criminals. “The only victims were police,” Rio’s rightwing governor, Cláudio Castro,told journalists. In a report submitted to the supreme court, police called those killed “neutralised opponents”.View image in fullscreenA protest against the police operation in Rio de Janeiro and in protest against Governor Cláudio Castro in São Paulo on 31 October 2025.Photograph: Cris Faga/ShutterstockBut Silva’s relatives are adamant he was not involved in crime. None of the 117 people killed were on the arrest warrant list justifying the operation. Even if they had been, Brazil does not have the death penalty.Police later admitted 17 of those killed – including Silva – had no criminal record but claimed there were “indications” some were involved in crime. One man had posted ared triangle emojisupposedly symbolising the Red Command. Another had posted nothing since 2022, something officers took as proof of evidence concealment.Of the operation’s 100 arrest warrants, only 17 were executed. The Bear remains at large.Chart showing how Red Command has been in control of increasing amounts of territory in Rio de Janeiro citySearching for the deadAs the last police vehicle was filmed leaving the favela at about 10pm, local women began hiking into the forest to find their men. Many hailed from the Amazon state of Pará, more than 1,200 miles (2,000km) to Rio’s north, which has become a major Red Command base because of its strategic location on one of South America’s most important cocaine smuggling routes.Correia, the community leader, joined the searchers as they entered Vacaria, using mobile phone flashlights to navigate the boulder-strewn bush.Local men and women in the forest look for their menAlmost immediately, they started seeing bullet-riddled bodies, many with horrific injuries. One 19-year-old, later named as Yago Ravel Rodrigues, had been decapitated, his head displayed on a tree.“The women were shouting, they cried – and they were focused. The more [bodies] they found, the more they pushed on and the more they found,” said Correia, recalling how searchers relied on moonlight when their phone batteries died.Tauã Brito was there and, at just after 1am, found her son near the stairway the traffickers were filmed climbing. “He’d been stabbed in the arm and shot in the head,” she said. One arm had a cord attached to it, as if his hands had been bound.Map of Penha and times and locations of where the first bodies were recoveredAll night long, corpses were hauled out in sheets and stretchers. Pickups ferried them to Saint Luke Square, where they were placed on tarpaulins outside Correia’s office.Some wore camouflaged ghillie suits, which locals cut off and discarded in a wheelie bin. Ronaldo Julião da Silva sported the same red shorts he was wearing when last seen alive.View image in fullscreenA photograph of Michel Peçanha, 14, the youngest of the 117 people shot dead by police during the Complexo da Penha raid.Photograph: Alan LimaThe dead included 14-year-old Michel Peçanha, who a family friend said had worked selling sweetcorn to tourists on Copacabana beach before joining the gang a few months earlier. “He wasn’t some kind of narco-terrorist,” insisted Edson Soares, a preacher who knows Peçanha’s father. “He didn’t even know how to shoot a gun.”By 9am, more than 60 bodies lay there and broken-hearted women sat cradling the heads of their broken men.“It’s evil. They kill for pleasure,” Tauã Brito said of the police as she guarded her son’s corpse. “They don’t do anything for the kids or for the community. This is all they know how to do.”‘An infinite war’View image in fullscreenRecovered bodies at the entrance of the Vila Cruzeiro favela.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianThe activists in Vila Cruzeiro that morning voiced outrage at the bloodbath, even more lethal than 1992’sCarandiru prison massacrein São Paulo when 111 inmates died. Many demanded the removal of Governor Castro, who has overseen three of Rio’s deadliest police operations since taking power in 2020.The former police chief Orlando Zaccone claimed the operation showed how the longstanding but illegal police tactic of “Trojan horse” attacks – where officers ambush targets from buildings, cars or trees – was now official policy. “The objective wasn’t to execute arrest warrants. The objective was to kill armed traffickers,” Zaccone said, something police deny.Tauã Brito and others also question why their loved ones were killed, not arrested. “The aim was to kill everyone who tried to escape – and that’s exactly what was done. All of those boys were executed,” said Brito, who recently left the favela and moved to a beach town 100 miles away hoping to escape her pain. “There isn’t a single place in Penha where I don’t remember my son, where I don’t see Wellington,” she said, tears rolling down her cheeks. “A piece of me is missing.”In the weeks after the operation, it became clear the purge had strengthened Rio’s governor, with polls suggesting widespread public support.The civil police chief, Felipe Curi, claimed favela residents were crying out for more such operations. Curi, who was shot in Alemão in 2016, insisted the officers had acted in self-defence. Curi also claimed, without proof, that traffickers had decapitated Yago Ravel Rodrigues “to incriminate the police”.View image in fullscreenCida Santana, the mother of one of the dead men, mourns after bodies are brought to Vila Cruzeiro.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianSo far at least nine police officers have been charged over alleged offences on the day of the operation, including stealing a rifle, car parts and a mobile phone. Five of them have been arrested.The public prosecutor’s office is still investigating other possible police crimes – a challenge since, despite all officers being legally required to wear body cameras during operations, fewer than half were. Even so, there are about 3,000 hours of footage to review.The late civil rights lawyerPaul Chevigny, a pioneer in the study of police brutality, argued that when civilian deaths outnumber those of officers by 10 or 15 to one, it is an “almost unequivocal” statistical sign that lethal force is being used punitively, not defensively. In Penha, the ratio was 23 to one. “This is a disparity that raises serious concern,” said Paulo Roberto Mello Cunha, one of the prosecutors investigating police conduct.“The police’s purposeis not to ‘neutralise’ people, but to arrest criminals,” Cunha added. “We will only be able to call the operation a success if I can state that all who died were in situations in which officers acted in legitimate self-defence.”Authorities called the operation the greatest blow to the Red Command since it was founded in the 1970s in an Alcatraz-style prison nicknamed the “Cauldron of Hell”, although a police intelligence chiefconcededit would have a “minuscule” impact.When the Guardian returned to the Complexo da Penha a fortnight after the shootings, there was no sign of change. The gunmen were back. The barricades rebuilt. Drugs were on sale. Red Command signs ordering residents not to drop litter adorned the streets. Across Rio, the faction still rules hundreds of other favelas, controllingan areaalmost the size of Sheffield or Washington DC.While the bodies have been removed from outside his office, Correia was still processing what he called the most traumatic day in his 48 years of favela life.The community leader was certain of one thing: Rio’s conflict would never end. “You kill 100 traffickers and tomorrow another 100 will appear. Four police die today and tomorrow there will be four more in their place,” he said. “It’s an infinite war.”View image in fullscreenTauã Brito in the beach town she has relocated to after leaving the favela where her son, Wellington Brito Santos, was killed in October’s operation.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianAdditional reporting by Melissa Cannabrava in Rio de JaneiroExplore more on these topicsBrazilRio de JaneiroAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, I have an entire loft room in my house dedicated to storing all my X-rated testers, samples and prototypes. I’m a trustworthy source when it comes to sauciness, so here are my top Valentine’s gift suggestions, whether mild or wild – all tried and tested. From a turmeric latte massage bar to a crotchless teddy, let’s get stuck in.The best sex toys and gifts for Valentine’s DaySex toysView image in fullscreenLelo Sona 3 Cruisesonicclitoralmassager£134.99 at LoveHoney£139 at LeloLelo is known for making ultra-chic, top-quality products that pack in a lorry load of features. Like previous versions, this latest edition of their Sona Cruise model is waterproof, rechargeable and uses pulsing sonic waves – rather than vibrations – to stimulate the clitoris. It retains the “Cruise Control” function, too, which holds back 20% of the device’s power during normal use, unleashing it only when you press hard against your body for an extra shot of oomph.So, what’s changed? Lelo has introduced SmoothRise technology, which sees the Sona 3 Cruise glide fluidly between its 12 intensity settings rather than abruptly change gear in a way that jolts you out of your reverie. And you can now pilot the toy via an app as well, with two new app-only patterns: “Finish Me Off” gradually builds to an almost agonisingly intense climax, while “Out Of Control” provides unpredictable speed shifts to prevent playtime becoming overfamiliar.View image in fullscreenVacation Vibesthe Aspen G-spotvibrator£70 at AnthropologieFemale-founded Aussie brand Vacation Vibes makes toys intended to channel the blissful escapism of a holiday, without the hassle of lost luggage or sunburn. They’re named after popular destinations – the Amalfi, the Miami, the Saint-Tropez – and come packaged in very giftable picture-postcard boxes.Like the ski resort from which it takes its inspiration, the Aspen features a crisp, white peak, shaped to stimulate the G-area, which is 1-3 inches up on the front vaginal wall. A lot of G-spot probes are rigid and hard, to facilitate the firm pressure that this part of the body tends to respond well to, but that also means they can poke and prod uncomfortably. The Aspen has lots of flex, meaning you can “stir” it inside yourself, creating an orgasmic feeling to (al)pine for.View image in fullscreenJe Joue ILYPebblevibrator£31.99 at Je Joue£45.28 at AmazonJe Joue’s ILY range is aimed at beginner sex-toy users, so if you and your partner are only just starting to dip your toe into the world of vibrators, this is a good one. It’s delightfully soft and squishy – like a mochi – with a versatile shape that can be laid flat against the skin, held like a pen for pinpoint stimulation, or used lengthways on its side (which feels great nestled between the labia with the legs closed – again, a nice, gentle, introductory position for beginners). It’s rechargeable; has three speeds and seven patterns; and emits much more rumbly, low-frequency vibrations than a lot of other toys of this style and size. These types of vibes travel deeper into the body, awakening more nerve endings, and giving a more enveloping sense of arousal.Top tip: I found that after a while of holding it, the Pebble started to make my fingers feel a bit overly buzzy and fuzzy. Experiment with sitting or laying on it if your hand starts getting the judders.View image in fullscreenLovense Lover Set£199 at LovenseWith £499’s worth of goodies for £199, this set offers brilliant bang for your buck, although you will have to invest a little time to set up and learn how the most techie toys in the box work. The kit contains a stretchy, textured masturbation sleeve, a feather tickler, a satin blindfold and a pair of wrist cuffs. However, the big-ticket items here are the Lush 4 and Gush 2: respectively, a wearable egg-shaped G-spot vibrator for her, and a hands-free vibrating penis massager for him. Both can be remotely controlled from anywhere via the Lovense app, making them a boon for couples who live apart or frequently travel separately.The list of things these toys can do is so lengthy that Tolstoy would raise his eyebrows at it. The Gush 2 has a stamina training option to help you edge your way to sustaining longer erections. You can even programme it to react along as you play video games. The Lush 4 can be set to react to music or voice commands; with a 36dB buzz, it’s quiet; and just five minutes of charge gives you an hour of play, which is frankly outstanding. With so much to explore, the Lovense set will keep you contentedly busy for ages.View image in fullscreenAnn Summersheart glitterdildo£25 at Ann Summers£25 at SuperdrugThe adult toy industry’s movement away from products that resemble genitalia towards more sculptural, less screamingly explicit gadgets has largely been heralded as a positive evolution. However, it means that the people who activelylikerealistic, anatomical toys can feel ostracised. There’s nothing regressive or gross about enjoying toys that look like actual penises, vulvas or bums rather than amorphous orbs.For special FX-level convincing penis toys in a host of skin tones, some of which feature sliding skin for a true-to-life flesh feel, check outRealdick. Alternatively, if you’re after a dildo with a realistic shape but a fun finish, this firm yet flexible transparent Ann Summers offering contains a sprinkling of heart-shaped glittery confetti. The suction cup at the base allows it to be attached to surfaces such as tiled bathroom walls, mirrors or wooden chairs.View image in fullscreenChakrubsrosequartzdildo£118 at Free People£130 at SheSpotCrafted from crystals and mineraloids, Chakrubs tools are truly stunning, and would make an impeccably classy present. They look like precious ancient temple artefacts that you might see in the British Museum.Despite their gorgeousness, I harboured stone-cold cynicism towards crystalline toys for a long time. I worried certain types might be porous, thus able to harbour bacteria that may render them unsafe for intimate use. Additionally, some crystal probes were marketed alongside claims that their “spiritual vibrations” could “heal sexual trauma”, which I feared could lead to the manipulation or endangerment of survivors of sexual assault or anguish.Chakrubs met my concerns with reasonable answers. “Our researchers from the Gemological Institute of America inform us that rose quartz, clear quartz and amethyst are non-porous, while other crystals may be porous or have ‘closed porosity’, meaning that pores lie on the surface of the stone where any bacteria within them can be hygienically washed away, rather than seeping deeper towards the centre,” it says. In addition, it states that the company “has never claimed that crystals themselves heal trauma or act as a cure”. Chakrubsdoposit that personally meaningful sexual rituals and meditative experiences with beautiful objects can prove beneficial to some individuals. Fair enough. Rock on.Scents, lubes and lustful liquidsView image in fullscreenTwinkle Tongue saliva enhancer gel$35.88 (about £26.20) at Twinkle TongueTasting like an intensely sour cherry smoothie, Twinkle Tongue claims to boost saliva flow by up to eight times. Its key ingredients include tangy citrus extracts and tingle-inducing Spilanthes flower (also used inFlintts Mintsoral dryness treatments – as I featured in myguide to spicing up your sex life). Within seconds of swishing a sip of the gel around my mouth, I was dribbling as though Pavlov was playing a bell symphony right there in my bedroom. I’m not sure how I can put this politely, but this stuff is awesome.View image in fullscreenBorntostandout Cuvée Skin eau de toilette, 100ml£163.40 at 50 mlSeoul-based gender-neutral perfume house Borntostandout makes heady sex-inspired fragrances, with names such asFig Porn,Drunk LoversandFilthy Musk. Its recently releasedEau Intimécollection comprises a suite of practically pornographic scents that might be the brand’s sauciest yet. Cuvée Skin was blended to smell like champagne spilled on nude flesh.Warm Airdraws from the scent of a couple’s body heat as they move in sync. Finally,Musc X– a moniker that suggests an unfortunately sour whiff of Elon for me, even though the perfume itself smells amazing – represents the aftermath: the lingering tones of a lover on clothes and sheets after their departure. These are perfumes that enter through the nose but travel straight to the groin. Wear if you dare.View image in fullscreenLushSex Bomband Turmeric Lattemassagebars£10 at LushMassage without mess. Warm one of Lush’s bars between your palms, then slide it over your beloved’s bod to slick them with Fair Trade cocoa and shea butters. If you can’t stand the oily rings massage oil bottles inevitably leave on your bedside cabinet or the oiliness of your sheets post-rub down, these solid slabs of slipperiness are for you. TheSex Bombscent is a classic, woozy with jasmine and ylang-ylang, but my current favourite is Turmeric Latte, redolent of tonka bean, vanilla and spice. Graba £3 tinto sling your bar in for storage and travel.View image in fullscreenEris Parfums Delta of Venus eau de parfum, 50ml£145 at BootsThis perfume borrows its name from a book of erotic short stories authored by Anaïs Nin in the 1940s, for a private client she referred to only as “Collector”. It’s certainly a scent worth adding to your own collection, or that of your sweetheart, particularly if you’re seeking something tropical and fruity yet strictly for grownups. The key note is guava, surrounded by lush greenery, and it’s apparently inspired by Eve sinking her teeth into forbidden fruit amid the leaves and vines of the Garden of Eden. Imagine being French-kissed with a mouth full of exotic juice, in a naked sauna held within a greenhouse – a spritz of this will take you there.View image in fullscreenSlyde Body Intimacy Elixir andluxuryoilset, 30ml each£49.95 at SheSpotSlyde’s water-based, condom-friendly Intimacy Elixir – AKA lube – is noteworthy for how natural it appears. Odourless and scent-free, it starts with the consistency of egg whites, forming fine strings and strands if you pinch it between your fingers: a good sign that it has sufficient viscosity to stay wherever you want to put it, yet it’s not sticky at all. It comes in a stylish, dainty glass bottle that you could confidently display on your nightstand, without fearing that it will announce itself as sex goo.It’s intended to be used in small amounts, so if you requirelashingsof lubrication, this probably isn’t for you. Similarly, the massage oil won’t last long if you’re ladling it on to your lover’s back. Infused with peppermint, lavender and lime, it works best stroked on to pulse points, or for “micro massage”: focus on caressing your partner’s inner wrists, hands, or reflex points on the ears, and see how honing attention on one tiny area can help you tune in to sensations.Jewellery that speaks your love languageView image in fullscreenCrave Vesper 2 rose gold vibrator necklace£185 at Coco de MerA chain that truly knows how to provoke a reaction. This 26in-long pendant looks like a modern, minimalist design, but its ostensible simplicity hides a secret: it’s actually an ultra-slimline steel vibrator, with three intensity options and a wave mode. It’s USB rechargeable and can safely be submerged in the bath or shower. A real pleasure treasure.View image in fullscreenStudiocult heart-shaped carabiner clip earring£27 at StudiocultOver the decades, wearing a carabiner clip has become a subtle signifier of your identity as a lesbian or WLW (Woman who Loves Women).Some folks feel that “lesbians = practical and masc” is an outdated stereotype. Others view carabiners as a fun, harmless and handy sign of sapphism, and a form of self-expression.

Or rather, prevent them from saying it with flowers. This gag is sized to be comfortable inside the mouth, and the smooth silicone means it won’t knock against teeth. It’s vented, with a hole running through the centre to make breathing easier, but you should also ensure you and your playmate agree a non-verbal “safe sign” together – three quick taps on a nearby surface; ringing a bell; or squeezing a squeaky toy, say – before you experiment with any type of gag, as the person wearing it won’t be able to clearly pronounce a safe word.The first few times you try out this gag, the wearer might feel reassured if the vegan leather strap is fastened loosely enough (or left unbuckled) so that they can spit the toy out should they wish. There’s no need to rush, and BDSM is all about respect – to submissives as well as dominants.View image in fullscreenSatisfyer 2 Pro Modern Blossom clitoral stimulator£33.95 at Satisfyer£17.99 at AmazonThe original Rose Toy – an air-pulse clitoral stimulator shaped like a flower bud – was a massive viral hit on TikTok. The pioneering model wasn’t manufactured by a recognised brand, but it proved immensely popular for its sweet, unobtrusive look, and its ability to cause climaxes with similar speed and reliability as a toaster popping out hot crumpets. The Rose spawned whole fields of floral imitations, and now, companies have also started adding their own innovations to differentiate themselves.Satisfyer’s waterproof take comes with two interchangeable caps that fit on the top: one for the standard air-pulse suction feeling you might well already know and love, while the second gives a sensation they call “Liquid Air”, which mimics the feeling of surging pulses of water.

It says that too many unsold stems end up being trashed, so in its effort to reduce waste – and promote more considered, original blooms – this year B&W has produced a less Valentine’s-centric arrangement called the Cathy, named after the protagonist in Wuthering Heights and created to celebrate Emerald Fennell’s adaptation. It sports antique pink and burning orange roses, along with the type of wild flora and foliage you might find out on the wily, windy moors.View image in fullscreenPiper-Heidsieckrosésauvagechampagne, 75cl£55.25 at The Whisky Exchange£52.95 at Hard to Find WhiskyView image in fullscreenFour Roses small batch bourbon with rose-shaped ice moulds£41.99 at Selfridges£36.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenCygnet Infinity alcohol-free botanical spirit£31.99 at Drink Supermarket£32 at Master of MaltChampagne is to Valentine’s Day what mulled wine is to Christmas, and Piper-Heidsieck’s rosé blend undercuts its blood orangey sweetness with teasing hints of smoke and liquorice.

But there were solid reasons why those in the know bought into this Brooklyn indie brand early. For starters, the embroidery is both sumptuous and unusual, with motifs such as tentacles, dragons, and cathedral architecture. Where nude mesh is involved, it’s available in a range of skin tones, from milky to melanated. The size range is expansive; models are diverse; and the brand has recently diversified into making sexy “Panties for Packages” for guys and people with penises.The Chanterelle body features the glittering gills of bronze and navy mushrooms, and – if you look closely – pairs of legs. It’s magic.View image in fullscreenClipher clip-off thongs£10 at ClipherThese thongs have a pair of heart-shaped clips on the waistband to make them easier to remove.

Take off your garments in your own time – struggling, straining and wobbling however much you need to, and only opening the door a tiny bit to teasingly drop your shed clothing piece by piece. Only once you’re naked, composed, and have struck a pose, open the door fully. You’ve stripped. You’ve teased.

In November, Rainbow Wool paired with gay hook up and social app Grindr to produce a fabulous 37-piece “I Wool Survive” fashion collection – but the pieces are one-offs that will be auctioned to the highest bidders.

This week has seen a clear-out of some of Starmer’s closest advisers, including his chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney, as he sought to regain his grip on his party.Starmer was again forced on the defensive on Wednesday, saying that his former communications chief, Matthew Doyle, “did not give a full account of his actions” before being nominated for a peerage, after it emergedhe had campaigned for a friendcharged with possessing indecent images of children.Soon after an uncharacteristically pugnacious performance at prime minister’s questions, where the leaders of all the main political partes lined up to question his judgment over Doyle’s peerage, Starmer faced a packed meeting of female members of theLabourparty (PLP). He apologised again to them for appointing Mandelson as the UK’s ambassador to the US, promising action to “eradicate structural misogyny”.Harman told Starmer decisive action was needed to draw a line under the scandals and that he should appoint a woman as first secretary of state who would be his de facto deputy and the most senior cabinet member after him. She said it would be “really powerful” if the role was given to a woman and said fighting misogyny should be the sixth mission of the Starmer government.Harman was deputyLabourleader under Gordon Brown, but he refused to make her deputy prime minister, later promoting Mandelson to first secretary of state. Mandelson was the last Labour figure to hold the role. Harman said the role would be in addition to the post of deputy prime minister held by David Lammy.“We need a complete culture change and I think everybody recognises that,” Harman told the Guardian. “But it’s easier to say let’s change culture than to make it happen.” The first secretary role would “turbocharge” the government’s pledge to halve violence against women and girls over the next decade, she said. “It would deal with culture change, but it would also hold every government department accountable for what they are doing on women and empower the work on women that’s happening in each of those departments.”The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said there had been far too many misogynistic briefings by the prime minister’s circle. ​“I’ve been completely straight with him about how unacceptable that is​,” she told ITV1’s Peston. “And I believe that he is sincere in hating that culture of briefings, particularly briefings against women, of which there have been far too many and it has been far too frequent and is sincere about wanting to stamp that out​.“We need to see far less of these misogynistic briefings. We need far more women around every table where decisions are being made and we need to make sure that we model that change that we’re creating out there in the country.”The fallout of the Mandelson scandal, worsened by the revelations about Doyle, has sparked real anger in the Labour ranks and particularly among female MPs, with one describing it as “the worst week of her life”.Another Labour MP said Starmer’s meeting with women from the PLP was “the least he could fucking do”, and that his future depended on moving the dial on violence against women and girls and “ending the kowtowing to the vested interests of powerful rich men”. “I’m just not sure the government is up for it,” they said.In a blog before the meeting, the local government minister,Alison McGovern, wrote: “It’s our culture that doesn’t properly hear women which meant Peter Mandelson’s power lasted for so long.”Amid the fury among female members of parliament, a growing Amazonian guard has formed around Starmer since his chief of staff’s resignation. McSweeney, who said he had advised Starmer to appoint Mandelson as US ambassador, has been replaced by acting joint chiefs of staff Vidhya Alakeson and Jill Cuthbertson.The role ofdirector of communications vacated by Tim Allanon Monday has been filled for now by Sophie Nazemi, one of the few veterans of the Corbyn era who has gained Starmer’s trust. Another name linked with the role is Starmer’s former director of communications Stephanie Driver, who resigned when Allan was promoted above her last autumn. The reputation of No 10’s political director, Amy Richards, has also strengthened, and she is widely thought to be playing a pivotal role in improving Starmer’s relationship with his party.But MPs urged Starmer to go further at the PLP meeting – described by one attendee as “supportive and constructive” – on Wednesday. The Bolsover MP, Natalie Fleet, who became pregnantafter being groomedand raped as a teenager, asked the prime minister to launch a national inquiry into the crimes of the former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed, telling him that victims had written to No 10 but had not received a reply.She asked Starmer to meet her and the victims. “These are our victims, this is our Epstein,” she said, adding that English police officers had taken bribes and doctors had checked that victims were virgins.“I know, as a survivor, that nobody cares,” she said. “Literally, nobody cares. You have to seize the moment right now, people up and down the country saying they care. OK, great, let’s do something about it.”Fleet said Starmer still had her full support but had to demonstrate that he had listened to women’s concerns, including those in his own party. “I genuinely believe that Starmer is the best we’ve got when it comes to tackling violence against women and girls,” she said.“If I could pick a prime minister out of the country, I would pick somebody with a record like his. The fact that he’s being derailed to this scale by this drama just feels so ironic, because he genuinely cares. That’s why we need him to do more. We need him to deliver. We need deeds, not words.”Get in touchContact Guardian Politics about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

The number of people living with the condition is forecast to triple to more than 150 million globally by 2050, and experts say it presents a big and rapidly growing threat to future health and social care systems in every community, country and continent.US researchers found that engaging in intellectually stimulating activities throughout life, such as reading, writing or learning a new language, was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, and slower cognitive decline.The study author Andrea Zammit, of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, said the discovery suggested cognitive health in later life was “strongly influenced” by lifelong exposure to intellectually stimulating environments.“Our findings are encouraging, suggesting that consistently engaging in a variety of mentally stimulating activities throughout life may make a difference in cognition. Public investments that expand access to enriching environments, like libraries and early education programs designed to spark a lifelong love of learning, may help reduce the incidence of dementia.”Researchers tracked 1,939 people with an average age of 80 who did not have dementia at the start of the study. They were followed for an average of eight years. Participants completed surveys about cognitive activities and learning resources during three stages.Early enrichment, before 18, included the frequency of being read to and reading books, access to newspapers and atlases in the home, and learning a foreign language for more than five years.Middle-age enrichment included income level at 40, household resources such as magazine subscriptions, dictionaries and library cards and the frequency of activities such as visiting a museum or library. Later-life enrichment, starting at an average age of 80, included the frequency of reading, writing and playing games and total income from social security, retirement and other sources.In total, 551 participants developed Alzheimer’s disease and 719 developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) during the study, which was published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.Researchers compared those with the highest level of cognitive enrichment, the top 10%, with those with the lowest level, the bottom 10%. Of those with the highest level, 21% developed Alzheimer’s. Among those with the lowest, the figure was 34%.After adjusting for factors such as age, sex and education, researchers found higher scores in lifetime enrichment were associated with a 38% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 36% lower risk of MCI.People with the highest lifetime enrichment developed Alzheimer’s disease at an average age of 94, compared with 88 for those with the lowest level of enrichment – more than a five-year delay.Researchers found people with the highest lifetime enrichment developed MCI at an average age of 85, compared with 78 for those with the lowest level of enrichment – a seven-year delay.Researchers also looked at participants who died during the study and had autopsies. Those with higher lifetime enrichment had better memory and thinking skills and slower decline prior to death, the study found.A limitation was that participants reported details about their early and midlife experiences later in life, so may not have remembered everything accurately. The study also did not prove that lifelong learning reduces the risk of dementia, as it only showed an association.Dr Isolde Radford, a senior policy manager at Alzheimer’s Research UK, who was not involved with the study, said the findings highlighted that dementia was not an inevitable part of ageing.“This new research shows that staying mentally active throughout life can cut the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by nearly 40%,” she said. “This supports what we already know about the preventive steps people can take to reduce their risk of developing dementia.”Explore more on these topicsDementiaAlzheimer'sHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Psychologists do not classifysocial media addictionas an official diagnosis. Researchers havedocumentedthe harmful consequences of compulsive use among young people, andlawmakersaround the world are worried about its addictive potential.Mosseri is the first executive to testify in a series of trials in which hundreds of families and school districts have suedMeta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, alleging the companies knowingly created addictive products that harm young people’s mental health.The initial trial, in Los Angeles, focuses on a 20-year-old identified by the initials KGM who alleges the social media platform’s addictive design features, including endless scrolling, exacerbated her depression and suicidal thoughts. KGM and two other plaintiffs are part of bellwether trials – test cases designed to gauge a jury’s reaction for both sides.Mark Lanier, the plaintiff’s lawyer, grilled Mosseri on Wednesday about whetherInstagramput profits ahead of safety, as well as whether Instagram’s cosmetic filters promoted plastic surgery. Mosseri said the company tests new features that will be used by younger users before their release. “We are trying to be as safe as possible but also censor as little as possible,” he said.Some families viewed the exchange as confirming their beliefs about the harm caused by Instagram. Matthew P Bergman, founding attorney of Social Media Victims Law Center and an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement: “Adam Mosseri’s testimony under oath today revealed what families have long suspected: Instagram’s executives made a conscious decision to put growth over the safety of minors.”Mosseri has previously faced scrutiny about whether he may have dismissed internal warnings about the platform’s addictive design. A conversation between Meta researchers, mentioned by the plaintiff’s attorney in his opening statement, stressed the addictive nature of the platform. One employee suggested in aninternal correspondencethat “IG is a drug” and another stated: “LOL, I mean, all social media. We’re basically pushers.”One of the two also mentioned: “I know Adam doesn’t want to hear it … He freaked out when I talked about dopamine in my teen fundamentals lead review, but it is undeniable. It is biological. It is psychological.”Some parents who allege their children were harmed – and in some cases, died – because of social media platform’s addictive design were in court Wednesday. That includesJohn DeMay, whose son, Jordan, was 17 when he died by suicide in 2022 – hours after being targeted in an online sextortion scam. Two Nigerian brothers, who were using a hacked Instagram account to pretend they were a girl, blackmailed Jordan after he sent them nude photographs of himself; they demanded $1,000 from him, and threatened to send the images to his friends and family.DeMay said he expected Mosseri to do little beyond try to save face ahead of his testimony. “It’s absolutely a win for us already because the testimony is public, the internal documents are public, and now Mr Mosseri is going to have to go on the stand and try to justify why his company was doing the things they were doing to build products that are so addictive, and continuing to do it even though kids are dying over them,” DeMay said, hours before Mosseri’s testimony.Mosseri’s remarks follow the trial’s opening arguments earlier this week. Mark Lanier, a lawyer for the victims, cited internal Meta and Google documents to argue they targeted children as young as four; he called social media apps “digital casinos” because of features such as endless scrolling. YouTube’s lawyers rejected assertions that the platform counts as social media and that individuals were addicted. Meta’s lawyers disputed the science behind social media addiction and argued that KGM’s mental health issues had to do withfamilial abuse and issues, not social media.Instagram has, in recent years, added somesafety features aimed at its young users.But a 2025 review of these tools byFairplay– a nonprofit which advocates for reducing the influence of big tech on children – found “that less than one in five are fully functional and two-thirds (64%) are either substantially ineffective or no longer exist”.The plaintiffs’ focus is not on individual bad actors or content, but rather allegations that social media companies knowingly made their products addictive. This novel strategy has so far allowed the plaintiffs to bypass a federal law that typically shields platforms from legal action tied to harmful third-party content.DeMay said he was at the US Senate in January 2024, when big tech executives testified before Congress about child safety. He said he has more hope in the courts ability to change policy.“Every time we try to get something legislatively done it’s a grind. I’ve lost a lot of hope and I know other parents have, too,” he said. The financial pressure could make a difference, he said: “These companies – when they start getting sued for hundreds of millions of dollars by all these victims for the harms that they’ve been perpetrating on their users for so long – they’re going to be forced to make changes or else they’re going to go broke.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyInstagramMetaCaliforniaSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

That’s 12 million people.”Figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate Ratcliffe’s claim is incorrect. The ONS estimated that the population of the UK was 67 million in 2020 and was last anywhere close to 58 million in 2000.Responding to the claims, the prime minister posted on X on Wednesday evening: “Offensive and wrong. Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country.Jim Ratcliffeshould apologise.”A Downing Street spokesperson added that Ratcliffe’s remarks “play into the hands of those who want to divide our country” and called on him to “immediately” apologise.The response was in contrast to the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, who told Sky News that Ratcliffe was “right to say that there are too many people who have been written off, not allowed to make the contribution that they could make to this country”.She said that people deserved an immigration system “they can trust”, claiming that both illegal and legal migration were too high while the Conservatives were in government.Ratcliffe’s criticism of the number of people on benefits comes shortly after the governmentawarded a £120m grant to Ineos, the chemicals company upon which his £17bn fortune largely rests, to protect 500 jobs.The billionaire, who shifted his tax residency to Monaco in 2020, is no stranger to wading into politics, havingvocally backed Brexitand lobbied against green taxes and in favour of fracking.In the interview, at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, he compared the performance of Starmer with the Reform leader Nigel Farage, whom he said he had met recently and described as an “intelligent man”.Ratcliffe said he knew Starmer, and added: “I don’t know whether it’s just the apparatus that hasn’t allowed Keir to do it or, or he’s maybe too nice – I mean, Keir is a nice man. I like him, but it’s a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don’t think the economy is in a good state.”He said Farage was “an intelligent man, and I think he’s got good intentions”. “But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir, when Keir came in. I think it needs somebody who’s prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.”Responding to the billionaire’s claims about the UK being “colonised by immigrants”, Farage told Sky News: “The country has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in the country. Labour may try and ignore that but Reform won’t.”Ratcliffe compared the changes he had made at Manchester United, including mass layoffs and the appointment and subsequent sacking of Ruben Amorim, to running the country. He told Sky News he had been “unpopular” but that the changes were starting to pay off.“But you’ve got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living,” he said, the government was “going to have to do some things which are unpopular, and show some courage”.Explore more on these topicsJim RatcliffeIneosImmigration and asylumManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

He met his final days with courage, faith and grace,”reads a statementshared on Van Der Beek’s official Instagram page on Wednesday.“There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother and friend.”James Van Der Beek: a life in picturesRead moreIn November 2024, Van Der Beek revealed that he had been diagnosed with bowel cancer as he prepared to appear on US charity TV special, The Real Full Monty. Based on the classic UK movie The Full Monty, the show saw a group of celebrities strip off to raise awareness of cancer. In November 2025, Van Der Beek revealedplans to auction off memorabiliaand the “treasures” he kept from working on his TV shows and films to fund his cancer treatment.Born in Connecticut in 1977, Van Der Beek initially preferred sports to the arts, until a childhood football accident left him with severe concussion. Doctors advised him not to play sport for a year, so soon after that he turned his attention to acting and was cast as the lead, Danny Zuko, in a school production of Grease.Van Der Beek shot to fame in 1998 as Dawson Leery, the teenage film buff who was as obsessed with Steven Spielberg as he was with his neighbour and lifelong crush, Joey Potter (played by Katie Holmes). Later that year, he was voted one of People Magazine’s Most Beautiful People in the World. On the 25th anniversary of the show starting,Van Der Beek wrote: “Twenty-five years ago today, my life changed. Not gradually, not day-by-day … instantly. It was the culmination of five years of auditioning, hundreds of hours on stage, thousands of hours travelling, preparing, dreaming, hoping, hearing ‘no’ and making up reasons to keep going. But the shift was overnight.”The intense pressures of celebrity proved difficult to cope with given his youth. After Dawson’s Creek became a smash hit, hesaid in an interview: “Walking around at that time was very tricky because one autograph could turn into a mob scene. So I walked around in fear of teenage girls.”View image in fullscreenVan Der Beek as Dawson with Katie Holmes as Joey, Joshua Jackson as Pacey and Michelle Williams as Jen in Dawson’s Creek.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyFor years after the show ended, Van Der Beek was plagued by people asking whether there were plans to do a Dawson’s Creek reunion show or film. In 2017, he said: “I felt pretty complete putting that one on the shelf and not looking at him again.” But not long after he announced his cancer diagnosis, a charity reunion was set in motion with Van Der Beek and former co-stars Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson attached. However, health issues meant that Van Der Beek was unavailable on the day – so Lin-Manuel Miranda stepped in to take the role of Dawson.James Van Der Beek was so much more than just Dawson | Stuart HeritageRead moreVan Der Beek also appeared in movies including the American football teen flick Varsity Blues, in which he starred opposite Paul Walker, and in the adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s The Rules of Attraction, in which he played drug dealer Sean Bateman – younger brother of American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman – caught up in a love triangle. He increasingly played tongue-in-cheek roles: he tried to climb into a bedroom window in the 2000 horror parody Scary Movie as the Dawson’s Creek theme tune I Don’t Want to Wait played, before declaring “Wrong set”. He was later cast as a meta version of himself in Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, for which he was nominated for a Teen Choice award for male scene stealer in 2012. He also did multiple skits for the comedy site Funny or Die, including one calledVandermemesthat riffed on him going viral for his so-called “ugly cry face”.Fellow teen idols, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chad Michael Murray, were among those who immediately paid tribute to the actor on social media. “I’m so sad for your beautiful family,” Gellar commented on the post. “While James’ legacy will always live on, this is a huge loss to not just your family but the world. Fuck Cancer.”Murray wrote: “Sending love and light to your beautiful family. James was a giant. We’re so so so sorry for what you’re going through. His words, art and humanity inspired all of us- he inspired us to be better in all ways. God bless you guys.”Jennifer Garner also commented, “What a heartbreaking loss. So much love to you, Kimberly, and to your kids, as you navigate this tender time.”On Instagram, the actor Paul Walter Hauserpostedan image of the money he helped raise for Van Der Beek’s cancer treatment, along with the message: “Love you, James. I know you’re in Heaven being pampered with love. The Van Der Beeks will be in our daily prayers and we’ll be drumming up some money to support your beautiful family. Thanks for the body of work and for being one of the good guys.”Roger Avary, the Canadian-American filmmaker who directed Van Der Beek in The Rules of Attraction, praised the actor and friend as “a pillar of strength to me and my family during the hardest of times”.“I have never known anyone else quite like him,” headdedon X, “and rarely felt so close a working connection, and my heart is broken at the loss, and my thoughts and prayers are with his wife and children.”Van Der Beek is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and their six children, Olivia, Joshua, Annabel, Emilia, Gwendolyn and Jeremiah.Shortly after announcing Van Der Beek’s death, Kimberly published a link to a GoFundMe to help with expenses in the wake of his extended medical treatment. “My friends created this link to support me and my children during this time,” she wrote. “With gratitude and a broken heart.”According to thefundraiser, which seeks to raise $500,000 for the Van Der Beek family, his medical care costs “have left the family out of funds. They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time. The support of friends, family, and the wider community will make a world of difference as they navigate the road ahead.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

He had “captained a tough ship” in order to safeguard “the ‘patina’ and prestige that differentiated the Daily Mail from other titles, both the popular ones and the so-called quality newspapers”.Others have described the editor’s tenure, and the impact it had on the UK, differently. Widely regarded as “the most powerful print journalist in Britain” (Politico) until hestood downin 2021, to his critics Dacre was “the man who hated liberal Britain” (New Statesman), and even the country’s “most dangerous man” (Observer).This was the editor whom celebrities and politicians most feared, whose management diatribes were so notoriously foul-mouthed that they were nicknamed “the vagina monologues” on account of the number of timeshe used the word “cunt”.So who was the unassuming older gentleman who shuffled quietly to the stand in court 76 of the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday and was immediately asked, on the basis of his softly spoken evidence the previous day, if he could keep his voice up a bit?“I’ll do my very best,” responded Dacre, still barely audibly.Dacre was giving evidence for a second day in defence of the Mail’s publisher,Associated NewspapersLimited (ANL), which has been accused by a group of claimants including Prince Harry, Elton John and Elizabeth Hurley of illegal information-gathering practices including bugging, phone tapping, hacking and “blagging” documents. ANL denies the claims.First, however, there was an apology from David Sherborne, the lead barrister representing the claimants. Sherborne’s line of questioning to Dacre on Tuesday had not pleased the judge in the case, Mr Justice Nicklin, who had said the “large bulk” of the barrister’s questions were irrelevant as this case was not a public inquiry into AssociatedNewspapers.Highly unusually, Nicklin had declared that Sherborne would have until 3pm on Wednesday, and no longer, to cross-examine the former editor. So, Sherborne told Dacre, he would start by outlining the relevance of his questions before “the guillotine comes down later this afternoon”.Sherborne may have been ordered to stay in his lane but he was barely three minutes in when Nicklin interrupted, the first of a series of increasingly exasperated interventions over the barrister’s cross-examination as he tried to pin down Dacre over Daily Mail journalists’ use of private investigators, which Dacre says he banned in 2007.Asked repeatedly about his recollection of a particular story, invoice or piece of correspondence, the 77-year-old, who remains editor-in-chief of ANL’s parent company, DMG Media, said they would not have come across his desk, and if they had he was unlikely to recall them. “I was a very busy man in those days,” Dacre said. “I was so busy producing a paper of 120 pages … No, didn’t get down to that granular level.”Repeated questions about stories published in the Mail on Sunday were met with the same response. “I keep repeating this mantra, this was the Mail on Sunday. It was an autonomous newspaper.”Hadn’t he been the editor-in-chief of that paper, too, at the time? “I don’t think you appreciate [the job] of an editor-in-chief of a busy media organisation,” he said.Though his voice remained quiet throughout, there were occasional flashes of anger, such as when he was asked about a series of articles about the Mail in 2017 in Byline Investigates (a “sordid paper” edited by “one of the most amoral people I have ever had the misfortune to come across”), or about the investigative reporter Nick Davies, whose book Flat Earth News about unedifying and corrupt practices in journalism was, Dacre said witheringly, “a book written to appeal to a certain section of the Guardian readership”.Soon it was 3pm and while the barrister did his best to continue, the judge was having none of it. “You have trespassed now into an area that is irrelevant, so I’m not going to let you pursue that any further,” he told Sherborne.The guillotine had indeed fallen and, for now at least, the former king of Fleet Street appeared to have escaped the block with his head intact.Explore more on these topicsPaul DacreAssociated NewspapersDaily MailNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That film’s title would also have applied perfectly well to this new one, an LA crime thriller adapted from a novella by Don Winslow. It is a little in the style of Michael Mann, though without the military hardware and the overhead shots of SUVs moving in swift convoy that would make it a full Mann homage.Layton does without the distinctive indirect mannerisms and meta-commentaries of his earlier movies, but he applies his pedal to the metal for what is an enjoyable and very stylish high-stakes armed robbery film about a thief who is highly controlled, super-cool, super-groomed, and naturally looking for the “walkaway money” of the time-honoured one last job.This is Mike (played by Chris Hemsworth), who with his sleek black performance cars and Glock handguns, commits jewel robberies with the laudably nonviolent precision of a ballet-dancing brain surgeon. He is controlled by a leathery old tough guy called Money (Nick Nolte), who once upon a time mentored Mike out of foster care and into crime. But Mike’s hits are all along California’s Route 101, a pattern spotted by LAPD’s single honest cop, detective Lou Lubesnick (Mark Ruffalo), as dishevelled and smart as Columbo.When things go horribly wrong, Mike develops qualms about the whole business, and Money looks like replacing him with Ormon (Barry Keoghan): an undisciplined, trigger-happy youngster who rides a flashy, attention-attracting motorbike – uncool – and has dyed blond hair (also uncool). Everything comes to a crisis point when Mike induces troubled insurance agent Sharon (Halle Berry) to give him inside info for a hugely lucrative job that he figures he can set up on his own. Meanwhile, he can’t bring himself to tell his girlfriend Maya (Monica Barbaro) what he does for a living.This is a movie that revs the engine entertainingly and loudly, though it is less convincing when it claims the moral high ground of social comment by perfunctorily showing us LA’s homeless. At one stage, Ruffalo’s detective rides on a city bus crowded with the city’s low-net-worth individuals. (What, no Uber?) But overall, it is a highly watchable spectacle, leaving a sizzling streak of rubber on the tarmac.Crime 101 is released on 12 February in Australia and 13 February in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsFilm adaptationsChris HemsworthNick NolteMark RuffaloreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ina political sense, it meant always being the one who reminded others to say “chairperson” not “chairman”; always manning the barricades for signs of bigotry, always being on the right demo. If its values were sound – all we’re talking about, really, is trying to systematise courtesy to others – it was often easy to lampoon, because it felt performative and had a hair-trigger.But what has risen in its wake – vice-signalling – cannot be seen as its mirror or answer, any more than dehumanisation could be seen as the equal and opposite of decency. They’re not in the same rhetorical category. The term doesn’t bring itself to life; for that you need the US president. Cast your mind back to 2015; although Donald Trump had said he might run for election to the highest office in every cycle this century, his speech in Trump Tower was his first campaign launch, and it was where he announced that he would build a wall between the US and Mexico.In seemingly unplanned remarks– the grammar was off, the structure meandered, the vocabulary was vague and repetitive – he said “[Mexico] are sending people that have lots of problems, and they are bringing those problems to us. They are bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and they’re rapists.”This is classic vice-signalling, breaking taboos in this case both general (against hate speech) and more specific (against falsely associating base or criminal traits with a race or ethnic group). He was signalling that he was prepared togo there– say what the establishment would not allow, and therefore assert himself as a politician who is authentic and courageous, who cannot be muzzled.The video he postedlast Thursday of the Obamas depicted as apes, a trope so racist it was breathtaking, did not come out of nowhere. Trump and his allies have been signalling the vice of racial hatred for more than a decade, and each new event punches out the space for the next, worse signal.Vice-signalling is attention-seeking – a typical strategy of the hard and far right “to constantly violate taboos, and in this way escalate the dynamics of the whole conversation, while getting immediate media attention, usually front page”, says Ruth Wodak, emeritus professor of linguistics and chair of discourse studies at Lancaster University. It works for a political insurgent, as Trump was, as Nigel Farage still is, because it breaks down establishment barriers to entry, in terms of coverage. Not that winning power stops provocateurs, as Silvio Berlusconi illustrated, still making dog-whistle racist remarks about Barack Obama – “young, handsome, and tanned” – when he had been prime minister of Italy on and off for nearly 10 years.View image in fullscreenWinning power doesn’t stop provocateurs … Barack Obama and Silvio Berlusconi at the G8 summit in 2009.Photograph: Jason Reed/ReutersMisogynistic vice-signalling has always been high-risk electorally, since even if you accept that women will vote for candidates who openly deride them (which we have to), there are so many of us. The best way to understand the recent surge of radical sexism is that it doesn’t so much address the voter as kick the door down (rhetorically speaking) for the next guy.The cascade has been dizzying: Trump’spussy-grabbing(he later apologised if his comments caused offence and dismissed the words as “locker room talk”) cracked open the space for JD Vanceto come out and say that the Democratic party was run by childless cat ladies (he later downplayed it as sarcasm), which opened up Tucker Carlson’s“daddy’s home” speechon the eve of the election (“Dad is pissed. And when dad gets home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl, and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now’”) and that, fair play, was not literally directed at women, because metaphorically, all liberals had become women. Literally, though, Christian nationalists have started to float the view that voting should be done by household, which is to say, not by women, a view that has beenvice-signally repostedon social media by the US defence secretary Pete Hegseth.Every time open misogyny is voiced by a politician with no consequence except more attention, it emboldens his allies. And every signal that makes an impact changes the weather. “People’s preferences are endogenous as well as exogenous,” says Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, meaning: “What goes on in politics does shape what people think, as well as what’s happened in their own lives.” Alarming, aggressive, taboo-breaking statements by today’s politicians create an Elysium yearning, so that when Trump appears at a press conference and he’s in a good mood, not threatening to deport anyone or invade anywhere, you get this wash of relief that feels like relaxation, even fellowship. It’s a trauma bond.Not that vice-signalling per se is new. Wodak first noticed the vice-signalling of Jörg Haider in the 1980s. He was the head of Austria’s Freedom party, which is no stranger to far-right narratives, though even in that context he was an outlier, known for “really antisemitic and revisionist utterances”. But precisely because taking the long view is soothing, it is dangerous. Today’s rightwing provocations have plenty in common with yesterday’s, but this is not just racist or misogynist undercurrent-as-usual. Elon Musk’s apparent Nazi salute is different, in effect and intensity, to Ronald Reagan falsely associating welfare fraud with Black people with his racially codedWelfare Queentrope.What is particularly scary about today’s all-out vice-signalling is that it still gets you the camera and bathes your agenda in a metaphorical ring-light, but these days doesn’t carry the same political risk, which was previously twofold: it would cost you at the ballot box – commentators thought Trump was crazy with that 2015 bid, since the Hispanic vote was considered so critical to Republicans at the time that Jeb Bush was making speeches in Spanish – but you wouldn’t even get in front of voters if your speeches were hateful enough, because you’d be shunned by the establishment. “Enoch Powell is the classic example,” says Bale. Even while there were attendant benefits of taboo-breaking, such as creating your own army of hardcore fans, which Powell achieved, the MP never regained his foothold in mainstream politics after his 1968 anti-immigration “rivers of blood” speech, and was spent as a force. That establishment shun-operation no longer functions, and Trump’s emergence as a Republican candidate should have alerted us to this a decade ago.View image in fullscreenUS defence secretary Pete Hegseth, who reposted a video that says women shouldn’t be allowed to vote.Photograph: Miguel J Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP/Getty ImagesWe talk a lot about why voters embrace those making openly racist and misogynistic comments: whether it signals widespread racism and misogyny that had previously been forced underground, or whether people overlook hate because they admire rule-breakers, and however they feel about bigotry, they feel worse about establishment politics. We talk much less about the failure of the first line of defence: why did the Republican party make Trump its candidate after the 2015 speech? Why was Boris Johnson not deplatformed aftersaying Muslim womenlooked like letterboxes in 2018, or 10 years earlier over the “watermelon smiles” of Commonwealth citizens? (He eventually apologised for both comments.) Why did Kemi Badenoch fire Robert Jenrick when he was about to defect to Reform, andnot when he bemoanedthe fact that there weren’t enough white faces in Birmingham (he said he was making a point about integration)? Why, in a country that has quite advanced laws against hate speech, does Herbert Kickl, the current leader of the far-right Freedom party in Austria, run rings around them? (“He’s a clever rhetorician,” Wodak says. “His speeches really escalate. There is so much hate expressed but you often can’t pin it down.”) Why didDavid Lammy go fishing with JD Vanceafter the vice-president time and againequated female worth with motherhood?Nigel Farage has been accused ofastonishing antisemitismin his schooldays, but he has also been criticised for using recognisedantisemitic tropesmuch more recently, such as “Jewish lobby”, “new world order” and threat of a “globalist” government. While hedenies any antisemitism, this really is some bold vice-signalling, both breaking the taboo against such tropes, and breaking the iron-clad unity over that period that the right had never even heard of antisemitism, and it was a leftwing problem. How did he keep his chummy media persona?The rightwing media in the UK is a bit of a cul-de-sac, here, if you’re looking for challengers. Print titles have been running in parallel with politics to break taboos. “They’ve just gone off the deep end,” Bale says, “in a way that would have been unrecognisable even 10 years ago”. We had a little skirmish about why this might be – he thinks “legacy media” generally are competing with the undigested internet for clicks and attention; I think rightwing media specifically has lost restraint around hate-speech and othering, reflecting the interests of increasingly rapacious billionaire owners. We had to agree to differ.The broadcasters of the right, meanwhile, such as GB News and TalkTV, “started up so you could say the things you’re not allowed to say”, says Scarlett MccGwire, a political communications adviser. But the centre right and centrists, in media and politics, have for decades operated as a firewall between robust speech and hate speech – part of their legitimacy derived from what they kept out: open racism; misogyny; hate speech; dehumanising imagery. Maybe as crucial, since discriminatory narratives rely on them, outright lies would historically have seen a public figure permanently dismissed. To see the mainstream lose its confidence around that principle has been disorientating.At its worst, vice-signalling normalises hate.“Empörung Müdigkeit is the German term, ‘fatigue at being angry’,” Wodak says. Vice-signalling “gets disseminated; antisemitic slurs, racist slurs, they become part of everyday conversation.” (This is the broken windows theory – the more your environment is vandalised, the less care you take of it – applied to hate speech.) Even if a shun-operation kicks in, it’s now hit and miss: the former Conservative MP Lee Anderson faced anoutcry in 2024with the double-whammy vice-signal of claiming that mayor Sadiq Khan had handed London to his mates (it was widely seen as Islamophobic insinuation, first, and it was of course untrue). Anderson, who says he isn’t Islamophobic –as in “an irrational fear of Islam”– refused to apologise, had the Tory whip removed, but there was a haven further right and he defected to Reform.View image in fullscreenNot deplatformed … Boris Johnson in 2023.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesThe right have nudged up to the electric fence, in other words, and discovered that it’s not electrified. But that is partly because of a “heads I win, tails you lose” manoeuvre that is – I don’t want to alarm anyone – a key characteristic of fascism. Critique and challenge is not addressed but it is welcomed, because it delivers a fresh domestic enemy, the metropolitan (UK) or liberal (US) elite. Being called a liar is proof that the leader isn’t playing their establishment game, so “Trump, for all that he tells lies all the time, is so disinhibited and off-the-cuff that he’s seen as more honest, more authentic than his opponents,” Bale says. This is quite new.So, from attention for the vice-signalling individual and the explosive dead-cat distraction from real problems and actual policies, to the Broken Windows degradation of the public sphere, the creation of a fanbase and the corresponding generation of street violence that will evidence a national race or values crisis where previously there was none – these are some quite significant wins for vice-signalling. You can see why they do it.It also, says Bale, shifts the … well, “I don’t like the phrase Overton window” – a model for what the mainstream public find acceptable at a given time. “I’ve never read a political science paper using it.” “What do you guys use?”, I ask. “Centre of gravity,” he says. I don’t even want to dwell on what Farageet al’s language has done to the centre of gravity and where it’s dragged the Labour government. FromKeir Starmer’s “island of strangers” immigration speechto the home secretary Shabana Mahmood’s idea of usingsurveillance-fed AI to stop criminals before they’ve committed a crime, it’s all just too sad.I originally thought the main point of vice-signalling was to cast its opponents into disarray. Progressives are bad at dealing with binaries and absolutes: we would far rather argue about whether a statementwasracist than argue about whether racism is bad. No question, all these signals have cast the left and centre into disarray. Alyssa Elliott, a member of the UK chapter of the largest grassroots anti-Trump movement, Indivisible, since she moved to the UK in 2018, describes the crisis in the Democratic party differently, however. It’s not that they don’t know how to have these arguments, so much as that their worldview is crashing down. “They’re still locked into this ‘Maga can’t do that because it’s against the rules’,” Elliott says. “That applies to the government’s statements as much as to their destruction of institutions. We still haveDemocrats sayingthat they will fund ICE as long as we make them do more training. That’s not the problem any more. It is a really big shift, to understand that the rules are over. A lot of people just refuse to do it.” Every vice-signal, whether it’s Trump or Farage or Jenrick or Herbert Kickl, is telling you the rules are over. If you can’t believe them the first time, at least believe them the 100th.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsRobert JenrickfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s your first sign that things were going badly long before you got here. Exploring dark waves and desolated urban environments in a rowboat, they’re on a search for their lost friends across a world of rabid, malformed entities. As the children struggle with their outsize fears, so will you, but you’ve at least got the option to play co-op if you want someone on the couch to brave the horrors with.In the early 2000s, irreverent gaming blog Old Man Murray pioneered the “crate review system”. The rubric was simple: the sooner the player encountered their first wooden cube of heinous mediocrity, the more uninspired the game. Updating this method for 2026, we’ve got a few new contenders: how soon before you shimmy slowly through a gap, boost a companion over a high ledge so they can pull you up or tediously rotate some mechanism with the analogue stick? Reanimal pulls out all these hits within the first 20 minutes and, by the time the credits roll, six hours in, it feels as if developer Tarsier has wrung the final drops of interactive novelty from its formula of light exploration puzzles, tense but simple stealth and ghastly chases. And yet this grim fairytale is still difficult to put down.Tarsier’sLittle Nightmares gameswere rightly praised for how their imposing and exaggerated worlds hold up a creepy funhouse mirror to a child’s thoughts and fears. Adults are gangly and terrifying; work is bizarre; bureaucracy is uncanny. Reanimal draws from that same well of fear, but with occasional riffs that feel at odds with childhood disempowerment, such as moments where the kids pilot a tank, or find a big honking bazooka.Even your worst nightmare is more bearable with a traffic cone on your headThe world’s worn and weary architecture feels fascinatingly wretched, with assured cinematography and arresting scale. Concrete and steel creak out sorrowful stories of decay and disaster. The starring pair make their way through crumbling bulkheads, a rotting orphanage and a forest so dark and dense that sunrise as a concept feels like a fanciful myth. Obscured crawlspaces hide away moments of reprieve in the form of silly, sad little secrets, proving that even your worst nightmare is more bearable with a traffic cone on your head.Observing their confidence and resourcefulness, you get the sense these kids have been dealing with hell for a long time. But they’re still kids. You’ll clumsily swing a crowbar at giant seagulls, or take a break to use a rusted slide. You’ll play grandmother’s footsteps through a flooded basement, sneaking in time with clattering washing machines to hide the sound of your movement from the awful, lanky presence just a few feet away. Lovingly animated detail brightens up the murkiness; the kids will help each other up and dust themselves off after falls, and beds quiver when you jump on them. A lighter and lamp to banish the gloom provide small comforts, but comforts all the same.View image in fullscreenLovingly animated detail … Reanimal.Photograph: Tarsier Studios/THQ NordicAnd, yes, the handful of marquee moments spent running from or tussling with gargantuan creatures are spectacular. I will never turn my back on a pelican again as long as I live. Throughout, Reanimal drip-feeds clues to compelling mysteries surrounding the nature of its world and the children’s place within it. A shame, then, that it whiffs its apparent swing at recapturing the gut-punch of Little Nightmares II’s ending.One early sequence sees you creep through a dilapidated theatre while a projector flickers between macabre images. Reanimal, too, relies on a celluloid reel of darkly beautiful scenes: they’re undeniably memorable in isolation, they just don’t form an especially cogent whole.Reanimal is out 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPlatform gamesPuzzle gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

They are an overlong celebration of underwatched films that take place in a room where, by the end of the evening, the bulk of those present have been told that they aren’t good enough to win anything. The whole thing is excruciating.But you know what’s much better than the Oscars? The annualOscars nomineesluncheon. This is when everyone who has been nominated gathers for a nice lunch. It isn’t televised, so nobody has to be on their best behaviour. No awards are handed out, so technically everyone invited is an equal. And, best of all, they take a class photo of everyone at the end.This is brilliant because not only does it act as a snapshot of the great and good in any given year, but mainly because it is genuinely impossible to have that many people look completely normal at the exact moment in time. So with that in mind, here are the annualOscarsluncheon class photo awards for 2026.Biggest showboater – Guillermo del Toro (front, centre)View image in fullscreenActing like a wacky usher at a wedding … Guillermo del Toro.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyWhen you look at an Oscars class, your eye is immediately drawn to the middle of the front row. Usually this is because this is where the greatest concentration of A-list talent clusters. However, this year it is becauseGuillermo del Toro– nominated forFrankenstein– has decided to act like a wacky usher at a wedding. Look at everyone else in the photo and you will see hundreds of people who aren’t sure what to do with their hands. Not del Toro, though, because he has opted to maniacally waggle them around like a 1920s showgirl. It gives the effect that this is del Toro’s party and everyone else is just a guest. Please also note thatPaul Thomas Andersonappears to be holding him back, in case he makes a lunge for the cameraman.Giantest man – Oliver Laxe (back row, tenth from left)View image in fullscreenUnstoppably huge … Oliver Laxe, back left, who is somehow taller than Stellan Skarsgård, back centre, and Jacob Elordi, back right.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyAs is traditional with a group shot, all the tall people get shoved to the back so they don’t accidentally end up obscuring a famous actor with their hulking shoulders. This year, the back row includedJoseph KosinskiandStellan Skarsgård(both around 6ft 3in) andJacob Elordi(around 6ft 5in). It had been assumed that Elordi, a veritable giraffe in the tiny world of Hollywood, would be the tallest person at the luncheon. But then in strode inSirāt director Oliver Laxe, who has to be at least eight feet tall. Laxe is unstoppably huge, to the extent that he pulls focus from everyone but del Toro. If he’s nominated again next year, please let’s start a petition to hang all the other nominees off his colossal frame like a human mug tree.Best disguised – Diane Warren (third row from back, second from left)View image in fullscreenBlending in … Diane Warren, dressed in all black, looks as if she’s trying to hide from the photographer.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyAs someone who has dedicated her life to writing pretty good songs for forgettable movies purely so that she can attend the Oscars, you worry that the Oscars luncheon is one of the only times thatDiane Warrenactually leaves the house. Quite often, she maximises on this by dressing boldly. But in the year that she is nominated for Dear Me, from Diane Warren: Relentless, the documentary about her life, she has changed tactic.. She’s a bit more muted, her hair and outfit melding into her surrounding nominees. She is also slightly too short to stand out, to the extent that a layperson could be easily convinced that she’s trying to hide from the photographer. This won’t do. When she is inevitably nominated again next year, let’s hope she opts for a big yellow feathery hat as a counterbalance.Most comfortable sense of self-worth – Ron Dyens (third row from back, third from left)An Oscar-winner already … Ron Dyens, centre.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyThere are several stages to spotting Ron Dyens in the class photo. The first is where you notice that, while everyone else is dressed to the nines, he is wearing a cat T-shirt. The second is where you realise that the cat on his shirt is thecat from Flow, which won best animated feature last year. The third and final stage is where you realise that, wait a minute, Dyens produced Flow. He got the nod this year for the animated short film Butterfly, and literally came to the Oscars nominee luncheon wearing proof that he has already won an Oscar. The balls of the man, frankly. Hopefully this sets a new precedent whereby next yearLeonardo DiCapriocomes dressed as the guy fromThe Revenant.Weirdest audition for a Guardian byline photo – Ronald Bronstein (back row, 11th from right)View image in fullscreenIs he coming for our jobs? Ronald Bronstein (in green jacket) poses like a Guardian journalist.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyThe co-writer ofUncut GemsandGood Time, and nominated this year forMarty Supreme, Ronald Bronstein will for ever be held in the greatest of respect. However, it has to be said that he spent the duration of the Oscars nominees luncheon class photo standing exactly – and I meanexactly– in the same way as Guardian journalists do when they’re posing for a byline photo. He’s dressed more smartly than usual. He’s pulling an expression that tries to be serious, curious and jaunty all at the same time (because you can’t predict the tone of the pieces you’ll write in the future). Most damningly of all, though, he is standing sideways while turning his head towards the camera. This isexactly how they make us do it at work! They have diagrams up and everything! Honestly, he could beRafael BehrorSimon JenkinsorPolly Toynbee. The bigger question is why he is even doing this. Is it a tribute? Is he taking the piss? Is he coming for our jobs?

Maybe she was a double agent?Wed 11 Feb 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 13.00 ESTShareAntonia Romeo is expected to become thefirst female cabinet secretaryshortly, an appointment that is “controversial”, according to conservative commentators, since the mandarin is the“queen of woke”. But how did she come by that title? What are her woke credentials – and how did she rise to preeminence?The civil service itself often sets off the woke tripwire, owing to workplace conventions such as respecting people’s pronouns and having sick leave. Often it’s even less specific, a vague but fiery opposition confected by someone who is anti-woke. So Jacob Rees-Mogg might take issue with the civil serviceallowing home working, and it will be a classic battle against woke (similar to Nigel Farage lumping in council employees who work from home with thoseworking on DEIor climate). If you were asked to explain verbally why commuting to an office is conservative and working from home is liberal, you’d struggle: but nobody has to, because anti-woke warriors fight under the banner of common sense, which doesn’t have to show its workings.It wouldn’t be logical, however, to say Romeo was a controversially woke choice just because she was a civil servant; by that rationale, any cabinet secretary would be controversial. There are certainly conservatives who think so. One is named Liz Truss, who recently said on her YouTube channel that if there were a new series of Yes Minister, Humphrey Applebywould be a radicalised trans activist. To unpick that remark, as an analysis of the wokeness of the civil service, would take a while. But that isn’t the mainstream rightwing view on the civil service, yet.Romeo, furthermore, has held a high rank in every government since David Cameron’s. Was Cameron woke? You might say so,because of the huskies, and a remark he made (this is going back a bit) about wanting his party tobe more Polly Toynbee. As for those who kept Romeo on after Cameron, Theresa May was woke because she sometimes spoke thoughtfully about mental health. After that, it changes. Boris Johnson was anti-woke before the word even existed. Rishi Sunak spent 2023waging a war on woke. No self-respecting queen of woke would have worked under these people, unless as a double agent.How does woke start winning again? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreMaybe it would help to nail down what “woke” means. It’swell knownthat it was coined by African American civil rights activists in the 1930s, and that “stay woke” meant stay aware of racial prejudice and structural racist discrimination. When it expanded to encompass other prejudices in the 2010s, you could have argued, and some did, that there was a fine line between co-opting vocabulary as an act of intersectional solidarity and purloining a word in a way that made it less useful.But there’s no point relitigating that, because the word no longer means “having an awareness of structural oppression, both of oneself and of others, with a mind to rooting it out at source and creating a fairer and better society”. Now, as the case of Romeo illustrates, it can mean anything: it can mean you’re a civil servant or a woman, or a police officer or a teacher or an HR person, or a parking attendant or the king (although the king would never be called king of woke – he is somewhat a woke king because he believes in the climate crisis).The definition has no hard edges. It can be something you are or something you think, and it doesn’t even have to be about a person – it can be a membership organisation (the National Trust) or a set of institutions (the law courts). Applied to disability, it is particularly dismaying and all-encompassing, since if you have a disability and want not to be oppressed, that makes you superwoke, but all institutions and processes that accommodate you – whether that’s a local authority giving you a special educational needs (SEN) certificate, or the Department for Work and Pensions paying personal independence payment (Pip) – then become woke. The only way to be disabled and not to be considered woke would be if you embarked on a permanent campaign against your own rights.Gen Z, which seems to have a much more reflexive understanding of when a term is being strategically overdeployed, call everything woke as a way to neutralise the word altogether. Activities considered woke in my house include, but are not limited to: eating Weetabix without milk; revising in pyjamas; washing.Ultimately, wokeness is a label you can only avoid being applied to you by actively fighting it – by being anti-woke. It wouldn’t even be enough to simply say “I’m not woke”, because you’re leaving the door open. You cannot spectate the war on woke; you have to go over the top.The vagueness, the contradictions, the tautologies, the breadth, the hyperbole, the multipurpose uselessness of this word are all part of the point. It builds the concept as a spectre, you cannot grasp it or pin it down. It cannot be vanquished because, meaning a different thing in every context, every mouth, it can endlessly regenerate. It has to be fought because it corrodes everything about your nation and its story. But you must also accept that this is a forever war.It’s still not clear how the future cabinet secretary got to be queen of woke.

Don’t rise too high, for the clouds are low, and I don’t want your aerial view obscured. Look at the roads – the grey ribbons snaking their way through the grey-green February countryside. Note how scarred are these roads, with dark, irregularly shaped marks, big and small. If the road was your skin, you’d be off to the doctor soonest. See how cars and bikes try to negotiate these lesions. Bobbing and swerving, gingerly they’ll try to slalom their way through the minefield. This isn’t driving, it’s dodgems. Some drivers, either oblivious to the danger or because their patience has snapped, will hold their line and proceed straight over or into one of them. Wince as you watch. Cast your eye wider and you’ll see stricken victims, cars and bikes strewn around, motionless. Recovery vehicles do brisk business; the queues outside tyre places are long. It’s hell down there. Because this, my friends, is peak pothole season.It’s wet, it’s freezing and then not freezing, and then it rains some more. And so surfaces fracture and craters deepen. And there’s not the money or the people to either fill the holes or stop them happening in the first place.It might be that I’m getting older and, just like police constables look younger all the time, potholes seem ever greater in number. But surely they were never this bad, this many of them, this big and deep and ruinous to tyres, wheels, pockets and lives. Yes, lives. Trust me, stopping and starting and slaloming all over the place is dangerous. Hit one of the bastard things at speed and things can get very nasty; hit one if you’re riding two wheels and you’re certainly more likely than not to be in a world of pain.I can’t have this moan without seeing a version of myself on the back row of the Question Time audience, a middle-aged bloke from central casting with steam coming out of his earholes. But, sod it, I’ll rant on. Because the alternative to ranting on is shrugging, giving up and accepting that this is the way things are. I keep meeting people, hundreds of pounds down after multiple tyre bursts, whose fury has given way to resignation. This is just how it must be.I’m not fooled by the sun popping out – it’s the season of miserable greys | Adrian ChilesRead morePotholes are more than just holes in the road. They stand for something greater. I have a friend who was a news correspondent in Washington DC. He lived in a swanky place in Georgetown next door to a bloke who did hedge fund private equity blah. Anyway, some money-moving manoeuvre earned this chap a handsome bonus. Well done, fella. He went out and bought himself a low-slung supercar. Only to find that the roads were too shit to drive on without knackering the stupid thing. Keeping my schadenfreude at bay as best I can, I suggest potholes are a metaphor; potholes are policy failure.I try not to subscribe to the idea of Britain being broken, but looking into a pothole which just shredded a front tyre, it’s hard not to succumb. It shouldn’t be there. It’s not my fault. Someone has blundered. Or someone – on local roads the local council – hasn’t got the resources not to blunder. This might be their fault, it might not. If it’s a big road, it’ll probably be some agency or other responsible. Either way, there’s no one to call, certainly no one to say: “Oh, I’m sorry, we better pay for your tyre to be fixed.” There’s probably some mechanism for suing someone, but I doubt it would get anywhere and it shouldn’t come to that anyway. How about my car insurance? Hilarious suggestion. Just calling them to ask could count against me come renewal time. A pox on the whole sorry business. Moan over.

It spills as it lands on the bar, sending a little eddy of suds down the glass, into the lattice of branded rubber matting, a place where neither scrubbing brushes nor a desperate human tongue can penetrate. Typical. My5p Reform windfall, gone in the clumsy flick of a wrist. I guard the pint carefully as I weave a perilous path to my table, quietly satisfied at pushing another struggling family closer to penury.Still, what is the pub if not a place for letting loose and sidestepping the usual laws of economics? It is surely no accident thatNigel Faragechose a Westminster boozer to launch his latest crime against mathematics last week, promising a £3bn tax relief for the hospitality sector – equivalent to 5p off a pint – to be paid for by the reinstatement of the two-child benefit cap.Never mind that HMRC’s own estimates blow a hole in his sums, assessing his buffet of inducements atabout £10bn more than budgeted. Within these four wood-panelled walls, anything goes. The questions will be softball and the banter will be legendary. No mate, no no mate, hear me out. You know how Labour took450,000 childrenout of poverty? What if we put them back in … and spent the money on pints for the lads instead?But, of course, attention to fiscal detail has never really been part of Reform UK’s personal brand. The optics are the point here, and while it was very sweet of the Labour press office to put out apolicy-based rebuttal– extension of World Cup opening hours, something called the hospitality support fund – as with most pub debates this is not really an argument that can be won with facts and figures. A more urgent and pertinent question is why the hard right has increasingly chosen this as its battleground, why this most public of spaces is becoming a sphere of political contention.Like many former public schoolboys, Farage loves to romanticise the pub as a sort of keyboard shortcut to working-class authenticity. One of his earlyGB Newssegments was called Talking Pints, where Farage and a guest would sit in a Paddington studio against an electronic backdrop of a traditional English pub, sipping from a beer placed in front of them by a member of the production staff and talking about, I dunno, probably “woke”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer pulls a pint at the Chainlocker pub in Falmouth in 2020.Photograph: Hugh Hastings/Getty ImagesThe same aesthetic survives today on Talk’s Sunday-afternoon show Grumpy Old Men, a show I swear was commissioned for the sole purpose of generating standup material for Stewart Lee. In it, three men sit in a similar studio in front of a similar pub backdrop and moan about topics ranging from Ulez to veganism to people who sneeze, with a rage so effortless and pure that you could almost swear they were producing it on demand for money.And so when the likes of Farage talk about saving the great British pub, when Reform’s Lee Anderson says “every pub is a parliament”, they are really evoking a very specific image: “a stereotype of pubs as spaces for older white men to sit and drink,” as the Green MPSiân Berry puts it. A kind of pub cosplay, the safety and impunity of an imagined past, a refuge where old white lads can say whatever they like without ever being challenged.Naturally this is a place shorn of society’s inconveniences: Muslims, families, the young people increasingly forsaking the pub for sobriety, digital socialising and cheaper supermarket drinking. Occasionally Grumpy Old Men will invite a woman on to the panel, who will be deemed an “honorary bloke” and have a moustache drawn on her.And the reason that this is fertile ground for the right is that for a broad swathe of society, the pub is objectively a brilliant invention. You love the pub. I love the pub. Indeed, I am typing these very words from a pub (The Sun of Camberwell). About 78% of these columns are written in the pub, and particularly attentive readers will invariably be able to spot the bit when the fourth pint begins to kick in and the hard details begin to blur into unfocused polemic, run-on sentences, made-up numbers.But the danger arises when we confuse one particular vision of the pub, one demographic, for the whole experience. The real beauty of the great British pub is its sheer versatility, the way the setting moulds around its people, the ability to choose your own adventure: desi pub, country pub, chain pub, gastropub, darts pub, gay pub, old man pub, gay old man pub, the pub with the trans pride flag hanging behind the bar, the pub with £20 roasts and a dog bowl in the corner, the pub that smells of hair where the pool table can be unlocked with a single well-placed hair clip.And while pubs are closing up and down the country – aboutone a day across 2024 and 2025– arguably as big a danger is the increasing homogeneity of the pubs that remain: devoured by the big chains, caught in a deadly pincer movement of societal change, institutional neglect and hostile licensing regulations. It is a handy fiction to imagine that all this can be fixed through tax tweaks alone, particularly from a party in thrall toneoliberal economicsandsuper-rich donors, being cheered on by the chair of Wetherspoons and the chief executive of Fuller’s.This is, in short, a battle that can still be won. Perhaps not by Labour, with its soiled reputation and talent for unintelligible jargon, but by those willing to fight for the simple malleable joy of the pub in all its forms. To reject the ersatz fantasy economics of Reform and its backers, a vision of the pub rooted in a past that never existed. Because – and every seasoned drinker knows this instinctively – every pub also has its crashing bores.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPubsOpinionReform UKNigel FarageGB NewscommentShareReuse this content"

British electricity prices in 2030 would be higher than they were in 2022 after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine,said Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas-owning Centrica. If he’s right, the implications may matter more for those MPs’ re-election prospects than if or when the prime minister goes.O’Shea was not making a point about net zero. He was merely saying all options for the necessary upgrade of the country’s energy infrastructure were expensive. “We’ve underinvested in the system for many years, and whether it’s the cost of building a new gas-fired power station or a new windfarm, the costs have gone up,” he said.Well, quite. The energy secretary Ed Miliband’s“record” auction for offshore wind last monthwas declared a triumph because guaranteed prices for developers did not come out at the nose-bleed levels that had been feared, but nobody can call £91 a megawatt hour for 20 years a bargain when the past year’s wholesale price for electricity was £80-ish.Equally, though, the government probably has a point when it says the gas-fired route would be expensive because the price of turbines has gone through the roof (though we may have to buy a few anyway because today’s fleet of gas stations is ageing and some will be needed as backup).Nor are Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C nuclear plants, or the comingsmall modular reactors, cheap. And, behind it all, sitsthe enormous £80bn-ish upgrade of the transmission gridout to 2031, a chunk of which would be required under all scenarios – indeed, some of it relates to gas.O’Shea’s prediction is not controversial, even if it’s striking to hear it spelled out starkly. Most mainstream energy analysts who crunch the numbers on the interplay between falling wholesale prices (because gas will be less influential) and higher network costs (because of the fixed-price contracts for renewables and nuclear and the extra spending on pylons and cables) end up concluding that system-wide savings only start to arrive sometime about 2040.One can quibble over details – and O’Shea was probably referring to the 2022 average price of electricity, not the peak – but one gets the broad picture. The direction is probably up a bit for the next few years.The government seems to have accepted as much because it has given up claiming its 2030 clean energy plan will – of itself – bring down household bills by £300. From April £150 is being removed by shifting a potion of costs into general taxation. It may be the future mechanism too because Miliband, in front of the energy select committee on Wednesday, called the £150 a “downpayment” by the chancellor to meet his £300 promise on household bills. Let’s hope Rachel Reeves realises.That still leaves British business exposed to some of the highest industrial electricity prices in the world. One can’t say the government is doing nothing because 500 companies in the most energy-intensive industries will get bigger discounts on their network charges via the established “supercharger” scheme.But that hardly adds up to a rounded strategy to address the inevitable consequences for growth and competitiveness. A “British industrial competitiveness scheme” for another 7,000 companies will arrive in April next year but ministers have yet to say who will qualify or what savings in electricity bills of “up to” 25% will mean. It’s vague stuff.Meanwhile, look at the mood of despair in vital manufacturing sectors. The Chemical Industries Association this weekpredicted more closures, on top of the 25 sites that have gone over the past five years. “One of the biggest pressures on the sector has been the crippling cost of energy – needed to not only run factories but also as a feedstock, underpinning production processes,” said its chief executive, Steve Elliott. “In the UK these costs continue to be as much as four times higher than in some key competitor countries – with government policy significantly reinforcing that differential.”Complaints go beyond high electricity prices – theyre also about carbon taxes out of line with those of other countries, unsustainable decarbonisation deadlines and the run-down of the North Sea. The net result, though, is loss of competitiveness in core industries that, according to the government’s own industrial strategy, will be critical in supplying the chosen “high-growth” sectors, including life sciences, defence and advanced manufacturing.Scunthorpe’s steelworkswas rescuedand Ineos’s chemicals plant at Grangemouthgot £120m of fundingto save the UK’s last ethylene plant. But they were 11th-hour interventions made when ministers judged the alternatives to be worse. They don’t add up to a strategy for industry to live with high electricity costs. If prices will be even higher by the end of decade, Labour needs to find some answers. Economic growth used to be its top priority.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryNils Pratley on financeEnergy billsManufacturing sectorUtilitiesCentricaConsumer affairscommentShareReuse this content"

But her broadside on TV punditry is another own goal, empowering the most chauvinistic commentatorsWed 11 Feb 2026 13.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 14.10 ESTShareIs this what Eni Aluko envisioned? Did she think reigniting the somewhat one-sided row between herself and fellow punditIan Wrightwould resurrect her broadcasting career or make Wright reflect differently on the incident that she triggered 10 months ago? If so, the exercise has failed and we sit staring at an overwhelmingly sad and depressing episode that is showing no sign of quieting down.No one credible would dispute Aluko’s record as a player. Her 105 caps and 33 goals for England, involvement in five major international tournaments, four FA Cup wins, three WSL titles and Serie A and Coppa Italia medals speak for themselves.Ditto her record as a fighter against racism and sexism and for equality, having played a role in the improvement of the central contracts England players benefited from for many years. She challenged the actions of Mark Sampson and the Football Association’s handling of allegations of racism against the former England manager (the claims were later dismissed), and, more recently, saw Joey Barton receive a suspended prison sentence for sending grossly offensive messages to her, fellow pundit Lucy Ward and broadcaster Jeremy Vine.It is important to acknowledge her role in punditry too, with Aluko among the vanguard of former women’s players going into broadcasting. In 2014 she was the first woman to appear as a pundit on Match of the Day.Aluko is clearly hugely frustrated at having slipped down the punditry pecking order and has highlighted her 11 years in broadcasting as evidence of her quality. Most recently, in one of two interviews with the 90s Baby Show podcast, she targeted the inclusion of Wright and Nedum Onuoha among a six-strong punditry team covering the 2025 Women’s Euros final across the BBC and ITV, while she and her former England teammate Fara Williams were in the stands.That, she said, was an example of opportunities in the industry being taken by men. She also accused Wright of failing to champion her in the way he had when allying with Gary Lineker when he was taken off air by the BBC for criticising the government’s asylum policy.Aluko then compounded the problem by appearing on TalkSport alongside Simon Jordan, because the former Crystal Palace chairman was never going to agree and she was never going to win. And no one should have to put up with the way he spoke about her.Her interventions this week were a doubling down on personalisation of the same criticismshe made in April last year on Woman’s Houron BBC Radio 4 when she accused Wright of hogging broadcast opportunities in women’s football and “blocking” the pathway for women. “He’s aware of just how much he’s doing in the women’s game,” she said then. “I think he should be aware of that. We need to be conscious, and we need to make sure that women are not being blocked from having a pathway into broadcasting in the women’s game.”Aluko apologised to Wrightafter being widely criticised.Wright did not accept the apology. This week on Wright and Onuoha, she said: “Out of six punditry spots, two have gone to men. Meanwhile, you’ve got 290 caps [277 caps between Aluko and Williams], whatever it is, sitting in the stands. It’s nothing against Ian, it’s nothing against them, I’m just saying broadly speaking we need to be aware of that because if we’re building a game where the limited opportunities are now being taken by men, where we can’t go into the men’s game and get the same opportunities, we’re stuck.”At points Aluko’s comments are wild, such as the suggestion that the number of caps gives a measure for the quality of the pundit, but there are seeds of good points. Before her comment about Wright in April, she said: “If we had a situation where there was an equal opportunity in the men’s game for broadcasters and coaches that there is in the women’s game, it’s a free-for-all. But that’s not the case. I can’t dominate the men’s game in the way that you used Ian as an example.”This is a valid comment that highlights the lack of opportunities for female pundits in the men’s game, with few trusted to give their views on the biggest domestic or international fixtures. Whether you agree that one solution could be to prioritise women in the coverage of the women’s game doesn’t really matter; it spotlights the lack of trust broadcasters have in some of their best female talent when it comes to coverage of the men’s game at the highest level.It is important when discussing Aluko’s comments that we do not sugarcoat the state of representation across sports broadcasting, or the sports media landscape more widely. The industry is woefully lacking diversity-wise and far from free of racism and sexism, whether overt, more subtle or micro-aggressions. This needs to be questioned and challenged. Aluko is among those who have drawn attention to these problems time and again.However, many believe Aluko has fallen out of favour because pundits who have emerged since she started are far better and have progressed faster and further. Female pundits who are excelling across the women’s and men’s game, such as Izzy Christiansen, Anita Asante, Karen Carney, Alex Scott, Emma Hayes and Lucy Ward, are proving that broadcasters will put women on air, even if there are still valid arguments about them not all being given higher-profile games.This does not mean it is OK for trolls online to share clips of errors Aluko has made on air, or to abuse her. Any presenter, pundit or commentator makes embarrassing errors and they are not a true reflection of an individual’s quality. The rounding on Aluko since she first spoke about Wright has been inappropriate, borderline racist at times and vicious. Some people will never believe she or any woman should have a role in coverage of the men’s game.But her views come across as self-serving rather than aimed at progressing opportunities for women, and that is empowering the most chauvinistic commentators and the anti-DEI brigade.Wright doesn’t have to champion Aluko and shouldn’t be expected to. There is a big danger in the idea that the success or rise of any woman is good for all women, and the same can be said for Black and ethnic minority groups and other minority groups. In all walks of life this idea is increasingly perpetuated. For example, what matters more, that the minister for women and equalities is a woman, regardless of their politics, or that the minister for women and equalities is politically and ideologically engaged with, and committed to, tackling the issues affecting women?Wright stuck up for Linekerprobably primarily because he was against the BBC’s handling of the situation and disagrees with restrictions on what public figures associated with the BBC can and can’t say online, and also possibly because he agreed with the premise of Lineker’s posts.There is no onus on him or anyone else to back someone because of their gender or skin colour. If Wright doesn’t believe Aluko is a good pundit, if he doesn’t want to align himself with someone who handles themselves in the manner Aluko has of late, or if he doesn’t agree with her worldviews, that is OK.Wright is one of the most beloved and genuine of women’s football fans and allies, who has time and again shown that his passion for the women’s game is authentic and deep, and targeting him is another massive own goal from Aluko, who is eroding all the good of her legacy.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballIan WrightcommentShareReuse this content"

Peter Mandelson’s peerage was not directly related to his appointment as ambassador to Washington, but nor was it irrelevant. He enjoyed the status bestowed by a seat in the Lords during many years of friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. Although he has voluntarily resigned from active membership of parliament, Lord Mandelson’s title can only berescindedby special statute. That is a reminder of the absurdity in a system that empowers party leaders to dole out places in the legislature to friends and supporters, with no obligation ever to face judgment by the electorate.Sir Keir is now under yet more pressure related to a peer. Earlier this week, Labour suspended the Lords whip from Matthew Doyle, a former Downing Street director of communications, whocampaignedin council elections on behalf of a friend who had been charged with possessing indecent images of children. Lord Doyle says he had believed his friend was innocent. No 10 says he didnot give a full accountof the facts when the peerage was awarded.Conservatives say the episode is another display of the prime minister’s terrible judgment in making appointments. But they do not call forwider reforms, still less a clear-out of unsuitable peers, because the Lords is stuffed with Tory donors, cronies and aides with tenuous credentials to be legislators for life.Labour understood this issue well enough in opposition. The party’s 2024 manifesto promised an extensive process of “immediate reform” of the Lords. The last remaining hereditary peers would go. The appointments process and other accountability mechanisms would be strengthened to uphold standards. Ultimately, the whole house would be replaced with a “more representative” second chamber.Progress on implementation has been slow. Abillto scrap hereditary peerages was introduced in the Commons in September 2024, delayed anddiluted in the Lords, and has yet to receive royal assent. Other planned reforms have been referred to a committee that is not due to report until July. There is no talk of abolishing the upper house, nor even a consultation on what might replace it.That loss of ambition was predictable. Constitutional reform is hard. Persuading a chamber of peers to accept change, let alone abolish itself, was always going toconsume bandwidththat Downing Street would rather use elsewhere. It is low on most voters’ list of priorities; not “a doorstep issue”, say political strategists.But dysfunction in Britain’s governing institutions has a way of cutting through to the public, as recent scandals have demonstrated. Trust in the political process and contempt for a system deemed to be inherently corrupt – run for the benefit of elites – is very much a doorstep issue. Avoiding constitutional reform on the basis that it takes up too much time for insufficient political reward is a false economy.Sir Keir’s instincts in opposition were the right ones. The rotten apparatus of sleazy patronage and power without accountability is not peripheral to his government’s dismal ratings. It is one of the things he promised to change and that has stayed the same. He would be in a stronger position now if he had addressed the issue with reforming zeal on first entering Downing Street. It is not too late.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This week, in what is being billed as a “leaders’ retreat”, a remote castle in the Belgian countryside has been selected for an EU summit on competitiveness. The pastoral setting may soothe the spirits of attending heads of state; but it belies the urgency of the debate they need to have.Europe in the postwar period has never felt so insecure. Mr Trump’s America First administration has made clear its intention tobullythe continent economically through tariffs and threats, and the transatlantic alliance can no longer be relied upon for its defence. Hi-techcompetitionfrom China threatens to overwhelm European industry’s attempts to keep up in key areas, such as the green transition. Across the European Union, support for the far right is on the rise.Against this sombre backdrop, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is surely right to suggest that business as usual cannot be an option. He and others arepushingfor a newly assertive “Made in Europe” industrial strategy, versions of which will dominate the summit’s agenda. On defence, this is already the EU’s direction of travel:Security Action for Europe (Safe), its new joint defence-procurement scheme, mandates that the lion’s share of purchases are made from EU members, or closely associated countries.In a newly volatile world, that makes obvious sense. Mr Macron argues that the same “European preference” criterion should be applied more broadly across strategic sectors, a view shared by the European Commission. In a recent intervention signed by hundreds of business leaders, the commissioner for industrial strategy, Stéphane Séjourné,wrote: “Whenever European public money is spent in Europe, it must contribute to European production and quality jobs.”Unsurprisingly, given the EU’s traditional commitment to global free trade, and hostility to any whiff of protectionism, sceptics have been quick to push back. German carmakers, whose manufacturing operations are worldwide, havevoicedtheir concerns. Baltic and Nordic member states have sounded the alarm over potential retaliation by third countries. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, a former BlackRock executive, hasteamed upwith Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, to put forward an alternative growth agenda based on deregulation and restricting the scope of Brussels bureaucracy.Such divisions encapsulate the dilemmas involved. Any “buy-European” approach would certainly need to be carefully calibrated to ensure that benefits in terms of jobs and strategic autonomy are not outweighed by geopolitical downsides. But, if combined with turbo-charged investment in areas such as green technology and tech – as the former president of the European Central bank, Mario Draghi, has consistently advocated – it could give the EU the self-confidence, and the means, to properly leverage a single market of 450 million people.In a brutally transactional world, the priority in Brussels and European capitals must be to find a way to level a skewed economic playing field with Washington and Beijing. As Mr Séjourné puts it: “The Chinese have ‘Made in China’, the Americans have ‘Buy American’, and most other economic powers have similar schemes … So why not us?” It’s a good question.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But can I offer a word of caution?There is talk of remaking the Lords as another elected chamber. I think that would be a mistake. It would generate a competing democratic mandate, which is the last thing we need (just look at the US if you need proof). What is required is a chamber devoted to scrutiny (of draft legislation and executive action), advice and accountability in public office.Its members should be experts in their field, people of proven ability, untrammelled by party allegiance, nominated by the public but chosen by Commons free vote, and should hold office for a fixed term of five years. The chamber would not be able to defeat Commons legislation, but could delay it for the purpose of proper scrutiny.The Commons, too, would need to accept change. To put the executive back in its place, they would have to abolish whipping, take back control of the timetable and undertake to give due consideration to what the hopefully re-named Lords (how about “Senate” instead?) advised, rather than acting as a rubber stamp for the executive. Who knows? In a few years we could actually achieve representative democracy.Chris HouseHertfordJenny Jonesis of course quite right to say that a better way must be found to select members of an essential second house, but even if you posited holding a general election as a selection process, someone would have to propose the names on the voting papers. A respected group is needed to make the proposals: it might eventually be the job of the privy council, but currently there is little reason for voters to trust any proposals that that group would make.There is only one group of people who might have sufficient respect from the voters, and these are a few of the female members of the royal family – sorry to add to your workload, Anne, but you’re younger than me.John DavenportKenley, LondonJenny Jones’s thoughts on theHouse of Lordsand its occupants remind me why it has long been my opinion that the only members of the House of Lords who shouldnotbe ejected are the hereditary and the episcopal peers still present. They alone are not there due to political patronage, or to their having made party political donations; they alone may be hoped to hold an objective and principled view of such legislation as comes their way. Eject every last life peer from the House of Lords; retain only the hereditary and episcopal peers.Robert DewarKinlochleven, Inverness-shireThe Green peer Jenny Jones attests to her own conscientiousness and that of some others, but ends her piece by saying it’s way past time to abolish the House of Lords and “urgently replace it with something elected and modern”.I hope that several of our political parties have their blueprints ready. The combined scandal of the Peter Mandelson revelations and the deliberate filibuster of the assisted dying bill means that the end of the House of Lords, in its present unelected form, must now be very close. When the latter bill falls, public outrage against the Lords will be unsurpassed.Nick WattsKettering, NorthamptonshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The tone varies, but that is the general message we have grown up with.Of course, the financial inability to have children is a strong and valid argument, and probably the more rational one. But when you have been conditioned to believe that the very idea of a viable future is limited, deeper and more emotional concerns come into play.Perhaps if governments began acting in ways that demonstrated a genuine commitment to the future of our habitat, people would feel more inclined to populate it.Daniel WhittingtonPuteaux, FranceImagine receiving such a letter just after having a miscarriage, or after a breakup with a long-term partner, or worse, if you know you can’t have children.My daughter was born in Sweden, where they had more than a year’s maternity leave to be shared between parents, and subsidised childcare. (Nowadays, Sweden also has declining birth rates.) Standard maternity leave in France is stillfour months. One of my friends had a breakdown when she had to go back to work and leave her three-month-old baby with a childminder.Name and address suppliedI read this article with some dismay. Rather than advocating a “mind your own business” approach, Zoe Williams might have been better advised to consider the huge emotional cost to women and men of leaving conception too late. I recently met an NHS gynaecologist who routinely visits schools to remind pupils of the limits on their fertility.In an age of virtually unlimited choice, it is hard for many young people to understand that in this particular issue there are no guarantees about your “choice”. The French government is taking a dynamic, proactive approach to this sensitive and emotive issue and I do wish Zoe had paused to consider the broader view.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

TheTeam GBpair had dreamed of becoming the first British Olympic skating medallists since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1992. Instead, they endured a nightmare on ice.Their chances went barely a minute into their free dance routine. The crowd had just started to clap boisterously along to the Proclaimers’ hit I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles), when Fear stumbled and lost her balance through the twizzle sequence.Winter Olympics 2026: France beat USA to figure skating gold as GB’s wait for medal goes on – liveRead moreOne yellow box, a signal of a technical error, quickly became two and, instead of eyeing bronze, they slumped down the rankings from fourth after the rhythm dance on Monday to seventh.“I can’t believe I just did that,” Fear said. “I feel so bad, I’m devastated. I’m in shock. It’s such a shame because I know what we’re capable of. I just feel so bad. I don’t have the words yet and it will take a while to process it.”Asked to describe what had happened, she said: “Just a really costly technical mistake, which was tough very early in the programme because I knew that we lost bronze at that point.“But I also really wanted to not let the Olympic experience just disappear because of that, so it’s this battle of taking it in and doing my best the rest of the way while also knowing what I’d just done.”Gibson agreed. “When you don’t perform the way you want to on any day it’s tough to take, but at the Olympic Games it’s even harder,” he said.Gold went to the controversial French couple, Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron, with 225.82 points, after their routine earned them a top-scoring 135.64pts. Not everyone in the arena was convinced that such a high score was justified.The pair, who teamed up last year when Fournier Beaudry changed her citizenship from Canada to France, have faced deeper scrutiny. Part of that is down to allegations made by Cizeron’s former partner, Gabriella Papadakis, and the suspension of Fournier Beaudry’s former partner, Nikolaj Sørensen.View image in fullscreenThe gold medal winners Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron of France.Photograph: Claudia Greco/ReutersIn January, Papadakis’s memoir, So as Not to Disappear, called Cizeron “controlling” and “demanding”, allegations he has described as defamatory. When asked last week about the book, Cizeron said: “I’ve said everything that I needed to say on that subject.”In 2024 Sørensen was suspended for six years by Canada’s Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner for sexual maltreatment. The suspension has been overturned by the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada on jurisdictional grounds.The American couple, Madison Chock and Evan Bates, the reigning three‑time world champions, had to settle for silver on 224.39pts, after scoring 134.67 in their free dance routine.The one consolation for Fear and Gibson? Even if they had skated their best they probably would not have beaten the 217.73 by the Canadian pair of Paul Poirier and Piper Gilles, who claimed bronze.Fear’s and Gibson’s free dance score of 118.35 – 12th in the section – gave them an overall score of 204.32. Fear was in tears afterwards.Jon Eley, the performance director at British Ice Skating, said their routine did not reflect their quality. “I’m gutted,” he said.“They have shown over the last cycle and this season as well how good they really are. It was at the end of a sequence of twizzles, which had cost them points.“They practise it multiple times a day. It’s one of the toughest moves in ice dance. They are pushing the limits with all the different things they do. For them not to deliver on this stage is upsetting for them and us.”Fear tried to look on the bright side when asked what she would say to her eight-year-old self.“I think my eight-year-old self would be really proud of me,” she said. “I wanted to come out here and enjoy the Olympic experience and skate for me and skate for Lewis.”The pain was evident in her words. The performance means that British skating will have to wait even longer to scratch the itch that has been around since the early 1990s, while Team GB’s humdrum start to these Games goes on.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She denied the crime for three years, claiming she had been a victim of identity theft, before finally admitting her guilt in a court hearing in Albertville last October after she was found to have photos of the credit card on her phone. “I confess the accusations but I don’t remember committing them,” she said at the time. “It’s like a blackout.”Simon explained at the time that she found her actions “incomprehensible” and that she was “working with a psychologist to understand what happened”.

But in this time of full‑scale war some things are really more important than medals. At this point, I would say a medal is worthless in comparison to people’s lives and, I believe, in comparison to the memory of these athletes.”The IOC maintains that under Article 50 of the Olympic Charter, political statements are forbidden while in competition. However, theUkrainedelegation insists the helmet does not violate any laws because the helmet is about remembrance. It is unclear whether the IOC will allow Heraskevych to make his first run before disqualifying him or try to stop him before the start.View image in fullscreenVladyslav Heraskevych wears his helmet during practice on Wednesday, in which he recorded the quickest time.Photograph: Andrea Solero/EPA“The IOC has turned the situation with the ‘memory helmet’ into a theatre of the absurd,” Heraskevych said. “It is obvious that it does not violate any IOC rules.”The IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that while Heraskevych could wear a black armband, and speak to the press, he would not be allowed to wear the helmet in competition.“He can, and we would encourage him, to express his grief, but let me be clear,” he said. “It’s not the message, it’s the place that counts. There are 130 conflicts going on in the world. We cannot have 130 different conflicts featured, however terrible they are, during the field of play, during the actual competition.Asked what would happen if Heraskevych tried to wear his helmet in competition, Adams said: “I don’t think it is helpful to speculate. But obviously there are rules and regulations that the athletes themselves want us to enforce, and they will ultimately be enforced.”Adams also pointed to how the USA skater Maxim Naumov, wholost his parents in the Potomac air collision last year, had honoured them byshowing a photograph after he competed on Tuesday.“It’s a very emotional, very human, spontaneous human gesture,” he said. “In a sense it highlights what we are saying, this Ukrainian athlete, he can do the same. And we have loosened the rules – we are offering him to wear a black armband to commemorate his friends and colleagues who’ve lost their lives.“But for us, and for the athletes more importantly, the field of play is sacrosanct.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026International Olympic CommitteeWinter OlympicsUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

But when confirmation finally came, the 21-year-old American could celebrate his first Olympic gold medal – and the opening chapter of what could become one of the defining campaigns of the Milano CortinaWinter Olympics.Skating in the second-to-last group, Stolz powered to an Olympic record time of 1min 6.28sec in the men’s 1000 metres, using a devastating final lap to deliver in his signature event and launch his pursuit of a potential four-gold haul across these Games.His time ultimately stood after a brief period of uncertainty triggered by a late-race judging decision that granted a reskate to Joep Wennemars – whoended Stolz’s two-year world championship reignat the distance last March – after it was ruled that the Dutch skater had been hindered earlier in the competition. The delay forced Stolz, Jenning de Boo and the rest of the field to wait nearly 15 minutes for Wennemars to skate again .At least 90% of the packed arena wore Dutch orange and the rollicking crowd roared “Joep! Joep! Joep!” as Wennemars returned to the ice. Skating alone, he never threatened Stolz’s mark. When he crossed the line more than two seconds off the pace, Stolz could finally celebrate, gliding through a slow victory lap with the US flag held aloft before posing for photos with his longtime coach, Bob Corby.Skating head-to-head with Dutch contender De Boo in the penultimate heat, Stolz did not threaten his own world record of 1:05.37, but comfortably lowered the Olympic mark of 1:07.18, which had stood for nearly a quarter century. His margin over De Boo – half a second – was commanding by 1000m standards, with China’s Ning Zhongyan taking bronze in 1:07.34.“It is not like it is different from any other race,” said Stolz, who finished 14th in the 1000m and 13th in the 500m as a 17-year-old Olympic debutant in Beijing. “It is just the fact you waited the last four years to finally get here again, and you get one shot to try and battle, which I was able to do. Just [a] feeling like no other.”Performing under the weight of dizzying expectations, Stolz responded with the same controlled, clinical skating that has defined his rise over the past three seasons. The race itself unfolded almost exactly along the blueprint that has made him dominant. Stolz opened aggressively but not recklessly, hitting the 200m split in 16.18 seconds – among the fastest early splits of the night – before settling into rhythm through 600m in 40.62.From there, he did what he has done all winter: closed harder than almost anyone in the field. His final lap of 25.66 seconds was among the strongest of the contenders and decisive against De Boo, who led early but faded slightly over the final circuit.De Boo’s intermediate splits underlined how narrow the margins were. The Dutchman was marginally faster early – 16.06 to 200m and 40.25 at 600m – but could not match Stolz’s closing speed, giving up more than three-tenths over the final lap alone.The final standings reflected the depth of the field but also the clarity at the top: Stolz first in 1:06.28, De Boo second in 1:06.78, Ning third, with Poland’s Damian Żurek fourth and Wennemars fifth after the reskate.The reskate itself added an unusual layer to an Olympic final that otherwise followed expected lines. Wennemars, initially timed at 1:07.58 and later granted another attempt under obstruction rules, failed to improve his mark on the second attempt, leaving the podium unchanged.Wennemars cut a devastated figure afterward, saying the collision that led to the reskate had effectively ended his medal chances.“My Olympic dream has been ripped apart. I am heartbroken, this is just horrible,” he said. “I was just racing my own line and then the Chinese guy blocked my road. I was fucked. I do not know what else to say.”He added that being asked to return to the ice so quickly – and to skate alone rather than head-to-head – left him at a clear competitive disadvantage.“The only way to still get a medal was to do the re-skate,” he said. “But in two days’ time nobody will be thinking about this moment, and I will still be without a medal.”For Stolz, the win immediately established him as one of the central figures of these Games and kept alive the possibility of a medal run rarely seen in Winter Olympic history.Stolz entered Milan targeting medals – and potentially gold – in four events: the 500m, 1000m, 1500m and the unpredictable mass start. Were he to complete the sprint treble as he did at two of the past three world championships, Stolz would become only the second American to win more than two golds at a single Winter Games – and the first since fellow speed skater Eric Heiden, whose five-gold sweep in 1980 remains one of the towering individual achievements in all of sport.Stolz has consistently resisted those comparisons.“I try not to think about the pressure too much,” he said earlier this week. “Once you get to the line, it’s the same thing you’ve been doing for years. Everything around you is just noise.”The numbers behind the hype have been difficult to ignore. Stolz entered the race as the world record holder and a two-time world champion at the distance. He was unbeaten in the 1000m on the World Cup circuit this season and has dominated global sprint speed skating since 2023, winning seven of nine possible world titles at the shorter distances over that stretch.The 1000m has historically been Dutch territory – the Netherlands had won the event at the previous three Winter Games – and the Milan field included multiple legitimate threats, including De Boo, Żurek and former Olympic champion Kjeld Nuis.For the United States, any medal would have ended a podium drought stretching back to Vancouver 2010. Instead, Stolz delivered something larger: the first Olympic gold of what could become a defining Games.His rise has followed a trajectory rarely seen in modern winter sport. Raised in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, he learned to skate on a backyard pond before developing at the Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee, emerging as a teenage prodigy with near-perfect natural technique. By 20, he was world all-round champion – the youngest since Heiden.What separates him from many champions is not just speed, but process. Stolz approaches skating like an engineering problem, obsessing over blade curvature, ice density and marginal aerodynamic gains in pursuit of what he calls “free speed”.The Milan venue itself added early-Games uncertainty. Built as a temporary Olympic track after outdoor venue plans were scrapped, the ice surface has produced some of the fastest Olympic times on record – another variable Stolz historically treats as something to solve rather than fear.The win now turns attention to the rest of his Olympic schedule. The 500m follows Saturday, with the 1500m next week and the mass start closing the long-track program. But Wednesday reinforced the same theme that has followed Stolz all winter: if he skates clean, he is extraordinarily difficult to beat.“It’s hard to say you will win four gold medals, if you haven’t even won one yet,” Stolz said. “Now that I’ve won one, I know what to expect. I felt how the crowd is, the energy, the ice. I think it’s going to be good.”Explore more on these topicsJordan StolzSpeed skatingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

On ­Sunday,they defeated Liverpoolat Anfield, on Wednesday they downed ­Fulham at home to reel off a 20th consecutive victory against them.The rosiest moment for the title challengers was Erling Haaland’s 39th‑minute strike, a first in the competition from open play in nine games, though more con­cerning was his removal at the break, when City led 3-0.Virgil van Dijk rises to occasion as Liverpool end Sunderland recordRead more“Niggles,” Pep Guardiola said. “Fatigue. He said: ‘I don’t feel comfortable.’ With 3-0 and a lot of games and having Omar [Marmoush] – common sense to take him off.”The clean sheet raises City’s goal difference to +30, two behind Arsenal. Who knows: the metric may prove the decider when the crown is handed out in May. Guardiola, though, refused to embrace City being three points behind the Gunners.“We are not three points before they play Brentford, after that we’ll see,” he said. “It’s more important how we can be more consistent over 90 minutes. But a really good performance, one of the best. After Anfield it is important – these emotional games – the next one is always tricky.”You had to go back to April 2009 for the last timeFulhamdefeated City when a Clint Dempsey double helped them to secure a 3-1 win here. Since then, the aggregate score was 53‑21 to the home team – a terrible statistic for the visitors that would plunge further.Phil Foden, back in the league XI for the first time in five games, had a volley from outside the area deflected. Then, from inside, saw a shot saved by Bernd Leno.In continual rain, Marco Silva bemoaned Harry Wilson going backwards along the right, but a press ­featuring Antoine Semenyo, ­Haaland, Nico O’Reilly, Foden and Rodri meant he had scant other choice.Semenyo opened the scoring when Rodri sprayed a pass left to Matheus Nunes, he crossed, and Haaland leaped and missed, which caused Sander Berge to head towards his goal, where the forward struck for a fifth in eighth appearances.Next came Kenny Tete pulling Semenyo’s hair as City crowded ­Fulham’s area. “I went to attack the corner and I just felt a tug on my hair, I let the referee know,” ­Semenyo said. “They checked it and said there wasn’t enough.”View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo slides home Manchester City’s first goal against Fulham.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesFulham’s concession of O’Reilly’s second came when Haaland stretched to feed him near halfway and was taken down by Joachim Andersen. O’Reilly found Semenyo, carried on along the left, took the return and defeated Leno. City celebrated and Andersen was booked by Paul ­Tierney for the challenge.Fulham needed to steady themselves, but failed as Haaland scored. Receiving from Foden near the D a touch tipped the ball on to his left and he drilled beyond Leno.After a misplaced Marc Guéhi header allowed Wilson to feed Emile Smith Rowe, who narrowly missed, Guardiola ended the period jumping at his side’s laxness.In the reverse, helter-skelter ­fixture, City were 4-1 up by 48 ­minutes and ended hanging on fora 5-4 win. Could Fulham engineer something similar? No, was the answer despite there being no Haaland to contend with for the second half.City popped the ball about but Guardiola was no happier, so Tijjani Reijnders and Abdukodir ­Khusanov entered for Bernardo Silva and Nunes, as Silva made a triple change – Kevin, Rodrigo Muniz and Josh King for Samuel Chukwueze, Smith Rowe and Raul Jiménez.When Rodri, Guéhi and ­Khusanov combined near their goal ­suddenly City were upfield and Foden could release Semenyo: the move ­faltered but the flow here was City in their best mode.A Foden challenge on Calvin ­Bassey had him booked as City sought to slow the contest and protect the lead. Helpful, too, was a Wilson corner – a rarity for Fulham – he overhit all the way over to the left.By 70 minutes Rayan Cherki and Nico González were involved, as ­Guardiola freshened the legs more – Rodri and Foden making way – this after Donnarumma repelled, low, a Muniz effort.As the game petered out, Donnarumma tipped over from King, but with 12 games left City are where Guardiola wants them: in the hunt.Silva said: “Not good enough from us, we were not at the level and the demands of a game like this one. We didn’t play in the way we are capable of playing.”They were, in fact, very far off what was required.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In finally ending Sunderland’s proud unbeaten home record in thePremier League, sixth placed Liverpool left themselves only three points adrift Manchester United and two behind Chelsea.Sunderland 0-1 Liverpool: Premier League – liveRead moreRégis Le Bris’s intelligent and well organised side did not surrender lightly but, with the excellent Florian Wirtz continuing to go from strength to strength in the No 10 role, Liverpool looked like champions and deserved to edge a match decided by Virgil van Dijk’s header from Mo Salah’s second-half corner.The only downside for Slot was the nasty looking ankle injury sustained by his stand-in right-back, Wataru Endo. Liverpool’s manager said it “did not look good” and he expects Endo to be “out for a long, long, time. It’s a serious one but how serious we don’t know. It will be assessed tomorrow.”That cloud apart, his mood was distinctly upbeat. “Sunderland are a good team with a good manager and it’s difficult to play against them,” he said. “But we controlled the second ball really well and from that we played some really good football. We were the better team. The mentality was excellent.”Le Bris acknowledged Sunderland had “clearly felt Liverpool’s quality”. As he put it: “If you fix one problem against them, you find you have to manage another. It wasn’t easy for them to win here. We showed character and identity. We showed composure and we were brave. We tried but it wasn’t enough. We faced a monster. Liverpool are composed and they have this ability to combine in tight spaces.”Although Slot’s side dominated possession it initially foundered in the face of a meticulously organised Sunderland defence. Then, with around 30 minutes on the clock, Wirtz met a pass from the influential, apparently renascent, Alex Mac Allister’s pass, took a steadying touch and decided to try his luck from the edge of the area.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk rises highest in a crowded six-yard box to head home Liverpool’s winner past the stranded Sunderland goalkeeper, Robin RoefsPhotograph: Owen Humphreys/PAWhile Robin Roefs did well to turn that one around a post, Sunderland’s goalkeeper was subsequently relieved to see a Wirtz shot rebound off the base of an upright after Andy Robertson’s cross bisected Le Bris’s backline.With Wirtz in increasingly catalytic mood as he assumed centre stage and Salah, sporadically ruffling Reinildo, Le Bris had reason to look more than a little anxious at times. Yet his team, too, had their moments. All kaleidoscopic positional interchanging going forward, Sunderland were being fully stretched yet remained very much in the game.It was the sort of match where they particularly missed their injured captain Granit Xhaka. Enzo Le Fée had dropped back alongside Noah Sadiki to fill Xhaka’s place at the base of ­midfield and his superior reading of the game and off-the-ball positioning ensured his side were able to make a series of important interceptions as Wirtz demonstrated precisely why Slot was so very keen to sign him last summer.Sunderland improved at the start of the second half but, still, they barely threatened Alisson’s goal and with the impressive Ibrahima Konaté winning his physical tussle with Brian Brobbey, a 25-yard off-target shot from Trai Hume was about the closest they came to scoring.View image in fullscreenThe impressive Florian Wirtz tries to evade Noah Sadiki.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersTellingly, once Liverpool began weathering a home storm briefly as intense as the torrential rain that had cascaded down on Wearside all day it took a vital block from Dan Ballard to deny Wirtz.A visiting goal was coming though. It arrived when Salah swung an excellent corner towards the far post and Van Dijk’s equally impressive header was helped on its inevitable trajectory into the back of the net by Habib Diarra.A delay ensued as Endo, deputising for the suspended Dominik ­Szoboszlai and putting in a very decent shift, received lengthy treatment – and pain relief – on the pitch after turning an ankle in evidently agonising fashion. Eventually the Japan international was carried off on a stretcher and replaced by Joe Gomez.It was a horrible way for Endo’s first Premier League start of the season to end but this most sodden of midwinter nights may yet come to be seen as a watershed in Liverpool’s hitherto troubled season.With the crushing disappointment of last Sunday’s defeat against Manchester City temporarily forgotten, almost anything suddenly seemed possible for Wirtz and friends.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Like, by and large, the ball (unless it was arrowing towards a fielder), England’s pursuit of a target of 197 never got off the ground, and after a largely pedestrian performance veered towards the end into a bilious combination of slapstick and horror they had been dismissed for 166 and, with seven balls remaining, been beaten by 30 runs.Had theknife-edge result against Nepal on Sundayfallen the other way this would already be another crisis in a winter full of them. As it is they will head to Kolkata, where they complete their group fixtures against Scotland and Italy, confident given the nature of their opponents of securing the wins they require to progress to the Super Eights but knowing they can afford no further stumbles.England lose to West Indies by 30 runs: T20 World Cup – liveRead moreWest Indies’ total of 196 was the third biggest of a World Cup still marked by largely moderate scoring, but it did not cause their opponents to be at all frantic. As a result England’s pursuit was always going to be judged either admirably or as puzzlingly calm, depending on its outcome.Even as their task grew increasingly difficult, and until it blundered into the realms of the truly far-fetched – duly inspiring a couple of manic run‑outs – there was no sense of panic, few wild swings and swipes.“One thing I would say is we were probably a little bit careful,” the England captain, Harry Brook, said. “With the power we had at the back end, myself included, I could have taken a risk a little bit earlier.“With that power and depth we have, we do think we can chase almost anything. Obviously today we didn’t.”View image in fullscreenSam Curran top-scored for England with 43.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APPerhaps they were comforted by their comparatively brisk early scoring – they stood at 67 for one at the end of the powerplay where West Indies had been 55 for three, and 93 for four at the halfway stage where their opponents had been 79 for four – but given the success enjoyed by Sherfane Rutherford and Jason Holder in particular as the first innings neared its conclusion, this was only storing up trouble.Clearly, England felt they had the players to do it, and unshakeable faith that one or more among them would settle down, get their eye in and start peppering the stands. The problem was that none did, and with Jamie Overton lasting just six balls, Tom Banton four and Will Jacks three, for all their vaunted depth England were swiftly scraping their toes in the shallow end.They struggled particularly during 12 overs of spin in which six wickets fell and their innings veered definitively off course, though Brook insisted this was freakish rather than fragility. “We played spin outstanding in Sri Lanka,” he said of their recent white-ball series against the co-hosts. “We’ve just had a bad day today.”With only Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran, who top-scored with 43, facing as many as 15 balls theirs was an innings that lacked outstanding individuals and destructive partnerships.By contrast Rutherford had led the way for West Indies, starting slow – after 13 deliveries he had scored only 10, off his next 16 he added 43 – before accelerating to finish unbeaten with 76 off 42.Really, though, their innings was a tale of three partnerships: Roston Chase and Shimron Hetmyer combined for 47 off 28, then Rutherford added 51 off 29 balls with Rovman Powell – despite Powell scoring a sober 14 off 13 – and another 61 off 32 with the free-scoring Holder, who finished with 33 off 17.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer was expensive in his four overs, going for 48.Photograph: MB Media/Getty ImagesFor England supporters concerned that disappointing performances against Nepal presaged an extended period of poor form for Jofra Archer and Adil Rashid, the evening brought only partial reassurance. Rashid, after a rare wicketless outing in the opener, was back to his sparkling best, taking two wickets and conceding just 16 runs in four excellent overs.But news of Archer was less positive: another 48 runs conceded, and of the 133 bowlers used in the tournament so far only USA’s Saurabh Netravalkar has been more expensive. He did pick up the wicket of Shai Hope, but with a short, wide delivery that was asking to be hit, and not necessarily straight to Banton at cover.“Everybody knows how good Jof is,” Brook said. “He’ll bounce back for sure.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026England cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamT20 World CupTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

If they did, it would buy them time until the summer when other candidates could be available, including Mauricio ­Pochettino and Andoni Iraola.Tottenham’s soaring dreams for Thomas Frank quickly hit the buffers of grim reality | David HytnerRead moreSpurs supporters sang ­Pochettino’s name duringthe 2-1 home defeat against Newcastle on ­Tuesday, which was Frank’s final game in charge. They made it clear that they would welcome back the manager under whom they enjoyed such good times for just over five seasons from 2014.Pochettino is the USA manager and is preparing for the World Cup this summer. There is no chance of him walking away from his ­responsibilities but he will be out of ­contract after the tournament – as will Iraola at Bournemouth. Spurs looked at Iraola before they appointed Frank last summer only for him to make it clear he was ­committed to Bournemouth.De Zerbi has left Marseille, the French club confirming his departure just before the news of Frank’s Spurs exit broke. His team were hammered 5-0 by Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday after which he was moved to apologise to the fans. De Zerbi has Premier League experience from a successful period at Brighton, plays an open and attacking style and feels like an opportunity for Spurs.The club are monitoring their ­former striker Robbie Keane, who has impressed at Ferencvaros in Hungary. He won the league title last season after joining midway through the campaign. His team are joint-top this time out. In 2023‑24, Keane led ­Maccabi Tel Aviv to the Israeli ­Premier League title.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank looks crestfallen after Tottenham’s defeat by Newcastle. Only Burnley and Wolves have worse home records.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesHeitinga was brought to Spurs in January to assist Frank, ostensibly to replace Matt Wells, who had left to become the head coach of Colorado ­Rapids. Heitinga, who was an assistant to Arne Slot at Liverpool last season, helping them to win the title, was sacked as Ajax manager in November.On Wednesday morning the club released a statement announcing Frank’s departure, eight months into a three-year contract with the team on a run of two victories in 17 in the Premier League.“We have been determined to give him the time and support needed to build for the future together,” the statement read. “However, results and performances have led the board to conclude that a change at this point in the season is necessary.”Spurs have given their players five days off to reset after the Newcastle match and prepare for the next one, which is the home derby against ­Arsenal on Sunday week. As such, the club have some time to finalise the move for the new coach and decide which of Frank’s staff to retain.When Frank left Brentford for Spurs, he brought the assistant coach Justin Cochrane, the head of performance Chris Haslam, and the analyst Joe Newton with him. Close to the start of the season, Nick Stubbings joined from Brentford to be the head of medical while Tom Perryman crossed over as a strength and conditioning coach. In December yet another Brentford staff member, Ted Munson, went to Spurs to become the head of nutrition.PosTeamPGDPts16Tottenham Hotspur26-12917Nottm Forest25-132618West Ham26-172419Burnley25-241520Wolverhampton25-328Tottenham have endured yet another long-term injury blow with the winger Wilson Odobert revealed to have badly damaged his anterior cruciate ligament against Newcastle.

Arsenal have needed to rotate a little amid a hefty run of fixtures and although this was the first leg of a tie that would earn a spot in the Champions League quarter-final stage it was also the optimal time to rest legs, with Renée Slegers’ side havingearned a 3-0 win against Leuvenin their final game of the league phase.Arsenal were predictably dominant against the Belgian champions. Despite vital minutes being put into the legs of the returning Leah ­Williamson and ­several lesser used players, there was little doubt that they would break through the impressive ­Champions League debutants.“There’s high buy-in with what we’re doing at the moment and we have a lot of clarity on how we want to play our football,” Slegers said. “So, even if we make changes I don’t think you notice it as much. Of course, you have different players with different qualities, but the structure and the foundation is always there.”Quick GuideReal Madrid take first-leg advantage at Paris FCShowReal Madridremains on course for an all-Spanish quarterfinal against three-time champion Barcelona after coming from a goal down to win 3-2 atParis FC.After going behind in the 10th minute, Madrid needed just six minutes to turn the game around before halftime in the French capital.Caroline Weir equalized on a rebound from close range in the 39th and Athenea’s low shot finished off a fast counter in the last minute of the first half to put the visitors ahead.The 20-year-old forward Linda Caicedo controlled goalkeeper Misa Rodríguez’s long pass before before making it 3-1 in the 83rd before Maeline Mendy pulled a goal back in the 89th to narrow the deficit ahead of the second leg.Paris had taken the lead through Kaja Korošec, who was at the far corner to volley the opener into the roof of the net off a corner kick from Maelle Garbino.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Their opening goal came in the 22nd minute, with Caitlin Foord’s ball in from the right headed home by Maanum, and they extended their lead before the break with Smith side-footing in from Kelly’s cross. It was 3-0 within seven minutes of the restart, Smith’s clever one-touch pass to Foord sprung the offside trap and the Australian put the ball into the middle for Maanum to turn in from close range.Russo, on as a substitute, delivered Arsenal’s fourth, volleying home after Lowiese Seynhaeve failed to deal with Smilla Holmberg’s cross.Arno Van den Abbeel’s Leuven team delivered a playoff place in their first European outing, but chances were few and far between against Arsenal, their best attempt was Alixe Bosteels’ curling effort from 25 yards out forcing a save from Daphne van Domselaar in the second half.Van de Abbeel was philosophical about where his side are at in comparison to their opposition and ahead of a “difficult game” next week which they “have to enjoy”.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Alessia Russo is congratulated after scoring her sides fourth goal.Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP“There’s a big budget difference between us and Arsenal and I think as a league, as a country and as a club we have to find resources and we have to find a way to make women’s football even more attractive than it is already,” he said.“Today, I think there’s almost 1,000 Arsenal supporters here. That says something also about the popularity of women’s football in England and that is something we have to work on in Belgium to make women’s football more attractive and in that way find more resources for the evolution of our sport.”The arrival of Little with eight ­minutes remaining was welcomed raucously by the travelling fans, the 35-year-old’s incredible Arsenal career and continuing influence a cause for recognition and celebration and her manager was full of praise.“Kim is special,” Slegers said. “Everything she does is 100% and with so much detail, and she’s so humble.

Shevchenko, the Ukrainian Association of Football president, is looking to restate Ukraine’s position in private when the pair attend Uefa’s congress in Brussels.European Super League project officially over after Real Madrid and Uefa dealRead moreSpeaking to a domestic audience on Monday, Shevchenko said he hoped soon to “convey, in concrete terms, information about the war in Ukraine and our position”. It is understood he may get the opportunity on the sidelines of Uefa’s annual convention, which Infantino is alsoexpected to address.The consistent stance held by Shevchenko and his governing body is that nothing has changed since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago and that a route back for its clubs or national sides is unthinkable under the status quo.Russia remains a member of Fifa andUefaand the former Fifa council member Alexey Sorokin, who advises the Russian Football Union president, Alexander Dyukov, saw the pathway to a return in Infantino’s remarks. “It’s a good sign – at least we took it that way,” he said.Russia were frozen out of competitive football because prospective opponents refused to play them. There is no groundswell to reverse that trend and, in practice, it is highly unlikely their return to World Cup or European Championship qualifiers would be viable even if Infantino andFifamanaged to welcome them back. But Infantino’s comments risk serving to normalise the idea of Russia’s comeback and have caused serious concern in Kyiv.Ukraine has continued to suffer during a particularly harsh winter in which temperatures have plummeted while power and water supplies have been severely hit by Russian strikes. Shevchenko and the UAF have helped colleagues by offering overnight accommodation and showers at the House of Football in Kyiv. The UAF has also opened a space for children to play while conditions outdoors are too cold to do so.Explore more on these topicsFootballRussiaFifaUefaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And with the temperature dropping around Murrayfield, the old commentary box catchphrase – “This one really does have snow on it” – might not be too far from the truth on Saturday. When Ford launches an up-and-under these days, the ball virtually disappears into orbit.It has reached the point where the aerial bazooka has become Ford’s party piece. A murmur of expectancy now ripples around the stadium as, standing back in the pocket, the fly-half carefully tilts the ball in his hands to ensure optimum height and spin. And then – whoosh! – up it goes like a meteor before tailing away from the poor catcher at the last moment. Devilish is the word.Suffocating Scotland key to Borthwick’s plan for England Calcutta Cup success | Robert KitsonRead moreThe rationale behind this cunning tactical weapon is simple enough. “A traditional end-over-end ball is easy to gauge and track whereas a spiral is unpredictable,” Ford says. “You don’t know where it’s going to land and it’s very difficult to go and jump and catch it. If they hear the footsteps of the boys chasing then hopefully it can cause them some problems.”But Ford will also tell you the spiral bomb forms only a tiny part of a much wider narrative. In the past, English crowds have howled with frustration at the sight of yet another seemingly aimless kick skywards. Six years ago, the game was in danger of becoming so risk averse even Ford spoke about possession in his own team’s half being akin to “a ticking timebomb”. Now England have reframed the narrative and look to the air for more proactive, calculating reasons.View image in fullscreenGeorge Ford launches the ball upfield during England v Wales.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesBecause, increasingly, the crucial bit is what happens next. “I think the key shift has been what you do when you win it back,” Ford says. “That’s been a big mindset shift in the world of rugby, but for us especially. Whenever we kick now what we’re trying to do is create an attacking opportunity at all times.“The reason we’re kicking the way we do is to win field position, get the ball higher up the field and then go and attack, move the ball and score tries. To give our X-factor back three players some space to go and entertain. There’s no point kicking the ball then getting the ball back, not doing anything with it and kicking it again, for example.”Thecrackdown on escort runnerswho previously helped to protect catchers from onrushing chasers has also played its part. There were 79 kicks in open play in the game between England and Wales, and Ford was responsible for 26 of the hosts’ 42 kicks, leathering it for 1,001 metres in total.So when England’s head coach, Steve Borthwick, talks before games about expecting Wales or Scotland to kick repeatedly, he does so knowing his own side will do likewise, if not more so. And with one-handed tap backs permitted, thus reducing the number of clean defensive catches, reacting smartly to the ensuing loose balls is now vital. “It’s fascinating to watch at the minute,” Ford says. “You can see France come alive just like that and I think we did it quite well at the weekend. We managed to strike fast and cause Wales some problems. Finn Russell will be great at that as well so it’s obviously a big part of Scotland’s game.”With 106 caps to his name, however, the 32-year-old Ford is experienced enough to know that simply targeting Russell can be counterproductive. As has happened in the past, it allows Scotland to employ him as a handy decoy on occasions and open up space for others. “The skill set and unpredictability he brings to the game are obviously a massive part of what they do,” Ford says. “But sometimes if you focus too much on one individual in a 15-man game it can catch you out. They’ve got other threats across the field.”England, too, are keeping an eye on the weather, having been blown off course at Murrayfield on numerous occasions in the past. Ford has been stressing the need for the visitors to focus on the basics – “Unless you have a strong foundation there is no point having all of your eggs in the attack basket” – but also accepts he and his teammates will need to be alert to a Scottish side on the rebound from their18-15 defeat to Italyin Rome. “In terms of our concentration, we’ve got to be at 100%. We’ve got to be making sure we’re on the front foot, on our toes and ready for anything.“Let’s respect the opposition and everything they bring, but the first thing at the forefront of our minds is to play our game and impose it on the opposition. Regardless of who and where we’re playing or what the weather is, we want to go and play the way we want to play.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Kellyfiled a lawsuitagainst Hegseth last month arguing the video he and other Democrats made was protected free speech, and that the secretary had undertaken an “unconstitutional crusade” against him.The Department of Justice had recently requested to interview Slotkin, the senator said last month. In a letter addressed to Bondi and Pirro, Slotkin said she would not comply with their inquiries and asked them to retain all of their records in the event she decides to sue.“Being quiet doesn’t actually make you safe,” Slotkin said. “Going on offense seems to be the only way to get their attention, so I certainly reserve that right of keeping all those options open.”It was previously considered exceedingly rare for a grand jury to decline to bring an indictment. But rejections have been happening with growing frequency in Trump’s second term, as his appointees prioritize politically-charged cases against the president’s political enemies, among them the former FBI directorJames ComeyandLetitia James, the New York attorney general.Federal grand juries returned indictments against James and Comey last fall, but a judge later dismissed both cases after finding the prosecutor who brought them had been improperly appointed. Efforts to reindict James were unsuccessful.Speaking on Wednesday, the senators warned that the administration’s efforts to prosecute them was part of a much broader campaign to chill free speech for all Americans.“We did not ask for this. We’re just the first through the breach. But you’ll be damn sure that we are not going to back down,” Kelly said. “The most patriotic thing that any American can do right now is to continue exercising our rights, continue speaking truth to power and not backing down.”Dani Anguianocontributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsDemocratsUS SenateDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He criticized the FAA order that came through early on Wednesday as a major disruption on a scale that had not occurred there since the terrorist attacks ofSeptember 11 2001.“This should have never happened. You cannot restrict airspace over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership. That failure to communicate is unacceptable,” Johnson said.The FAA had issued a “temporary flight restriction” notice on its website, citing “special security reasons”, saying it would apply to a 10-nautical-mile area and up to an 18,000ft altitude, and encompassingEl Pasoand its local military base, the massive Fort Bliss – which also currently houses the largest immigration detention camp in the US.No further explanation was given, and residents in the city of about 700,000 were immediately rattled, speculating furiously about what was the spark or what might be about to occur.The FAA restriction was originally ordered to be effective from 10 February at 11.30pm local time to 20 February at 11.30pm local time, according to El Paso international airport. But even as confused travelers were being turned away from the airport and commercial flights were unable to take off, the order was lifted at about 7am local time on Wednesday, after the FAA abruptly posted on social media there was “no threat to commercial aviation”.View image in fullscreenA man rests on a chair at El Paso airport on Wednesday.Photograph: José Luis González/ReutersBy that time, airlines had already canceled 14 flights to and from El Paso and delayed at least 13 others, according to FlightAware, an online service that provides real-time flight tracking data.It had also forced medical evacuation and emergency flights to divert to Las Cruces, New Mexico, about 45 miles north-west of El Paso, Mayor Johnson said during a press conference on Wednesday.Johnson confirmed that amid the disruption, surgical equipment being shipped from Dallas, Texas and other parts of the country failed to arrive in El Paso and on to area hospitals for scheduled procedures.“El Paso is not just a dot on a map. We are a major city,” he said. “Without hospital, military operations, emergency services and critical infrastructure that depend on coordinated and reliable airspace operations, decisions made without notice or coordination put lives at risk and create unnecessary danger and confusion.”US congresswoman Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents El Paso, also criticized the FAA for failing to notify local officials before closing the airport, a move she learned about through unofficial channels late on Tuesday night.“That is not the way that the federal government should operate. Any impact of this magnitude needs to be communicated with clarity and with advanced notice,” she said.Escobar contradicted US transport secretary Sean Duffy’s claim that the shutdown was a response to a Mexican cartel drone incursion involving the FAA and the Pentagon, noting that drone incursions from Mexico, just acrossthe borderfrom El Paso, are not unusual. And, if there had been one, she would have been informed.She said the information provided to her and the House armed services committee painted a different picture than the one the Trump administration presented in public. She did not elaborate on the information, however.“The FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly, and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly. And based on the information I have right now … [it] is not what we in Congress have been told,” Escobar said.El Paso’s deputy city manager of public safety and support services, Mario D’Agostino, said the city has not been informed of any actual US incursions by Mexican drug cartel drones.“That’s just been reported. We haven’t been notified of anything. That’s just rumor that we’re hearing, chatter,” he said. “There’s been no official determination put out to us as to why it was closed down (the airport), so we won’t speculate.”On Wednesday morning, as parents got their children ready for school and workers prepared to start their day under clear, sunny skies and mild February temperatures the atmosphere changed abruptly as news came through of the mysterious government order.El Paso all too often finds itself in the national news in relation to immigration crises, especially in Donald Trump’s first and now second terms in the White House. It has been in the spotlight in recent months because of deportation flights operating out of Texas amid the US president’s anti-immigration crackdown and immigrants being brought from across the country byICEto be detained in a huge, secure camp constructed last summer on a portion of the sprawling nearby Fort Bliss military base.Critics havecalled forit to be shut down amidallegations of harsh conditions, which are denied by the Trump administration, anda seriesofdetainee deaths.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, puzzlement at the US airspace shutdown order was apparent in El Paso’s sister city of Juárez, which sits just across the Rio Grande and the international border from the west Texas city. Huge volumes of motor and some foot traffic go back and forth each day between the two cities.The mayor of Ciudad Juárez, Cruz Pérez Cuéllar, said that he had no information to confirm allegations from the US side that drug cartel drones from Mexico crossed into US territory.He said that the Juárez municipal police had been patrolling the border since rumors of drone activity surfaced on Tuesday night, but they have found no signs of any of the small, unmanned aircraft.“We don’t have any information to confirm that this happened,” said Pérez Cuéllar, adding that US authorities had not yet contacted his city with any official information.Explore more on these topicsTexasEl PasoUS-Mexico borderUS immigrationAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The results of the hastily arranged meeting were announced by Trump in an online post.“There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations withIrancontinue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “If it can, I let the Prime Minister know that will be a preference. If it cannot, we will just have to see what the outcome will be.”The US has massed forces in theMiddle Eastthreatening a major strike against Iran’s nuclear programme, as well as its leadership and military, as the White House has sought new concessions over the country’s nuclear program. Trump this week said he was considering sending another aircraft carrier to the region to join the USS Abraham Lincoln.ButIsraelhas called forIranto also limit its ballistic missile program and cut support for regional allies including Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Netanyahu’s office before the trip had said that he “believes that any negotiations must include limiting ballistic missiles and ending support for the Iranian axis”.Senior US and Iranian envoys met last week in Oman for talks that only addressed Iran’s nuclear program, as Tehran has said that its ballistic missile program and support for regional allies were not under discussion.The two leaders are allies but occasionally their mutual frustration with one another has spilled into public, asIsraelhas sought greater US support in numerous conflicts in the region.In his online post, Trump suggested that he was restraining Netanyahu but also said that further strikes could be a result if Iran does not agree to a new nuclear deal with the US.“Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal, and they were hit with Midnight Hammer – That did not work well for them,” Trump said, referring to the strikes last June that targeted Iranian enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow. “Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible.”Earlier, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, had denied that the country was seeking a nuclear weapon as he acknowledged “great sorrow” after the authorities’ recentcrackdown on protesters. Both the nuclear program and the crackdown were cited by Trump as reasons for the US military buildup in the region.Pezeshkian said Iran was willing to negotiate over its nuclear programme and was “ready for any kind of verification” in relation to its insistence it is not trying to build nuclear weapons. However, the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been unable for months to inspect and verify Iran’s nuclear stockpile.Pezeshkian said: “The high wall of mistrust that the United States and Europe have created through their past statements and actions does not allow these talks to reach a conclusion.“At the same time, we are engaging with full determination in dialogue aimed at peace and stability in the region alongside our neighbouring countries.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpIranIsraelNuclear weaponsBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

This would lock the world into a new and hellish “hothouse Earth” climate far worse than the 2-3C temperature rise the worldis on track to reach. The climate would also be very different to the benign conditions of the past 11,000 years, during which the whole of human civilisation developed.At just 1.3C of global heating in recent years, extreme weather isalready taking livesand destroying livelihoods across the globe. At 3-4C, “theeconomy and society will cease to functionas we know it”, scientists said last week, but a hothouse Earth would be even more fiery.The public and politicians were largely unaware of the risk of passing the point of no return, the researchers said. The group said they were issuing their warning because while rapid and immediate cuts to fossil fuel burning were challenging, reversing course was likely to be impossible once on the path to a hothouse Earth, even if emissions were eventually slashed.It was difficult to predict when climate tipping points would be triggered, making precaution vital, said Dr Christopher Wolf, a scientist at Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Associates in the US. Wolf is a member of a study team that includes Prof Johan Rockström at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria.“Crossing even some of the thresholds could commit the planet to a hothouse trajectory,” said Wolf. “Policymakers and the public remain largely unaware of the risks posed by what would effectively be a point-of-no-return transition.“It’s likely that global temperatures are [already] as warm as, or warmer than, at any point in the last 125,000 years and that climate change is advancing faster than many scientists predicted.”It is also likely that carbon dioxide levels are the highest they have been in at least 2m years.Prof Tim Lenton, an expert on tipping points at the University of Exeter in the UK, said: “We know we are running profound risks on the current climate trajectory, which we can’t rule out could turn into a trajectory towards a much less habitable state of the climate for us. However, we don’t need to be heading towards a hothouse Earth for there to be profound risks to humanity and our societies – these will already be upon us if we continue to 3C global warming.”View image in fullscreenMeltwater flows from the Greenland ice sheet into the Baffin Bay. Tipping may already been happening in Greenland and west Antarctica.Photograph: Kerem Yücel/AFP/Getty ImagesThe assessment, which waspublished in the journal One Earth, synthesised recent scientific findings on climate feedback loops and 16 tipping elements. The tipping elements include the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, mountain glaciers, polar sea ice, sub-Arctic forests and permafrost, the Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Amoc), a system of ocean currents that strongly influences the global climate.Tipping may already be happening inGreenlandandwest Antarctica, with permafrost, mountain glaciers and theAmazon rainforestappearing to be on the verge, the scientists said.“Research showsthat several Earth system components may be closer to destabilising than once believed,” they concluded. “While the exact risk is uncertain, it is clear that current climate [action] commitments are insufficient.”Prof William Ripple, at Oregon State University, US, who led the analysis, said: “The Amoc is already showingsigns of weakening, and this could increase the risk of Amazon dieback. Carbon released by an Amazon dieback would further amplify global warming and interact with other feedback loops. We need to act quickly on our rapidly dwindling opportunities to prevent dangerous and unmanageable climate outcomes.”Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ stateRead moreScientists warned in 2018 of the prospect of ahothouse Earth. Inthis scenario, global temperature stays significantly above the 4C rise of current worst-case climate scenarios for thousands of years, driving a huge rise in sea level that drowns coastal cities. The scientists said then that the “impacts of a hothouse Earth pathway on human societies would likely be massive, sometimes abrupt, and undoubtedly disruptive”.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisSea levelGlaciersExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

Since that time, the land has been calling us back, and we are answering that call,” Smokey said in a statement. “This land purchase is good medicine for our people. This is a small start to healing from generations of historical trauma, and the benefits will go on for many generations to come.”Today there are about 1,500 enrolled members of the Washoe, largely split betweenCaliforniaand Nevada.The tribe has named the property, previously known as Loyalton Ranch, the Wélmelti Preserve. It worked with the Northern Sierra Partnership and the Feather River Land Trust on the project and ultimately used a $5.5m grant from the California Wildlife Conservation Board as well as private donations to support the purchase, according to a statement.The property cost $6m, and additional funding was set aside for planning and assessments and to start an endowment to support the tribe in its long-term management of the land.The sale of the property is another milestone for the Land Back movement in California, which has seen tens of thousands of acres returned to tribes that occupied the land for millennia before European colonization. Last June, the Yurok Tribe acquired about 47,000 acres near the lower Klamath River as part of thelargest such dealin state history. The Tule River Tribe regained 14,672 acres of its ancestral land in Tulare county in 2024.The Washoe’s recent acquisition will triple the tribe’s current land holdings, Smokey said on Wednesday. It will also support the return of traditional cultural practices and foster greater connection with the land among youth. “Now we actually have something to call ours,” he said.The preserve is an important habitat for wildlife, including pronghorn, mule deer and gray wolves, and has springs and key water resources. The tribe is focused on conservation, but will also use the land to house some tribal members. Parts of the property have been used as a dumping ground, Smokey said, and clean-up is needed.The tribe hopes to purchase other properties across its homelands in the Sierra Nevada.“It is exciting to know that the Washoe people will be caring for this spectacular landscape going forward,” Lucy Blake, the president of the Northern Sierra Partnership, said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaIndigenous peoplesWest CoastNevadanewsShareReuse this content"

This scene is typical for narrow countryside roads in Wallonia in the south ofBelgium. “Having lights here is logical,” says André Detournay, 77, who has lived in the village for four decades. “I walk here with my dog and it makes me feel safe and gives me some protection from theft.”Belgium glows like a Christmas decoration at night, as witnessedfrom space. It is one of the most light-polluted countries in Europe, with the Milky Wayscarcely visibleexcept in the most remote areas.But in the coming months, these lamps outside Mazée in the municipality of Viroinval will be turned off permanently as part of a radical project to remove75 pointless streetlightsin this area of Wallonia.View image in fullscreenJacques Monty dismantles a street lamp. He says his job until now has always been about maintaining lighting.Photograph: Christophe Smets/The GuardianAcross Europe, unnecessary lighting is being extinguished, and a key motivation is to protect nature. Over the past decadean increasing amount of researchhas shown that illuminating night skies is bad for a wide range of species, including insects, birds and amphibians – disrupting their feeding, reproduction and navigation.View image in fullscreenAndré Detournay says he would need to see evidence of significantly increased biodiversity to support the project.Photograph: Christophe Smets/The GuardianDetournay is not happy. “I am for frogs. I dug two ponds for them,” he says. “But near a village, we need lights. You would have to prove it significantly increased biodiversity here to persuade me otherwise.”The idea for the project was born in 2021. A Wallonia public administrator estimated that6% of the 8,000 streetlightsin the Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse national park – a protected landscape of forests, rivers and wetlands near the French border – were pointless, meaning they were more than 50 metres from the nearest building (often on roads between villages where few people walk) and less than 50 metres from aNatura 2000 site, areas judged to be of the highest value to nature.The national park has allocated €308,000 torestore night-time darkness, treating it as beneficial for nature in the same way as restoring a pond or a woodland. Between now and August, dozens of streetlights are being removed by the municipality’s electricity grid operators.“We cannot say to an old lady we want to prioritise bats over you,” says Nicolas Goethals, who is leading the project, emphasising that ensuring people’s safety is critical.View image in fullscreenTwo streetlights in Mazée will soon be dismantled.Photograph: Christophe Smets/The GuardianSome people, however, are still not convinced. Jacques Monty from the Viroinval municipality is up an eight-metre pole in a cherrypicker detangling electrics and metal to remove a light near the village of Nismes, where nearby limestone caves are a bat hotspot. Monty has worked for the municipality for 35 years, and during that time his job has always been about maintaining lighting. “It could be good, but we need to make sure it doesn’t compromise the safety of people – that is my priority,” he says.The luxury effect: why you’ll find more wildlife in wealthy areas – and what it means for your healthRead moreThe public debate on streetlights is simple – they make people safer, and this is the main objection for people living in Wallonia. But research paints a messier picture.Although lighting increases people’s feeling of safety and willingness to walk in public spaces at night, it does not always mean they are actually safer.One studyinto the effects of reduced street lighting in England and Wales found that it was not associated with significant changes in crime or with the number of road collisions. Other reviews have foundinconclusive evidencethat lighting reduces crime, and indeed data on it reducing road collisions also paintsa mixed picture.“Seventy-five [streetlights] might not seem like much but you have to start somewhere,” says Goethals, who has organised local talks and night walks and sent out letters to convert people to the merits of the project. “It’s not right that lights are on all night long for everybody and not used. The normal should be darkness. It’s night-time!” he says. People should illuminate themselves with vests and torches if they want to walk on rural roads, he says.View image in fullscreenOld electricity pylons are being retrofitted to support the return of white storks.Photograph: Olivier ColinetFindings of the negative effects of light pollution on nature, as well as human and plant health, are unequivocal. Experts argue that light pollution should be treated as a pressure on nature that is akin to habitat loss or chemical pollution. More than half of insects areactive at night. In France, an estimated2,000 billion insectsare killed each year by public lighting, either dying from exhaustion or being eaten by predators.This is a global problem. The invention of the electric lightbulb 150 years ago was one of the most transformative human inventions, but now80% of people on the planetlive under light-polluted skies.Thousands ofcommunes across Franceswitch off public lighting in the middle of the night to save energy and reduce light pollution. At the EU level, there is guidance on creating dark corridors for wildlife and reducingartificial light at night. In the UK, campaign groups areraising awarenessabout the issue, and a number of cities in the US are looking toreduce sky glow. In April, Goethals is collaborating with colleagues in France to extend darkness infrastructure into other parts of Europe. “Here is just the start – real darkness infrastructure will come off the back of this,” he says.Elsewhere in the park, another form of infrastructure gives an indication of what disused poles could be used for.Old electricity pylons – which were once a threat to wildlife – are being retrofitted to support the comeback of white storks. Back in 2011, it was relatively rare to spot a white stork, but in 2025 there were nearly 800 recorded sightings in the national park, with numbers increasing year on year.View image in fullscreenThe pylon nesting spaces have helped grow the numbers of storks in the national park – there were nearly 800 sightings in 2025.Photograph: Erik de Brandt/HandoutThese large white birds would naturally nest at the top of tall trees, but in a human-dominated landscape, an old pylon is a good alternative. Each metal stork nest costs €500 and the goal is to install 30 by this summer. Branches and fake droppings are added to each nest to make it look like it has got the thumbs up from a previous occupant. Unlike removing streetlights, this work is unanimously appreciated. “People love these birds. I’ve never spoken to someone who doesn’t like seeing them in their nests,” says Goethals.Although this experiment rolling out on Belgium’s rural roads may be small, it is part of a bigger shift. For more than a century, humans have been seeking to light every corner of the night, but there is a growing movement to let it be dark again.Explore more on these topicsBiodiversityThe age of extinctionBelgiumConservationWildlifeEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the 760MW project in southernRomaniawill not hold the title for long. In the north-west, authorities have approved a bigger plant that will boast a capacity of 1GW.The sun-lit plots of silicon and glass will join a slew of projects that have rendered the Romanian economy unrecognisable from its polluted state when communism ended. They include an onshore windfarm near the Black Sea that for several years was Europe’s biggest, a nuclear power plant by the Danube whose lifetime is being extended by 30 years, and a fast-spreading patchwork of solar panels topping homes and shops across the country.“The trend is irreversible,” said Liviu Gavrilă, vice-president of the Romanian WindEnergyAssociation and manager at Enery, which is building the solar farm. “But we need to play it smart.”Few would consider Romania a climate leader but on one metric it has found the holy grail of the energy transition. The country has decoupled economic growth from pollution faster than anywhere else in Europe, and perhaps even the world. Its net greenhouse gas emissions intensity fell by 88% between 1990 and 2023, the latest data shows, meaning each dollar’s worth of economic activity heats the planet almost 10 times less than it did before. Emissions have plunged by 75%.How did Romania shatter the historical link between the economy and the climate? And can its breakneck transformation keep up the pace?‘History happening’Under the oppressive reign of Nicolae Ceaușescu, a dictator obsessed with self-sufficiency, the Romanian economy became industrial and polluted. Energy hungry factories sprang up faster than power plants could handle, and Romania turned to low-grade lignite and heavy oil to keep conveyor belts moving. When Ceaușescu wasshotand industry privatised, factories closed, mines shut and power plants slashed their output.graphAt the same time, world leaders began to accept that carbon dioxide was heating the planet to disastrous levels. Aware that emissions needed to fall but mindful that developing countries deserved to grow richer, the signatories of the1997 Kyoto Protocolhit only industrialised countries with reduction targets. They picked 1990 – the start of the diplomatic climate fight – as a benchmark for measuring progress.The first drop in Romania’s emissions was “history happening, not active, policy-led decarbonisation”, said Ioana-Maria Petrescu, a former finance minister of Romania who founded a climate nonprofit after leaving politics. “But it continued, luckily, because Romania joined the EU.”Romania’s entry into theEuropean Unionin 2007 held polluters to higher standards and forced the closure of unprofitable factories propped up by state support. Its emissions trading system put a price on carbon and its modernisation fund brought back cash to clean up the energy system. Meanwhile, workers completed a nuclear power plant in Cernavodă, a town in the south-east of the country, which had been commissioned under Ceaușescu, and the government introduced a green certificate scheme to bankroll renewables.In the 17 years after the iron curtain fell, the carbon intensity of the power sector – the CO2spewed per kWh of electricity generated – fell by 9.2%. In the 17 years following that, it plunged by 52%.The shift to a service-based economy also led to upheavals in agriculture, where livestock numbers fell and farms modernised or closed. Beleaguered forests got a respite from the high levels of logging under communism and expanded on to abandoned plots. The amount of carbon absorbed by nature increased by 77%, official data suggests.The changes have resulted in Romania decoupling at one of the fastest rates in Europe, even when measured from the turn of the millennium. But the benefits of its economic boom, which has doubled real GDP since 1990, have not been evenly shared. Entire communities withered after workerslost their jobsin factories and mines. Former coal towns depopulated at alarming rates as young people sought better-paid work abroad.“It’s good that we reduced greenhouse emissions and it’s good that now we’re relying on different types of industries,” said Petrescu, who runs Pur și Simplu Verde, which works to ensure a just transition in fossil fuel-dependent communities. “But the transition was brutal for a lot of people.”Low-hanging fruitIf industrial countries could decouple as quickly as Romania – and do so without the social fallout it suffered – the fight to stop climate breakdown may not seem so hopeless. Promising signs have emerged. Dozens of countries have completely decoupled their economies from emissions, even accounting for the pollution in imported goods, and many more have managed to grow richer while emissions climb at a slower rate, which scientists call relative decoupling. Ananalysisfrom the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) last month found that countries representing 92% of the world’s economy have achieved one of these milestones.View image in fullscreenWind turbines at the Fântânele-Cogealac windfarm, operated by CEZ group, in Constanta, Romania.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesYet the pace of change is still slow. In 2023, astudyof 36 rich countries found 11 had fully broken the link between GDP and CO2but none had done so fast enough to comply with their share of theParis Agreementtarget of keeping global heating to 1.5C (2.7F). It is also to be seen whether countries have exhausted easy wins from the power sector that may be hard to repeat for sectors such as buildings and transport, said William Lamb, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.“We’ve been chucking coal into ovens and producing power with steam turbines for decades, and actually just switching those things off … is really low-hanging fruit,” said Lamb, who is also a lead author of the soon to be published Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. “It’s happening very fast in some countries, and it looks like it will continue happening very fast, but that’s just a chunk of our emissions.”More recently, the clean energy boom has been marred by the beating that climate policy has taken in much of the rich world. The US has embraced a return to fossil fuels, while theEU has begunto tear up parts of its Green Deal. The ECIU report identified nine countries that had absolutely decoupled in the decade before theParis climate agreementin 2015 and then reversed progress in the decade after.Those backtracking include Latvia and Lithuania, two former Soviet republics with economies that – much like Romania – experienced bust in the 90s and boom when they joined the EU in the 2000s. Russia, meanwhile, has steadily increased its emissions since the initial shock after the Soviet Union fell apart.“Russia doubled down on having a large extractive oil and gas sector, coupled with a highly inefficient use of those resources domestically,” said Lamb. “It’s interesting that Romania – which is on the periphery of Europe and not as wealthy as countries like France, Germany, the UK or Sweden – has still managed to make substantive progress.”What is unclear is whether Romania can keep up the pace.The birthplace of big oilIn the mid-19th century, before human activity had heated the planet, Marin Mehedinţeanu turned his attention to the “black gold” beneath a field he leased near Ploiești, roughly 60km north of Bucharest. The pastry shop owner realised he could profit from exploiting oil at a larger scale than the local peasants and, with his brother Teodor, built the world’s first oil refinery in 1857. That year, their supplies made Bucharest the world’s first city lit wholly by distilled crude – a feat that bankrupted the candle industry – while Romania became the first country listed in international oil production statistics. During the second world war, Ploiești oilfields fuelled one-third of the German war machine.View image in fullscreenThe Petrotel-Lukoil refinery in Ploiești, about 40 miles north of Bucharest.Photograph: lcv/AlamyNow, with global temperatures 1.4C higher, the birthplace of big oil has little fear it will share the fate of the candle makers. “We’ll use petroleum for at least 100 years more,” said Iulian Pițoiu, a petroleum engineering student at the Petroleum-Gas University of Ploiești, the only such institution on the continent. Adrian Muşoiu, a fellow student following in the footsteps of his father, who has worked in the surrounding oilfields since he was 16, said he was aware of job losses but did not feel his career was at risk. Their classmates agreed that neither they nor their professors were worried about Romania’s energy transition.The students may well be correct. In March, drilling began in the Black Sea for Neptun Deep, which is expected to be the largest gas extraction project in Europe. In July, workers finished an EU-subsidised pipeline to funnel the fuel to Podișor – a village over from the solar-and-battery farm Enery is about to build – where it joins a pipeline linking it to the rest of Europe. The Mintia coal plant, which was mothballed in 2021, is being converted into a gas-fired power plant expected to rank among Europe’s biggest.Romania’s dash for gas has angered campaigners, who fear it will leave the country dirtier and poorer even as carbon prices rise and EU climate law compels faster action. Areportby the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity found that a planned 2.15GW expansion of gas-fired power plants in Romania was unlikely to be economically viable, and may need to be decommissioned by 2035 if built in full.View image in fullscreenSheep graze by a solar panel field owned by Enery, the renewable energy company building Europe’s largest solar farm in Romania.Photograph: Enery“It’s more expensive to transition twice,” said Raluca Petcu, a campaigner at Bankwatch Romania, an environmental nonprofit. “We’re going to have to build more renewables in 2035 or transform the gas plants we’re building.”Five coal plants scheduled to close at the start of the year were granted a stay of execution in October, after the government warned of blackouts and job losses. A formalassessmentby the European Commission in May found Romania’s National Energy and Climate Plan fell short on ambition for its carbon sink – forests endangered by illegal logging – and renewable energy. Preliminary emissions data suggests pollution increased slightly in 2024, even as the economy stagnated.Public appetite for transformational change is lacking. The share of Romanians who do not think climate breakdown is a serious problem is double the EU average, a Eurobarometersurveyfound in June. Only three countries hold lower support for becoming climate neutral by 2050.In many places there is a fear of being left behind, said Petrescu. “People remember what happened 30 years ago, and they’re afraid to be victims of another transition.”For all the caveats, Romania has still broken records for protecting the planet. Its net greenhouse gas emissions have fallen to just 3 tonnes per person. The Swedes, who are also blessed with large carbon-sucking forests, are the only Europeans who pollute less.Romania’s journey could provide a blueprint for other countries in eastern Europe that have decoupled at a slower pace – or not at all – despite also having experienced disruptive restructuring of their economies. It also shows middle-income countries across Asia and South America that a manufacturing powerhouse can cut its emissions quickly while raising living standards.Still, “what’s happened in Romania should never turn into something preachy”, said Mihnea Cătuți, executive director of Energy Policy Group, a climate thinktank. While the clean energy boom is allowing developing countries to take greener growth paths than Europe and North America, there is still a level of development that can only be reached by raising energy consumption, he said.“Romania used to be an oil and gas country for a century before it managed to decouple its emissions,” he added. “But you get to a point at which growth simply doesn’t come from that any more.”Explore more on these topicsRomaniaBeyond growthPollutionClimate crisisEuropeEnergyCommunismEuropean UnionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A 13-year-old boy is thought to be a former pupil who disguised himself in the correct uniform to carry out the attack.Police will refer every child knife possession case to youth justice services – locally led teams spanning health, education and community services tasked with mandating targeted action to help each child.They could also could be forced to attend mentoring to stay in education or social skills training to boost employability, officials said.The aim is to address the root causes of a child’s offending, including potential exploitation by criminal gangs and childhood trauma.Officials claim such a policy will give children the foundations they need to turn their backs on crime and keep our streets safe, and is part of the government’s commitment to halve knife crime within a decade.These plans will be mandatory, with no child able to avoid the getting the support they need, it is claimed. Failure to engage will have serious consequences, such as possible criminal charges and time behind bars.Lammy said: “With early targeted action, we can put children on the right path to a positive future and stop them falling into a toxic cycle of reoffending.“Our reforms will give local services the security they need to help more young people and make our streets safer for everyone.”The plans announced today will be backed up with a first-of-its-kind three-year wider funding package for youth justice services, worth more than £320m.In Brent, DCS Helen Flanagan, of counter-terrorism policing London, said the victims were in a stable condition in hospital, and their wounds – although serious – are “thankfully not life-threatening”.Police said the suspect fled the scene and was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.Investigators are analysing the suspect’s devices and going through dozens of witness accounts as they try to establish the motive for the attack.Explore more on these topicsKnife crimeYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Butresearch across 17 English and Scottish councilsshared with the Guardian has now found AI-generated hallucinations are slipping in.As scores of local authorities begin to use AI note-takers to accelerate recording and summarisation of meetings with adult and child service users, an eight-month study by the Ada Lovelace Institute found “some potentially harmful misrepresentations of people’s experiences are occurring in official care records”.The independent thinktank found that one social worker who had used an AI transcription tool to create a summary said the technology had incorrectly “indicated that there was suicidal ideation”, but “at no point did the client actually … talk about suicidal ideation or planning, or anything”.Women in tech and finance at higher risk from AI job losses, report saysRead moreAnother said that the AI’s notes might refer to “fishfingers or flies or trees” when in fact a child was talking about their parents fighting.Social workexperts said such glitches were particularly worrying as it could cause a risky pattern of behaviour to be missed.Other social workers raised concerns about inaccuracies in transcribed conversations with people with regional accents. One described how their AI-generated transcriptions often included “gibberish”. Another said: “It’s become a bit of a joke in the office.”Dozens of councils from Croydon to Redcar and Cleveland have given social workers access to AI transcription tools, which record and summarise case conversations. The potential time savings are appealing to town halls with chronic staff shortages.One popular system, called Magic Notes, issold to councilsat a cost of between £1.50 and £5 for each hour of transcription. Most of the social workers interviewed used either the specialist Magic Notes AI or the general purpose Microsoft Copilot AI.The research also found AI transcription delivered observable time savings and liberated social workers to focus more on relations with service users.“Our evidence shows these tools can also improve relational aspects of care work and the quality of information recorded by social workers,” it said after interviews with 39 unnamed social workers.But when one social worker used an AI tool to redraft care documents in a more “person-centred” tone, the system inserted “all these words that have not been said”. Another social worker reported the technology had “crossed the line between it being your assessment and being AI’s assessment”.“AI-produced inaccuracies that enter these records may have far-reaching impacts, such as a social worker making an incorrect decision about a child’s care, which could lead to harm for the child and professional consequences for the social worker,” the report concluded.The impact of AI errors is already being felt in the profession, with reports of disciplinary action for failing to properly check the outputs of AI note-takers and missing obvious errors, according to the British Association of Social Workers (BASW). It is calling for social work regulators to issue clear guidance on how and when AI tools should be used.While there is “real excitement” among some social workers about their potential, “these tools also introduce new risks to social work and society, from potential bias in report summaries to inaccurate ‘hallucinations’ in transcripts,” said Imogen Parker, associate director at Ada Lovelace. “These risks aren’t being fully assessed or mitigated, leaving frontline workers to navigate these challenges on their own.”Social workers often receive little AI training – just an hour in one case. While some social workers said they spent up to an hour checking AI transcripts, others said they spent just two minutes. One said they took “five minutes to literally just quickly screen it […] and then cut and paste it on to the system”. Another said AI-generated cut-and-paste care plans could read “horrifically”.Others said some colleagues were too lazy or busy to check the transcripts.AI use in breast cancer screening cuts rate of later diagnosis by 12%, study findsRead more“The risk here is that people aren’t checking what’s been written for them,” said Andrew Reece, BASW strategic lead forEnglandand Wales. “The time you spend writing helps you make sense of what you have heard. If the computer is doing that for you, you’re missing out on the important parts of reflective practice.”Beam, which operates Magic Notes, stressed its outputs were a first draft, not a final record. “AI tools are being embraced by social workers for good reason,” said Seb Barker, its co-founder. “Services are overwhelmed and hard to access; a generation of social workers are at risk of burnout, and needs for accurate, compliant documentation are growing.”He said an evaluation of bias had found Magic Notes performed “consistently and equitably” and highlighted its specialist features for social work, including automated hallucination risk checks. “Not all AI tools are the same, with unspecialised, low-quality or generic tools failing the specific needs of the sector,” he said.The UK government and Microsoft were approached for comment.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Despite clear links between disadvantage and Send needs, inequitable spending patterns have seen Send spending rise faster in the most affluent councils, with deprived areas trailing behind.“Restoring sanity and certainty to the system is the only way to secure the long-term future of Send provision in England and ensure fairness for those who rely on it.”Estelle Morris, who was education secretary in 2001–02, said: “The financial burden that the present system is placing on local authorities is already known but this report explores the details and its different impact on individual local authorities. It concludes that the increased expenditure in recent years is greatest in areas of least deprivation which adds to the evidence for the need for radical change.”Earlier this week, ministers said they would spend about £5bn clearing 90% of local authority Send debt accumulated by this April. Council leaders had said that without intervention these debts would push 90% of councils into effective bankruptcy by 2028.Children with special needs in England will keep current support, minister saysRead moreZachary Marsh, research fellow in education at Policy Exchange and author of the report, said: “The government has made the right call to tackle the Send funding crisis head on and take the pressure off local councils and on to the Treasury balance sheet.”Asked why spending has gone up fastest in wealthier areas, he said it was closely correlated with rising applications for education, health and care plans (EHCPs), the legal agreements supporting pupils with special needs. “Last year nine out of the top 10 councils that saw the highest number of EHCP applications were in the 50% most affluent council areas. It is vital that reform ensures support is accessible early to those who need it most and not only to those well-placed to advocate through the bureaucratic EHCP process.”Jane Harris, vice-chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, said: “We know half of parents have to give up work or reduce their hours because of lack of support for their disabled child. In areas of greatest disadvantage that will tip families into poverty and crisis.“Every child should have the chance to learn in a setting that is safe and where staff know how to teach them. Common sense and certainty will come when families no longer have to fight for these ordinary expectations, regardless of where they live.”ADepartment for Educationspokesperson said: “We are determined to seize this once in a generation opportunity to reform a broken Send system and transform life chances for children with additional needs.“For too long, families have been forced to fight for support while councils have been left carrying unsustainable deficits.“Our forthcoming schools white paper will set out how we will build a more inclusive education system that delivers support earlier, restores financial sustainability, and ends the postcode lottery once and for all.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsEnglandDepartment for EducationnewsShareReuse this content"

According to UN calculations,74 million women worldwideand 3.1% of UK women aged 15-49 use injectable contraception.Multiple studies have shown that women who take Depo-Provera have a much higher relative risk of developing meningiomas, though the overall risk remains low. Not normally cancerous, these benign tumours can cause seizures, blindness, hearing loss, headaches and memory problems.Now several law firms are hoping to take legal action against Pfizer in the UK.Austen Haystold the Guardian it had some potential clients,Fletchers’ website is actively seeking clients andLeigh Daysaid it is in the early stages of considering the legal basis for any case.Chaya Hanoomanjee, a partner at Austen Hays, said: “We have been approached by at least 30 women who have developed meningiomas following prolonged use of Depo-Provera.“Their lives have been considerably impacted due to having brain tumours, with consequences such as loss of vision and, in one case, a woman having to terminate her pregnancy. The duty here lies withPfizerto ensure a drug is safe and to update warnings and contraindications as soon as new risks become known.“We are looking into the legal merits of each case, with a view to bringing a claim in the UK.”Jill Paterson, a partner at Leigh Day, said: “We have been aware for some time of the concerns that have been raised in relation to Depo-Provera. We know the devastating impact meningiomas can have on women’s lives and are assessing the strength of any potential case of those affected.“We are investigating the potential for a legal claim against the manufacturer and hope to be able to have a clear position on this soon.”The potential UK legal cases come asthousands of women are suing Pfizer for compensation in the US. Three law firms are leading a federal case, representing approximately 2,500 women, with the first trial to be held in December.The lawyers contend that Pfizer knew the risk of meningioma since at least 2015, but failed to warn patients or medical professionals of the risks, and failed to adequately warn the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration.Pfizer has not admitted liability and is contesting the litigation.The health impacts of meningioma can be devastating. Sandra Somarakis is one of the women suing Pfizer in the US for compensation and damages after developing a meningioma after long-term use of Depo-Provera. “Women shouldn’t have to live with what I’ve gone through,” she says. “There has to be consequences.”Somarakis, who is represented by Weitz & Luxenberg, took Depo-Provera for about 15 years and was diagnosed with meningioma in 2008, for which she had surgery. In 2010 she had to have more surgery and radiation treatment.Fifteen years later, Somarakis still has serious ongoing health problems. “To this day, I can’t open my mouth wide,” she says. “My left eyeball still pops out. It’s sore, it’s watery. It’s hard to remember people’s names, I get lost easily.”In the UK, Claire Buck, 47, believes the jab could have contributed to her meningioma and says she would consider bringing a legal claim against Pfizer, though at present her focus is on raising awareness.“I have a teenage daughter that I wouldn’t want this to happen to”, she says. Buck had to have a metal plate put in the front of her head, after brain surgery for a large meningioma. The foster carer from Surrey, who took Depo-Provera for a number of years, says her body went into shock when she came round from the operation. “I nearly died,” she says. “I’m lucky to be here.”Buck has life-changing ongoing symptoms. Her chewing muscle has shrunk, causing a lot of pain, she has developed glaucoma and hearing and memory problems, and her mental health has suffered.“I’m terrified of hospitals, I live in constant fear the tumour will start to grow again and I can’t cope with crowds or busy spaces – I worry someone might hit my head,” she said.Emma (not her real name), 57, believes the evidence suggests that taking Depo-Provera could have contributed to the growth of her meningiomas. She was diagnosed in 2024, after she developed seizures on the left side of her body. She had taken Depo-Provera for 15 years until 2019.Although Emma says that, physically, she has recovered well from her surgery, she now suffers from fatigue, and memory and attention problems. She also worries about the prognosis. “I fear that they might come back and I end up with brain cancer or losing my sight.”A spokesperson for Pfizer said: “Patient safety is our top priority. We conduct rigorous and continuous monitoring of all our medicines, including assessments of reported adverse events, in collaboration with health authorities around the globe.“Depo-Provera has been approved in more than 60 countries over the last 30 years, has a well-established efficacy and safety profile, and has been a treatment option for millions of patients during that time.“People should talk to their doctor, pharmacist or nurse if they have any concerns or experience any side effects.”Explore more on these topicsPfizerPharmaceuticals industryHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The statement was made on behalf of the author’s wife, the photographer Simone Sassen.“We will miss the friendship, erudition, enthusiasm and individuality of this internationally acclaimed writer,” it said.Nooteboom first made a name for himself in theNetherlandswith his 1955 debut novel Philip and the Others. Based on long hitchhiking trips to the Mediterranean and through Scandinavia, it won the Anne Frank prize and became a Dutch literary classic.He achieved his international breakthrough with his 1980 novel Rituals, about two friends – one of whom breaks rules frequently while the other follows them strictly. The book was turned into a film in 1988 and became his first work to be published in English translation.Born in The Hague on 31 July 1933, Nooteboom told the Guardian in a2006 interviewthat he had no childhood memories until the outbreak of the second world war.When Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940, “we watched on the horizon the glow of Rotterdam burning and I remember being very afraid and having to have cold water thrown in my face to calm me down”.His father was later killed when a British air raid levelled a residential quarter of The Hague “by mistake”.Germany was later one of the European countries were Nooteboom’s fiction and travel writing found even greater critical acclaim and commercial success than at home.As well as writing his own work, Nooteboom translated works from English into Dutch, such as poetry by Ted Hughes and Czesław Miłosz, and the plays of Brendan Behan and Seán O’Casey.He was awarded honorary doctorates from universities in Brussels, Nijmegen, Berlin and, in 2019, the University College London.Explore more on these topicsBooksNetherlandsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And that shame is a double sentence, it’s a suffering you inflict on yourself.”She added: “I said to myself that fighting against that on an individual level was also fighting for the collective. I said if I could do it, other people could too … My message of hope to all victims is never have shame.”Earlier, she described her shock when police first showed her images of the crimes, likening herself to a “rag doll”.In extracts from her forthcoming memoir, A Hymn to Life, Pelicot, 73, describes her shock when police told her of the actions of her ex-husband Dominique, whom she considered “a great guy” and had shared her life with for 50 years.She tells of her world falling apart on 2 November 2020 when she was first told her then husband had been drugging and raping her and inviting strangers to rape her, in extracts inLe Mondefrom the French-language version of the book that will be published simultaneously across the world in 22 languages next week.Dominique Pelicot had been summoned by police for questioning after a supermarket security guard caught him secretly filming up women’s skirts.Gisèle Pelicot had accompanied him to the police station and was completely unprepared for the bombshell delivered by the officer, Laurent Perret. He said: “I am going to show you photos and videos that are not going to please you. That’s you in this photo.”Pelicot said she did not believe the inert woman lying on the bed was her. “I didn’t recognise the individuals. Nor this woman. Her cheek was so flabby. Her mouth so limp. She was a rag doll,” she writes in the book.“My brain stopped working in the office of Deputy Police Sergeant Perret.”Pelicot became known internationally last year when she waived her right to anonymity in the trial that shocked the world.View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot leaves the courthouse for a break during the appeals trial of a man challenging his conviction in Nîmes, France.Photograph: Lewis Joly/APDominique Pelicothad for over almost a decade crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her mashed potato, coffee or ice-cream and invited dozens of men to rape her in the village of Mazan in south-east France, where the couple had retired. She had been in a state akin to a coma. A total of 51 men were found guilty of rape or sexual assault.In the book extracts, Pelicot describes her decision to make the trial public. She said if she had kept the trial behind closed doors – as usually happened in such cases – it would have protected her abusers and left her alone with them in court, “hostage to their looks, their lies, their cowardice and their scorn”.She wrote: “No one would know what they had done to me. Not a single journalist would be there to write their names next to their crimes … Above all, not a single woman could walk in and sit in the courtroom to feel less alone.”She said if she had been 20 years younger: “I might not have dared to refuse a closed-door hearing.“I would have feared the stares. Those damned stares a woman of my generation has always had to contend with, those damned stares that make you hesitate in the morning between trousers and a dress, that follow you or ignore you, flatter you and embarrass you. Those damned stares that are supposed to tell you who you are, what you’re worth, and then abandon you as you grow older.”The launch of Pelicot’s book, co-written with the French author Judith Perrignon, is considered a major publishing event as it is released simultaneously across the world on 17 February.The British actor Emma Thompson will narrate the audiobook in English. In a social media post, Thompson said the “absolutely extraordinary” story was “difficult to read out loud” but that it inspired “courage and compassion but also crucially demands change”.Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotGisèle Pelicot rape trialFranceAutobiography and memoirBiography booksEuropeViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

A jury found him not guilty of one count of transmission of material harmful to a minor by electronic device or equipment.The Guardian has contacted an attorney listed for Johnson.“He is exposed to the possibility of life in prison,” said Walter Forgie, chief assistant state attorney for Florida’s fifth judicial circuit, of a possible sentence. “Sentencing will be at a later date.”The Hernando county sheriff’s office received a report in July that “two juveniles had fallen victim to lewd and lascivious acts over a many-month span”, according to aprobable cause affidavit.View image in fullscreenAndrew Paul Johnson on 6 January 2021.Photograph: Department of JusticeThis document claims that a mother of one of these children claimed she had discovered Johnson, her former boyfriend, who had lived with them, had sent “inappropriate” Discord missives to her son.She asked her child about these messages and whether Johnson had “done or said anything inappropriate”, the probable cause affidavit says. Her son allegedly said that “between April 1 2024 and October 2024” Johnson had “molested him three times”, starting when he was aged 11.The police document also claimed Johnson said “he was pardoned for storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he was being awarded $10,000,000 as a result of being a ‘jan 6er’” and would put the boy “in his will to take any money he had left over”.“This tactic was believed to be used to keep” the child “from exposing what Andrew had done to him”, police said.Johnson was one of approximately 1,500 defendants charged for participation in the 6 January attack whom Trump granted clemency early in his presidential term.Trump has publiclydiscussedcompensating defendants prosecuted in related to the deadly attack, but none have received compensation thus far.

The studio was stumped on how to publicise it … Truthfully, its success came from the people.”In 2014, Corttold the Guardianit was “a blessing and a curse” as it led to him being typecast, getting offered only weirdo characters. He turned down the role of Billy Bibbit in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest as he wanted the lead and, after Jack Nicholson was cast, later asked for it back, but it was too late.In the 1970s, Cort went on to star in comedy drama Why Shoot the Teacher? and a TV movie adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald’s Bernice Bobs Her Hair with Shelley Duvall. In 1979, he was in a car accident that left him with serious injuries, breaking an arm and a leg and requiring plastic surgeries.He later returned to acting with roles in 1980s films such as the Jamie Lee Curtis-led romance Love Letters and Tobe Hooper’s sci-fi horror Invaders from Mars. The 1990s saw him in Kevin Smith’s Dogma and queer classic But I’m a Cheerleader before he later appeared in films including Coyote Ugly, The Number 23 and Wes Anderson’s The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.Small screen appearances also included Ugly Betty, Criminal Minds and Arrested Development. His long list of voice credits includes animated Batman, The Mask and Superman series.Cort was in another car accident in 2011 in which his arm was almost torn off, which made it hard to find work in the years after.Explore more on these topicsFilmHarold and MaudenewsShareReuse this content"

But he said he did not want to “look backwards and litigate the past”.“The company has been a mess in lots of ways for a long time, but I’m confident stars are aligning in a positive way,” he said.Murray said Post leadership used data on readership trends to determine which areas to cut. The publication’s sports, international, local and style sections were particularly hard-hit. “I’m sure we got some things wrong, but if I look around the room with everybody here, I know we got a lot of things right,” he said.While the Post achieved historic success during the first Trump administration, as reporters broke scoops and readers signed up in droves to support the publication’s mission, Murray said there was “no more Trump bump” these days.“People are reading [about] Donald Trump, but they also want to escape from Donald Trump,” he said.Amid questions about whether the publication’s mandate and ambition had shrunk, Murray said “the mission of the Post is unchanged”.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

ANL denies all the claims.Whittamore said he was in “no doubt that all journalists who used my services on a regular basis, or who worked in newsrooms who were regular users, knew that the information was obtained through illegal means such as blagging”.“The journalists who used me, and the editors who sanctioned this, knew full well that I was a practitioner of the ‘dark arts’,” he said. “If the information the journalists requested could have been acquired legitimately, as opposed to through blagging or other checks, then the newspapers would have had no need to use my particular services.”He said he obtained through a subcontractor details of the family of the actor Sadie Frost, one of the claimants in the case. He said the claimants’ team had shown him a “blag” relating to Frost in 2003.In written submissions, ANL said it had publicly acknowledged at the Leveson inquiry into the practices of the press that it had used “inquiry agents” in the past, “and there had been instances of blagging by those inquiry agents (Mr Whittamore in particular)”.Appearing in court, Paul Dacre, the former editor of the Daily Mail, said he banned the use of private investigators in 2007.ANL said the claimants’ legal team was trying to link up invoices to private investigators with stories complained about in the trial without evidence, claiming the tactic amounted to “guesswork”.Journalists named as having used Whittamore’s services said they did so for legitimate help finding addresses or phone numbers and “did not know or suspect Mr Whittamore was acting illegally”.Dacre was challenged over the evidence he had given to the Leveson inquiry, where he said it was not clear “what the journalists asked for” from private investigators.David Sherborne, the lead barrister for the claimants, showed Dacre a series of invoices. He suggested it was clear they were for finding details such as criminal record checks and vehicle registrations.Dacre said he did not deal with invoices and that he could not comment without knowing their context, the story they related to and the information gathered. He stood by his Leveson testimony.During the trial there have been rising tensions between Sherborne and the judge, Mr Justice Nicklin. The judge has warned Sherborne to stick to evidence related to the seven claimants rather than attempt to use the trial as a public inquiry into alleged unlawful activity at ANL.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsAssociated NewspapersDaily MailMail on SundayNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, Orbex said it had examined several merger and acquisition options in an effort to stay afloat but none of had come to fruition.“Disappointing doesn’t come close to describing how we feel about this moment,” Chambers said. “We have been successfully developing a sustainable, world-class sovereign space launch capability for the UK and were on the cusp of our first test flights later this year.”He added: “It is no secret that designing and building space rockets to enable a launch service is a capital-intensive, highly advanced process with a long development cycle that creates a ‘scale-up’ funding gap. Institutional support is a crucial to bridge this gap and we have worked tirelessly to try to find both funding or rescue solutions.”Peter Kyle, the business secretary,approved £20m of taxpayer-funded loans to Orbexin January 2025, hailing its plan to launch small satellites into orbit as one that would “transform the UK space industry”.At the time, Dr Paul Bate, who steps down as chief executive of the UKSpaceAgency next month, said Orbex would “inspire a new generation to reach for the stars”.Last summer, Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, handed a further £6m loan to the startup, designed to help it pursue a £150m contract with the European Space Agency to aid the development ofalternatives to Elon Musk’s SpaceXin the US.Orbex was planning to launch small satellites into orbit using its 19-metre long, low-carbon rockets. It had initially been developing its own home spaceport on the A’Mhòine peninsula in the Highlands, but was eventually forced to shelve the project and relocate its planned launches to SaxaVord, a base on the Shetland Islands.The launch would have been the first from UK soil since the British billionaire Richard Branson’sfailed Virgin Orbit missionin 2023.A government spokesperson said: “We remain committed to supporting our dynamic space sector. We recognise this will be a very worrying time for staff at Orbex. Space launch is a highly competitive sector, and it has always been the case that some companies will succeed, while others will fail.“We will be setting out more details about our plans for developing key national space capabilities, including launch, in due course. Any decisions will be focused on ensuring maximum impact for taxpayers’ money.”Explore more on these topicsAerospace industryScotlandSpaceSatellitesnewsShareReuse this content"

The NLRB declined comment on the report.In August last year, a US appeals court agreed with SpaceX and two other companies that the NLRB’s structure was probably unlawful and blocked the agency from pursuing cases against them.The National Mediation Board oversees railroad and airline companies such as American Airlines Group, while the NLRB oversees most other private sector employers, including manufacturers like Boeing.Under federal law, workers covered by the NLRB have a right to participate in a wide range of collective action aimed at improving their working conditions, with or without a union. Workers under National Mediation Board jurisdiction are covered by a different law, which lacks equivalent protections, the report said.Explore more on these topicsTechnologySpaceXElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Heroda and Hermon Berhane, the deaf identical twin presenters, say it reveals their community in a way never seen beforeLiam O'DellWed 11 Feb 2026 11.03 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 13.16 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIt may not be the first TV programme to describe itself as being “more than just a dating show”, but Hold My Hand is undoubtedly the first to focus exclusively on British Sign Language.“We’ve been waiting to get a show of our own for such a long time,” says Heroda Berhane, one half of the deaf identical twin presenting duo, Hermon and Heroda. “People have never seen our culture, our identity, the way we discuss the things. So it’s a dating show, yes, but it’s not just about dating; it’s also revealing our identity and our culture, and that has never been seen before.”The twins – who have more than 125,000 followers on their shared Instagram lifestyle account Being Her – are hoping to bust what Hermon calls “a lot of myths around deaf people being unable to do things because they think that we can’t communicate the same”. Their collaboration with the dating app Tinder in 2023 led with the headline statistic that 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds would not feel confident dating someone who uses BSL as their primary form of communication. According to the British Deaf Association, the UK has 150,000 BSL signers, of which 87,000 are deaf themselves.“It’s just another language,” Heroda explains. “It’s another world that you have to be curious about and lean into, learn, be open and don’t be afraid.”“Especially for hearing people,” says Hermon. “They speak a lot, and they sort of hide behind their language and their words. But for deaf people, we sort of peel off those layers to express ourselves in a different way and really show our emotions, rather than hiding behind words, so we become a bit more vulnerable.”Us deaf people, we’re very open, very blunt, very straight to the point, very honestAll contestants on LumoTV’s Hold My Hand are either deaf, or children of deaf adults (Codas) who would have used British Sign Language (BSL) to communicate with their parents. The size of the deaf signing community also meant Hermon and Heroda were more likely to know the contestants sitting in front of them.“It’s a very small circle,” says Heroda, “so we had to just pretend that we didn’t know the people and carry on. There’s a little bit of acting as well in that.”Fortunately, the pair are both actors in their own right, but they admit they had to stop themselves from joining the fun too.“There were so many things we wanted to say, because of our deaf identity and culture,” says Heroda. “We had to be careful.”There’s plenty to discuss in each of the three episodes in the first series, which also boasts a dedicated instalment with LGBT+ singletons. A “this or that” round has contestants opening up on whether they prefer morning or evening sex, while another has the singletons matching lube and lingerie to their rightful owners.“Us deaf people, we’re very open, very blunt, very straight to the point, very honest,” says Heroda, “and I want [hearing people] to see that.”She adds: “I really hope that hearing people realise, ‘Gosh, deaf people, we’re the same. There’s no difference. We’re all the same. We’re human.’ What’s most important is the humanistic side. There is love, there is sex, there is joy, there is flirtation, and there’s vulnerability as well. We’re exactly the same.”Hermon agrees: “We’re similar, but what is difficult, of course, is communication barriers. We have to learn from one other. You speak the language that I cannot hear, and I speak a language that you don’t understand.”“It’s more party-like – lively – the way we communicate,” concludes Heroda. “There’s more depth to the communication, rather than just hiding with words and relying on mood or facial expression. So actually, I just want them to see that there’s more authenticity, maybe.”The series lands just in time for Valentine’s Day and producers believe a strong and fun dating show format celebrating deaf identity has “huge mainstream potential”.“For too long, the use of British Sign Language has been treated as an afterthought in mainstream entertainment and reality TV,” says LumoTV CEO Camilla Arnold. “With this series, we’re flipping that on its head.”Hold My Hand’ will be available to stream from 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDeafness and hearing lossfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is based on the autobiographical novellaThe Character of Rain by Belgian author Amélie Nothomb, published in 2000.Loïse Charpentier voices the role of Amélie, a little girl living in Kobe,Japan, with her Belgian family in the late 60s; mum, dad and older brother and sister. Until the age of three, she was in a persistent vegetative state, but was miraculously jolted free of it by a terrifying earthquake; yet she emerges quarrelsome and almost feral, to the despair of her parents. That is until her elegant grandmother Claude (Cathy Cerda) comes to visit and gives her a piece of narcotically delicious white Belgian chocolate, which causes Amélie to bloom into a lovely, biddable child who adores her Japanese nanny Nishio-san (Victoria Grosbois).But there are problems: the family’s icily distant landlady Kashima-san (Yumi Fujimori) not-so-secretly detests her western tenants – and despises Nishio-san for working for them – due to unresolved feelings about allied bombings during the war. And what will happen when Amélie’s grandmother has to leave? And when the whole family have to leave Japan, which Amélie now sees as her adored homeland?The animation itself is, in its way, a very charming mix of European and Japanese styles, and there’s a lovely final sequence, when Amélie revisits in memory her fractionally younger self in various scenes around the idyllic house and garden.Little Amélie is in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFilm adaptationsFamily filmsJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

The extended footage of Welsh in conversation is certainly engaging, as he discusses his writing and the movies it created, and his own youth in Edinburgh.Some of the rest of the interviewees aren’t quite so gripping, however, and the film is padded out with a fair bit of redundant anecdotage from people on the subject of getting hilariously wasted in Irvine’s company — or at least his approximate vicinity. As for one 90s ladmag-style story about Irvine doing some kind of Marquis de Sade-themed photoshoot in Ibiza’s Manumission club involving prising apart young women’s buttocks for the camera … well maybe you had to be there.Iggy Pop, whose Lust for Life featured in Trainspotting, is interviewed, and so is producer Andrew Macdonald, but interview footage with director Danny Boyle and the Trainspotting stars seems to have been cannibalised from junket videos they did back in 2017 forthe film sequel T2 Trainspotting(based on Welsh’s book Porno). Be that as it may, I would have liked to hear more from Welsh about the cities he loves and about other authors and music he loves – and more from other authors about how he influenced them.

On the face of it, they were back on top. Their commercial fortunes had been revived by the huge success of some timely compilations: in the US, 1974’s Endless Summer sold 3m copies, while 20 Golden Greats became Britain’s second-biggest-selling album of 1976. Their leaderBrian Wilsonwas apparently, miraculously, match fit after years of addiction and mental health struggles. “BRIAN IS BACK!” ran the advertising slogan for 15 Big Ones, the first Beach Boys album to bear his name as sole producer since Pet Sounds, and the first to be made at their newly founded Brother Studios. Buoyed by a media campaign that included an hour-long TV special, it duly became their most successful album of new material in 11 years.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for We Gotta Groove.Photograph: Capitol RecordsBut, as ever with theBeach Boys, it was more complicated than it initially seemed. As a succession of features noted, Wilson didn’t seem to be terribly well at all. A Rolling Stone writer dispatched to meet him was startled when Wilson asked him for drugs midway through the interview, and expressed grave doubts about Eugene Landy, the controversial psychologist supposedly responsible for Wilson’s recuperation. A Melody Maker journalist who saw the Beach Boys live that summer declared that Wilson “shouldn’t be subjected to being propped up onstage”, noted that he looked visibly distressed and made no musical contribution. Rather than a triumphant return, 15 Big Ones was a hastily thrown-together mess of cover versions and wan new material, its sessions marked by disagreements, not least over whether Wilson was even capable of producing an album. The band’s members openly disparaged it on release: Dennis Wilson bluntly described one track as a “piece of shit”. The public who bought it seemed to lose interest quickly: the Beach Boys did not score another Top 10 album of new material for 36 years.There are people who have made some wild retrospective claims for 15 Big Ones’ artistic merit, among them Brian Wilson himself, but this box set’s compilers tactfully skirt around its existence despite its roots in Brother Studios. The original album isn’t included, its presence here confined to a scattering of outtakes, none of which seem fit to cause anyone to reassess their views, unless your opinion is likely to be swayed by the sound of Mike Love crooning his way through Johnny Preston’s Indigenous American-themed 1959 novelty hit Running Bear. Indeed, the inclusion of a handful of tracks that predate 15 Big Ones (from sessions abandoned because of Wilson’s reluctance to get involved) suggest the Beach Boys might have been making better music before his “recovery”: even in their unfinished state, Dennis Wilson’s Holy Man and 10,000 Years Ago are vastly superior to anything the Beach Boys’ comeback had to offer.The Beach Boys: We Gotta Groove – videoInstead, We Gotta Groove concentrates its attention on 15 Big Ones’ less commercially successful successor. Entirely composed and mostly played by Wilson, 1977’s Beach Boys Love You was both a radical departure – it’s dominated by the sound of synthesisers – and a drastic improvement: the opening seconds of Let Us Go on This Way have more life in them than every track on 15 Big Ones put together. That isn’t the same as suggesting it’s a masterpiece. Your enjoyment of it is likely to depend on whether you view Wilson’s lyrics as charmingly naive, a fascinating insight into a damaged psyche or just completely excruciating. “He sits behind his microphone, he speaks in such a manly tone,” offers his appraisal of talk show host Johnny Carson. “Saturn has rings all around it,” notes Solar System. “I searched the sky and I found it.”Still, you don’t want for melodies beautiful enough to suggest that Wilson’s primary songwriting skill remained intact, despite all that had been visited upon it in the preceding decade: The Night Was So Young, I Wanna Pick You Up, Airplane. Whatever you make of the lyrics to Roller Skating Child – “I go and get my skates on and I catch up with her / We do it holding hands, it’s so cold I go ‘brrr’” – the tune and the stacked vocal harmonies are fantastic.View image in fullscreenThe back cover of We Gotta Groove.Photograph: Max Aguilera-HellwegDespite its muted commercial response, Beach Boys Love You appeared to embolden Wilson further. His next project was a set of songs that drew on pre-rock’n’roll pop, an idea out of left field, but not one entirely without precedent. Wilson was a huge fan of George Gershwin and the Four Freshmen, a 50s vocal group whose oeuvre drew extensively on pre-war pop and jazz: a cursory listen to their 1955 album Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones reveals how much they influenced the Beach Boys’ harmonies. Moreover, his own work had occasionally seemed to reach back past the birth of rock’n’roll. It’s not a huge stretch to imagine Pet Sounds’s You Still Believe in Me or Don’t Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder) hailing from the 30s or 40s rather than 1966, although they were less explicit in their intentions than his new material: Wilson intended for Frank Sinatra to sing Still I Dream of It. Sinatra turned him down, but no matter: it’s hard to imagine a version more potent than Wilson’s, his cigarette-ravaged voice amplifying the effect of its wistful lyrics. Another sumptuously orchestrated ballad, It’s Over Now, is similarly great, as is Wilson’s cover of the 1930s hit Deep Purple.The concept wasn’t completely out of step with contemporary trends – not long after Wilson recorded these songs, Willie Nelson released Stardust, an exquisite album of Great American Songbook standards that sold millions – but somehow things went off piste. First, Wilson taped a selection of tracks that seemed to have nothing to do with his original idea, among them the frankly appalling Hey Little Tomboy, a song that’s even creepier than its title suggests. Then the tracklisting of the projected album, Adult/Child, was padded out with early 70s outtakes, apparently in the belief that the world was desperate to hear HELP Is on Its Way, a 1971 paean to organic food, and its capacity to guard against “doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too” (neither the outtakes nor Hey Little Tomboy are here, the latter presumably excised on the grounds of taste). Then the whole thing was scrapped: in a weird echo of Smile, Mike Love’s response to the 40s-style songs was: “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”Whether wistful or euphoric, Brian Wilson made pop’s most overwhelmingly beautiful musicRead moreIt’s a question that seems more germane to the remainder of the Beach Boys’ recording career. Their next release turned out to be the abysmal MIU Album, home to the tennis-themed Match Point of Our Love, which succeeded in making the lyrics on Beach Boys Love You seem as erudite and multi-layered as Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands. It says something about the Beach Boys’ increasingly catastrophic judgment that the only track to survive the Adult/Child sessions and make it on to MIU was Hey Little Tomboy. You might have thought MIU represented the band’s artistic nadir, until you heard its follow up, LA (Light Album). And if you thoughtthatwas their nadir, you hadn’t heard 1980’s Keepin’ the Summer Alive, and so on and so on.It’s a sorry story that places the music on We Gotta Groove in context: wildly variable in quality, even at its best not in the same league as the stuff that made the Beach Boys famous; for fans only. But, filled with strange diversions and what proved to be dead ends, it’s seldom boring: in fact, the Beach Boys would never be so interesting again.Explore more on these topicsBeach BoysPop and rockBrian Wilsonalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The viral musical virtuosos bringing brains and brilliance back to social mediaWhether making microtonal pop or playing Renaissance instruments with sheep bones, a crop of bold artists are making genuinely strange music go mainstream – but are they at the mercy of the algorithm?Nathan EvansWed 11 Feb 2026 05.38 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 06.20 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleChloë Sobek is a Melbourne musician who plays the violone, a Renaissance precursor to the double bass. But instead of playing it in the traditional manner, she puts wobbling bits of cardboard between its strings or uses a sheep’s bone as a bow, and these weird interventions have become catnip for Instagram’s algorithm, getting her tens of thousands – sometimes hundreds of thousands – of views for each of her self-made performance videos. “Despite how it might appear, I’m a reasonably shy person,” she says.When Laurie Anderson’s robo-minimalist masterwork O Superman hit No 2 in the UK charts in 1981, thanks to incessant airplay on John Peel’s radio show, it was a signal of a media outlet’s power to propel experimental music into the mainstream. That’s now happening again as prepared-instrument players such as Sobek, plus experimental pianists, microtonal singers and numerous other boundary-pushing solo performers, are routinely breaking out of underground circles thanks to videos – generally self-recorded at home – going viral onTikTokand Instagram.You may have come across a cover of a Mitski songplayed on a sinister microtonal scale, or a piano piece where the playerfrantically draws a circle across the keys of a piano, or in the case of Brad Barr, a strained drone made by Barr pulling along piece of polyester through his guitar strings. It all suggests that the general public are actually a lot more receptive to weird music than many assume – but why is it all resonating quite so strongly?View image in fullscreenPrecious Renee Tucker performing in November 2025.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for Saint HeronThe success of these bedroom virtuosos is already moving into the real world: after getting millions of viewers of her expressionist solo piano and synth performances, Arkansas musician (and part-time piano teacher) Precious Renee Tucker was recently invited to perform for her hero Solange Knowles. “I’m definitely still processing everything,” she says. Her TikTok is a chaotic digital sketchbook of her lifelong friendship with the piano, captioned with enthusiastic exclamations such as “i don’t know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” and “music is fabric!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”. “I’m always releasing things without thinking too hard about the need to comprehend them,” she says. “It’s really these fragments of myself.”‘I feel like a mother to Björk’ – the amazing Meredith Monk on composing with growls, gasps, chirrups and yodelsRead moreOther experimental artists, such as Maddie Ashman and Bryan Deister, are captivating TikTok scrollers with microtonal music, which is essentially a great wilderness of dissonant notes hidden between the standardised western scale. “This blows my mind, it’s like we’ve been living in a musical matrix of prescribed noises that are ‘OK’,” reads one comment underone of Ashman’s songs.“I’m led by questions,” says Ashman, a British musician who makes microtonal pop filled with freakish harmonies and unpredictable vocal hocketing – a technique with interlocking melodic lines – reminiscent of that great hero of the avant garde, Meredith Monk. “I’m happiest when I’m moving between places, and approaching one instrument in the way I would approach another instrument.” During her four-year rise on short-form video platforms, culminating in the release of her debut EP last week, she’s embraced microtonality because it’s something few artists can do. “For a lot of people, their experience of microtonal music is them not being able to play it, and it hurts.”Ashman bases her videos around the element of surprise, starting with a playthrough of the raw microtonal scale, then pulling a beguiling song from it. “I suppose that works well for the algorithm,” she hypothesises, “because people have an expectation of what it’s going to be. Then we’re defying those expectations, and people feel something.”However, like Anderson’s chart success, these musicians are as divisive as they are prominent; each video is guaranteed to have a share of detractors, questioning the validity of the music. “People start having arguments on the comment threads,” Sobek says and, in her case, people often show concern for her instrument. “Because it’s this beautiful Renaissance instrument and I look like I’m bashing it, people are like, ‘How can you do that?’ But the way I play is actually quite gentle if you saw it in person. I’m saying that these old instruments don’t have to be behind glass. In a way, I’m bringing them to life more than someone who’s stuck trying to replicate history.”View image in fullscreenChloë Sobek performing the violone – with added cardboard.Photograph: Courtesy: Chloë SobekThat provocation means Sobek stands out on social media, an attention economy where every comment – positive or negative – is registered as engagement; mainstream musicians such as Rosalía and Jacob Collier have meanwhile driven interest in classical performance and music theory in recent years. But the success of Sobek, Ashman et al. is mostly down to genuine excitement from people who have become numbed by boring influencer culture and AI slop. “We are genuinely desiring something brand new, or at least to be inspired to have that perspective,” says Tucker. “To let go of the past and detach from what we’ve seen before, and have the courage to do something creative that hasn’t existed yet.”In a roundabout way, it’s a re-engagement with experimental art’s purpose: to provoke and gauge reaction by bending invisible rules. “That is my favourite part about the experimental realm,” Tucker says with a smile. “I’m not necessarily saying the way that I play is correct or the standard. I really love the conversations that come up: Is this acceptable? Does this sound good? What is this?” She compares the process to a lab full of scientists comparing notes.However, some comments underneath female artists’ videos veer into misogyny. “There’s definitely an element of me being a woman doing something that’s confronting,” Sobek says. “I get a lot of men having strong reactions, and I do wonder, would it be different if I was a guy? Whether it would be slightly more accepted?” Ashman sees a similar pattern of male self-elected experts questioning how “truly microtonal” her music is, but says that “we’re now in a society where the majority of people can laugh at them rather than being hurt too much, which is amazing to be able to say”.For all their online success, these artists are also anxious about appeasing the social media algorithms that promoted their videos in the first place. “Can I keep the same mindset of doing this for fun? Can I take a break, or do I need to keep making and push it out regardless?” questions Tucker.The 10 best experimental albums of 2025Read more“There’s always been gatekeepers,” Sobek argues. “We think that the internet has democratised things, but it’s still defined by this gatekeeping algorithm. It’s all the same thing.”Not only does this create pressure to post regularly, but short-form video could warp the idea of what experimental art actually is, in the eyes of those who have just discovered it via an algorithm. “It’s pushing this idea of spectacle, and I don’t think art is just about spectacle,” Sobek says. “I’ll post a video that’s more ‘musically serious’ and it won’t get anywhere near as much interest as the fun and crazy stuff.”But short-form video also offers new ways to express oneself – you can see it in the superimposed lyrics descending down the stairs behind Ashman in her videos, or how each of Tucker’s lo-fi, impulsive clips adds up to a singular body of work – and this is art in a uniquely public dialogue with its audience. “It is surprising,” Tucker says, “that this many people are willing to be in this place of the unknown, and not having such an immediate answer in such an immediate digital space where you can have every kind of stimulant you’d like. I’m proud of all of us for having the bravery to go there.”Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicClassical musicPop and rockSocial mediaTikTokInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chair of judges and Labour peer Thangam Debbonaire said the longlist was “hopeful”, and represented “women writing excellently on a wide range of subjects, each uncovering something new about our world”.Among the best-known names on the list is the Booker prize-winning novelist and political activist Arundhati Roy, longlisted for her first memoir, Mother Mary Comes to Me, an exploration of identity, motherhood and the making of a writer, which Amit Chaudhuri described as “utterly absorbing” in aGuardian review.Quick GuideWomen’s prize for nonfiction longlist 2026ShowDaughters of the Bamboo Grove: China’s Stolen Children and a Story of Separated Twins by Barbara Demick (Granta)The Finest Hotel in Kabul: A People’s History of Afghanistanby Lyse Doucet (Hutchinson Heinemann)Don’t Let It Break You, Honey: A Memoir About Saving Yourself by Jenny Evans (Robinson)Art Cure: The Science of How the Arts Transform Our Health by Daisy Fancourt (Cornerstone Press)With the Law on Our Side: How the Law Works for Everyone and How We Can Make It Work Better by Lady Hale (The Bodley Head)To Be Young, Gifted and Black: Creativity and Race in the 21st Century by Kadiatu Kanneh-Mason (Oneworld)Artists, Siblings, Visionaries: The Lives and Loves of Gwen and Augustus Johnby Judith Mackrell (Picador)Ask Me How It Works: Love in an Open Marriage by Deepa Paul (Viking)Death of an Ordinary Manby Sarah Perry (Jonathan Cape)The Genius of Trees: How Trees Mastered the Elements and Shaped the Worldby Harriet Rix (The Bodley Head)Hotel Exile: Paris in the Shadow of War by Jane Rogoyska (Allen Lane)Mother Mary Comes to Me by Arundhati Roy(Hamish Hamilton)Finding Albion: Myth, Folklore and the Quest for a Hidden Britain by Zakia Sewell (Hodder Press)To Exist As I Am: A Doctor’s Notes on Recovery and Radical Acceptance by Grace Spence Green (Wellcome Collection)Nation of Strangers: Rebuilding Home in the 21st Century by Ece Temelkuran (Canongate)Indignity: A Life Reimagined by Lea Ypi(Allen Lane)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.British author Sarah Perry’s Death of an Ordinary Man, a meditation on grief, family and faith, centred on the death of her father-in-law, is also longlisted.Writing in the Guardian, Joe Moran called it “gem-like” and “special”, a book that “works its magic through the adamantine detail and quiet lyricism”.The academic and author Lea Ypi is nominated for Indignity: A Life Reimagined, which examines her personal family history alongside political upheaval across the Balkans, from the Ottoman empire to the aftermath of communism – a history “brought to life through Ypi’s novelistic style”, Sami Kent wrote in hisGuardian review.History and politics loom large on the list – the BBC’s chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet is recognised forThe Finest Hotel in Kabul, a people’s history of Afghanistan told through the shifting fortunes of the InterContinental hotel in the capital. Barbara Demick’s Daughters of the Bamboo Grove tells the true story of separated twins to illuminate the human consequences of China’s one-child policy, while Jane Rogoyska’s Hotel Exile looks at the history of the Hotel Lutetia in Paris, which was used as the headquarters of the German military intelligence service, the Abwehr, during the second world war.Contemporary social and cultural questions are tackled in works including Lady Hale’s With the Law on Our Side, an insider’s account of how the legal system works and how it may be improved; Zakia Sewell’s Finding Albion, exploring British myth and folklore; and Ece Temelkuran’s Nation of Strangers, on exile, migration and belonging. The longlist also includes books on art and science, from Daisy Fancourt’s Art Cure, on the health benefits of creativity, to Harriet Rix’s The Genius of Trees, a study of how trees have shaped ecosystems and human history.View image in fullscreenArundhati Roy has been longlisted for her first memoir, Mother Mary Comes to Me.Photograph: TT News Agency/AlamyOther longlisted titles include Jenny Evans’s memoir Don’t Let It Break You, Honey, her account of beingassaulted by a high-profile figure; Kadiatu Kanneh-Mason’s To Be Young, Gifted and Black, exploring creativity and race in the 21st century; Judith Mackrell’sArtists, Siblings, Visionaries, a dual biography of Gwen and Augustus John; Deepa Paul’s Ask Me How It Works, an exploration of love and desire in an open marriage; and Grace Spence Green’s To Exist As I Am,a doctor’s reflections on a life-changing spinal injury.Debbonaire said: “The books on this hopeful longlist are rigorous and researched, lyrical and flowing. They are drawn together by the originality and skill with which they have been written. This reading list carries relevance and truth for the future as well as holding significant value for the present day.”Claire Shanahan, executive director of the Women’s Prize Trust, said the longlist reflected the importance of hearing a variety of voices. “Reading and hearing a multiplicity of perspectives, experiences and ideas through nonfiction writing is more vital than ever – it is how we make sense of the world, it’s how we learn from the past, challenge injustice, and imagine new futures,” she said.The creation of the prize was prompted by research which found that only 35.5% of winners across seven major UK nonfiction awardsover the previous decadewere women.Last year’s prize went to Dr Rachel Clarke forThe Story of a Heart, while the inaugural winner was Naomi Klein forDoppelganger.The judges will announce a shortlist of six titles on 25 March, with the winner revealed on 11 June. The winning author will receive £30,000 and a limited-edition artwork known as the Charlotte.Alongside Debbonaire, the judging panel includes Roma Agrawal, engineer, author and broadcaster, Nicola Elliott, founder of NEOM Wellbeing, Nina Stibbe, novelist and memoirist, and Nicola Williams, crown court judge and thriller author.To browse all books on the Women’s prize for nonfiction 2026 longlist, visitguardianbookshop.com.

While his comrades were dying at the front, plenty of young men appeared to have dodged military duty and were now to be found carousing in Berlin’s packed bars. The women were no better: husbandless but flush with ration coupons purloined from soldiers on leave, they were busy gorging themselves. “If Berlin were Germany,” huffed the complainant, “we would have lost this war years ago.”Berlin had always been a case apart. The legacy of the wild Weimar years – all that artistic and political radicalism, not to mention louche living – had continued under the Third Reich. The city remained defiantly itself and, despite the efforts of high command, mulish about being told what to do. That, at least, had been the situation in 1941.By the time Ian Buruma’s father, a conscripted labourer from the Netherlands, arrived two years later Berlin had begun grudgingly to toe the line. The war was going badly now, with the Russians pushing in from the east, and American and British bombs dropping from the skies. Food was scarce, Jewish citizens were being disappeared daily and Hitler and Goebbels, both frequently in the city, were getting more anxious and crueller by the day. Now whenever Berliners met each other in a food queue or a bomb shelter their most likely greeting wasBleiben sie übrig– “Stay alive”.Nonetheless, argues Buruma, wherever you looked you could still find pockets of resistance. He isn’t referring here to well organised underground networks, but rather to ordinary men and women, not especially brave but still capable of doing the right thing. When Jews were ordered to start wearing identifying insignia, plenty of their fellow Berliners made a point of going up to them in the street and shaking hands. Young Leo Buruma, drafted in to work at a heavy engineering factory, took up with a Ukrainian girlfriend, pointedly ignoring the Nazis’ dictum that, as a “Germanic” Dutchman, he had no business consorting with an “inferior race”. It might not sound like much but, as Buruma puts it, “not everyone is cut out to be a hero”.These small acts of grace from 80 years ago can be hard to research. Buruma starts with his own father’s letters home, which he began to go through systematically after Leo’s death in 2020. The young man clearly didn’t want to frighten his family – he reports the after-effects of a heavy bombing as merely “quite a sight” – and was careful not to fall foul of the German censor. Reading between the lines, though, Ian Buruma pieces together an existence of outward conformity (Leo signs up to be an air raid warden) and inner protest (on Saturday nights he plays piano with the widow of a wealthy Jewish lawyer, an act that could have got them both locked up or worse).Other witnesses, such as journalists Ursula von Kardorff and Ruth Andreas-Friedrich, were careful to keep only scrappy and coded memos during the war, but subsequently reconstructed these into coherent narratives for publication. Von Kardorff could never be described as a resister, yet her memoir shows someone trying hard to remain decent in a criminal state. Her father, a successful portrait painter, had lost his teaching job thanks to his opposition to the regime yet her mother, a textile designer, continued to kit out the homes of the Nazi grandees. Ursula herself delivers warm clothes to Jewish homes but wonders if she is merely doing it to salve her conscience. Her real anguish is reserved for her brother who is fighting for Germany on the eastern front.None of this is morally coherent and yet, suggests Buruma in this wonderfully nuanced book, it was necessary if you wanted to stay alive, and knew yourself to be neither brave nor craven – but somewhere in the muddled in-between.Stay Alive: Berlin 1939-45 by Ian Buruma is published by Atlantic (£22).

Stretching from a strawberry farm in Indiana to the North Korean border, Choi’s sixth novel reckons with the lies that undo families and underpin empires.Flashlight first appeared in the New Yorker as a short story – a standoff in a psychiatrist’s office. The novel opens here too. It is the late 1970s: 10-year-old Louisa has been dragged in for a consultation, and she’s not playing nice. She waits out the clock, evading, deflecting. “This room is full of tricks to get children to talk, but you’re too smart for them,” the doctor flatters her. “I’m too smart for compliments,” Louisa snaps back.Louisa’s father has drowned, and her mother has turned into a strange new invalid. What the girl feels defies grief or sympathy. This isn’t mourning, it’s mutiny; and it will take more than some avuncular desk jockey to tame her. While the doctor is distracted, she steals an emergency flashlight from his office – a low-stakes theft with high-voltage meaning. The night Louisa’s father disappeared into the water, he was holding a flashlight.Portentous torches will appear throughout these pages (it’s not the subtlest of metaphors for a novel about absence and secrecy). This is a story told in brief illuminations, like a child spinning a torch in a dark bedroom. Slices of light; slices of life.We begin with a flashback to Louisa’s parents. Her father, Serk, an ethnic Korean raised in Japan, is a child of postwar limbo. Caught between two nations, and claimed by neither, he trades his borderland life for a blank American slate – or so he thinks (America has other ideas).Louisa’s mother, Anne, is an obstinate, spiky creature, allergic to expectation. Pregnant at 19, she gives birth to a child she’s not permitted to keep, and her adult life shapes itself around her son’s absence, like a house built around a locked room. Louisa will inherit her mother’s bone-deep stubbornness – twin contrarians.When Serk drowns, he leaves behind a silence so complete it swallows the past whole. And so Louisa is left with two absent parents: one right in front of her; the other near mythic. Flashlight is a study of absence – absence of narrative, of inheritance, of place, of affection. Who are you, it asks, when there’s no story to inherit, no history to claim?Beejay Silcox£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirZuckerberg and meCareless PeopleSarah Wynn-WilliamsCareless PeopleSarah Wynn-WilliamsZuckerberg and meIf Douglas Coupland’s 1995 novel about young tech workers, Microserfs, were a dystopian tragedy, it might read something like Careless People. The author narrates, in a fizzy historic present, her youthful idealism when she arrives at Facebook (now Meta) to work on global affairs in 2011, after a stint as an ambassador for New Zealand. Some years later she finds a female agency worker having a seizure on the office floor, surrounded by bosses who are ignoring her. The scales falling from her eyes become a blizzard. These people, she decides, just “didn’t give a fuck”.Mark Zuckerberg’s first meeting with a head of state was with the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2012. He was sweaty and nervous, but slowly he acquires a taste for the limelight. He asks (unsuccessfully) to be sat next to Fidel Castro at a dinner. In 2015 he asks Xi Jinping if he’ll “do him the honor of naming his unborn child”. (Xi refuses.) He’s friendly with Barack Obama, until the latter gives him a dressing-down about fake news.In 2016, Facebook embeds staff in Donald Trump’s campaign, helping him win. This inspires Zuckerberg to consider running for president himself, and he tours US swing states in 2017.Meanwhile, in an effort to do business in China, his company has been offering the Chinese Communist party a “white-glove service”, and a genocide has occurred in Myanmar following a flood of false anti-Muslim stories posted on Facebook.Zuckerberg turns out to be a giant man-baby suffering from a severe case of the Dunning-Kruger effect, whereby people overestimate their own cognitive abilities. His colleagues obsequiously let him win at board games. He blames his assistants when he forgets his own passport.Wynn-Williams left Facebook in 2018 to work on “unofficial negotiations between the US and China on AI weapons”. Has the company’s office culture improved since then? A clue might be Zuckerberg’s recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast. He complains that corporate culture has become too “neutered” and needs a new injection of “masculine energy”.Editor’s note: since this review was written Meta has responded to Wynn-Williams’ book, calling it “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives”.Steven Poole£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA brilliant meditation on mortalityDeath of an Ordinary ManSarah PerryDeath of an Ordinary ManSarah PerryA brilliant meditation on mortalityThe novelist Sarah Perry’s father-in-law, David, died of oesophageal cancer in 2022. This book tells the story of his dying, from the last time she saw him well, on a trip to Great Yarmouth at the end of summer, to his death less than two months later, just nine days after being diagnosed.What makes this book gem-like is that it succeeds in conveying the reality of death as this monumental, mythic thing that coexists surreally with the mundane world of council bin collections and neighbours hanging out their washing. Death, once it has decided to capture us, descends with the inevitability of gravity.Perry balks at the well-meaning phrase “dignity in dying”. Her father-in-law’s dying feels so unavoidably undignified, a matter first of confusion and fear, then immobility and incontinence. But the dying body, as she describes it – the desiccating lips and hands, the skin the colour and texture of vellum parchment, the labourer’s hands now resembling “those of a Russian pianist” – is also transfiguring. She watches David change hour by hour into someone else entirely, a diminished but more majestic self.As a young, aspiring writer, Perry yearned for dramatic, painful experiences to give her something to write about. She wanted, she says, “to hoard rubies and lose them, and spill ink into the loss”. But here she has written beautifully and compellingly about the life of an unexceptional man, and an experience that is coming to all of us – and shown that there is no such thing as an ordinary life, or an ordinary death.Joe Moran£10.79 (RRP £11.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionWitty debut about Islamic State bridesFundamentallyNussaibah YounisFundamentallyNussaibah YounisWitty debut about Islamic State bridesNadia is a lecturer in criminology at UCL whose latest academic article on Islamic State brides has garnered global attention. Now the UN has its eyes on her. Her research, which asks questions such as, “What’s the appropriate punishment for IS brides who didn’t commit any violent crimes?”, “Can we detain people just because of their beliefs?” and “Should we try to change their beliefs?”, takes her to Iraq, where she’s tasked with leading a UN deradicalisation organisation: UNDO. But, she discovers, “half the UN doesn’t believe in deradicalisation”.Escaping a “juvenile heartbreak” and a strenuous relationship with her mother, Nadia arrives in Baghdad with high hopes of “women helping women”. Before long, her bubble bursts, and she comes face to face with the opacity and sanctimony for which foreign aid bodies are notorious.When she meets Sara, a British Asian who joined Islamic State at 15, and is now in a refugee camp in the Iraqi countryside, she finally finds her purpose. The novel follows Nadia’s attempts at making a case for her repatriation. Sara is sceptical of the rehabilitation programme: “What bait spying shit is this?”; “The UN is definitely not a colonial conspiracy that gives fake legal cover to Western war crimes”. But Nadia is utterly charmed by her: “that bolshiness, the vulnerability it undoubtedly masked, the way she reminded me of my teenage self – right down to the diamanté headscarf and the post-colonial theory-based backchat”.Near the end of the novel, Nadia finds that she has an “ungrateful refugee problem”. Despite all her best efforts, Sara still thinks of her as a “slag with a saviour complex”, and Nadia isn’t sure which side of history – or the truth – she stands on. Will the two women ever believe the best in people, or themselves?Younis tackles radicalism and racism, faith and friendship, with dexterity, deep care and a large dose of  laughter. Fundamentally exposes the bureaucracy, hypocrisy and corruption widespread across both academia and activism, but its success lies in teaching us that repair and healing are slow, and never straightforward, processes.Sana Goyal£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseShort storiesAn extraordinary debutEvery One Still HereLiadan Ní ChuinnEvery One Still HereLiadan Ní ChuinnAn extraordinary debutThe latest addition to the literature of the Troubles is a slim debut story collection by nonbinary Northern Irish writer Liadan Ní Chuinn.“I believe, these things, they’re the making of us,” a character says at one point. He’s talking about a dead friend, but his words might apply to Northern Ireland’s past 50 or so years. Throughout the book the violence of that period is shown to persist, the past proving powerfully, inconveniently alive. Tensions flare between those who attempt to ignore that fact and others who insist on it.When the narrator of the title story, Jackie, was a boy, his father fell ill and appeared to enter a vegetative state. Ní Chuinn, a writer of subtlety despite the polemic that veins these stories, doesn’t push hard on the metaphor, but this “lax and unmoving” figure can be read as a symbol for a Northern Ireland that forgets its history. In fact, as another character – born, like Jackie, after the Good Friday agreement – insists later on, in Northern Ireland the past bears down on the present with such weight that it is an error to even call it history. Ní Chuinn forgoes an epigraph, but a lesser writer, one more in need of underlining their aims, would have reached for Faulkner’s lines from Requiem for a Nun: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”Ní Chuinn’s stories are unpredictable and memorable. While they contain the stuff of plots – family secrets, abuse, fraudulent fertility clinics and human trafficking – these aren’t their true subjects, and they almost entirely lack the resolution provided by that familiar short-story trait, the epiphany. Rather than accounts of revelation, these are reports from the knotty midst of things. They describe entanglements that cannot be ignored or consigned to history.Chris Power£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA shattering account of losing two sonsThings in Nature Merely GrowYiyun LiThings in Nature Merely GrowYiyun LiA shattering account of losing two sonsIn this quietly devastating account of life after the death by suicide of both of her sons, Yiyun Li refuses to use “mourning” or “grieving” because they cannot adequately contain the magnitude of her experience. “My husband and I had two children and lost them both,” she writes, and words can only “fall short”.She begins by laying out the facts. And those facts, raw and precise, are shattering: Vincent died in 2017, aged 16. James died in 2024, aged 19. Vincent, we learn, loved baking and knitting, and did not live long enough to graduate high school. James, a brilliant linguist studying at Princeton, where Li teaches creative writing, took his last Japanese class on a Friday. “Facts, with their logic, meaning, and weight, are what I hold on to,” she writes. Things in Nature Merely Grow is by necessity profoundly sad, but in the act of sharing details of the “abyss” she now inhabits, Li has created something both inclusive and humane.James, with his gentle smile and understated sense of humour, is depicted as a brilliant, autistic, self-contained, somewhat unreachable person who “thought hard: deeply, philosophically, and privately”. Months before his death, he reread Albert Camus’ play Caligula “a bit obsessively”, and watched English, Spanish and Japanese productions of it online. Now, with hindsight, Li homes in on a particular line: “Men die; and they are not happy.” She repeats this phrase, considering it a possible key to James’s thoughts.Li understands that nobody can know the precise reasons a person chooses suicide but, still, she circles back towards the same thoughts: did James “back himself into a corner” through his readings of Camus’ The Myth of Sisyphus and Caligula? Was the decision he made connected to Vincent’s death? Trying to comprehend, Li experiments with painful variants of the refrain: “Children die, and they are not happy”; “Children die, and parents go on living”.Grieving is not a useful word for Li because it implies an end point, a release from the loss. There is no redemptive moment of healing here; things in nature merely grow, they are not automatically resolved, wounds are not neatly sutured. But growing is life and Li is, and always will be, a mother. Her book is a meditation on living and radical acceptance that has the potential to offer deep solace; comfort from the abyss.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

It’s a hot, dry summer and two estranged brothers decline into middle age while their adolescent children wait desperately for their lives to begin. This is a world we’d expect to find in a play by Chekhov, rather than a novel by Tash Aw, who has made his name with exuberant, heavily plotted portraits of life in Malaysia and China, the characters edging between makeshift grifting and actual criminality. But now he has distilled his vision of the novel into something smaller and more intense. The South takes place on a single farm in rural south Malaysia over a single summer in the 1990s.The book soaks us in bodily intimacy from the outset, opening with a description of two boys having sex for the first time in the orchard. Jay, who has longed for this for weeks, wants to draw out the moment, so that “whatever time they have together will feel like many hours, a whole day”, while Chuan seems to want “to accelerate each second and collapse time”.Like Chekhov’s Russia, Aw’s Malaysia is both a universally resonant vision of a timeless and placeless lost world, and a historically precise portrait of a country undergoing rapid modernisation. In the background are climate shifts that exacerbate these difficulties. Our present cycles of drought and flooding were already happening in Malaysia in the 1990s. The orchard destroyed to make way for a building project is a symbol of a lost way of life, as for Chekhov, but is also indicative of larger threats to the climate.This is the first novel in a quartet described as an “epic for our times”. I worry that after the vitality of this portrait of a moment, it might be tedious to read book after book about Jay and Chuan and their descendants as they age. But Aw has moved beyond his previous novels to discover a different kind of writing here, emerging as a Proustian chronicler of momentary bodily and mental experience writing on a compressed, exquisite scale. Perhaps he will follow Proust in using his newly revealed capacity for blending the timeless and the historical to reinvent what an epic can be.Lara Feigel£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryReclaiming beautyDecolonising My BodyAfua HirschDecolonising My BodyAfua HirschReclaiming beautyIn February 1982, the black American feminist, poet and civil rights activist Audre Lorde said: “If I didn’t define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people’s fantasies for me and eaten alive.” She was ruminating on liberation, oppression and life in the 1960s, but her journey of self-definition and discovery is one many black women in the west find themselves on.Afua Hirsch is one of them. After her 40th birthday, the journalist and former barrister embarked on “a year of adornment” – a new phase in her life, an attempt to unlock something deeper, something spiritual, to combat the years of debating for her own humanity as a black woman in the public eye. To truly find rest.She reconnects with her heritage while simultaneously applying this new understanding to her own body. “I’m coming to terms with the fact that, in my family, ancestral traditions of bodily adornment – like so much other knowledge – are lost,” she writes.If her first book Brit(ish) was about grappling with her identity as a black British woman of mixed heritage, Decolonising My Body aims to unpack how her identity and wider society have shaped her physically. Hirsch is less concerned with proving that she belongs, instead focusing on what she describes as “ancestral deficiency syndrome” – a yearning to restore ancestral traditions “that offer a cohesive way to initiate us through the stages of life”. This isn’t a guide or a self-help book, rather an effort to examine the effects of Eurocentric beauty standards and ask how we can extract ourselves from them.Hirsch has a nifty way of drawing from anecdote while using her journalistic skills to report on the wider cultural context, and tracing this back around to her own life. From observing a sacred menstrual ritual with her daughter to the historical significance of tattoos and scarification, she writes in a manner that is self-aware without feeling deprecating or patronising.In many ways, Decolonising My Body is Hirsch’s pilgrimage towards another definition of rest and care, one that feels ancestral and intimate. As a reader you can’t help but be swept up in her quest of gentle unlearning and relearning.Niellah Arboine£11.04 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionHopeless sons vs brilliant daughtersThe Tiger's ShareKeshava GuhaThe Tiger's ShareKeshava GuhaHopeless sons vs brilliant daughtersKeshava Guha’s second novel opens with a family summit organised by narrator-protagonist Tara Saxena’s father, Brahm, her Baba, during which he announces to Tara and her younger brother, Rohit, that he has decided to relinquish all obligations to them. In the remaining years of his life he feels compelled to find and then act upon his deeper, more essential purpose – what he owes not to his family but to the world itself, in particular his own beloved and polluted country, which sees “every tree, every bird suffering, as if it has been told it must live but is stuck in a place no longer fit for living”.“Daddy, you’ve gone full Greta,” is Rohit’s alarmed response. The resulting narrative unspools over the year that follows their father’s ecological awakening, with all the ways it alters the course of things for Tara and Rohit. She is a very successful lawyer; as an adult, he has mostly failed and flailed about, existing in his sister’s shadow – or, at least, this is how Tara sees it.Two questions propel the narrative onwards. The first: what is it that Brahm Saxena will do? The second: why is this moral spirit so lacking in the sons of men like Brahm Saxena? “What was it with this generation of Indian men?” Tara asks rhetorically. “Why couldn’t fathers raise sons?”Over time, Rohit becomes a kind of anti- or inverted Baba, taking to YouTube – a male trope we now recognise all too easily – to proclaim that man should not be content with survival but must instead strive for “thrival”, his own coinage, focusing on our own species’ prosperity rather than, say, animal conservation.It is testament to Guha’s adroit, understated authorial touch that we are never given conclusive answers to complex questions about patriotism, nationalism and how India’s identity is changing, only a range of responses acted out through his characters.Lamorna Ash£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA delightfully grounded romanceConsider Yourself KissedJessica StanleyConsider Yourself KissedJessica StanleyA delightfully grounded romanceCoralie, a young Australian copywriter, and Adam, a single dad, swap homes for a single night. Adam looks like a shorter, younger Colin Firth; Coralie waits in vain for him to tell her that she looks “like Lizzy Bennet, a known fact at school”. Coralie considers Adam’s neat bookcase of political biographies, including – to her joy – those of Australian politicians. Adam considers Coralie’s piles of “those green-spine books by women”. They fall in love, books-first, fairly instantly. And the reader who knows immediately that battered green spines mean Virago Press, and that what is being implied by Coralie’s careful collection is key to not just her character, but the character of this novel as a whole –thatreader will also be irresistibly, hopelessly in love by chapter three. (If this meet-cute does nothing for you, you’re in the wrong place.)Yet there are clear cracks: one might even say universal cracks, of the kind that not even adoring Adam and cautious Coralie can intellectualise. It is hard to write about the unfairness of Adam and Coralie’s relationship without wanting to excuse it, somehow, on behalf of two fictional characters. Adam just wants to succeed! He’s trying! When Coralie tells him to change, he tries! They make each other (and the reader) laugh; have great sex; are intellectual and emotional equals! I loved Adam; I loved Coralie; I loved their relationship and their family and their life. But when Coralie storms out to sleep in “what used to be … the spare room, but which (somehow) … had become Adam’s study”, that “(somehow)” leaps off the page. (I have long noticed that in a house with one spare room and a heterosexual couple who both work from home, the spare room is where he works – with a door that shuts and perhaps even a designated desk – and she workssomewhere else. Always for good reasons, butalways.)Coralie knows all of this. She has “read novels” about this. And yet it’s happening to her. “How could the world … be made fair,” she wonders, “when two people who loved each other couldn’t even manage alife?” This is a book about making a better world, globally and domestically – and whether, perhaps, those two might amount to the same thing.Ella Risbridger£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirFinding the funny side of living with cancerThe Leopard in My HouseMark SteelThe Leopard in My HouseMark SteelFinding the funny side of living with cancerThere are enough cancer memoirs to fill a small bookshop, with bookcases for all the affected body parts. It can feel churlish to apply critical faculties to this of all subjects, but if thereisa high bar for the genre, then it’s one Mark Steel clears like Dick Fosbury on a good day.Sporting metaphors are a feature of The Leopard in My House, a new entry in the “throat” section by the comedian, broadcaster and campaigner. While waiting for a radiotherapy appointment in the basement of a London hospital, Steel meets Jules, an army general. As the treatment weakens them, they resolve to take the stairs rather than lift back up to ground level. “We’d describe the previous day’s climb as ‘set off at a good pace but only the first stage of the Tour de France. By the third week it was ‘two sets and a break down with a heavily bandaged ankle, but determined to finish the match’.”Connections like this, between people who have little in common beyond a love of sport and rotten luck, give Steel’s book much of its warmth. Likewise tales of the nurses who tolerate the same “I’d be a terrible junkie” joke while they struggle to raise a vein in his arm, and the French teacher who doesn’t spare him during the weekly lessons he takes while still able to speak: “Labiopsie … la biopsie est feminine.”There is a sense throughout of a man knocked off course, and being forced to ask big questions about who he is and what really matters. The ride we accompany him on is inspiring and invariably very funny. The book will comfort any reader directly affected by serious illness. It’s illuminating, too, for those who have watched a loved one get sick and struggled to know what to do or say (avoid “But youlookwell!”). For everyone else, well, as Steel himself might put it, this account is a bit like being invited into the mind of that bandaged tennis player, as he somehow takes the match into a deciding set, with the Centre Court crowd fully behind him.Simon Usborne£11.04 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePoliticsIdentity fraudMinority RuleAsh SarkarMinority RuleAsh SarkarIdentity fraudThe British left used to be a force to reckon with. Edward Heath’s government was famously felled by the miners in 1974 – the only instance in postwar European history when working-class power resulted in the overthrow of a ruling party. These days, however, the concept of the working class has an almost retro feel. Trade union membership has plummeted. Expressions of collective solidarity have likewise vanished. Disaffection has far from disappeared, only now it manifests in the form of petty crime and race riots.In Minority Rule, Ash Sarkar blames the rightwing press for this shift. Thanks to tabloid agents provocateurs and their political creatures in Westminster, she says, the lower orders have abandoned class war for the culture wars.Sarkar’s thesis, that fears of minority rule of one kind (by the non-white and non-binary) serve to legitimate minority rule of another sort (by barons and billionaires), isn’t an earth-shattering observation, of course. As early as the 1890s, Friedrich Engels argued that the gullible and easily distracted working classes were conspiring in their own oppression. All the same, she prosecutes her case with more panache and punchiness, more hilarity, than is usual from the dour quarters of British political punditry. Her hyper-caffeinated prose and acid observations are unquestionably a joy to read.Sarkar reserves some of her snarkiest comments for left-liberals seduced by identity politics. Instead of uniting minorities and the proletariat into an ecumenical alliance of the oppressed, she says, the present-day left has pitted them against one another in an Olympics of victimhood. Mired in fratricidal identitarianism, left-liberals have lost the argument to the hard right, which has repurposed class politics with a racial tinge.Pratinav Anil£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionGlobalism and a voyage into dangerTwistColum McCannTwistColum McCannGlobalism and a voyage into dangerColum McCann’s breakthrough 2009 novel, Let the Great World Spin, was set on the day in 1974 when the acrobat Philippe Petit walked across a high wire strung between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York. In his new novel, Twist, McCann is drawn to another type of wire and another obsessive, boundary-pushing hero. The wires, this time, are the undersea cables that carry data around our hyperconnected planet. And the hero, John Conway, is an engineer and free diver who travels the world, repairing them when they break.The novel is narrated by a fiftysomething Irish journalist and novelist, Anthony Fennell, who’s got himself an assignment to write a long feature about Conway’s cable repair vessel, the Georges Lecointe. He travels to Cape Town to join the ship then sails with the crew up the western coast of Africa to the site of a cable break. McCann/Fennell lets us know early on that Conway will be the puzzle at the book’s heart, and that it won’t be an easy one.The account of the journey and the observations of the work on board the ship feel as if they must be rooted in McCann’s own reportage. We are on board for days, among the polyglot, multi-ethnic male crew. The book is full of wonder at the difficulty of their work, at the scale and beauty of the natural world – and full of anger at humanity’s capacity to wreck it.Marcel Theroux£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA precious and powerful work of literatureLooking at Women, Looking at WarVictoria AmelinaLooking at Women, Looking at WarVictoria AmelinaA precious and powerful work of literatureOn 27 June, 2023, Victoria Amelina was in a restaurant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk when it was hit by a Russian missile. She died of her injuries a few days later, leaving the book she was working on unfinished. She was 37 and the mother of a young son.The full-scale Russian invasion transformed every aspect of Amelina’s life. At the beginning of the war she threw herself into humanitarian work, as refugees from the east and south arrived in her home city of Lviv. But she soon began to realise that she could do something bigger through writing.Amelina had previously been a writer of fiction – her most celebrated novel, Dom’s Dream Kingdom, will be published in English translation next year. But a full-scale invasion was not a time for novels.In this book, her only work of nonfiction – written in English to reach the widest possible audience – she set down a personal account of the terror of unfolding events. But she also wanted to tell a wider story. Into her diary she wove portraits of other extraordinary women and their work – including a soldier, a human rights activist, a librarian, a curator. After she trained as a war crimes investigator with the NGO Truth Hounds, her missions to recently de-occupied territories became part of the diary, too.She had sent her latest draft to a friend some days before she was killed. In the weeks after her funeral, an editorial group was assembled, consisting of writers Tetyana Teren, Yaryna Grusha, and Sasha Dovzhyk; as well as Alex Amelin, her husband. She had, they estimated, written about 60% of what she had planned. The typescript had a beginning and an end, and many gaps in the middle that existed as rough notes. The editors did not “complete” the book, but rather assembled the best and most readable version they could, occasionally inserting material from earlier drafts, adding footnotes, and making the status of the fragmentary sections as clear as possible.What Amelina achieved is to be greatly treasured. Looking at Women Looking at War is an important piece of testimony and a precious, powerful work of literature: a steady beam of light born amid darkness and violence.Charlotte Higgins£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA major new voice in SFLuminousSilvia ParkLuminousSilvia ParkA major new voice in SFSilvia Park’s debut novel is about people, robots and cyborgs: that is, humans enhanced or augmented with robotic technology. Ruijie is a schoolgirl afflicted with a degenerative disease: “affixed to her legs were battery-powered titanium braces; the latest model, customised circuitry to aid her ability to walk”. As the novel opens, Ruijie is in a robot junkyard, scavenging for spare parts and better legs. Here she meets a robot boy, Yoyo, discarded despite being a highly sophisticated model. Ruijie takes the quirky Yoyo to school with her, and a group of friends assemble to protect him from scavengers and exploitation in the robot-fighting ring.This element of the novel reads like a YA adventure, though the rest is more adult-focused: cyberpunk, violent and sexualised. In an author’s note, Park says that they began writing Luminous as children’s fiction, until a bereavement took the work in a different direction, making the novel “a shape-shifter, no longer so appropriate for children”. There’s an awkwardness to this mix of tone, although we could say it reproduces, on the level of form, the book’s central topic of hybridisation, cyborgification, different elements worked together, as the novel’s setting – a future unified Korea – does on the level of geography.The Korea of Luminous is busily and vividly rendered. Robot-sex addiction is rife. Kids have grown dependent on their robot nannies: “botwired, these children were called. Children who supposedly couldn’t go anywhere without a robot. Undersocialised, entitled, prone to tantrums and anger issues.” This speaks, obviously enough, to present-day anxieties, but Park is doing more than satirising our current tech dependencies. Luminous is profoundly interested in what it means to be a person, in where authenticity is located – through love, grief and connection.Adam Roberts£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseScience booksA revelatory study of the bodyAliveGabriel WestonAliveGabriel WestonA revelatory study of the body“The truth of the body is as much about storytelling as it is about anatomy,” the writer and surgeon Gabriel Weston argues in Alive, an unusual and gripping book that she describes as an “ecumenical exploration” of her subject. An English graduate, in her early 20s Weston enrolled in a pioneering medical degree programme designed to encourage arts students to become doctors. She believes clinical medicine has much to learn from the humanities. When anatomy textbooks show organs and body parts in isolation, removed from the individual and their wider context, Weston believes they miss important truths. Bodies are, after all, not purely mechanical entities. And so Alive, a book that draws on science, history, philosophy and art, is as much about what our bodies mean to us, how they feel to us, as what they do.The chapters – Heart, Bone, Genitals, Lungs and so on – offer plenty of detailed anatomical information. The reader will learn the name and function of our different layers of skin, what happens inside our kidneys, and how breasts turn blood into milk, but this information is enriched by Weston’s personal and philosophical reflections, accounts of pioneering surgeries, and digressions on medical ethics and the arts.This bold, humane yet unsettling book makes a strong case for giving doctors more time to get to know their patients properly, and it will make you see your own body a bit differently, perhaps change how you feel in your skin. Just – and trust me on this – make sure you finish your breakfast before reading it.Sophie McBain£11.04 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

Set after a galactic apocalypse, it follows a convict who must buy his freedom by piloting a rusty submarine through an ocean of human blood on a distant planet. Ostensibly, he’s looking for relics that may prove vital for scientific research, but what he finds is much more ghastly. So far, so strange.The film was also written, directed and financed by one person – the YouTube gaming superstar Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach – who also stars. But that’s not the weird part, either. The weird part is that watching the film Iron Lung feels like watching Fischbach play Iron Lung the game. Maybe it’s the fact that he spends most of the movie sitting at the sub’s controls, trying to figure out how to use them correctly – like a gamer would. Maybe it’s that, as the film progresses, he has to solve a series of environmental puzzles linked by various codes, computer read-outs and little injections of narrative – just like in a video game. Long periods of the movie involve Fischbach trying to decide what to do next, the camera close up on his confused face. This is incredibly similar to watching hisYouTube videos about playing Iron Lung, an experience he often found bewildering. It was the most metatextual experience I’ve had in the cinema since The Truman Show – but I’m not sure this is what Fischbach intended.View image in fullscreenMetatextual … Iron Lung.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyOf course, there have been plenty of movies in which a character must escape an enclosed environment by solving a series of puzzles. It’s a whole subgenre of fun thrillers, from the Saw franchise to Buried to Fall. But the highly procedural nature of Iron Lung, the long sequences of pondering, the tools the character uses and the way that puzzles dovetail into each other to open new possibilities? That’s video gameplay. Even the way the backstory is revealed, via short, oblique flashbacks, is exactly how a game would use cinematic cutscenes to flesh out the universe. This is not a film of a game, it is a film of the experience of a game – a sort of narrativisedYouTubeplaythrough. I almost expected a comments section to appear instead of the closing credits.Iron Lung isn’t the only YouTube video sensation to be converted into linear media. The hugely successful Dungeons and Dragons YouTube channel,Critical Role, is now an animated TV series. Elsewhere, Adventure Time and Rick and Morty started on the web before they were transferred to TV (and then became games), and theatre has been experimenting with interactive immersive productions for a decade or two. There’s now a growing range of TV shows morphing into video podcasts (the new Harry Hill series, for example), andvideo podcasts morphing into TV. We now live in an age of hybridised entertainment experiences and as viewers we’re going to have to renegotiate our relationships with traditional media as a result.View image in fullscreenLegendary … A Minecraft Movie.Photograph: Warner Bros Pictures/APRemember the controversy over how audiences wereshouting out catchphrases and throwing popcorn during A Minecraft Movie? What they were doing was re-enacting the para-social experience of playing and/or watching Minecraft on a computer screen – but in a cinema. The auditorium became a physical equivalent of the Twitch/YouTube chat window, with the spectators participating in meme-like jokes. While watching Iron Lung, the teenagers behind me were pointing out tropes and Easter eggs that referenced Fischbach’s YouTube videos as well as the original game, like a sort of ontological hall of mirrors.Iron Lung can be enjoyed as an oblique and claustrophobic B-movie. Comparisons have been made with John Carpenter’s anarchic Dark Star, although I see a closer analogue in the cult sci-fi thriller ​​Hardware, in which a self-assembling killer robot terrorises a woman in her apartment. But beneath the familiar trappings of the contained thriller, Iron Lung’s origins as a game are also written into the experience, there for those in the know who are prepared to unpick the self-reflexive strands.Whatever you make of Iron Lung, I’m sure we’ll see more YouTubers migrating into film. I just hope it in no way leads to a Jake Paul-directed Rocky movie.What to playView image in fullscreenAdorably awkward … Hermit and Pig.Photograph: Heavy Lunch StudioHere is a game for those who want a role-playing adventure that won’t take 120 hours to complete or bombard you with dark, Tolkienesque lore.

Did I miss it? If so, what was it?”This long-running debate seemed to reach peak interest in the late-2000s and early 2010s, when innovative, highly cinematic titles such asBioshock,Red Dead RedemptionandDeus Exwere expanding the narrative and emotional scope of games with dazzling new techniques. At that time every games site on the internet had its own “What is the Citizen Kane of video games?” article. IGN, for example, declared that Nintendo’s sci-fi adventure Metroid Prime fit the bill, because, like the Orson Welles film, it used a huge variety of genre tropes and technical tricks to achieve its ambitious aims. Even at the time, most people disagreed, but well done IGN for having a go.I think the debate died out because it sunk into self-parody – it represented the reflexive anxiety of a growing medium still living under cinema’s cultural shadow. Ten years later, we’re more comfortable with the understanding that not everything that happens in video games has to be analogous to the history of film. There are games as formally daring as Citizen Kane (The Stanley Project,Disco Elysium,Shadow of the Colossus) and there are games that tell stories with myriad narrative strands (The Last of Us,Life Is Strange,Mass Effect). But the whole package? Possibly not. Ultimately, I think the answer to your question is that it doesn’t matter. Games do different things from films and comparing them in this way doesn’t actually achieve anything. Having said that, the real answer isShenmue.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterYouTubeFilm adaptationsScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Other times it stays in the past, like a historical curiosity, a museum piece, even a relic. Glen Tetley’s 1962 Pierrot Lunaire, apivot point in dance history, is an odd conjunction of these disparate aspects.Drawing fromcommedia dell’arteiconography, it tells the stylised story of moonstruck innocent Pierrot (Marcelino Sambé), the awakening of his desire through an encounter with many-faced Columbine (Mayara Magri), and the intervention of the dominant, manipulative Brighella (Matthew Ball). The set is sparse – just a scaffold, centre stage – and the dance style is a bold, efficient alloy of the long, lean lines of classical ballet with the gravitational pull, tensed angles and visceral gesticulations ofMartha Graham.Glimpses of the moon abound – in the many fleeting crescent shapes, in Pierrot’s upward tugs as if catching moonbeams. The choreography is clear, finely wrought, and purposeful: witness Pierrot and Columbine’s highly constructed duet in which they keep looking outwards, upwards, around, but not at each other. All three dancers, inscrutable in face makeup, embody their roles superbly, inhabiting the mood set by Schoenberg’s composed yet highly strung score, all atonal anxiety and sliding hysteria.View image in fullscreenHigh style … Pierrot Lunaire by Glen Tetley at Linbury theatre, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhich brings us to the somewhat hysterical and certainly antiquated Freudian iconography that drives the drama. There’s a key moment when (there’s no way to put this nicely) Pierrot parps Columbine’s boobs, and she slaps him and flounces off. It gradually becomes clear that Pierrot is Boy, shamed and punished for his burgeoning desires; Columbine is Woman, variously living doll, bow-wrapped bride and scarlet harlot; and Brighella is Man/Daddy, big and bad, and poking his wooden sword from between his legs. The combination of retrogressive crudeness and sadistic tone with high style, refined design and powerful performance is indeed strange – and creepy.AtLinbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, until 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceRoyal BalletBalletRoyal Opera HouseClownsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A debut writer was showcased on its biggest stage last autumn (Nima Taleghani withBacchae). Now a canonical playwright is in a space associated with the new and edgy – although Terence Rattigan fans may not recognise his lesser-performed 1963 play.It charts the fall of a megalomaniacal Romanian financier, Gregor Antonescu (Ben Daniels), and his reunion with his estranged son, Basil Anthony (Laurie Kynaston). The latter has changed his name and is trying to make it as a songwriter when Gregor re-enters his life, beleaguered with corruption charges and on the verge of exposure.Director Anthony Lau has put a thoroughly new spin on this old yarn but one which sadly drains the emotion and tragedy. Set in a 1930s basement apartment in Greenwich Village, the production has been jazzed up for this jazz age. Georgia Lowe’s set design gestures to the silver screen, with credits written across one wall in an art deco-style font, lighting up every time the relevant actors/characters appear on stage.View image in fullscreenDeliciously charged performance … Isabella Laughland as Countess Antonescu in Man and Boy.Photograph: Manuel HarlanArtifice is underlined in other ways, with green baize all around and initially a central table that stands in for a room. It suggests a giant game of snooker, with characters playing each other perhaps, as they clamber on to tables or shift them around. Knock Knock is written on top of the gangway representing the door. Is this all a big theatrical joke?The first half is pulled down by the weight of its laboured reinvention. The drama is so arch that it seems operatic – the bigger the performances, the more you feel removed from Rattigan’s subtexts. Kynaston projects bewilderment and anger but never seems quite at home. Basil’s betrayal by Gregor, who attempts to pimp him out to an American businessman, Mark Herries (Malcolm Sinclair), in order to save himself, gets lost in the overheated conceptual fray.‘As evil as Iago’: the return of Terence Rattigan’s shocking Man and BoyRead moreSome characters bring a cartoonish edge, like Basil’s girlfriend, Carol Penn (Phoebe Campbell), with her exaggerated Long Island accent, and Herries’s comically tetchy lawyer (Leo Wan). Gregor’s wife (Isabella Laughland) struts on in silk pyjamas and heels to give a deliciously charged performance, but this former typist turned fake countess is too much of a type to feel real. There is strangely poised or slow-motion movement, especially by Gregor, in what seems like a heavily stylised mishmash of screwball comedy and financial thriller.It engages more when some of the theatrics are dropped, a little too late. Gregor is like a darker version of Jay Gatsby and so much distance has been created that his downfall becomes emotionally remote, his self-loathing rejection of filial love understood rather than felt.It is a shame because this is an explosive story about the corruptions of capitalism with present-day echoes of Jeffrey Epstein, but the concepts smother the drama.AtDorfman theatre, National Theatre, London, until 14 March.Explore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreTerence RattiganreviewsShareReuse this content"

Guess which aspect of his work this show focuses on?Jonathan JonesTue 10 Feb 2026 19.01 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIf painting is a fast car, drawing is more like taking the bus. At least that’s how it felt to me, puttering along on the 27 to Paddington that isthe National Portrait Gallery’s trawlthrough Lucian Freud’s sketches, engravings and even childhood crayonings, daydreaming until my stop, with the occasional flash of colour and flare when one of the exhibition’s “carefully selected group of important paintings” rolled past.View image in fullscreenChurning out nonsense … Solicitor’s Head, a 2003 etching.Photograph: National Portrait Gallery, London/© The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman ImagesThis is a sad review to write. Freud seemed an unquestionable genius in his lifetime and I still stand in awe of the great modern paintings with which he won that crown. One of his 1990s portraits of “Benefits Supervisor”Sue Tilleytowers here, in every sense, her face slumped into her hand as she sleeps vertical in an armchair, while Freud eagerly inspects every pore and blemish on her big naked body and translates her into an ecstasy of oily greys, whites, purples, ridged, pockmarked, magnificent.But such peak moments are surrounded with so much dross it makes you doubt he was anything special. I wish I could lambast the curators for failing to do him justice, but when an artist leaves this many mediocre works for them to make a meal of, you have to face facts. Freud did churn out a lot of nonsense as well as his nuggets of greatness.I’ve always tried to avoid looking at his etchings but they are shoved in your face here as if they were highlights of his late years. They teeter between ordinary and awful. There just isn’t the niftiness and daring of the paintings: faces and bodies are defined with matted, heavily shaded edges that seem precious as well as laborious. At best they are posters. Two prints of Tilley seem like adverts for his art rather than manifestations of it.I laughed – and not kindly – at Man Posing, a 1985 etching of a nude model on a couch with his cock and balls up front between splayed legs. It’s not the genitals that are disappointing but his sad, stupid face, too big for the body. The result is weird without being witty or moving. Yet a small painting beside it of the same man in the same pose is dazzling, magic. The balls are deep pinkish red, flaming from his white flesh like a cockerel’s comb.View image in fullscreenStumbling about … Portrait of a Young Man, 1944, black crayon and chalk on paper, by Lucian Freud.Photograph: © The Lucian Freud Archive / Bridgeman ImagesFreud is an albatross of an artist, glorious when he flies on canvas, clumsy when he stumbles about in earthbound black and white. It is hard to see why he even bothered with etching when he was hitting his peak as a painter – was it for an extra few bob, or the old-masterly connotations of this medium in which Rembrandt and Picasso excelled, or just the need for a graphic outlet? For the NPG does make its point that Freud started out as a draughtsman first – a precise, patient observer of thistles, dead monkeys and the human face – and a painter very much second.Yet his meticulous drawing style palls unexpectedly as one early work after another is stacked up – and as for his childhood pictures from Berlin, a kid could have done them. This is where the show starts to seem indulgent, confused, soppy. You thought Freud was tough and cruel? His drawings of Kitty Garman and other beauties, as well as himself and male friends from the 1940s and 50s, look sentimental. He loves a pretty face, and in his 1946 chalk and crayon drawing A Girl, desire softens his eye.View image in fullscreenFlying on canvas … Portrait of David Hockney, 2002.Photograph: © The Lucian Freud Archive. All Rights Reserved 2025 / Bridgeman ImagesThis Freud is a nicer man but a lesser artist. Perhaps what has gone wrong here is that curators and art historians who don’t remember Freud as a living artist, and don’t feel him as contemporary, are starting to reevaluate him as a historical figure who is “interesting” rather than urgent. They dismally succeed in redefining him as a minor British artist, doing careful, stylish drawings that he translated, in the 1950s, into modest paintings. But this Freud died. There’s a rift in the middle of the show when it announces that, in the 1960s, he abandoned his fascination with drawing to plunge into pure paint. His terrifyingly brilliant 1963 Self-Portrait, a painted hand grenade of squinting eyes and bruised-looking flesh, announces the years without drawing.It’s at the moment he put down his sketchbook he became an artist who holds us. He chose paint – and painting from life, with models in front of him as he added another stroke of purple or black to their oily double. It may be that he was less intellectual than his mysterious personality suggested. He worked from instinct, not thought, and when he hit the vein he was great, but sometimes he missed. The NPG concentrates on the misses.Why put on such a perversely stupid exhibition? I’ve heard it said that Freud’s great paintings are hard to borrow because so many are in private hands. But if Freud’s collectors really are so uncooperative, they are risking their own investments. A few more shows like this and his prices will fall off a cliff.Lucian Freud: Drawing Into Painting is atthe National Portrait Gallery, London, 12 February to 4 MayExplore more on these topicsDrawingLucian FreudArtNational Portrait GalleryPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

I thought about the face coverings we all had to wear, and I thought about masks more widely. I researched masked balls and carnival masks and read a lot about the many outbreaks of plague in Venice starting in the 14th century, and about pandemics in general.This photograph, Danse Macabre, was inspired by Covid. If you take a close look at the paper lamps hanging from the ceiling, you’ll see some Covid-19 viruses smuggled in among them. In the middle of the scene, a doctor in a plague mask – the type still sold at carnival in Venice – is dancing with the rat that caused the plague. The couple on the left reference the fact that the Bolsonaro-led Brazilian government at the time of the pandemic was accused ofallowing many Indigenous people to die unnecessarily[he denied any wrongdoing]. So those two deal with colonialism – the woman in the yellow hat represents an Indigenous person, the guy she’s dancing with is wearing a mask with the face of Pedro de Alvarado, a Spanish conquistador responsible for massacring Indigenous populations in Guatemala in the 16th century.Different countries measured social distancing in different terms. In Austria, for some unknown reason, we were told to stay the length of a baby elephant apart. I found a list of measurements suggested by different countries and discovered that in Florida, people were told to visualise a baby alligator. By including a character in an alligator mask, the social distancing gesture became a dance gesture. One of the dancers has a face mask with the virus on it. I designed it myself using an online platform that would print you your own mask – they really liked it and asked: “Can we use your design?”Countries measured social distancing in different ways – in Austria, we were told to stay the length of a baby elephant apartI got into this type of staged photography by looking at paintings, and am very interested in colonialism and postcolonialism, a field that informs much of my work. Danse Macabre is half of my Masquerade diptych. The other half is calledHidden Transcriptand includes characters from carnivals in different countries – there’s a lady with a rattle from a Peruvian carnival, a man in a New Orleans Mardi Gras headdress, a red mask from Andalusia and a Trinidadian devil mas character, like a blue dragon. They’re dancing behind a seated woman in a dress made of green curtain material, recalling the one worn by Scarlett O’Hara in the ball scene in Gone with the Wind. I took the two photographs on consecutive days, using the same models, in the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. Since it was about masked balls, I needed a nice floor.I used to use friends in my photographs, but found it is much better to use actors or dancers because they have a different feeling for their bodies. They’re better at moving, but also better at holding a position when I need them to. The summer of 2021, when this was taken, was one of the hottest on record in Europe and I was using lights which made it even hotter indoors. It was quite exhausting, especially for the woman playing the rat.We had a truck parked outside with a generator to power the lights. It made a slight noise, and someone living nearby called the police to complain he was being disturbed. They came, took one look and said: “Yeah, just park around the corner and forget about that guy.” I invited the guy in and asked if he wanted to look at what we were doing, but he refused. I think he just wanted to be angry.It’s not possible to immediately decipher all the meaning and research that goes into my photographs. What I provide is a surface that looks interesting and a title that might open some doors and make the viewer want to find out more.

The play, which explored ambition, motherhood and sexual violence, drew strong audiences but divided critics.“The play was mostly hated by the critics,” she said. “So why did people flock to the Pinter to catch it before we all vanished?“A clue might be that many of the reviews were written by men who really didn’t understand what it is to be a working mother or a child-free actress.”She said one male critic had described a female character’s lament about her vagina as unrealistic. “We need women to write that,” she said. “Voicing their experience. Men are beginning to see the light.”She said Waller-Bridge’s writing had helped to shift public debate. “When Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote Fleabag series two, she gave me the most fantastic scene about menstruation and metaphors, which ripped through the internet and helped bring what people used to call female problems right into the front row, and even get laws changed.”The Women’s prize for playwriting was founded in 2019 to address gender inequality in theatre. Its organisers say women are under-represented as playwrights and in senior creative roles across the sector.Research published by The Stage in 2022 found that about three-quarters of writers working in UK theatre that year were men. A 2023 update from Sphinx Theatre’s “women in theatre” survey reported continuing structural barriers for women in the industry, including caring responsibilities and uneven commissioning opportunities.Speaking after the ceremony, the producer Ellie Keel, the co-founder of the prize, said she agreed that plays by women received a different critical reception.“Lyonesse was received as a very mediocre play, when actually it wasn’t,” she toldthe Stage. “It feels like women writers are held to different standards, and written about in different ways.“We don’t necessarily need more female critics. I just think the men should do better,” she said.Reviews of Lyonesse were mixed. The Stage’s male critic, Dave Fargnoli, awarded the play four stars, while the female critics Arifa Akbar and Fiona Mountford each gave it two stars.Scott Thomas said she was committed to championing female writers. “It isn’t always easy to be a woman in the spotlight,” she said. “But keeping the fires burning and the arguments flaring is something I relish and would not be able to do without writers.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreKristin Scott ThomasGenderWomennewsShareReuse this content"

They weren’t, and so while his siblings and parents were incarcerated at Tule Lake in northernCalifornia, he was on the frontlines in what has been deemed one of the bloodiest conflicts in the Pacific during the second world war.‘Our bodies bear traces of all we’ve endured’: exhibition explores bodily photographyRead moreThe caves of Okinawa were used “almost as bunkers to protect people”, Kiyomi Gork explains. “But they were also spaces of mass suicide because of Japanese propaganda.” Local Uchinanchu who took refuge there were instructed by Japanese soldiers to kill themselves, rather than face what they were told would be a violent fateat the hands of the US army. As one of the few American soldiers who spoke Japanese, Kiyomi Gork’s great-uncle worked to ensure their safe passage.The parallel experiences of the Uchinanchu in the caves and Japanese-Americans interned at Tule Lake – that have been silenced by decades of repressed trauma and historical whitewashing – sit at the heart of Kiyomi Gork’s forthcoming exhibition, Gama 1213-B, at Canary Test, an experimental arts space in downtown Los Angeles. “The camps are something difficult to address because there’s been so much silence and shame around them,” she explains. “I grew up with an inherited shame around being Japanese, like not being able to speak or read the language or acting like a Japanese girl should. There are a lot of problematic western expectations around what being Japanese is. It was a topic that I never felt comfortable addressing in my home or in myself until I got older.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Photograph: Empty GalleryIt was only when Donald Trump started creating more immigrant detention centers in his first term that her family began to talk about the eerie similarity of these centers to the interment camps. Then, when the war broke out in Gaza “I just stopped,” Kiyomi Gork says. “I needed to make work about what was happening. And for me the way I could do that was through my family and their relationship to history.”This prompted her to visit the caves of Okinawa. Sitting alone in a quiet, damp space, Kiyomi Gork found herself listening to a trickle of water at the bottom of the caves. “People generally like the sound of water,” she remarks, because “we need it to survive, so the sound of it is enhanced by that mortal need”. But in the caves, Kiyomi Gork recalls that the water sounded “menacing and unnerving”. This prompted her to consider how her perspective of the space – informed by all that she knew and didn’t know about the Battle of Okinawa, her great-uncle’s service, the lasting scar that the war left on her family and all Uchinanchu, and the island’s continued military occupation – changed her relationship to something that is, in most other contexts, innately comforting.Working in sound, installation and sculpture for over 20 years, Kiyomi Gork routinely explores how sound affects movement and movement affects sound; blurring boundaries between performer, audience and architecture; and often, for example, creating feedback loops that enhance the sound of the viewers’ own movements in the space of the exhibition. Gama 1213-B represents a departure from this modality. “It’s less of a choreography in the space and more of letting the sound happen around you, less you creating the sound with your body,” she says. Titled after the Uchinaaguchi word for cave (gama) and the number of her grandfather’s barrack at Tule Lake (1213-B), the exhibition at Canary Test will feature a recent sculptural work and a newly created ambisonic sound piece – alongside a selection of books from Kiyomi Gork’s research and her grandparent’s collection – that honor the charged, intentional and yet uncontrollable silences of these sites.View image in fullscreenJacqueline Kiyomi Gork.Photograph: Telavaya, courtesy of the artist.With clay sourced from the caves in Okinawa, Kiyomi Gork recreated sections of the cave walls as large ceramic tiles, using a mold based on 3D scans of its surface. Inset within a gridded, metal folding screen, these quasi-archeological fragments mimic the sonic effect of the cave’s multifaceted surface which possesses so many angles for sound to bounce off that echoes and reverberations are effectively deadened.Kiyomi Gork’s ambisonic sound piece about Tule Lake recreates a different kind of silence. Visiting the site – which is now an airplane field that bears little acknowledgment of where the barracks previously stood, or the people they incarcerated – the artist recorded what remains: sounds of the wind and the open air. She processed this recording through a virtual barrack (working with a sound lab at a structural engineering company in Los Angeles) to simulate what it might have sounded like inside the structures.“I’ve gone through a lot of video footage about the camps,” Kiyomi Gork says. “But no one really talks about how it felt or [the specifics of] how it sounded.” Both this piece, and her sculpture, consequently live in something of an liminal space, oscillating between the physical structures that have been documented and the experiences of them, which can only be imagined.The line of inquiry into her Japanese-American and Uchinanchu roots exemplified by this exhibition, which Kiyomi Gork describes as an unfinished and potentially endless project, is “more about the unknown than anything”, she explains. “About being OK with not knowing. Or being OK with the fact that there is this huge silence, and honoring that.”As much as Gama 1213-B is a sonic and sculptural memorial to individuals on both sides of the Pacific, how anyone connects with an unknown nevertheless remains unknown. “For me, at least, it’s through time,” Kiyomi Gork says. “This is a time-based work, so it’s through spending time with it, almost like a meditation, [that one can] sit with and acknowledge [what happened].”Gama 1213-B is on show from 12 February to 20 March at Canary Test in Los AngelesExplore more on these topicsArtCaliforniaJapanSound artSecond world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s the nightmare the Oscar-nominated Byrne faces in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You. The star and its director reveal why backers were scaredWed 11 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 06.49 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You, for whichRose Byrnejust won a Golden Globe and is Oscar-nominated for best actress, is unmistakably a horror film. And yet how can it be? It’s the story of a mother, Linda, with a very sick child. You never see the child, only the outlines of the anxious medics. You never find out what’s wrong with her, only that it involves a feeding tube. Linda is going steadily crazy, because who wouldn’t? On paper, this is a painful yet heartwarming tale of love and adversity. Instead, it is claustrophobic and vertiginous. It sometimes has the panic-attack surrealism of an anxiety dream, and other times is so real you can barely look directly at it. I’ve never seen the maternal condition drawn as a trip to the abyss. The only film I’ve seen that’s anything like this is Eraserhead.“I was very influenced by that film,” writer and director Mary Bronstein says, carefully. She’s a fascinating conversationalist, frank and open but watchful. Byrne is more reserved. Both are darkly funny, all the time. They look Hollywood-polished, in this central London hotel, but fair play, they’ve just come out of a photoshoot. “Eraserhead is about a type of parental anxiety that only men can have,” Bronstein says. “And this is a film about a parental anxiety only a woman can have. In Eraserhead, he can leave and that’s his angst. Linda cannot leave. That’s hers.”It shouldn’t be seen as a betrayal to say: I can’t take this any more – I’m really angryThe fundamental terror of the film is that it doesn’t just say the unsayable, it puts you right in Linda’s frame, feeling things you’re not allowed to feel. What if loving your kid is actually destroying you and all you want to do is escape? “Can you love something so much that you smother it?” Bronstein wonders. “I’m trying to express things that are very uncomfortable, but that are very true, and are seen as very ugly because they’re considered a betrayal of your child. But it shouldn’t be seen as a betrayal to say, ‘I can’t take this any more. I’m really upset. I’m really angry. I’m really frustrated. I don’t know what to do.’ None of that means that you don’t love your child.”Seeing Byrne’s character unravel – “It’s not fair!” she explodes – is a bracing revelation about how narrow the parameters of acceptable motherhood are. “Even in the privacy of therapy,” says Bronstein, “she’s not allowed to say things like, ‘Why does that lady get to have a kid with no issues? And I have a kid with all these complicated issues?’”View image in fullscreen‘I’m going to embarrass you now’ … Byrne, left, and Mary Bronstein.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianIf I Had Legs draws on Bronstein’s own experience generally, but also specifically – in the sense that her daughter, who she has with US film director Ronald Bronstein, had a period of grave illness. (Now 15, she has recovered.) Bronstein’s directorial debut, the 2008 camping comedy Yeast, was acclaimed. Motherhood, she says, “took a bite out of my career, and a bite out of my life, and it took getting to crisis point where I totally disappeared into being my daughter’s mother, before I could ask, ‘Who is this person I don’t know any more? It was a true ego-death situation and that’s where the horror elements of the film come from. What I came to is, ‘Oh, I’m an artist. I’m a storyteller. I’m a film-maker. That’s what I am. And I’m going to radically try to do this with nobody’s permission.’ It took the total dismantling of my life to take that back.”The nature of the daughter’s illness in the film remains mysterious, partly because, Bronstein says: “If you spell it out too much, it becomes one of those stories about a mother running around trying to cure an illness.” The key example of that genre must be 1992’s Lorenzo’s Oil, and it would be impossible to overstate how different that film is from this one.View image in fullscreen‘My character definitely should not be practising therapy’ … Byrne with her Golden Globe.Photograph: Jesse Grant/2026GG/Penske Media/Getty ImagesOne US reviewer compared Byrne to Charlize Theron in Monster. It’s an amazing parallel to draw, because Theron is physically unrecognisable in that movie, hunched and hulking, while Byrne looks the same as she did in Bridesmaids, the 2011 comedy in which she plays the nervy, impossibly fragrant, way too perfect new best friend. Both women laugh at the comparison. “Not to take anything away from Charlize Theron,” Byrne says, “but that wasn’t ever the idea.”“I’m gonna embarrass you now,” Bronstein says. “Rose is a beautiful woman. So Linda, unavoidably, is a beautiful woman, who’s going through a really bad time. What does this person look like when she’s not taking care of herself? When she’s not wearing makeup? When she hasn’t slept? So it’s a de-evolution, but it’s nothing like Monster.”It’s as if the ugliness of the idea – the maternal experience as selfish, unhinged – has put a filter over what some viewers see. Linda is also not interested in sex, at all. She has to move into a motel at one point and meets a young man, played by A$AP Rocky. “Those were some of the hardest scenes,” Byrne says. “He’s such an enigmatic, charming guy and so gorgeous – and Linda is constantly dismissing him, being actively rude. My brain was, like, ‘He seems really nice. Are we sure she wouldn’t want to just have a chat?’ But she’s closed for business.”Bronstein takes up the theme: “I’m also subverting the idea of going into a man’s bedroom. What usually happens in a movie? Yeah, it’s not happening here. She doesn’t even have access to that side of herself.” Which is, I suggest, part of why motherhood occupies this bizarre place in the collective consciousness. “Mothers are held in this high regard,” says Bronstein, “at the same time as being completely dismissed. It’s very confusing. ‘Am I the most valuable thing in society, or am I at the bottom?’”One piquant twist is the fact that Linda, in the middle of a florid nervous breakdown, is herself a therapist, and we see her with a client who has postnatal depression, completely unequal to the situation. “Yes, she definitely shouldn’t be practising,” Byrne says. “When I read that in the script, I thought, ‘Well, that’s a pivot.’”View image in fullscreen‘He’s such a nice man, but she’s closed for business’ … A$AP Rocky and Byrne.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockBronstein has no beef with therapy, has been in and out of it since she was 14, has had good ones and bad ones. “My previous therapist said to me, just as an aside, ‘My therapist said …’ and my ears completely closed at that point, because all I was thinking, all I was obsessed with, was, ‘This guy has a therapist?’ But then, of course he does, because that’s ethical practice – then that guy has a therapist, who also has a therapist. Where does it end? Can you skip to the head therapist? It’s like the man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz. There is no wizard. There is no head therapist. Everybody is somebody like Linda, just a human being struggling.”Nobody, they say, ever asks about one of the film’s most challenging scenes, except for one schoolkid in a Q&A: Linda agonises over an abortion she had in the past, running through futile what-ifs, that maybe if she hadn’t done that, her daughter wouldn’t be ill, or she would have a different daughter, who wasn’t ill. “And I think that you can be politically pro-choice,” Byrne says. “Obviously I am. But at the same time, you acknowledge that it’s a difficult thing and it remains a trauma for some women.”“There are a lot of movies where people talk about abortion,” Bronstein says, “and I wanted to express something that I felt was authentic, and maybe not what people want to hear: which is that you can have an abortion, and get on with it, and that’s what you’re supposed to do. But for some people, it stays with them.”This isn’t, however, a film designed to get liberals to pore over their fine differences. Nor is it agitprop about the structural injustices of motherhood within late capitalism, though Byrne is droll and caustic about the US context, summing up its attitude thus: “We care about the baby when you’re pregnant, but once it’s out, you’re not going to get any time off work, you’re not going to get any day care, if you want any time off work, you have to claim having a baby as a disability.”The profound political challenge of this film is to the patriarchy, since the impossible contradictions and iron-clad taboos around motherhood are ultimately a way of making femaleness impossible. Was it tough to get it made? “I heard a lot of Nos,” Bronstein says, “and they were all qualified with, ‘What if we pulled back here?’, or, ‘What if we didn’t do that?’ I’m no dummy. I knew what they were saying. People were afraid that no one was going to like Linda. And that, for some reason, is very scary.”“We always said to one another,” Byrne adds, “the audience doesn’t have to love Linda – butwehave to.”If I Had Legs I’d Kick You is out on 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmRose ByrneinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Also: wearing jeans with high heels.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Jeans with heels gets me every time. The woman who walks into the room in jeans and heels looks as if she owns the place, in a good way. It is a style language that speaks to everyone, confident and direct, a woman who is on top of her brief but also fun. The impact is stronger than a casual outfit, more compelling than a formal one.There is sound mathematical logic behind the case for wearing jeans with heels. It works visually, because although the mood music of denim is informal, jeans have as much structure as a tailored suit. The rigidity of denim and the assertive stitching of a five-pocket jean create an architectural shape for the bottom half of your body. A high heel elongates the leg, exaggerating the effect. And by shifting your balance, heels tweak your centre of gravity, giving you no option but to pull your shoulders back and stand up straight, which makes you look taller. Wear jeans and heels together, and they elevate you. Literally.View image in fullscreenVictoria Beckham rocks the look.Photograph: JP Yim/Getty ImagesA pair of jeans is the most ordinary piece of clothing there is. There are designer jeans, of course, but in contrast to the mythology of handbags, shoes or jewellery, denim is a category in which the headline brands are affordable ones. And yet despite how everywhere jeans are, we are captivated by them. The saga ofwhich denim silhouette is most fashionableis a soap opera that everyone follows – a variation of “what shape of jean should I be wearing?” is the fashion question I get asked most often. Perhaps it is because jeans are so democratic, so universal, that they are so powerful. By resisting being slotted into fashion’s hierarchy, they are charged with independent spirit.The impact of high heels is not just visual (although they have a fairytale-slipper charm that even the most well-constructed loafer cannot compete with), it is audible too. There is something thrilling about announcing your arrival with the crisp staccato drumroll made by heel-tips on a hard floor. This look isn’t loud, but it’s got some good chat.How to wear jeans with heels? With confidence. Get yourself into character as a hot, sublimely self-possessed French It girl. The golden rule is that the two should be in proportion. If you are in a dainty kick-flared jean, then the precision of a cute kitten heel is on the same scale. If you are wearing wide-leg jeans, consider a chunkier heel: a block-heeled, round-toe boot has the right level of gravity.A straight-leg jean is the easiest to pair with shoes. A pointed or almond-shape is simple and elegantA straight-leg jean, being somewhere in the middle in terms of volume, is the easiest to pair with shoes. A pointed or almond-shape is simple and elegant. At this time of year, I am also a big fan of a straight-leg jean worn with strappy sandals over a nice sock. The hot-summer-night energy of a fancy strappy sandal brings a welcome fantasy element to the midwinter doldrums, and a cosy ribbed sock will make the sandals way more comfortable than when worn with bare feet.Mix and mismatch: if it doesn’t go with anything, it goes with everythingRead moreFashion cycles will continue to spin. Jean shapes will wax and wane, heel heights rise and fall. But the combination of jeans with heels transcends the churn because it taps into something deeper than trend: confidence, clarity, a dash of theatre. It has survived every swing of the pendulum because it works mathematically, visually, emotionally.Which brings us back to that Notes app list. What things that are always chic share is that they are not trends, but shortcuts to a certain feeling. Jeans with heels belongs there because it is not about chasing novelty, or getting dressed up for someone else. It is about knowing how to use clothes to shift the energy of a room in your favour.

I was part of a group of visiting American students visiting the University of Oxford – we kept ourselves to ourselves in the first few weeks of term – and he leaned over from the next table to talk to me. I saw his one-dimpled smile and the cocky way he tipped his chair back on two legs and I thought: “Uh-oh, here’s trouble.”Despite the fact that I was only at Oxford for one term, we quickly became a couple – and stayed together. When he finished university and started working in London, I returned to North Carolina to finish my English degree. We visited each other when we could. He made a surprise appearance at my 21st birthday party; we spent a New Year’s Eve in Paris.After graduation, I moved to London to do an MA and also – mostly – to be near Chris. Then I moved toNew Yorkto work in publishing, and a year later he joined me to work for an American bank. We rented a place together and lived the life of childless twentysomethings in Manhattan: long working hours, long drinking hours, long summer weekends in a shared house on Fire Island.It was love, for sure. But we were still figuring things out: I wear my heart on my sleeve, while he is the strong, silent type. I come from a middle-class midwestern American family; he was raised outside Manchester by a single mother who sometimes struggled to make ends meet. I was, truth be told, kind of spoiled. He could, on occasion, be a little dour. Were we too different? I wanted to analyse, to discuss – but, typically, he didn’t.View image in fullscreenLauren and Chris on their wedding day, on 19 July 2003.Photograph: courtesy of Lauren SchottOn the morning of 11 September 2001, I was in our Flatiron apartment, getting ready to work at a magazine. I was half-listening to the NY1 news channel when a story broke: there had been an explosion at the World Trade Center. The slow replay of the footage revealed the first plane. I perched on the arm of the sofa with my coffee and blamed the crowded airspace around LaGuardia.Fifty blocks downtown, papers that had blown out of the World Trade Center had been falling from the sky outside the windows of Chris’s office on Wall Street. In the aftermath of the plane striking the North Tower, he and some colleagues went out to see for themselves what was happening. He had only made it a couple of blocks west when, at 9.03am, the South Tower exploded two blocks in front of him. The building itself seemed to bend in his direction, and he turned and ran.For several hours, I couldn’t reach him. I watched the towers collapse on TV knowing that he worked just four blocks away. I went up to the roof of our apartment building and saw the smoke billowing up from downtown. I fielded calls from both of our mothers. Finally, Chris made contact: he was OK, just being held back inside his office building until it was safe enough to leave.He arrived home mid-afternoon, in the stream of survivors trickling out of lower Manhattan. He was covered in dust and smelled like burning metal. We hugged. We watched the news. Then at some point we realised we hadn’t eaten, so we went to watch more news in a pizza shop on Third Avenue. The guy behind the counter saw the dust, and probably the shock, and wouldn’t let us pay.It wasn’t until that night, when the focus of the coverage shifted on to who was responsible for the attacks, that I realised that I was overcome with a fierce, possessive anger: how dare they try to take him from me? In my rage, I got a glimpse of the void. But for the difference of two city blocks, I could have missed out on all of Chris, the good and the bad: that perfectly placed dimple, and his tendency towards bossiness; his goofy sweet side, and his grumpy aversion to fancy dress. My instinct was to grab him tightly and hold on for dear life, before the world came at us again.This feeling, mixed in with the grief over what was taken from so many people that day, fossilised over the weeks and months that followed. To my surprise, it left behind something that is hard and unwavering. It made me realise that love can be primitive and visceral. We married in 2003. I keep no tally of how our relationship is going, of what’s fair or how our marriage could be stronger. When things have gone wrong for us, in the face of grave illness and financial stress and all the pressures of 25 years of modern life, it’s just a given: he’s mine, and I will always hold on.Very Slowly All at Once by Lauren Schott is published by HQ, price £16.99.

Inspired by Auguste Escoffier’s exceptionally simple tartare, I’ve given his recipe a zero-waste twist by using whole boiled eggs and swapping in pickle brine from a jar of gherkins or capers to replace the vinegar. Everything else is optional: tarragon, mustard, cayenne … add what you like or have in store.Traditionally, tartare sauce is delicious with fish and chips, calamari or in a chicken sandwich, but I also like it tossed through potato salad with tinned sardines and radicchio. It’s also great as a dip with crudites and on top of a steaming jacket potato.Boiled egg and gherkin brine tartare sauceMyboiled eggtartare sauce uses whole eggs, blended with a little gherkinbrinefor acidity and flavour. I like to makemayonnaisewith extra-virgin olive oil – though some find it a little bitter – I love the flavour. Avocado oil or a cold-pressed sunflower oil also work well.We enjoyed it tossed through a potato salad withtinned sardines, and bowl of radicchio. But traditionally, tartare sauce is delicious enjoyed with battered fish andchips, calamari or in a chicken sandwich. It’s also great served as a dip with crudites and on top of a steaming jacket potato.To boil the eggs, place them in a small pan covered with cold water. Place on a high heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, cook for three minutes, then turn off the heat. Cover and leave for another three minutes. Refresh under cold water, then peel.If your mayonnaise splits while blending, don’t fret – decant the mixture from the blender, add a whole raw egg, then blend continuously while slowly drizzling the split mixture back into the egg until it emulsifies, adding more oil if necessary.Makes350-400ml, to serve 103 hard-boiled eggs1 tbsp pickled gherkin or caper brine,or white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar or lemon juice200ml cold-pressed oil(extra-virgin olive, avocado or sunflower)1 spring onion, green and white parts separated, green part finely chopped, or 5g finely chopped chivesOptional extras1 tbsp gherkins, finely chopped1 tbsp capers, finely chopped5-10g soft herbs(tarragon, dill, parsley, chives), stalks and leaves finely chopped1 tsp mustard(English, wholegrain or dijon)1 tspWorcestershire sauceA pinch of cayenne pepperor a dash of hot sauceSeparate the hard-boiled eggs into whites and yolks, placing two egg whites and all the yolks into an immersion blender jug or food processor. Add the pickled gherkin or caper brine and finely chopped green part of the spring onion.Blend together while very slowly trickling in the oil until thick and emulsified.Roughly chop the remaining egg white and white part of the spring onion and fold into the mixture.

Nothing says “I love you” more genuinely than a decadent tray of delicious things to savour between the sheets. Because V-Day falls on a weekend this year, you can do better than just buttered toast and an unbidden cup of tea. Whether it’s sweet or savoury (or even a cheeky cocktail), I’ve got you!Saffron crepes with cavolo nero and smoked trout (pictured top)These French crepes are given the Midas touch with a pinch of saffron. Use your favourite fish – mackerel and salmon also work well here.Prep20 minSteep20 minChill30 minCook30 minMakes4250ml milk1 pinchsaffron strands40g unsalted butter, plus extra, melted, for brushing1 egg, lightly beaten½tsp salt75g buckwheat flour2 tbsp plain flour150g hot smoked trout, flakedCreme fraiche, to serveFinely grated zest of1 lemon, to serveFor the cavolo nero2tbsp olive oil,plus extra to finish1 garlic clove, peeled and finely slicedFinely grated zest of1 lemon1 pinch chilli flakes(optional)200g cavolo nero, leaves stripped and choppedSea salt and black pepperWarm 50ml of the milk in a small saucepan until it’s lukewarm, then crumble in the saffron, take off the heat and leave to steep for 20 minutes.Put the butter in a small saucepan on a high heat until foaming and nutty, then take off the heat and leave to cool.Put the butter, egg, saffron and milk in a blender and blitz until just combined. Add the salt and both flours, blend until smooth, then refrigerate for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1 and line an oven tray with baking paper. Put a 21cm crepe pan on a medium heat, brush with melted butter, then add 60ml of the batter, swirling to spread it evenly over the base of the pan. Cook until the edges turn golden, then transfer to a tray and keep warm in the low oven while you cook the remaining crepes.For the cavolo nero, put the olive oil in a pan on a low heat, add the garlic, lemon zest and chilli, if using, and infuse for about five minutes, until the garlic is just fragrant. Add the cavolo nero and stir-fry for a few minutes until wilted. Season with sea salt and pepper, and finish with a little olive oil.To serve, divide the crepes between two plates, stuff each one with the greens and smoked trout, and fold over. Serve warm with a dollop of creme fraiche and some grated lemon zest.Dutch baby with caramelised pears, tahini and dark chocolate sauceView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s Dutch baby with caramelised pears, tahini and dark chocolate sauce.This large, fluffy pancake makes an excellent base for sweet and savoury fillings.

Whisk the flour, eggs, milk and a pinch of salt until smooth, then leave to rest for at least half an hour – it’s fine overnight in the fridge, if you are organised.When you are ready to cook, put a 30cm shallow casserole or heatproof pan in the oven and, after a few minutes, add the knob of butter. Wait four to five minutes, or until it’s very hot, making sure the butter doesn’t burn. Quickly take the dish from the oven, pour in the batter, return to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, by which time it should be very puffed up and golden brown on top. Don’t open the oven, not even for a peek.Meanwhile, make the pear compote and chocolate sauce. In a large frying pan, melt the butter on a medium-high heat, lay in the pear quarters cut side down and cook until browned; turn and repeat on the other side. Sprinkle over the sugar, a tablespoon of water and the vanilla extract, and swirl to combine. Over a low-medium heat, cook the pears, turning them regularly, until soft and caramelised.To make the chocolate sauce, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water until completely smooth. Add the butter, tahini, maple syrup and salt, and stir until smooth.To serve, spoon the pears into the Dutch baby, drizzle over the chocolate-tahini sauce and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.Lady marmalade breakfast cocktailView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s lady marmalade breakfast cocktail.Marmalade isn’t just for toast.

They don’t believe they can achieve the same financial success as previous generations, so they’re refocusing on their goals.”In middle school, Ho sold sketches to classmates for candy money long before he enrolled in art school. What began as pocket change has now become a crucial source of supplementary income.“I love how art can evoke emotion in people and share a story,” he said. “Compared to my retail job, my side hustle gives me a sense of accomplishment. It’s more challenging, creative and mentally stimulating and I can have a real impact.”‘The job market is cooked’The money Ho receives for his illustrations helps cover everyday expenses in New York City, where the annual cost of living – including housing, bills and food expenses – approaches $64,000,accordingto the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.Many young Americans are no longer prepared to “rely on a single job for financial security and career growth” as they grapple with an increasingly rocky economy, said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor. “All the traditional pathways to success, like going to college and securing a steady white-collar job, haven’t borne out, and now they are left with debt and a tough job market.”The tech industry has been particularly vulnerable to layoffs in recent years, as AI rapidly reshapes the sector. More than 150,000 jobs werecut across550 companies last year.Doshi’s side hustles are her safety net if the next wave hits her. “The job market is cooked,” she said. “You might have a job today, but tomorrow you might be laid off. Side hustles are about security and control, in such an unpredictable economy. It feels safer than just relying on one employer.”Yeong Yuh Lee, 23, a freelance illustrator in New York, was recently let go from her full-time job. Without side hustles, she would have been without income. She was previously an artist for an animation company and, in her spare time, commissions graphics for content creators.“I don’t know what I would’ve done if I didn’t hustle for clients outside of my in-studio job,” said Lee. “Right now I am living off of my side hustle, while trying to find a new job. But it’s already been six months and no luck.”Generative AI cratered the art job market, offering illustrations at afractionof human artists’ rates. Like Lee, Ho is struggling to find stable in-house studio positions.“With AI, combined with theincreasinglack of funding for the arts, and being a recent graduate, I just couldn’t break into the industry at all,” said Ho. “The industry is slowlydecliningso I had no choice but to fall into retail as my day job and just side-hustle my art.”‘I am never off the clock’But working on these gigs alongside day jobs has its costs. Ho doesn’t have much down time. When he clocks off at the store, he clocks into his side gig, opening his computer and beginning cold outreach to find potential clients, or posting new pieces on social media in a bid to boost his exposure.“In a sense, I am never off the clock,” he said. “It does get tiring, I do admit, but at the end of the day it’s like I got to do what I got to do. I just love drawing so much that I cannot imagine not doing it no matter how tired or exhausted I may be.”When Doshi tried splitting her time evenly among her roles, she felt drained and burnt out as if “fighting demons”, she said, before she focused on managing her energy levels. Her 9-5 role at Google eats her “peak focus energy”, she said, “and I work best with content creation and podcasting when my mind is relaxed, and feeling more creative”.Zhao, of Glassdoor, believes employers should embrace their employees’ side hustles, provided there is no conflict of interest. A “happy workforce is ultimately an engaged workforce”, he said, predicting that more young workers will pick up jobs on the side as time goes on.“Side hustles are here to stay, especially for younger workers,” Zhao added. “They are motivated, have the will to learn, the grit to be scrappy, and these are all characteristics that are really important for a workforce.”As more workers juggle multiple jobs, Valentino cautioned that corporate America faces a reckoning.“There’s going to be a big gap in the workforce in the next 10 years,” he said. “The onus is on corporate employers to figure out how to attract young people into jobs where they feel passionate, where there’s a mission and a sense of purpose, where there’s flexibility.”This fundamental shift may be irreversible, Valentino added. “The barriers to entry for starting something … are the lowest they’ve ever been,” he said. “I do see there being a change in terms of what we define as a ‘career’ moving forward.”Explore more on these topicsUS work & careersYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you should be aware of all of the policy’s limitations when you buy one.The most basic policies start at £15. The price will depend on the provider you choose, whether you want to be brought home with your car, whether you want coverage in Europe, if you get a replacement vehicle, and other features.The most basic level is simple breakdown cover. With this, if your car breaks down when you are more than a certain distance (for example, a quarter of a mile) from home, the insurer’s mechanic will attempt to fix it on the road and, if that is not possible, will tow it to an approved garage nearby.Consider extrasWith national cover, which costs more, your car will be towed to your home, or your destination, if you are going somewhere else. This could be useful for people who travel long distances for work or those who want to make sure a holiday is not disrupted.Another additional element is “home start”, which covers breakdowns at your home, or within the exclusion zone (such as the quarter-mile mentioned above) in cheaper policies. This could be helpful if your battery fails.Choosing an “onward travel” addition means that if your car needs repairs, then the insurer will provide you with a replacement vehicle, public transport or overnight accommodation if necessary.View image in fullscreenThe ‘home start’ element will add to the cost of your annual breakdown cover.Photograph: Paul Thompson Images/AlamyKara Gammell of comparison website MoneySuperMarket, says drivers should focus on the level of cover that they need when comparing policies and only buy the features they need.“Basic roadside assistance is usually the cheapest option, while national recovery, onward travel and at‑home start add extra protection, but can also add to the cost, so it’s important to tailor your policy, rather than assuming you need every add‑on,” she says.For example, if you were to get a basic personal policy with RAC Essentials, it would cost £29.99 a year. Make that national cover and it rises to £40. Add home start and it is £49.99. And with onward travel as well, the bill comes to £51.99.Choose person or carBreakdown cover is offered in two ways: either for the vehicle or the person named on the policy.Choosing to take out vehicle cover means it is that car, van or motorbike which will be covered, whoever is driving it. The RAC recommends this for a family car driven by a few people.If you take out personal cover, you will be covered, no matter what vehicle you are in, as the driver or passenger.Therefore, if you are a passenger in someone else’s car that does not have cover, you will be able to call for help.The downside is that if you are not in a car when it breaks down, it will not be covered unless the other person has cover.Typically, personal cover will be more expensive. In the case of RAC Essentials, a basic policy, with vehicle cover, will cost £25.98 a year – about £4 less.View image in fullscreenIf more than one person in the family drives the car, it makes sense to opt for vehicle cover, ie put the car on the policy, not the owner.Photograph: ZarkePix/AlamyWith family breakdown cover, a number of people who live at the same address can be covered for any vehicle they are driving, or are in, under one policy.Trips abroadIf you are driving to a European country on holiday, you can get breakdowncoverfor your trip. This can avoid the potential of having to deal with garages and recovery companies in a foreign language if something does go wrong.European cover is available for single trips, or as an annual policy, which will cover an unlimited number of trips. If you make several journeys over the year, then the annual policy may be better value.You should buy your policy before you travel (sometimes the insurer will specify that you need to buy it a minimum number of days before you go or can use it).The levels of cover will differ between policies – such as how much the provider will pay for repairs, or a replacement vehicle – so compare the details carefully.Check existing policiesBefore buying a policy, check you do not already have the cover you want.Some packaged bank accounts come with cover. For example, Nationwide’s FlexPlus current account (£18 a month) comes with UK and European breakdown cover from the AA. NatWest’s Reward Platinum account (£22 a month) has UK car breakdown cover, and the Premier Reward Black account (£36 a month) offers UK and European cover.Although most car insurance policies do not include breakdown cover, some do.NFU Mutualincludes Mutual Assist on all its polices. This includes roadside help, local recovery if more than a quarter of a mile from home, and a small hire car for 48 hours. More comprehensive cover costs more.Many car manufacturers offer cover for a limited period when you buy a new car. Ford offers one year of UK and European assistance with new sales. Audi offers three years, as does BMW.If you do have cover already, you should look at the details and ensure it covers everything you need it to.Shop around and haggle!Asurvey by consumer group Which?found the four most highly rated providers to be Aviva, Axa Assistance, Autonational Rescue and Start Rescue. These results come from a combination of customer satisfaction and waiting times for matters to be dealt with.View image in fullscreenMartin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert site says  breakdown assistance providers are among the easiest to haggle with when renewing your policy.Photograph: Andrew Bret Wallis/Getty ImagesTom Banks of comparison site GoCompare says theindependent Defaqto ratingon a breakdown cover policy is the industry benchmark of its quality.He also recommends looking at the average response times for providers. For example, theAA says that it usually gets to people in less than an hour, and gets them back on the road within 30 minutes of arrival.If you are renewing your cover, never accept the automatic renewal price as there are likely to be better deals out there. Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert site says breakdown cover providersare among the easiest to haggle with.It advises that you call your provider towards the end of your existing cover period to ask for a better deal as you are paying too much or there are better offers elsewhere. Telling a provider that you are leaving may prompt a better deal as they are usually eager to retain customers. There may be a better deal available from another provider, so use comparison sites to see what else is on offer.Know what to expectSeeing a recovery vehicle can be a huge relief when you have broken down, but your journey homemay take some timeand involve several trucks, and a broken-up trip.This is because UK law limits the time that truck drivers can spend on the road to 10 hours a day, which may mean your initial driver cannot take you all the way.Also, many companies operate networks of recovery vehicles within certain geographical regions – such as the north-east or Wales – and only within those boundaries.Therefore, if you switch from one network to another, you will have to move to another breakdown vehicle.Explore more on these topicsMoneyMoney hacksConsumer affairsMotoringCar insuranceInsuranceInsurance industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what is available to all actors (without getting their teeth pulled, taking magic mushrooms or demanding to be spoon-fed on set) is method dressing: that is, promoting a film in an outfit inspired by their character.View image in fullscreenRobbie in high gothic.Photograph: Joanne Davidson/Camera PressEveryone seems to be doing it, particularly in the past few months as Wicked: For Good and now Wuthering Heights have hit the red carpet. Why? It’s a low-stakes way to offer an extra endorsement for the film the actor is promoting (they liked it so much they’re willing to stay in character) and to drum up column inches and excitable TikTok commentary. It can also be a knowing wink – a gift, even – to fans. Some actors (or their stylists) include subtler sartorial semiotics and Easter egg accessories in their outfits that only the hardcore fandom and fashion nerds can appreciate. Either way, there’s a lot of it about. But who are the Daniel Day-Lewises and Robert De Niros of promo tour dressing?Margot Robbie – Wuthering HeightsView image in fullscreenRobbie in a Wuthering Heights-inspired outfit.Photograph: David Jon/Getty Images to Warner Bros. PicturesThe undisputed queen of method and her stylistAndrew Mukamal have outdone themselves in the past week, with a high gothic Wuthering Heights “tour-drobe” that requires a close line reading of the 1847 classic to decode. Her outfits feature lots of red (a leitmotif in the film; Kate Bush may approve), a snakeskin motif referencing Heathcliff’s line “I’d rather be hugged by a snake” and Elizabeth Taylor’s heart-shaped Taj Mahal necklace (more Heathcliff; this time: “I have not broken your heart - you have broken it”). Perhaps its most floridly OTT expression came with last week’s London premiere, at which Robbie wore aDilara Findikoglu dress crafted from (fake) hair, accessorised with a replica of Charlotte Brontë’s amethyst mourning bracelet, which incorporated (real) hair from her dead sisters, Emily and Anne.Margot Robbie – BarbieView image in fullscreenRobbie channels Barbie at a press conference in  Seoul, South Korea.Photograph: Han Myung-Gu/WireImageRobbie has been method dressing for years: she was clocked doing it forOnce Upon a Time in Hollywoodback in 2019, forBabylonin 2022 and, most famously, Barbie. For the 2023 press tour, she and Mukamal created looks, complete with hairstyles and accessories, that preciselyreferenced multiple specific dolls, including a black sequined sheath with a frill (“Solo in the Spotlight Barbie”), psychedelic mini (“Totally Hair Barbie”), pink polka dots (“Pink and Fabulous Barbie”) and even a black-and-white striped number paying homage to the original doll.Cynthia Erivo and Ariana GrandeView image in fullscreen‘Disciplined method dressers’: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande at the Wicked premiere.Photograph: Don Arnold/WireImageThe two stars of Wicked areexceptionally disciplined method dresserswhen promoting the franchise, sticking to a palette of Glinda pink for Grande and black or green (referencing Elphaba’s skin tone) for Erivo. Grande often goes further: at the LA premiere in 2024, herThom Browne pink ginghamand Swarovski-crystal-encrusted round-toed pumps directly referenced Judy Garland’s wide-skirted blue and white dress and sparkling red slippers, while in Sydney, her Vivienne Westwood floofy pink meringue of a gown closely echoedthe dress Billie Burke, the original 1939 Glinda, wore in the Wizard of Oz. Shamed or inspired by the stars’ commitment, the supporting cast have got in on the act: Jeff Goldblum has worn all sorts ofwizardlywhimsy, and Colman Domingo appeared at the For Goodpremiere in afaux fur coat imitating the pelt of his Cowardly Lion character.Zendaya – Challengers/DuneView image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet and Zendaya, wearing a metallic robot suit, at the premiere of Dune: Part Two.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for Warner Bros. PicturesFor Luca Guadagnino’s sexy tennis flick Challengers, Zendaya appeared on the red carpet not merely in aWimbledon-ish green Loewe sparkly shift, but one embellished with a still from the film of a player serving a ball. On the promo circuit, her stylist Law Roach had her dressed in a succession of“tennis-core” looks: short, white and green and eventennis ball heel shoes. Zendaya is anotherrepeat method dresser: she wore asilky red ringmaster jacketpromoting The Greatest Showman way back in 2017 and her Dune: Part Two promotional tour-drobe spanned everything from the kind of“space desert warrior” garb her character Chani would wearto afull-on metallic Mugler robot suit.Alexander SkarsgårdView image in fullscreenAlexander Skarsgård and Harry Melling promoting the film Pillion.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPromoting his“gay biker dom-com” Pillion, Skarsgård looked to be enjoying himself immensely in what Vogue described as “kinky method”: leather and fetish details, most notablythigh-high black shiny boots and a boot-licking motif T-shirtat Cannes. That said, he might have worn them even if he wasn’t promoting a BDSM biker movie – theinfamous teeny-weeny shorts he wore on Lorraineweren’t method; just Skarsgård having fun.Jenna OrtegaView image in fullscreenOrtega dressed in ghostly white.Photograph: StillMoving.Net/ShutterstockOrtega seems to embrace the spooky goth aesthetic joyfully when she’s promoting her Addams Family spin-off Wednesday, turning out inshredded black leather, Victorian ghost white and even a green Simone Rocha ghoul bodysuit.

His brand came of age in a gilded era of American charm, when Bill Clinton was president, the economy was booming and the twin towers glittered on the Manhattan skyline. His clothes speak to an America of sportsmanship and vigour, where everyone has a firm handshake and perfect teeth.The US could use some poetry right now, and Lauren is still the man. In fact, at 86, he is the hottest designer atNew York fashion week.The king of American fashion in the 1990s, Lauren presided over a solid commercial business in the two decades that followed. Decline seemed inevitable – between 2016 and 2018 sales fell by $1.3bn, or 18% – but with a personal fortune estimated by Bloomberg at $16.4bn, he looked on course to enjoy an extremely comfortable retirement.View image in fullscreenThe set for the New York show, inspired by Lauren’s country estate.Photograph: Pixelformula/Sipa/ShutterstockGeneration Z turned the trajectory around. Now entering adulthood, they are moving away from the ultra-casual, street-coded sportswear of oversized hoodies and bulky trainers and rediscovering the neater, more refined codes of preppy fashion that Lauren brought into the mainstream.Knits are replacing splashy sweatshirts, ironed and collared rugby shirts replacing shiny football kit, and loafers are back on the streets. The unabashed optimism of the Ralph Lauren worldview, in which carefully diverse groups of beautiful young people sell a wholesome dream of American chutzpah delivered with grace and manners has hit a nerve with a generation looking for reassurance and harmony in a fractious cultural landscape.The Ralph Lauren renaissance has been steered by CEO Patrice Louvet, who has harnessed the emotional intelligence of the founder into a marketing strategy that has brought the brand to life on social media platforms.View image in fullscreenA model wears a floor-length velvet gown.Photograph: Pixelformula/Sipa/ShutterstockShoppers who spend their time scrolling TikTok and Instagram instead of strolling malls have discovered the brand for themselves. A consistent aesthetic keeps sales steady – roughly 70% of product remains similar year after year, minimising expensive mistakes – while affordable price points bring in young consumers. At the Bond Street flagship, a leather jacket can cost £2,000, but there is a near-constant queue for the in-house cafe, where a coffee costs £5.To openNew York fashion week, Lauren transformed a grand marble palazzo in the city’s financial district – a showpiece of the young city’s financial muscle when it opened in 1894 – in the style of his own country estate upstate.View image in fullscreenLana Del Rey shows off her Ralph Lauren cowboy boots next to her husband, Jeremy Dufrene (left), Morgan Spector and Rebecca Hall.Photograph: Lexie Moreland/WWD/GettyThe frigid streets outside, banked with greying icebergs of snow, were banished in a cosy scene of overlapping antique rugs and generous urns of winter greenery. In keeping with the film-set vibe, a significant proportion of the audience were red-carpet famous. Lana Del Rey showed off her new Ralph Lauren cowboy boots on the front row. There was a Devil Wears Prada moment whenAnne Hathaway, soon to reprise her role as underling to a legendary magazine editrix, posed with Vogue’s Anna Wintour.The great fashion designers are world-builders who use shows, billboards and stores to sell a dream that is much bigger than clothes. Walking into a Ralph Lauren store feels like walking into a country club, even if you have never in fact been inside a country club. A shrewd business model has built a sturdy pipeline selling this dream to the people, one £175 quarter-zip cotton knit at a time.A yearning for the era when Have A Nice Day, not Maga, was America’s favourite baseball cap slogan, is at the core of the brand’s revival. The American sweetheartTaylor Swiftwore a breezily striped Ralph Lauren sundress for her engagement photoshoot last year, and the US Winter Olympics team are currently on the Italian slopes in Ralph Lauren stars-and-stripes kit. At this fashion house, the American dream is still alive. Nostalgia has become momentum: its quarter-zip sweater was named the hottest product of the last quarter of 2025 by the Lyst index, which ranks brands according to sales, search and social media.TikTokwent wild for a “Ralph Lauren Christmas” over the same period.View image in fullscreenComfort and cosiness is frequently layered on top of grandeur.Photograph: Pixelformula/Sipa/ShutterstockNot that there were any £175 sweaters on this catwalk. The fashion week collection is the pinnacle of the brand, and the dress code was unabashedly grand. Floor-length velvet gowns hung from delicate straps, and glass-bead fringing swished the carpet at the hem of sinuously curving skirts. Comfort and cosiness was layered on top: a tweed blazer was shrugged over a beaded cocktail dress, and a tailored evening suit padded past worn with velvet slippers.View image in fullscreenThe show closed with an appearance from Lauren himself.Photograph: Pixelformula/Sipa/ShutterstockA keen eye for contemporary styling connects the dots between the high-rolling clients who buy these clothes, and the baseball cap-buying masses who are the engine room of the business. Pebble-textured leather jackets, generous trousers worn with belts and knitwear slung around shoulders reflected an awareness of fashion as it looks in the real world right now.The show ended with a curtain drawing aside to allow Lauren to take a brief, stately bow.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In practice, day creams, lotions and gels marketed for those with a combination of dry, balanced and oily areas often only play to the latter condition. They add no oil and shine to the chin, nose and forehead, but offer only fleeting comfort to tight, parched areas around the cheeks.A thoughtfully formulated combination skin moisturiser that gives lasting, soothing hydration without becoming greasy and clogging is consequently rare – but it does exist, usually in a hybrid gel-cream texture.I’m not entirely sure whyCaudalie’sVinoHydra GelMoisturiseris (at £20 for a 60ml tube) so much cheaper than the rest of the luxury French skincare brand’s line, but I assume it serves as a metaphorical gateway drug to get you hooked. Don’t loiter and fill your basket, is my advice. This contains soothing aloe, hydrating glycerin and fine, lightweight oils that sink in fast and behave well under makeup.Creams marketed for combination skin often offer little comfort to parched areas on the cheeksBioderma’sHydrabio Gel-Cream Moisturiser(£18) does its job so well that even dry skins will like it. I was shocked by how long my naturally very low moisture levels remained topped up underneath this fresh, lightweight, cloudy gel – even in cold weather. The key is likely the inclusion of squalane, which feels and moisturises like an oil, but isn’t technically one and therefore doesn’t clog congestion-prone pores. The men in my life enjoyed using it too, and didn’t balk at the price.Sali Hughes on beauty: beat the winter blues with a luxury bubble bath at bargain basement pricesRead moreI’ve long admired the textures in Summer Fridays’ skincare line. Lightweight but luxurious, they’re fast and faff-free. So while their newCloud Dew Gel Cream(from £17) is too slight for my own skin, I could instantly feel why a combination type without any significant problems with breakouts will love it. Like all my favourite moisturisers, it contains the humectant glycerin, combining it here with hyaluronic acid and skin barrier-comforting ceramides, all in a juicy but quickly absorbed gel-cream. And it’s eczema friendly.I can’t fail to mention Simple, whose rebooted skincare line is extremely good, especially theSmooth+ Soothing Water Cream(£9.99, but frequently on offer). Its very fine gel-cream texture will delight anyone with an aversion to grease – even those with balanced skin – as well as those who are easily irritated by fragrance. Its long-lasting hydration and fresh, cooling aloe feel even won me over. And I like my face cream like lard.Explore more on these topicsSkincareSali Hughes on beautyBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I picked up my pen. A month of living in this Icelandic village and I was still unaccustomed to the impenetrable January gloom and the ferocity of the wind; its propensity to sound sentient. I had started to feel like the island was trying to tell me something, had a story it wanted me to write.Sauðárkrókur, a fishing town in the northern fjord of Skagafjörður, was all mountain, sea and valley. There were no trees to slow the Arctic winds, and I had already been blown sideways into a snowbank while walking home from Fjölbrautaskóli Norðurlands vestra, my new high school whose name I could not yet pronounce. At night, my dreams were filled with a soundscape of weeping women. When I woke, their wailing continued in the gusts outside. That was when I wrote. I wrote to understand myself in this new place. I wrote to understand Iceland, its brutality and its beauty.View image in fullscreenSauðárkrókur in Iceland’s north-west, with Mount Tindastóll in the background.Photograph: Hannah KentWhen I applied for a foreign student exchange at 16, I did not give much thought to where I would like to live. It was enough to have a year of respite from the pressure to decide what to do with my life. Since I was six years old, I had wanted to write,neededto write as one needs to breathe, but, influenced by wider social rhetoric regarding the arts, I had come to believe that writing wasn’t serious or worthy. Yet the thought of shackling myself to some other acceptable profession by way of university applications filled me with dread, and when the local Rotary club announced it would sponsor a student for a year abroad, I saw the opportunity as a lifeline. With no language studies under my belt, I was told that a host country would be selected for me based on “my personality”. When I received a letter informing me that I would be sent to Iceland, I was surprised. I knew nothing of this small Nordic island of 250,000 people. I wondered what we would have in common.By March, the winter winds had eased and the days lengthened into exquisite blue twilights. I was still overwhelmed by the difficulty of attending school, my unbelonging clear in the ongoing incomprehension and the stares that came my way, but writing about what I saw – the ravens circling, the fjord mirroring the height of the mountains – allowed me to step outside my loneliness. Each night, in the privacy of my bedroom, I let the words pour from me.View image in fullscreenHannah Kent beside the sculptureKona að strókka(Woman churning butter) by Ásmundur Sveinsson in Blönduos.Photograph: Hannah KentOne day, in Icelandic class, I started writing a poem in the margins of my notebook. Outside, I could see Mount Tindastóll, its snowy heights lit in pink from the late sunrise. I soon became so absorbed in pressing its beauty into paper that I did not notice my teacher, Geirlaugur, standing in front of me until he cleared his throat.“What is so important that it stops you from working?” he asked me, tapping the neglected exercises. He peered down at my notebook, reading sideways. “Poetry?”The place that stayed with me: I was cautious in showing my queerness, until a night spent dancing at a Tokyo gay barRead more“Fyrirgefðu,” I said.Sorry.The next day, when I returned to Icelandic class, Geirlaugur summoned me to his desk. I was expecting a reprimand, but instead he handed me an anthology of Icelandic nature poems, translated into English. He had included an inscription:To Hannah, From one poet to another, Geirlaugur.“Keep going, and you will be published one day,” he told me. I was struck by his seriousness, the absence of any condescension.“I hope so,” I replied.He shook his head. “You will be. Just keep going.Áfram.”View image in fullscreenThe writer at the Goðafoss waterfall in Iceland’s north.Photograph: Hannah KentFrom that day onwards, my relationship with Iceland shifted. I hurled myself into learning Icelandic and reading Icelandic novels, and the more I comprehended, the more I understood that Geirlaugur’s poetic sensibility was not an individual quirk but, rather, indicative of a wider cultural appreciation. I read Independent Peopleby the Nobel prize-winner Halldór Laxness, where the farmer Bjartur composes stanzas while he labours. I read the Sagas of the Icelanders, where poets are ranked equal to warriors in prestige. As I found friendship and belonging in Sauðárkrókur, I realised that Icelanders’ respect for authors had not abated. One friend told me proudly that Iceland is a nation of writers: one in 10 would publish a book in their lifetime. Nowhere else in the world were as many titles published per capita.I would not have become a writer were it not for Iceland. The enthusiasm for literature I saw around me that year – and the many times I have returned to the country since – renewed my confidence in the worthiness of writing as a vocation. Iceland herself, her sentient winds and blushing mountains, remain my muse. And if I feel the old self-doubt, the worry that I should be doing other things, I remember Geirlaugur’s gruff voice. “Áfram.” Onwards.Explore more on these topicsIceland holidaysThe place that stayed with meAustralian lifestyleEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is cold, unusually dark and a film of ice is forming on the lake. I’m sitting in an unlit wooden sauna, alone, in immense silence. The only noise is the soft ticking of the stove as the heat rises. Across the water are ghostly silver birches and dark pines. Above them, Orion’s Belt shines bright. This vivid experience feels like midwinter in Canada, Finland or anywhere else about 60 degrees north. So it’s bizarre to know I’m a few miles south-west of Great Yarmouth.Fritton Lake is an anomaly. Like the Broads to the north, this deceptively big, sinuous lake was largely created by medieval peat-digging, but it’s nothing like its Norfolk cousins. Set in a sandy, hilly landscape of heaths and pines, the northernmost outpost of the wildlife-rich strip of sandy heathlands running up the Suffolk coast, the lake is deep and two miles long but so hidden by trees that many people don’t know of its existence.Over the past five years, Fritton Lake has been transformed by a rewilding programme. Landowner Hugh Somerleyton is the co-founder ofWildEast, anow-national movementencouraging people to pledge to “wild” at least 20% of their garden, park, playground or farm. Fritton and its surrounds represent Somerleyton’s 25% rewilding contribution, while he farms the rest of his 2,020-hectare (5,000-acre) estate regeneratively.View image in fullscreenFritton Lake’s heated swimming poolI’ve brought my family for a winter weekend seeking wildness in far-eastern England. Arriving after nightfall, my first impression is simply darkness. Anything as suburban as a lit walkway or illuminated sign is not found here. But we locate our self-catering cottage, one of a range of accommodation options that includes chic wooden cabins (some with hot tubs) and B&B rooms in the cosy pub turned clubhouse that is now is both a holiday destination and a high-end members’ club.The highlight of our first night is a (very) quiet private 30-minute session in the lake’s magical floating sauna. Between pub and sauna are courts and pitches for tennis, basketball, football, cricket, croquet, pétanque and pickleball. Down by the lake are canoes, kayaks, rowing boats and paddleboards. Passing the heated outdoor 22-metre swimming pool with fire pits at either end is like stepping through a set for a film about a 1960s Cliveden pool party featuring Christine Keeler, except there is a solitary swimmer doing laps as the pool steams alluringly in the chill night air.It feels like midwinter in Canada or Finland. So it’s bizarre to know I’m a few miles south-west of Great YarmouthThe next morning, I wake up to another silence so deep it might swallow me. Huge flocks of jackdaws and rooks fly overhead as we stroll through rewilded grassland to the pub for a hearty breakfast. Afterwards, my son Ted and I set out on a Fritton “safari”. Our guide, Matthew, is a fast-talking, east London-raised botanist-horticulturist-entomologist-mycologist. We jump in an old-fashioned, cream-coloured motorboat and putter slowly across the lake, which is superb for swimming and also enjoyed by pike, eels and, in winter, teals, shelducks and egrets. In summer, an osprey occasionally hunts for fish here, while “all the owls” – little, short-eared, long-eared, tawny and barn – are seen nearby alongside six endangered amphibian species.View image in fullscreenThere are deer and stags on the estate.Photograph: Max Ellis/AlamyOn the far side of the lake, the wildlife area is only open to those on guided tours (and Scout groups). We climb into an open-sided 1976 Austrian Pinzgauer 4WD and Matthew bumps us through the woods. Amid last year’s bracken, we spy an enormous shiny black shape slumped under a pine. A hippo? Creeping closer, we find that the shape is a pair of huge black pigs that Somerleyton has “retired” to the woods. They flick floppy ears out of their eyes to examine us. Their rootling mimics wild boar lost to this landscape, disturbing the ground and assisting wildflower germination; former arable fields are filled with oxeye daisies in summer. We admire the long-horned Highland cattle roaming free, while a buzzard cries in the sky above.I duck into the lake, cracking ice as I gasp with the delicious cold shockTed spots a muntjac and a fallow deer, and then Matthew screeches to a halt with excitement. “King Conan’s sons!” he whispers. There, crossing our paths are two magnificent red deer stags, although apparently not quite as magnificent as King Conan himself. “They are the princes,” whispers Matthew. They observe us, seemingly unafraid, from 15 metres away.On our return across the lake after an otherworldly three-hour experience, two kingfishers pirouette around our boat, shining iridescent orange and turquoise against the dark water.My kids are mortified when I arrive at the pub for dinner wearing my Dryrobe, but if it is socially acceptable anywhere, it must be here. I need it for another sauna session that follows an amazing steak from a menu emphasising local/seasonal food, with good veggie options too. An owl calls on the walk back to the cottage.View image in fullscreenThe writer spotted kingfishers on his ‘safari’ around Fritton Lake.Photograph: Lisa Geoghegan/AlamyOn Sunday morning, I rise before dawn to exploreCarlton Marshes, a Suffolk Wildlife Trust nature reserve that’s a 20-minute drive away. The sunrise fills the vast sky with pink, and I have the seemingly endless marshes of the Waveney to myself, silent reeds silvered by frost. A Chinese water deer watches me, its teddy bear ears twitching, as I circle round the reserve, which is a haven for rare dragonflies and the spectacular fen raft spider in spring and summer. Although this coast is dominated by the surprisingly large conurbation of Great Yarmouth, Lowestoft and surrounding villages, Gorleston-on-Sea’s sandy beach offers another great stroll with seabirds and salty air.Later that day, while my wife, Lisa, does a yoga class, I head for a farewell sauna and find the open session is packed with a friendly crowd of regulars who say they wish Somerleyton would build another sauna or two. I pop outside and duck into the lake, cracking ice as I gasp with the delicious cold shock.We head home much less frantically than we arrived – a sign of the nourishment provided by a weekend of painterly light, stripped-back landscapes, cold water, warm hospitality and the gorgeous avian soundtrack of this wild, wintery east.The trip was provided byFritton Lake.

But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?Lucy Knightwith additional reporting bySumaiya MotaraWed 11 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 09.10 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleCalifornia-based Jacqueline Bowman had been dead set on becoming a writer since she was a child. At 14 she got her first internship at her local newspaper, and later she studied journalism at university. Though she hadn’t been able to make a full-time living from her favourite pastime – fiction writing – post-university, she consistently got writing work (mostly content marketing, some journalism) and went freelance full-time when she was 26. Sure, content marketing wasn’t exactly the dream, but she was writing every day, and it was paying the bills – she was happy enough.“But something really switched in 2024,” Bowman, now 30, says. Layoffs and publication closures meant that much of her work “kind of dried up. I started to get clients coming to me and talking about AI,” she says – some even brazen enough to tell her how “great” it was “that we don’t need writers any more”. She was offered work as an editor – checking and altering work produced by artificial intelligence. The idea was that polishing up already-written content would take less time than writing it from scratch, so Bowman’s fee was reduced to about half of what it had been when she was writing for the same content marketing agency – but, in reality, it ended up taking double the time.“I now had to meticulously fact-check every single thing in the articles. And at least 60% of it would be completely made up,” she says. “I would just end up rewriting most of the article. So something that would take me two hours when I was writing it by myself now took me four hours, making half the money.”To add insult to injury, Bowman’s few remaining clients have sometimes accused her of using AI to create her work. “I never use AI to write anything,” she says, but she has noticed that AI-produced copy can sometimes seem eerily similar to her own writing – which she suspects is due to large language models being trained on some of her previous work. She can’t afford to take any of the Silicon Valley giants to court – though she is grateful for the authors, likeGeorge Saunders and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who have done so.By January 2025, Bowman was no longer able to afford her own health insurance, which hammered home what she had already begun to suspect: “Writing is not going to work out for me any more.” She decided to bring her wedding forward (she and her partner are still going ahead with their planned celebration in March, but last year obtained a marriage certificate from their local courthouse) so she would be eligible to join her husband’s health insurance plan. But she knew a more drastic change would be needed before long.There’s a subsection of people who say: ‘Hey, AI took my job. I’m not going to an AI therapist’She remembered a psychology elective she had enjoyed in college, and wondered if she might be able to make a more secure living by becoming a therapist. “It’s not AI-proof” – Bowman admits that some people will be happy to useAI-powered therapy services, which already exist. “But there’s another subsection of people who are going to say: ‘Hey, AI took my job, AI ruined my life. I’m not going to go to an AI therapist,’” she says. “So in that way, I do think that there’s still going to be an audience who wants a human therapist.”Bowman decided to take action and retrain, “while I still do have a little bit of work”, and is now back at university studying to become a marriage and family therapist. She counts herself “incredibly lucky” because she is able to rely on her husband, and on any writing work she can still get, to make ends meet – but has still had to take out loans. She’s enjoying the course, and is “glad she has the opportunity to do it”, but it is not something she would have considered if her writing work hadn’t become untenable.View image in fullscreenJanet Feenstra, in her previous job as an editor in Stockholm.Photograph: Courtesy of Janet FeenstraJanet Feenstra, an academic editor turned baker based in Malmö, Sweden, also has mixed feelings about her career change, a choice she similarly made because of fears that AI would make her old job void. “It’s complicated because, in a way, I maybe should be grateful to AI for prompting this change,” she says. Feenstra now works at “a really cute bakery”, where she and her colleagues “roll out the dough by hand and it feels amazing”.“We listen to music and we dance and sing whenever we want,” she adds. “I have a lot more fun now, but I don’t want to be grateful to AI for this – I’m still a little bit bitter.” It felt like a forced career change, rather than one she was choosing on her own terms, she explains – not to mention the fact that she now gets paid less, travels farther to work and does a much more tiring job.Since 2013, the 52-year-old, who is originally from the US, had been working as a freelance editor alongside a part-time job at Malmö University doing what is called “language editing”: tidying up texts written by researchers whose first language isn’t English.“The standard of English here in Sweden is very, very high, so this was very specialised academic editing,” she says. “The international journals are very picky, so it required a certain expertise that we could offer.” However, in recent years, she began to hear people within the university talking about wanting to use AI. “It was scary. I felt like the writing was on the wall a bit,” Feenstra says. She began to realise that if a manuscript “is already quite good”, then an AI system prompted to meet academic journal requirements might be able to do the work she had been doing.View image in fullscreen‘Rolling out the dough by hand feels amazing’ … Janet Feenstra in her new job as a baker.Photograph: Courtesy of Janet Feenstra“I didn’t want to wait until it was too late,” she says. “I felt scared … I’m divorced, I have two children to look after and I need financial security.” So she decided to retrain in something she “was fairly sure that AI would not replace anytime soon”, and enrolled in culinary school.It wasn’t an easy transition. “I had to move out because I wasn’t able to afford my rent any more,” she says, which meant that her sons, who had previously lived between their parents’ two homes, had to live full-time with their father. While Feenstra embarked on her year-long training, she moved in with her partner, whose flat was too small to house her sons as well. Now, having worked in the bakery for five months, she has recently signed a contract on a new flat, which will have room for her sons. “I’ve had to work really hard: I’ve had to retrain, I’ve had to accept lower pay and conditions that are physically challenging,” Feenstra says. But securing the flat “is really exciting because it’s a goal realised”.Feenstra says it has been “an interesting journey” to go from a job typically associated with middle-class people to one seen as working-class. “White-collar work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, I’ve realised,” she says. “But it requires an adjustment. We’re so defined by our jobs and our class.”Perhaps those definitions of what counts as a “good” or “middle class” job will begin to change: a 2023 report on theimpact of AI on jobs and trainingin the UK by the Department for Education concluded that: “Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles.” And, rightly or wrongly, Feenstra is not alone in deciding that learning a trade is a relatively safe bet.Angela Joyce, the CEO of Capital City College, a further education provider in London, says: “We’re seeing a steady growth in students of all ages coming to us to do trades-based qualifications,” in subjects such as engineering, culinary arts and childcare. There is “definitely a shift” away from traditional academic routes, she says, which she attributes to the high numbers of unemployed young people – and “a good proportion of those are graduates”, she notes. That shift towards seeking vocational training is “in part linked to AI”, Joyce thinks, because people are looking for “jobs that AI can’t replace”.View image in fullscreenComposite: Rui Pu/The Guardian; Getty ImagesThat was certainly the case for Richard, a Northampton-based chartered occupational health and safety professional. After working his way up the career ladder for 15 years, the 39-year-old decided to jump ship and retrain as an electrical engineer.“Health and safety isn’t going to disappear any time soon because organisations can’t name AI as a responsible person or a duty holder for businesses legally,” he says. But a few years ago, he started to hear “mumblings of AI” within the industry, and saw organisations start to experiment with automating certain systems and procedures. He watched as AI began to be used for writing policies and safe systems of work, and realised that if a large portion of practitioners’ workload could be done by AI, then there might only be a need for “highly specialised managers. The rest of it’s probably going to go.”Though he decided to “pre-empt that” and pursue a different path, his main worry about AI taking over health and safety roles wasn’t actually that people like him would lose jobs – he finds aspects of AI “exciting” and accepts that it will inevitably shake up the way we work. His primary concern was that the implementation of AI might be “more of a cost-cutting exercise than it is about safety”. Richard cares deeply about the health and safety industry, which he entered after his friend was killed in a gas explosion at work.View image in fullscreenRichard, who retrained as an electrical engineer after 15 years in occupational health and safety.Photograph: HandoutHe has taken “a huge cut” financially since he has been working as an electrical engineer over the past year, but his new job does at least still have keeping people safe at its core. And there is the potential to make the kind of money he earned in his old job once he has more experience under his belt, he says, but “I’m a good five, 10 years off”. And that’s if automation hasn’t come for electrical work by then – Richard mentionsBMW’s testing of a humanoid robotas an example of how AI could affect trade jobs. Currently, though, the trades, in the UK at least, are “the most resilient to the levels of automation that AI is bringing in”, Richard believes. “Companies are capitalising on AI to remove one of their biggest costs, which is human overheads,” he says. “You need to pick something which has resilience. So, statistically, that is not your roles that are bureaucratic by nature, heavy in data and are just a bunch of processes which you repeat end on end. It needs to be something with high dexterity and some high problem-solving skills.”Carl Benedikt Frey, an associate professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, agrees that manual work “is going to be harder to automate”, but predicts that AI will have an impact “across a very wide range of industries” – trades included. “If the dishwasher breaks down in my home, I can take a picture and I can quiz the large language model of my choice, and I’m more likely to be able to fix it myself these days without calling an engineer,” he says. That’s not to say tradespeople are “doomed” – he cautions against making too many decisions based on “some hypothetical future scenario … We have to go by what’s actually happening in the labour market.” Which, now, is not a lot. “We’re beginning to see some studies suggesting more of an impact on entry-level work,” Frey says, but a reduction in entry-level job opportunities could also be attributed to higher interest rates, or post-pandemic recovery, he says.“As AI gets better, and its capabilities improve, I think it’s likely that we will see it on a bigger slice of the labour market. But we’re not seeing it yet.” In fact, Frey has now reassessed his earlier claim that 47% of roles were at risk of being replaced by computerisation, made inThe Future of Employment, the 2013 paper he co-authored with Prof Michael Osborne. “In that study, a lot of the jobs that we deem are highly exposed to automation are jobs in transportation and logistics because of autonomous vehicles,” he says. “It’s fair to say that it’s taken much longer for that technology to materialise.” Asself-driving carsdo begin to hit our streets, “we will see a lot of jobs being replaced in trucking and even in taxi services”, Frey believes. But his message seems to be don’t panic – at least not yet. “It might be a good idea if you are, say, in the early days of your professional career, to take the time that you still have to invest in training and figuring out other more viable career paths,” particularly if you work as a translator – one profession where “we’re already seeing that AI is having an impact, although we’re not seeing mass displacement by any means”. But if you are reaching the end of your working life, “you can probably ride the wave for a few more years”, he says.Roles the team don’t want to do – like email outreach and cold calling – we can get AI agents to do thatThe most significant AI-caused declines in employment and wages will be in jobs like software engineering and management consultancy, according to aKing’s College London studypublished in October 2025. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that there aren’t going to be new jobs that will be created,” Dr Bouke Klein Teeselink, who authored that study, notes. Historically, whenever there have been technological advances people have worried about mass unemployment, but it hasn’t happened, he says. “So there’s a part of me that is a little bit sceptical that all the jobs will disappear, but at the same time there is a reason to think that this technology might be different, in the sense that humans always maintained some type of absolute advantage over technology in certain domains. And that may no longer be true.”For now, while we can’t yet know the full impact AI will have on workers, “becoming really good at working with AI is probably going to be a skill that will pay off”, Klein advises. Which is what the Birmingham-based entrepreneurs Fayyaz Garda and Arun Singh Aujla, both 25, are attempting to do. Garda, who works in procurement, and Singh Aujla, who runs a social media marketing business, are in the process of setting up anAI consulting business, educating themselves about AI via YouTube. “It’s a growing market, and there’s definitely a space for it. So I’m hoping to try and get in there early,” Garda says. The plan is to employ a number of engineers to create AI systems that will answer phone calls, respond to mail and fulfil other tasks businesses need doing, he explains.“The AI consulting business is one way I’m upskilling to move with the times,” Singh Aujla adds. “AI won’t replace me, but it may take a large market share out of my business. So it’s always good to make an extra stream of revenue.” There are certain roles Singh Aujla would never replace with AI, though: “I would not replace my management team. You need that human interaction with your team,” he says. “But roles the team don’t want to do, like email outreach and cold calling, we can get AI agents to do that.”For some, it may well prove true that AI improves their work life by removing tasks they find tedious or difficult, giving them more time to focus on the more fulfilling aspects of their job. For others, though, it is the reason they have given up on their dream career. Paola Adeitan, 31, had her heart set on being a solicitor, and obtained an undergraduate degree and a master’s in law. She had planned to do the legal practice course, the final stage of training needed to qualify as a solicitor, “but I decided not to pursue that path because I felt like, with the change in technology, the AI, that might not be a viable path for me to carry on with,” she says. Friends of hers had struggled to get entry-level law roles, which she believed to be partly due to the increased use of AI at law firms.Adeitan still volunteers as a legal adviser, but her day job is in the health sector – although even that role could be affected by AI, she thinks, so she is remaining open to the idea that she might end up retraining again. “I do feel a sense of disappointment,” she says, “but the nature of work is changing. It’s very difficult now to decide what you want to do; you have to think carefully. It’s not about what you want any more; it’s about what is going to be there, what’s going to work.”If you’re lucky, what ends up working best could be something you really enjoy – as is the case for Faz, 23, who took a break from his geography degree at the University of Manchester in 2023 because of a family matter. Afterwards, it didn’t make sense to him to return to his degree. “I had to think about what was future-proof, I had to think about what was AI-proof. And it seemed like a lot of entry-level roles in the corporate sector were being taken over by AI. And because AI is so unpredictable, you never know if those more specialised roles will also become obsolete,” he says. So he has instead been training for a Level 2 qualification in electrical installation since September 2025. “I thoroughly enjoy it,” he says. Though he might go back to university at some point – his “ideal setup” would be a combination of working part-time for a council or a charity, while doing electrical work on the side – “right now, a tradie job is 100%, God willing, the correct choice. I’m fairly certain it will be future-proofed against AI.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Rui Pu/The Guardian; Getty ImagesBethan, 24, from Bristol, also enjoys her AI-proof job, working in a local cafe. But it comes at a cost: she has hypermobility spectrum disorder, which gives her severe joint pain and makes it hard for her to move around. “I can’t work long hours now because I’ve pushed my body past the point,” she says.Bethan’s old job, at a university IT helpdesk, “was the first job that I didn’t come home in pain from”, she says. But only a couple of months after she was hired, she and her colleagues were told the helpdesk was being closed down and replaced with an AI kiosk. “It was awful,” she says. The helpdesk staff tried to defend their roles, arguing that for students who didn’t speak English as a first language, or older students who weren’t computer-literate, having humans behind the desk may still be necessary. “It felt like we were getting completely ignored. They went ahead with it because they said they had to get a certain number of cuts to the budget.”Hospitality was the only other sector in which she had experience, so she ended up at her cafe job. “Feeling like I had to go back to hospitality, which was so bad for my body, was a horrible feeling,” she says. She is now on the lookout for an office job, but has struggled to find anything entry-level. “Those are the jobs that are vanishing because they’re the easiest to replace,” she says – but it also means it is impossible to get the experience needed for higher-up roles. Bethan worries that even if she does get an office job, she could lose it to AI again. “Is it worth all the effort of applying, getting my CV up to date, and potentially doing a couple of rounds of interviews just to find out at the end we’re going to be replaced again?”With more physically demanding jobs making up the bulk of what is now considered “AI-proof”, those who have made the switch from white-collar roles are having to adapt to the toll it takes on their bodies. The electricians Richard works with are typically in their late teens and early 20s. “Their recovery rates are a hell of a lot quicker than mine. So if I pick up an injury, for example, it takes me far longer to recuperate. Also, they can work far longer hours than I can,” he says.And though Feenstra enjoys the physicality of working in a bakery, she has been thinking about how sustainable this kind of job will be as she gets older. “That’s why I’ve been taking note of how the owners run the business,” she says, in case there is a possibility of running her own bakery one day. She is proud of how she is continuing to adapt to the changing world around her: “I want my sons to feel a little bit inspired by that,” she says. Yet she doesn’t feel she can offer them career advice. “How am I supposed to advise them when I don’t even really know if what I’m doing is the right path?” she says. “It’s really unsettling when you can’t advise them. If they have a passion for something and they want to do something, immediately you think, OK, is this even going to exist in the next 10, 20 years? That just kind of sucks.”More than a quarter of Britons say they fear losing jobs to AI in next five yearsRead moreBallerinas will still exist, says Klein. “No one is going to go to the ballet to see a robot do really good ballet,” the academic says. “Same for theatre, same for football, same for many other things where it matters that there’s a human.” He doesn’t think people will be wanting to confess to robo-priests any time soon either, or leave children in the care of AI. “There are just categories where we prefer to interact with humans, right?” For that reason, social skills will remain important, Klein and Frey agree. And though it might seem as if AI could make expert knowledge useless, Klein disagrees. “I have students who use AI naively, and therefore they have no idea whether the reports they produce are good or bad,” he says. “You need to have that expertise to be able to guide the AI to get it to do what you need it to do. So in that sense, I think the value of expertise might actually go up.”How such expertise will be developed, if entry-level jobs are being ditched in favour of AI systems, is a question that remains as yet unanswered, as is who will actually be able to buy a ticket to the ballet should large swathes of the population be put out of work. But Frey doesn’t think it is worth spending too much time worrying about that potential future – yet. “It could well arrive, but it matters a great deal if that happens in five years or 20.” While he acknowledges “there are reasons to be concerned”, Frey doesn’t think it’s time to “paint a scenario where everybody’s going to be out of work five years from now, and we need to rethink everything”.Share your experienceShare your experienceIf you've altered your career plans because of AI, tell us about it in the form below.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

One victim was found in the stairwell, and the others were located in the school’s library.Two firearms were recovered at the scene – a long gun and a modified handgun. Police are still working to determine their origins and role in the incident.The suspect had a firearms license that had expired in 2024 and did not currently have any firearms registered to her.The suspect had dropped out of Tumbler Ridge secondary school about four years ago and was not currently a student there.There is no information at this point to suggest that any of the victims in the school were specifically targeted.Police had attended the suspect’s family residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with mental health concerns of the suspect.This included one police attendance to the home approximately two years ago where firearms were seized under the criminal code. The lawful owner of those firearms petitioned for them to be returned, and they were.The suspect was born as a biological male who had started transitioning about six years ago and identified in public and on social media as female.The suspect is believed to have acted alone.Police don’t yet have an idea as to what the suspect’s motive was.ShareUpdated at16.53 EST"

The suspect was later found dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted injury.Police found six people dead inside the high school in the remote town of Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia, with a further two bodies found at a residence believed to be connected to the incident.Another person initially believed to have died on the way to hospitalwas later said to have survived, but remained in critical condition.The suspected shooter was found dead at the school, police said, adding they did not believe there were any more suspects or an ongoing threat to the public.Tumbler Ridge shooting: what we know so farRead morePrime minister Mark Carney said he was “devastated” by the shootings. “I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,” he said. “Our ability to come together in crisis is the best of our country – our empathy, our unity, and our compassion for each other.”1:12British Columbia school shooting 'one of the worst' in Canada's history, officials say – videoThe prime minister’s office said Carney had suspended plans to travel to Germany on Wednesday for the Munich security conference.More than two dozen people have been hospitalised – two with life-threatening injuries – in what British Columbia’s premier, David Eby, called an “unimaginable tragedy”. “It’s hard to know what to say on a night like tonight. It’s the kind of thing that feels like it happens in other places and not close to home,” Eby told reporters.map of area of CanadaA police active-shooter alert sent to people in the area described the suspect as “female in a dress with brown hair”. Police Supt Ken Floyd later confirmed at a news conference that the suspect described in the alert was the same person found dead in the school. Police did not say how many of the victims were minors.The District of Tumbler Ridge issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon, calling the shooting a “deeply distressing” incident for a community of less than 2,500.1:29Canadian police give update after deadly school shooting in British Columbia - video“We recognise that many residents may be feeling shocked, scared and overwhelmed,” the district said. “In the days ahead, we know this will be difficult for many to process. Please check in on one another, lean on available supports, and know that Tumbler Ridge is a strong and caring community.”Tumbler Ridge is a remote town in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia, approximately 1,155km northeast of Vancouver.Tumbler Ridge secondary school has 160 students in grades 7 to 12, roughly ages 12 to 18, according to its website. The school will be closed for the rest of the week and counselling will be made available to those in need, school officials said.“There are no words that can ease the fear and pain that events like this cause in a school community,” the Tumbler Ridge Parent Advisory Council said in a statement. “We want families to know that the safety and wellbeing of students and staff are paramount, and we are grateful to the first responders and emergency personnel who acted quickly and professionally.”Officials said the town’s small police force was on the scene within two minutes of receiving a call, and that victims were still being assessed hours after the incident. British Columbia’s public safety minister, Nina Krieger, said at a press conference: “Speed and professionalism saved lives today.”Earlier, Krieger,saidonline that news of the shooting was “sending shockwaves through the community and the entire province”.Police initially issued an emergency active shooter alert on Tuesday afternoon after receiving reports of a shooting at the secondary school at about 1.20pm. The alert told residents to shelter in place, lock their doors and refrain from going outside. The RCMP alert was lifted at 5.45pm.Supt Floyd told reporters the scene of the shooting was “very dramatic” with extensive injuries. He said all remaining students and staff at the secondary school, numbering about 100 people, had been safely evacuated from the school.View image in fullscreenA Google Maps image of Tumbler Ridge Secondary SchoolPhotograph: Google MapsFloyd said police wouldn’t comment on a possible motive.“We’re following all leads to try to determine the connection to the shooter,” he said. “I think we will struggle to determine the ‘why’, but we will try our best to determine what transpired.”The town’s health centre was placed on Code Orange, signifying a mass-casualty incident or large-scale emergency response. But given the rural nature of the community, at least two victims were airlifted to larger hospitals. Shock Trauma Air Rescue Service (STARS) said one of its aircraft from Grande Prairie, Alberta, was requested for the incident.Because of Canada’s strict gun laws, which make it difficult to own both handguns or “assault-style weapons”, the country has experienced far fewer instances of mass violence compared with the United States. Still, the shooting is the second-deadliest school shooting in Canadian history. In 1989, a gunman killed 14 students at Montreal’s L’Ecole Polytechnique in an attack that targeted women. In 2016, five people were killed in a series in La Loche, Saskatchewan.Speaking to reporters, Eby, a father of three, said news of the shooting “makes you want to hug your kids a little tighter”.“Wrap these families with love. Not just tonight but tomorrow and into the future. This is something that will reverberate for years to come,” he said. He later added: “This is the kind of thing that feels like it happens in other places, and not close to home in a way that this feels like for many British Columbians and Canadians.”This article was amended on 11 February 2026. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police initially said a person had died on the way to hospital, then later clarified the person had survived, but remained in critical condition.Explore more on these topicsTumbler Ridge school shootingCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They simply bribe officials or bribe vendors, and with money, they get what they want. And they have very advanced weaponry.”Among that weaponry, drones have become a key part of the drug gangs’ arsenal.“The drone is fundamental,” Guerrero added. “If you have a good drone strategy, and you can acquire them quickly on the black market, and you combine that with artificial intelligence, forget about it. You become incredibly powerful.”First weaponized in 2017, drones are used by Mexican cartels for reconnaissance,the delivery of drugsand, increasingly, to bomb rivals and sow terror in rural communities, according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on non-state armed groups at the Brookings Institution.“We have seen activities by the cartels such as carpet bombing of rural areas in Michoacán [state] with the purpose of driving populations out of an area,” said Felab-Brown. “The reporting in Michoacán has been of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people displaced as a result of the scorched-earth policy through drones by [the Jalisco New Generation cartel].”The use of drones has also given crime groups a significant advantage in attacking their rivals.“On the battlefield one of the big implications is the ability to conduct crime as well as warfare over greater and greater distances,” said Felbab-Brown.Increasingly, that long-distance capability of drones has been used by cartels to cross the US-Mexico border.In July, Steven Willoughby, director of the counter-drone program at the US Department of Homeland Security,testifiedbefore Congress saying that cartels were using drones to conduct surveillance and convey drugs across the border “nearly every day”.In the last six months of 2024, Willoughby said, more than 27,000 drones were detected within 500 meters of the southern border. In October, according to Willoughby, customs officials seized a drone carrying 3.6 pounds of fentanyl pills.Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, disputed Willoughby’s allegations the next day, saying during her morning news conference that “there is no information on any new drones currently at the border”, adding: “There’s nothing, let’s say, in particular to be alarmed about.”On Wednesday, Sheinbaum again rejected claims of a drone incursion in El Paso: “There is no information regarding drone use at the border,” she said. “If the FAA or any other US government agency has any information, they can ask the Mexican government.”But whether or not there was a drone incursion on US airspace this week, Guerrero warned that, if cartels do use drones to strike targets on US soil, the Trump administration could use it as an excuse to launch its long-threatened ground attack on Mexico to tackle the country’s drug gangs.“Here in Mexico, cartels have been using drones for some time to attack state and municipal police,” he said. “But if they tried to do something like that in the United States, that would be the perfect pretext for the US to launch a ground offensive against Mexico.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoTexasDrugs tradeAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

She is accused ofcolluding with foreign forcesand police have offered a bounty of 1m Hong Kong dollars (£93,740) for her arrest.Rights groups condemn arrest of Hong Kong activist Anna Kwok’s father and brotherRead moreAnna Kwok said the targeting of her father was an attempt by the authorities “to drive distance between me and other Hongkongers”.The regime wanted to “weaponise human emotions against me”, she added. “It has been a journey for me to find out what activism means.”In a separate statement published by the HKDC, she said: “The Hong Kong government’s retaliation does not and will not discourage me from my ongoing advocacy and activism.”Kwok Yin-sang was accused of trying to withdraw funds totalling 88,609 Hong Kong dollars from an education savings insurance policy he bought for her when she was almost two years old. He had pleaded not guilty and did not testify at the trial.View image in fullscreenAnna Kwok said the targeting of her father was an attempt by the authorities ‘to drive distance between me and other Hongkongers’.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersThe acting principal magistrate Cheng Lim-chi said since Anna Kwok was a fugitive, directly or indirectly handling her insurance policy is illegal.A sentence is expected to be announced within a few weeks. The maximum penalty is seven years in jail.According to the prosecution, when Kwok Yin-sang was arrested, he said under police caution: “I know my daughter is wanted by the security bureau. I was the one paying for her insurance policy. Since she’s no longer in Hong Kong, I just cut it.”He had initially been denied bail but was later granted bail by the high court, with conditions imposed including a travel ban and a ban on communication with his daughter.During the closing submission, his defence lawyer Steven Kwan argued that section 89 and 90 of Article 23 should not apply in a case where a person was simply handling an insurance policy he had bought a long time ago for his children. “This … is a form of prosecution based on family ties,” Kwan said.Anna Kwok’s brother was also arrested for the same crime, and is now on bail.Elaine Pearson, the Asia director for Human Right Watch, said: “The conviction of Kwok Yin-sang is cruel and vindictive, showing just how far Hong Kong authorities are willing to go to silence peaceful activism abroad.”The targeting of relatives of a person wanted by the authorities is common in mainlandChina, although is a relatively new phenomenon in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous city that was suppose to maintain an independent identity for at least 50 years after it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.View image in fullscreenThe 20-year prison sentence handed to Jimmy Lai outstripped the punishments given to some of China’s most famous dissidents.Photograph: Tyrone Siu/ReutersLegal experts and rights groups say the tactics used to target regime critics in Hong Kong are becoming increasingly similar to those of mainland China. On Monday, Jimmy Lai, a high-profile critic of the Chinese Communist party, wassentenced to 20 yearsin jail for national security offences. The length of the sentence for the 78-year-old outstrips punishments given to some of China’s most famous dissidents.China imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020. In 2024, the city’s legislature passed Article 23, enacting a provision of Hong Kong’s mini-constitution that had previously faced fierce opposition from Hongkongers. The authorities said that Article 23 was necessary to close “loopholes” in the city’s national security regime.Explore more on these topicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The statement was made on behalf of the author’s wife, the photographer Simone Sassen.“We will miss the friendship, erudition, enthusiasm and individuality of this internationally acclaimed writer,” it said.Nooteboom first made a name for himself in theNetherlandswith his 1955 debut novel Philip and the Others. Based on long hitchhiking trips to the Mediterranean and through Scandinavia, it won the Anne Frank prize and became a Dutch literary classic.He achieved his international breakthrough with his 1980 novel Rituals, about two friends – one of whom breaks rules frequently while the other follows them strictly. The book was turned into a film in 1988 and became his first work to be published in English translation.Born in The Hague on 31 July 1933, Nooteboom told the Guardian in a2006 interviewthat he had no childhood memories until the outbreak of the second world war.When Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940, “we watched on the horizon the glow of Rotterdam burning and I remember being very afraid and having to have cold water thrown in my face to calm me down”.His father was later killed when a British air raid levelled a residential quarter of The Hague “by mistake”.Germany was later one of the European countries were Nooteboom’s fiction and travel writing found even greater critical acclaim and commercial success than at home.As well as writing his own work, Nooteboom translated works from English into Dutch, such as poetry by Ted Hughes and Czesław Miłosz, and the plays of Brendan Behan and Seán O’Casey.He was awarded honorary doctorates from universities in Brussels, Nijmegen, Berlin and, in 2019, the University College London.Explore more on these topicsBooksNetherlandsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And that shame is a double sentence, it’s a suffering you inflict on yourself.”She added: “I said to myself that fighting against that on an individual level was also fighting for the collective. I said if I could do it, other people could too … My message of hope to all victims is never have shame.”Earlier, she described her shock when police first showed her images of the crimes, likening herself to a “rag doll”.In extracts from her forthcoming memoir, A Hymn to Life, Pelicot, 73, describes her shock when police told her of the actions of her ex-husband Dominique, whom she considered “a great guy” and had shared her life with for 50 years.She tells of her world falling apart on 2 November 2020 when she was first told her then husband had been drugging and raping her and inviting strangers to rape her, in extracts inLe Mondefrom the French-language version of the book that will be published simultaneously across the world in 22 languages next week.Dominique Pelicot had been summoned by police for questioning after a supermarket security guard caught him secretly filming up women’s skirts.Gisèle Pelicot had accompanied him to the police station and was completely unprepared for the bombshell delivered by the officer, Laurent Perret. He said: “I am going to show you photos and videos that are not going to please you. That’s you in this photo.”Pelicot said she did not believe the inert woman lying on the bed was her. “I didn’t recognise the individuals. Nor this woman. Her cheek was so flabby. Her mouth so limp. She was a rag doll,” she writes in the book.“My brain stopped working in the office of Deputy Police Sergeant Perret.”Pelicot became known internationally last year when she waived her right to anonymity in the trial that shocked the world.View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot leaves the courthouse for a break during the appeals trial of a man challenging his conviction in Nîmes, France.Photograph: Lewis Joly/APDominique Pelicothad for over almost a decade crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her mashed potato, coffee or ice-cream and invited dozens of men to rape her in the village of Mazan in south-east France, where the couple had retired. She had been in a state akin to a coma. A total of 51 men were found guilty of rape or sexual assault.In the book extracts, Pelicot describes her decision to make the trial public. She said if she had kept the trial behind closed doors – as usually happened in such cases – it would have protected her abusers and left her alone with them in court, “hostage to their looks, their lies, their cowardice and their scorn”.She wrote: “No one would know what they had done to me. Not a single journalist would be there to write their names next to their crimes … Above all, not a single woman could walk in and sit in the courtroom to feel less alone.”She said if she had been 20 years younger: “I might not have dared to refuse a closed-door hearing.“I would have feared the stares. Those damned stares a woman of my generation has always had to contend with, those damned stares that make you hesitate in the morning between trousers and a dress, that follow you or ignore you, flatter you and embarrass you. Those damned stares that are supposed to tell you who you are, what you’re worth, and then abandon you as you grow older.”The launch of Pelicot’s book, co-written with the French author Judith Perrignon, is considered a major publishing event as it is released simultaneously across the world on 17 February.The British actor Emma Thompson will narrate the audiobook in English. In a social media post, Thompson said the “absolutely extraordinary” story was “difficult to read out loud” but that it inspired “courage and compassion but also crucially demands change”.Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotGisèle Pelicot rape trialFranceAutobiography and memoirBiography booksEuropeViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

But there’s big opportunities.”Reeves stressed the areas already under discussion with Brussels as part ofLabour’s UK-EU “reset”, including a food and farming agreement, a youth mobility scheme, and how the UK will participate in the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, are just “first base”.The government is due to carry out a review of the trade and cooperation agreement with the EU signed by Boris Johnson in 2020 by the end of this year, and a summit on the “reset” between the two sides is due in the coming months.Reeves’s plan for aligning with EU rules in some sectors echoed recent comments by Keir Starmer.Both have rejectedthe idea of a customs union, however, which would preclude the UK from forging its own trade deals with non-EU countries. Rejoining either a customs union or the single market was ruled out in Labour’s general election manifesto.Reeves also underlined the importance of working closely with the EU – and other like-minded countries – in other areas, citing the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney’srecent speech at Davos,in which he called on middle powers to work together.“Britain’s future is inextricably bound with that of Europe’s: for economic reasons that I’m primarily responsible for as chancellor, but also reasons of security, resilience and dependence,” she said.The chancellor also urged her European colleagues to press ahead with cooperation on defence procurement, saying: “Russia is not going to sit on the sidelines and wait for the next Ecofin [meeting of EU finance ministers, which Reeves also attends].”The shadow chancellor, Sir Mel Stride, said: “It’s no secret that Reeves and Starmer have wanted to row back on Brexit since day one.“Labour are desperate to blame anyone but themselves for their economic failures. Under increasing pressure from their own soft-left colleagues following the Mandelson scandal, Starmer and Reeves would rather point the finger at Brexit than accept their poor choices have been a disaster for our economy.”Reeves was speaking before the release of official data on economic growth for the final quarter of 2025 on Thursday morning. With recent survey data signalling optimism in some sectors, the Treasury is hoping for an upturn in the coming months, after six cuts in interest rates.In a message on X sent to support Starmer as hispremiership appeared to be in jeopardyon Monday, the chancellor said: “Interest rates are falling. The conditions for the economy to grow are there.” She told the Bruegel conference she was optimistic about recent signs of an uptick in productivity growth.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesEuropean UnionTrade policyEconomic policyBrexitEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She denied the crime for three years, claiming she had been a victim of identity theft, before finally admitting her guilt in a court hearing in Albertville last October after she was found to have photos of the credit card on her phone. “I confess the accusations but I don’t remember committing them,” she said at the time. “It’s like a blackout.”Simon explained at the time that she found her actions “incomprehensible” and that she was “working with a psychologist to understand what happened”. The crimes were committed in 2021, but only came to light later, after Simon had won the first of her 10 world championship titles.View image in fullscreenJustine Braisaz-Bouchet competes in the women’s 15km individual biathlon.Photograph: Martin Metelko/EPABraisaz-Bouchet found herself the target of extreme online abuse in the wake of the scandal. “It has made a lot of people angry,” she said. “The story came out in 2023, after Julia Simon’s great season, and for many people I was the troublemaker.”The French Ski Federation imposed a six-month ban on Simon, but five months of it were suspended meaning she missed one event at the beginning of this season but was still eligible to compete here. She helped the team win the gold medal in the 4x6km mixed relay on Sunday, when she was on the anchor leg.As Simon crossed the finish line she held a finger to her lips, but refused to explain why she had done it. “I put my finger to my mouth, it was for one person and they know who because we had a talk. But I won’t tell any more about it, it’s over.”Simon refused to talk about the conviction, or her ban, or anything except her gold medal. “I’m just focused on my sport, it is the thing I love the most, I had a goal and I put all my energy into it,” she said. “Yes, it was a difficult month, but today was the perfect result for me, it feels like a dream.”View image in fullscreenJulia Simon wipes away tears after she received her gold medal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe affair was the most high-profile of a series of scandals in the sport inFrance. Last year Jeanmonnot revealed she had received death threats from a gambler who was furious about losses linked to her performances, and another of the French team competing at these Games, Jeanne Richard, was briefly excluded from the national squad after she was accused of tampering with a gun belonging to one of her teammates.Biathlon is in the middle of a drive to reform ethical standards after the man who had run the International Biathlon Union for 25 years, Anders Besseberg,resigned in 2018 after he was accused of accepting bribesincluding an Omega watch, several hunting trips, a leased BMW X5, and the services of sex workers in return for protecting Russian interests during the state-sponsored doping scandal.

She told the court any job contracts for European parliament assistants were transparent and “we don’t have the feeling of having committed the slightest crime”.The leader of the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) had been one of the top contenders for next year’s presidential election until last March, when her conviction in the fake jobs trial led to her beingbarred from running for public office.Judges in that trial ruled Le Pen had been “at the heart” of a carefully organised system of embezzlement of European parliament funds from 2004 to 2016.They banned her from running for office for five years, effective immediately, and handed out a four-year prison sentence, with two of those years suspended and two to be served outside jail with an electronic bracelet. They also ordered her to pay a €100,000 fine.Le Pen, who is trained as a lawyer, appealed. During the appeal trial she has sought to overturn the verdict and sentence, denying wrongdoing and insisting she wanted to run again for president.The verdict and sentence – to be delivered on 7 July – will determine her political future and whether she can make a fourth presidential attempt next year. If not, she would be replaced by her protege and party president, 30-year-oldJordan Bardella.Last week, state prosecutors asked appeal court judges tomaintain the five-year election banon Le Pen. If the judges grant that request, she would probably not be able to run in France’s 2027 presidential election.State prosecutors told the appeal court that Le Pen had been at the heart of a “thought-out”, “centralised” and almost “industrial” system to embezzle European parliament funds.They said taxpayer money allocated to members of the European parliament to pay their assistants based in Strasbourg or Brussels had been siphoned off by the party from 2004 to 2016, to pay its own workers inFrance, in violation of the parliament’s rules.The staff in France had no connection to work undertaken at the European parliament, prosecutors said. The loss to European funds was estimated at €4.8m (£4.2m). The party, called Front National at the time, made substantial savings through the system, prosecutors said.One state prosecutor, Thierry Ramonatxo, criticised Le Pen for making public attacks on judges after last year’s verdict, when she said a “tyranny of judges” wanted to stop her running in a presidential race that she could otherwise win.Ramonatxo said judges simply applied the law that had been voted for by the people’s representatives in parliament. He said Le Pen had “made a choice to attack judges on the political stage rather than to reflect upon what she had been reproached for”.The judges will retire to consider their verdict over several months.Explore more on these topicsMarine Le PenNational RallyFranceEuropean UnionThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Successive opinion polls have shown he remains the most popular candidate to become president of the Palestinian Authority in succession to Mahmoud Abbas.The Foreign Office has so far declined to back the calls for his release.Marwan Barghouti, ‘Palestine’s Mandela’, to publish book from prisonRead moreBarghouti, a member of theFatahparty central committee, has been held in jail for 22 years after being given multiple life sentences in September 2003 for five murders, at a trial that a lengthy Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) inquiry found failed to meet the standards of fairness. Barghouti, during the second intifada, said he opposed the targeting of civilians inside Israel, but defended the right to resist the occupation.Israel has released more than 500 Palestinians serving life sentences in the last 15 years, but has always excluded Barghouti. His son warned a meeting in London: “The UK recognition ofPalestineis going to be seen as symbolic in the history books as long as there are no actual steps being taken on the ground.”He said: “Current Palestinian politics is dysfunctional and that can only be changed with democratic renewal, including a new leadership that really represents the people. We have not had elections for 20 years.”“My father does not have a magic stick, he cannot change everything overnight, but people look at my father as a source of hope,” he said.Barghouti said his father, freed from jail, would be in a position to sell any agreement to Palestinians, and so represented the best route to a non-violent solution, adding: “The reason he is not being released is because the Israeli government does not want a legitimate Palestinian leader, because it does not want a two-state solution.”He said his father has been kept in solitary confinement since the 7 October attack on Israel and has been assaulted multiple times, most recently in October, leading to broken ribs. He said: “If that is not an invitation to speak out against the violations of international law, I don’t know what is. I would expect the UK government, as an upholder of international law, to go further and call for his release. He can change the status quo, Palestinian politics, and take us on a path to where there is real hope for a political settlement.“We have not yet had brave enough British politicians when it comes to the highest level of politics.”The Guardian view on Marwan Barghouti: Palestinians need a political future as well as aid and reconstruction | EditorialRead moreLabour MPs said there is a growing sense of frustration that the UK government has sat back after the recognition of Palestine, and that France and Spain have been more proactive.Asked if the UK supports Barghouti’s release, the Foreign Office in written answers states it supports the International Committee of the Red Cross having access to Palestinian prisoners.With some MPs reluctant to back Barghouti on the basis that he was found guilty by an Israeli court of organising the murder of four Israelis, and one Greek monk, the Barghouti campaign has been working to reassure MPs about his innocence and the many flaws in the Israeli judicial process.The author of the 2003 IPU inquiry, Simon Henderson, told the Westminster meeting he compiled his highly critical report after full conversations with the Israeli attorney general. He said he discovered that, of the 96 witnesses, only 21 were in a position to testify to his involvement, and yet none did so, while 12 of them explicitly exonerated him. Israel claims that at the time of the second intifada Barghouti helped found the armed wing of Fatah, and that the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade had claimed him as its leader.Explore more on these topicsPalestineFatahIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, Donald Trump said he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East to prepare for military action if talks with Tehran failed.Iran tells US not to let Netanyahu thwart nuclear talks before Trump meetingRead morePezeshkian said Iran was willing to negotiate over its nuclear programme and was “ready for any kind of verification” in relation to its insistence it is not trying to build nuclear weapons. However, the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been unable for months to inspect and verify Iran’s nuclear stockpile.Pezeshkian said: “The high wall of mistrust that the United States and Europe have created through their past statements and actions does not allow these talks to reach a conclusion.“At the same time, we are engaging with full determination in dialogue aimed at peace and stability in the region alongside our neighbouring countries.”View image in fullscreenMasoud Pezeshkian did not directly address the protests that rocked the country at the beginning of the year but said authorities were ‘ready to hear the voice of the people’.Photograph: Iran’s Presidential website/WANA/ReutersWhile he did not directlyaddress the bloodshed by authoritiesin suppressing the protests, Pezeshkian said: “We are ashamed before the people. We are obliged to serve all those who were harmed in this process. We are ready to hear the voice of the people. We are servants of the people and we do not seek to confront the people.”However, Pezeshkian spurned an appeal from leaders of reformist parties to speak out against themass arrest of their leadershipin recent days. In a statement, the Reform Front told Pezeshkian that a failure to demand their release would be understood as a betrayal of his campaign promises and a blow to peace.Lawyers acting for the detained reformists said they understood they were being kept in solitary confinement. Media organisations close to the security forces claimed they were guilty of sedition by trying to organise a national conference to call for change.View image in fullscreenDemonstrations at the beginning of the year roiled the country and triggered an unprecedented crisis for the regime.Photograph: Getty ImagesThe 1979 commemorations featured state television showing hundreds of thousands of people at pro-government rallies, which included the burning of American flags and cries of “death to America!” Yet the night before, witnesses had heard shouts from people’s homes in the Iranian capital, Tehran, of “Death to the dictator!”Alongside the crowds in the streets, pictures circulated of empty school desks adorned with red roses commemorating children killed in the protests. A teachers’ union said it believed 213 children were killed.Other regime figures used the anniversary of the revolution as an opportunity to reassert their ideological supremacy.Brig gen Aziz Nasirzadeh, the defence minister, hailed the crowds as unique and claimed: “I have never seen such a passionate attendance in any year.”He added: “They have participated in this march with full awareness, and this presence is more powerful than any bomb or missile.”Away from the demonstrations, Iranian diplomats were trying to head off anattempt by Benjamin Netanyahu to toughen Trump’s negotiating stancewith Iran before the Israeli leader’s meeting in the White House with him on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenThe 1979 commemorations featured state television showing hundreds of thousands of people at pro-government rallies.

Tehran is determined that its stockpile of ballistic missiles, regarded as necessary for Iran’s defence, is excluded from the talks. Ali Shamkhani, a representative of the supreme leader, said the missile issue was not something that the negotiators had authority over.In his latest remarks, Trump suggested Iran’s nuclear missiles would have to be included in any agreement.Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, visited Qatar after holding three hours of talks with mediators in Oman on Tuesday. Larijani is trying to craft a response to US demands that will keep within Iran’s red lines but still make the US believe talks are worth continuing.Larijani kept open the possibility of wider talks with US, so long as next week’s talks are confined to guarantees about Iran’s civil nuclear programme.Larijani said: “If the current negotiations with the United States are successful, they can be expanded and extended to other areas as well. However, at the moment, I cannot say definitively whether this path will lead to talks about other disputes with the United States or not.”Explore more on these topicsIranIran nuclear programmeThe Iranian revolutionIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In its World Cup bid, Saudi Arabiapromised to build 11 new stadiumsand renovate four for the 2034 tournament.Arshad died on 12 March 2025, while working on a high platform at Aramco Stadium in the eastern city of Al Khobar. The platform tilted suddenly, and Arshad, who was not secured to it, was thrown to the ground. He later died in hospital, leaving behind his wife and three young sons in Pakistan.Under Saudi law, Arshad’s family are entitled to be paidcompensationfor his death, potentially worth as much as £63,250. They are also entitled to his outstanding salary and end-of-service benefits.His family, who live in the district of Mansehra, about two hours’ drive north of Islamabad, say the only money they have received has come from a voluntary donation from Arshad’s co-workers and stakeholders working on the project, matched funded by Besix.In response to a request to comment, Besix told the Guardian that end-of-service benefits had been transferred to the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation and should be paid shortly once the family had submitted the required documents. The company said it was also in contact with the family and that they were being assisted on completing the necessary documents for the insurance payment – death compensation – to be made.Saudi Arabia’s World Cup bid victory is a crushing defeat for migrant workers’ rights | Pete PattissonRead moreSardar Manzoor, a local politician and friend of Arshad, says the family should not be waiting so long to be compensated. “Arshad was like my brother, so I don’t want his children to suffer.” He says many people from the area go to work in the Gulf. “Two or three from every family. It’s only their remittances that keep the economy afloat.”The family’s lengthy delay appears to show howdifficult it is for families of migrant workers who die in Saudi Arabiato negotiate the bureaucratic process to secure compensation, or even know what they are entitled to.“This terrible case is sadly emblematic of what so many families of migrant workers who die inSaudi Arabiago through. It shows the enormous hurdles that they face in attempting to secure the compensation they are legally due in cases of workplace accidents,” said James Lynch, a director of human rights group FairSquare.Human rights groups havepreviously highlightedthe “long and burdensome” process families faced to get compensation and have documented a number of cases where families received little or no compensation.Lynch urged Fifa to publicly demand compensation for the families of workers who have died on projects linked to the tournament, saying: “Fifa has recklessly awarded the World Cup to Saudi Arabia after a sham human rights assessment process. That means they cannot escape their responsibility for the massive construction programme that will result.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomWorkers' rightsFifaWorld Cup 2034Saudi ArabiaMiddle East and north AfricaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not initially clear when the new rules would come into effect but they require no further approval.“We will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state,” Katz said in a joint statement with the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.The EU called the measures “another step in the wrong direction” and said sanctions were “still on the table”, including the possible suspension of some parts of the EU-Israel trade agreement.A joint statement by a group of Arab and Islamic states, which will be central to Donald Trump’s hopes of implementinga peace plan in Gaza, said they “condemned in the strongest terms the illegal Israeli decisions and measures aimed at imposing unlawful Israeli sovereignty”.The signatories – including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Turkey – said the new measures would “inflame violence, deepen the conflict and endanger regional stability and security”.The UK said it “strongly condemns” the Israeli measures. “Any unilateral attempt to alter the geographic or demographic makeup of Palestine is wholly unacceptable and would be inconsistent with international law,” a UK statement said. “We call on Israel to reverse these decisions immediately.”The Australian government, which ishosting a visit by the Israeli president Isaac Herzog,also joined the global condemnation. “Australia objects to the Israel security cabinet’s decision to expand Israel’s control over the West Bank. This decision will undermine stability and security,” the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement. “The Australian government has been clear that settlements are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace. Altering the demographic composition of Palestine is unacceptable.“A two-state solution remains the only viable path to long-term peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”‘A violation of our history’: Palestinian uproar over Israel’s plan to seize historic West Bank siteRead moreThe outrage at the Israeli measures came on the eve of a planned White House meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Donald Trump on Wednesday. The administration made no formal comment, but a White House official issued a statement to reporters indicating its opposition.“President Trump has clearly stated that he does not support Israel annexing theWest Bank,” the statement said. “A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace in the region.”The new measures are wide ranging and aimed directly at authority and control of territory in the West Bank. They repeal a law dating back to the era of Jordanian rule before 1967, which banned the sale of land to non-Arabs.They also transfer authority over building licences in Hebron from the Palestinian-run municipality to the Israeli civil administration, the army’s occupation authority in the territory. The transfer could violate a 1997 Hebron protocol, which divided the city into two sectors.The Jewish settlement around Rachel’s Tomb in Bethlehem is also transferred from Palestinian governance to direct Israeli control.The Palestinian Authority’s control over its designated parts of the West Bank has beenseverely weakened over past decadesby lack of money, aggressive Israeli obstruction and settlement-building, as well as its own corruption. It issued a statement in its capital in Ramallah warning that the new Israeli measures were aimed at “deepening attempts to annex the occupied West Bank”.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestineIsraelTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The first free and fair elections in 17 years have been promised for Thursday, after the toppling of the regime of Sheikh Hasina in a bloody student-led uprising in August 2024 in which more than 1,000 people died.Opposition figures long persecuted and jailed are now running as candidates, freely holding rallies for the first time in years. The former prime minister islanguishing in exile in Indiaand facinga death sentencefor crimes against humanity in Bangladesh, and her Awami League party is banned from contesting the election.Women marched in Dhaka at midnightYet for swathes of women in the country, including those who were at the forefront of the revolution, the hope of the election has become tinged with disappointment and fear, amid a resurgence of regressive Islamist politics that it is feared will impinge upon women’s rights and a dearth of female candidates in the running.“This was meant to be an election representing change and reform. Instead, we are seeing women being systematically erased and their rights threatened,” said Sabiha Sharmin, 25, as she took part in the midnight march. “We worry this election will throw the country back 100 years.”Among the most oppressed political movements of the Hasina era, when elections were rigged and opponents persecuted, was Jamaat e-Islami, an Islamist party that believes in bringing sharia law to Bangladesh. It was banned and its leaders jailed, disappeared or sentenced to death.Since Hasina’s fall, Jamaat e-Islami has mobilised with unprecedented gusto, positioning itself as a rival to the veteran Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) that was previously expected to make a clean sweep of the elections.Limited polling still suggests BNP will win the election but it appears as if Jamaat e-Islami will earn a historic share of the vote and be a significant force after the election. “Whether it’s as a sizeable opposition or a government in power, the future of Bangladesh’s politics looks like a heavily Islamist party will be at its centre,” said Thomas Kean, Crisis Group’s senior consultant on Bangladesh.View image in fullscreenPeople board an overcrowded train in Dhaka to travel home to vote in the national election.Photograph: Fatima Tuj Johora/ReutersCritics say the resurgence of conservative Islamist politics has already begun to seep into society. In rural areas, girls were prevented from playing football by religious leaders who termed it indecent, and women have reported mounting harassment if they do not cover their hair or dress modestly.While Jamaat e-Islami has put forward a manifesto focusing on reform, women’s safety from harassment and clean politics, the party is not running a single female candidate. Rhetoric from the party’s leader, Shafiqur Rahman, has had a chilling effect.In an incendiary interview with Al Jazeera, he said a woman could never lead the party as it was un-Islamic. Comments he made last year then resurfaced, denying the existence of marital rape and describing rape as “immoral women and men coming together outside marriage”.“These are the kinds of views and policies you hear in Iran and Afghanistan,” said Zayba Tahzeeb, 21, a physics student who attended the Dhaka midnight march. “Women’s sovereignty, our freedoms, our independence: all are at stake in this election.”View image in fullscreenTaslima Akhter (fourth from right) of the Ganosamhati Andolon party at a campaign rally in Dhaka.Photograph: Munir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty ImagesAmong the policies proposed by the party is reducing women’s working hours from eight hours to five, with the government subsidising the lost income, so women can spend more time at home. Women make up 44% of the country’s workforce, according to the International Labour Organization, the highest proportion in south Asia, and paid work is a right fiercely guarded by women across economic strata.The sense of frustration grew after the National Citizen party (NCP), which wasformed by the student leaderswho toppled Hasina and positioned itself as the party of progress, announced in December it would join the Jamaat e-Islami alliance in the election. The party that had forged itself as a political alternative with women at the forefront is now fielding just two female candidates.Tajnuva Jabeen, a doctor and founder member of NCP, was one of a wave of women who left after the Jamaat e-Islami alliance was announced – a decision made without consultation by a few select men at the top of the party.“It was such a clear betrayal,” Jabeen said. “This was a historic opportunity to create a third political force, to represent the change that so many people died for in the July uprising. Instead, they failed the people and silenced the women who led this movement. I’m sorry to say, this election will not represent the spirit of the revolution.”She emphasised the failures towards women in this election were not Jamaat e-Islami and NCP’s alone – less than 5% of the BNP’s candidates are women.Bangladesh, which is 91% Muslim, has had a chequered history with secularism since its independence from Pakistan in 1971. Religion-based politics were outlawed on the country’s formation but dominant during military rule after 1975, before secularism was restored to the constitution in 2011.Analysts emphasise that many now supporting Jamaat e-Islami are simply disenchanted with the political old guard. Since 1971, the country has swung between two parties, Awami League and the BNP, both of which have been accused of indulging in dynastic politics and rampant corruption.View image in fullscreenJamaat-e-Islami’s leader, Shafiqur Rahman, centre, and colleagues at an election rally in Dhaka.Photograph: Anupam Nath/APJamaat e-Islami appears particularly popular among young, first-time voters, who make up 42% of the electorate and are hungry for change. The authoritarian nature of Hasina’s regime somewhat discredited secularism and made voters more open to Islamist politics this time around, say analysts.One of the fresh faces of Jamaat e-Islami is Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem Arman, a barrister up for election in Dhaka. The son of an executed Jamaat e-Islami leader, he was abducted under the Hasina regime and spent eight years imprisoned and tortured in one of her notorious underground facilities. He emerged from his cell the day after Hasina was toppled, initially believing he was being dragged out to finally be executed.“It was systematic torture for eight years, worse than death,” he said, his voice breaking. “It felt like I was buried alive. But God gave me a second life. I am here to represent all those who were taken to the dark cells and never came out.”Pushing a message of reform and anti-corruption, he insisted the fears of women towards his party were unfounded and part of a political smear campaign.“When you talk to urban elites, their talking points are whether women can be in the top position of the government, whether women can wear whatever they want,” Arman said. “These are – I’m sorry to use the word – feminist demands. The ground level is very different. The primary requirement of the women on the ground, the working class, is safety and that’s our prime concern.“Maybe in the near future you will see women running on our ticket too,” he added.Female supporters of Jamaat e-Islami take part in a march in DhakaIn an attempt to demonstrate the party’s commitment to women, thousands of female Jamaat e-Islami supporters took to the streets of Arman’s constituency in Dhaka to deny that the party would restrict their freedoms.“The policies they are proposing will improve women’s lives and their safety,” said Sirajim Munira, 27. “I think it will be good for the country to bring in Islamic law because it will make us honest and corruption-free.”Ainum Nahar, 58, said Jamaat’s grassroots were driven by women. “Jamaat empowers us,” she said. Yet she agreed that women should never head the party. “As an Islamic party, it is prohibited for women to be leaders,” Nahar said. “But we will stand behind, to inspire them, to encourage them and to move the country forward.”Explore more on these topicsBangladeshSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A 13-year-old boy is thought to be a former pupil who disguised himself in the correct uniform to carry out the attack.Police will refer every child knife possession case to youth justice services – locally led teams spanning health, education and community services tasked with mandating targeted action to help each child.They could also could be forced to attend mentoring to stay in education or social skills training to boost employability, officials said.The aim is to address the root causes of a child’s offending, including potential exploitation by criminal gangs and childhood trauma.Officials claim such a policy will give children the foundations they need to turn their backs on crime and keep our streets safe, and is part of the government’s commitment to halve knife crime within a decade.These plans will be mandatory, with no child able to avoid the getting the support they need, it is claimed. Failure to engage will have serious consequences, such as possible criminal charges and time behind bars.Lammy said: “With early targeted action, we can put children on the right path to a positive future and stop them falling into a toxic cycle of reoffending.“Our reforms will give local services the security they need to help more young people and make our streets safer for everyone.”The plans announced today will be backed up with a first-of-its-kind three-year wider funding package for youth justice services, worth more than £320m.In Brent, DCS Helen Flanagan, of counter-terrorism policing London, said the victims were in a stable condition in hospital, and their wounds – although serious – are “thankfully not life-threatening”.Police said the suspect fled the scene and was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.Investigators are analysing the suspect’s devices and going through dozens of witness accounts as they try to establish the motive for the attack.Explore more on these topicsKnife crimeYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

If the candidate mentioned in the media is the one, in my view, the due diligence has some way still to go.”If Starmer’s prospective top civil servant really is the ‘queen of woke’, let’s agree that word has lost all meaning | Zoe WilliamsRead moreNo 10 was preparing to confirm earlier on Wednesday that Wormald would depart his job as cabinet secretary after just a year in the job – but the announcement was delayed.Multiple government sources said a new cabinet secretary would not be announced at the same time and the role would be split between officials on an acting basis in the interim. They also said it was not a “done deal” that Romeo would get the cabinet secretary job, despite her having previously been found to be an appointable candidate a year ago.Romeo, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, has been widely considered to be the frontrunner after she was on the shortlist for the job last time. The other candidates include Tamara Finkelstein, who has now left the civil service, and Olly Robbins at the Foreign Office, who was at the top of the department when Peter Mandelson was appointed as US ambassador.Romeo is viewed as a dynamic official outside the traditional civil service mould, in contrast to Wormald, who is being forced out partly over concerns he is not the right person to drive reform in Whitehall.She won support within the civil service for her warning to Dominic Raab, then justice secretary, over behaviour that led to his being found to have engaged in bullying conduct towards officials. She has also impressed Shabana Mahmood at the Home Office.However, Romeo has also faced questions about her spending while consul general in New York in 2017, working under McDonald at the Foreign Office. A subsequent Cabinet Office investigation cleared her of any wrongdoing.Asked about this on Channel 4, McDonald said he would like to discuss this with No 10 through its vetting process.Top civil servant could become third key No 10 departure in daysRead moreA government source said: “There is absolutely no basis for this criticism.“Antonia Romeo is a highly respected permanent secretary with a 25-year record of excellent public service. The allegations all come from a single grievance made some time ago by a former employee. All the allegations were dismissed on the basis there was no case to answer.”A Cabinet Office spokesperson declined to comment on speculation about the departure of Wormald and possible promotion of Romeo to cabinet secretary.Explore more on these topicsLabourCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t believe they can achieve the same financial success as previous generations, so they’re refocusing on their goals.”In middle school, Ho sold sketches to classmates for candy money long before he enrolled in art school. What began as pocket change has now become a crucial source of supplementary income.“I love how art can evoke emotion in people and share a story,” he said. “Compared to my retail job, my side hustle gives me a sense of accomplishment. It’s more challenging, creative and mentally stimulating and I can have a real impact.”‘The job market is cooked’The money Ho receives for his illustrations helps cover everyday expenses in New York City, where the annual cost of living – including housing, bills and food expenses – approaches $64,000,accordingto the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.Many young Americans are no longer prepared to “rely on a single job for financial security and career growth” as they grapple with an increasingly rocky economy, said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor. “All the traditional pathways to success, like going to college and securing a steady white-collar job, haven’t borne out, and now they are left with debt and a tough job market.”The tech industry has been particularly vulnerable to layoffs in recent years, as AI rapidly reshapes the sector. More than 150,000 jobs werecut across550 companies last year.Doshi’s side hustles are her safety net if the next wave hits her. “The job market is cooked,” she said. “You might have a job today, but tomorrow you might be laid off. Side hustles are about security and control, in such an unpredictable economy. It feels safer than just relying on one employer.”Yeong Yuh Lee, 23, a freelance illustrator in New York, was recently let go from her full-time job. Without side hustles, she would have been without income. She was previously an artist for an animation company and, in her spare time, commissions graphics for content creators.“I don’t know what I would’ve done if I didn’t hustle for clients outside of my in-studio job,” said Lee. “Right now I am living off of my side hustle, while trying to find a new job. But it’s already been six months and no luck.”Generative AI cratered the art job market, offering illustrations at afractionof human artists’ rates. Like Lee, Ho is struggling to find stable in-house studio positions.“With AI, combined with theincreasinglack of funding for the arts, and being a recent graduate, I just couldn’t break into the industry at all,” said Ho. “The industry is slowlydecliningso I had no choice but to fall into retail as my day job and just side-hustle my art.”‘I am never off the clock’But working on these gigs alongside day jobs has its costs. Ho doesn’t have much down time. When he clocks off at the store, he clocks into his side gig, opening his computer and beginning cold outreach to find potential clients, or posting new pieces on social media in a bid to boost his exposure.“In a sense, I am never off the clock,” he said. “It does get tiring, I do admit, but at the end of the day it’s like I got to do what I got to do. I just love drawing so much that I cannot imagine not doing it no matter how tired or exhausted I may be.”When Doshi tried splitting her time evenly among her roles, she felt drained and burnt out as if “fighting demons”, she said, before she focused on managing her energy levels. Her 9-5 role at Google eats her “peak focus energy”, she said, “and I work best with content creation and podcasting when my mind is relaxed, and feeling more creative”.Zhao, of Glassdoor, believes employers should embrace their employees’ side hustles, provided there is no conflict of interest. A “happy workforce is ultimately an engaged workforce”, he said, predicting that more young workers will pick up jobs on the side as time goes on.“Side hustles are here to stay, especially for younger workers,” Zhao added. “They are motivated, have the will to learn, the grit to be scrappy, and these are all characteristics that are really important for a workforce.”As more workers juggle multiple jobs, Valentino cautioned that corporate America faces a reckoning.“There’s going to be a big gap in the workforce in the next 10 years,” he said. “The onus is on corporate employers to figure out how to attract young people into jobs where they feel passionate, where there’s a mission and a sense of purpose, where there’s flexibility.”This fundamental shift may be irreversible, Valentino added. “The barriers to entry for starting something … are the lowest they’ve ever been,” he said. “I do see there being a change in terms of what we define as a ‘career’ moving forward.”Explore more on these topicsUS work & careersYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Economistspredicted70,000 in job gains and an unchanged unemployment rate for January.The gains are still 13,000 jobsless than the the143,000 jobsadded a year ago in January 2025, but morethan double the 50,000 jobs that were added in December.Despite January’s boost to the labor market, the report also included revisions to the total number of new jobs in 2025. After revisions, total new jobs for the year was 181,000, down from an initially reported 584,000 jobs, marking the weakest year of job growth since the Covid-19 pandemic. In comparison, 2m jobs were added to the economy in 2024.a chart showing monthly changes in US jobs from October 2024 to January 2026The report comes after a tumultuous year for theUS economy, with constantly changing trade and immigration policies marring the labor market with instability.The jobs report, originally scheduled for release on 6 February, was alsodelayedby the Bureau of Labor Statistics due to the brief government shutdown in early February.Donald Trump celebrated the new job figures, posting on social media: “Just in: GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED!”“WOW! The Golden Age of America is upon us!!!” he wrote.In advance of the report, private payroll grew byonly 22,000 jobsin January, below economists’ expectations of 45,000 jobs. Last year, private payrolls gained140,000 jobsduring the same period.US employersannounced108,435 layoffs in January 2026, according tooutplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, up 118% from January 2025 and the highest to start a year since 2009.Job openings in the US dropped in December 2025 by 386,000 jobs to 6.542m, the lowest level since September 2020, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (Jolts)reportreleased last week.On Tuesday, the White House adviser Peter Navarrowarnedagainst high expectations for the monthly jobs number, claiming that new jobs would be in the 50,000 range.“We have to revise our expectations down significantly for what a monthly job number should look like,” Navarro told Fox News.Job figures during the Biden administration were actually inflated because “we were letting in 2 million illegal aliens”, but “all of the jobs that we were creating in Biden years were going to illegals”, he saidThe weakening labor market has not been slow enough to inspire the USFederal Reserveto slash interest rates as US inflation also remains unstable.Last month, economists at the banksaidthe unemployment rate leveling at 4.4% was a possible sign of stability in the labor market, though job gains have been low. Slowed job growth comes from new immigration policies and labor force participation, Powell added, as well as tempered demand for labor.The central bank is also being cautious about increasing prices. US inflation was 2.7% inDecember, and Powell said the effects of tariffs are still flowing through prices.Higher prices have continued to affect consumer sentiment: according to theUniversity of Michigan’s survey of consumers, sentiment was 57.3 in February, a lift up from over the past six months but more than 11% lower than the same period in 2025.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataUS economyFederal ReserveInflationnewsShareReuse this content"

But he said he did not want to “look backwards and litigate the past”.“The company has been a mess in lots of ways for a long time, but I’m confident stars are aligning in a positive way,” he said.Murray said Post leadership used data on readership trends to determine which areas to cut. The publication’s sports, international, local and style sections were particularly hard-hit. “I’m sure we got some things wrong, but if I look around the room with everybody here, I know we got a lot of things right,” he said.While the Post achieved historic success during the first Trump administration, as reporters broke scoops and readers signed up in droves to support the publication’s mission, Murray said there was “no more Trump bump” these days.“People are reading [about] Donald Trump, but they also want to escape from Donald Trump,” he said.Amid questions about whether the publication’s mandate and ambition had shrunk, Murray said “the mission of the Post is unchanged”.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

It can’t be any other way.”Murray faced tough questions from some longtime employees who expressed skepticism about the Post’s direction.“I’ve not seen this place as demoralized as it is right now,” said one veteran reporter, who asked why employees should continue to believe in management. “I can’t tell you to believe in me or believe in Jeff or believe in other Jeff,” Murray responded, acknowledging it was an “essential question”.“We’re here, we’re talking, and I have an incredible amount of faith in the masthead team,” he added.“How are we possibly supposed to move forward when we are demonstrating to the people we are begging to give us their money every day that we can’t even do the basics any more?” another reporter asked, mentioning errors in the print product since the cuts happened.During the town hall, Murray did not say much about Lewis’s sudden exit after only two years on the job.But when asked about accountability for executives who have contributed to the Post’s financial challenges, Murray noted: “We have a new CEO.

The total number of union elections fell from a 10-year high of 2,124 in 2024 to 1,498 in 2025.The success rate in union elections also dropped to 69.8% in 2025, after rising to 72% in 2023.The NLRB presides over enforcing labor law in the private sector, including conducting union elections and enforcing theNational Labor Relations Act. Workers file to hold an election with the NLRB once they have agreed to form a union but their employer doesn’t voluntarily recognize it.Since the start of his second term, Trump has made unprecedented moves tofreezethe board.Days after taking office, TrumpfiredNLRB board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board without a quorum needed to make decisions. When Trump eventually restored a quorum, heappointedtwo Republicans to fill the vacant seats, creating a conservative majority.Though the NLRB was created to protect workers’ rights and rule on disputes, the political makeup of the board dictates how friendly it will be to either organizers or their employers.The agency also lostabout 100 employeesdue to early retirements and resignation buyouts pushed by Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, leaving roughly 1,100 workers to oversee collective bargaining and labor practices in the private sector. In comparison, 1,545 employees worked at the agency in 2016.The NLRB workforce declined during Trump’s first term, though the private sector workforce grew from120 millionin 2016 tomore than 135 millionin 2024.

Van den Brink, who will step down in May, had been under pressure to increase Heineken’s growth and productivity, with fewer resources, after investors accused the company of becoming less efficient.Heineken said the job cuts were aimed at “accelerating productivity at scale to unlock significant savings”.The company has forecast slower profit growth of between 2% and 6% this year, compared with the 4-8% growth it predicted in 2025.It came as Heineken reported a 1.2% fall in total beer volumes last year compared with 2024, at a time when the company and its rivals are fighting declining beer sales, particularly inEuropeand North America.Squeezed household finances have played a role, while some consumers are drinking less alcohol because of health concerns and others have cut back after changing their diet and lifestyle whiletaking weight-loss drugssuch as Mounjaro and Wegovy.Heineken shares rose by as much as 4% in Amsterdam, taking them to their highest level in more than six months.“Heineken’s investors have welcomed the job cut guidance, pushing up the share price on news that more costs will be coming out of the business,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at the broker AJ Bell.“Whoever becomes Heineken’s new CEO will walk into the top job with many difficult decisions having already been made. There is no news on who will replace Dolf van den Brink when he leaves in May, but the pressure is on to find a new leader fast, and one who can breathe new life into the beer giant.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryBeerJob lossesNetherlandsEuropeAnnual resultsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Elliottbuilt a stake in BPworth almost £3.8bn, or 5% of its shares, in early 2025, becoming the oil company’s third-largest shareholder.BP’s chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, wasousted in Decemberafter less than two years in the job, after pressure from Elliott, which also led a successful campaign against the oil company’schair, Helge Lund, earlier in 2025.Elliott typically takes stakes in companies that it believes have lost value because of mismanagement, and demands changes that can improve their market value. It has previouslyagitated for a shake-up at the drugmaker GSKand the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey.The feared New York hedge fund is also the owner of the combinedWaterstonesand Barnes & Noble bookstore chains and is reportedlypreparing to list them on the stock market. Elliott is thought to prefer London over New York for a listing, which would be seen as a welcome boost to the UK stock market.There was a pickup in the rate of businesseschoosing to list in Londonin the second half of 2025, although concerns remain that takeovers and delistings have reduced the number of the UK’s public companies.Elliott declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsLondon Stock ExchangeHedge fundsnewsShareReuse this content"

Wambach is the first figure of note from the sports world to publicly depart.“I read Casey Wasserman’s correspondences in the Epstein files. I know what I know, and I am following my gut and my values,” Wambach wrote on Instagram. “I will not participate in any business arrangement under his leadership. I also need to say this: I’m grateful to my agent, who I’ve known for almost 20 years and trust.“Casey should resign. He should leave, so more people like me don’t have to. I am unclear of my next steps. That’s OK with me, I just know where I can’t be.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

She retired from professional soccer in 2015 after a 15-year career during which she scored 184 international goals, the second most all-time. She has since written two books and hosts a podcast with her wife, Glennon Doyle.Documents released last month by the US government included flirtatious email exchanges between Wasserman and Maxwell in 2003.Wasserman released an apology on 31 January, saying: “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said occurred “long before her horrific crimes came to light”.“I never had a personal or business relationship withJeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them,” he said.Maxwell was charged with conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse teenage girls and was convicted in 2021 on five counts of sex trafficking and abuse of minors. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein’s death in a New York jail cell in 2019 was ruled a suicide and came a month after he was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges.Wasserman has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing by any of Epstein’s victims, but he has faced calls to step down from his CEO post at the agency and as LA Olympics chair.The LA28 Olympics executive committee met Wednesday to discuss Wasserman’s status. It announced its support for its chair and said he should continue in his role.The committee hired outside counsel to review his interactions with Epstein and Maxwell and found that his relationship with them “did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented,” according to a statement provided to the Guardian.“Twenty-three years ago, before Mr. Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell’s deplorable crimes, Mr. Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein’s plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation. This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell,” the statement read.Wasserman “fully cooperated” with the review. The executive committee determined he “should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful Games”.Wasserman’s website says its soccer clientele includes US women’s national team stars Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson and Naomi Girma, along with the now-retired Alex Morgan. During the 2019 World Cup, the agencyrepresentedmore than half of the winning US team.On the men’s side, its roster includes US star Weston McKennie, Real Madrid’s Fede Valverde and Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher.The agency also represents top players in the NFL, NBA, WNBA and MLB, along with actors such as Brad Pitt and Adam Sandler.Dani Anguiano contributed reporting.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsUSA women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

He also faces a charge of tampering with or fabricating evidence. Lee is due back in court for a preliminary hearing on 9 March.Authorities identified the victim in the case as Gabriella Perpétuo. The couple had been living in a home they rented where the incident occurred for about 10 days, Brian Lockhart a detective in Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office testified on Wednesday.Former Super Bowl champion Darron Lee charged with girlfriend’s murderRead moreLockhart said he was present during the autopsy and learned the potential manner of death is blunt force trauma homicide, though an autopsy report has not been released yet.According to an arrest affidavit, on 5 February first responders went to a home in the Chattanooga suburb of Ooltewah for a call of CPR in progress, where they found the woman already deceased.Lee told deputies that the woman may have fallen in the shower, but according to the affidavit, there were extensive amounts of blood in different areas of the residence that were inconsistent with Lee’s statement.Authorities carrying out a search warrant found evidence of trauma to the woman’s body, including a stab wound to her abdomen, an apparent bite mark on her shoulder, a large bruise on her head, black eyes with heavy swelling, and dried blood on her face and neck, the affidavit said.Lockhart testified that she also had a severe brain injury and a broken neck. She had more stab wounds on her legs. Her pants were unmarked, suggesting they were put on after the injuries were sustained, Hamilton County district attorney Coty Wamp said.The affidavit said Lee had a facial injury, lacerations on his hands, wounds on his chest and blood inside the case of his cellphone. Crime scene detectives also identified blood that had been attempted to be cleaned in multiple areas of the house, in addition to cleaning supplies near where testing confirmed blood stains but no blood was visible, the affidavit said.Wamp said the case is eligible for capital punishment, but prosecutors have not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty.“Mr Lee was in a home with a female that was, for lack of a better term, beaten to death,” Wamp said in court, arguing for the judge to withhold bond. “And the explanation that he gave doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.”Wamp said Lee, 31, was on probation in Florida for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in one county and battery in another, and on probation in Ohio for attempted batteries.Lee was represented at the hearing by deputy public defender Mike Little, who said in court that bond is often set for homicide or first-degree murder defendants, including those with prior felonies. Little said it is too early in the case for him to be making any statements.Lee was one of the best college players in the country during his time at Ohio State, and the Jets selected him with the 20th overall pick in the 2016NFLdraft. The Jets signed him to a four-year contract that included $7.9m guaranteed but he left the team in 2019 after disciplinary problems and poor play.Lee was a part of theKansas City Chiefsroster that won the Super Bowl in February 2020, although he did not play in the game itself. His final NFL appearance came in November 2020 for the Buffalo Bills.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsTennessee TitansUS sportsUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

On ­Sunday,they defeated Liverpoolat Anfield, on Wednesday they downed ­Fulham at home to reel off a 20th consecutive victory against them.The rosiest moment for the title challengers was Erling Haaland’s 39th‑minute strike, a first in the competition from open play in nine games, though more con­cerning was his removal at the break, when City led 3-0.Virgil van Dijk rises to occasion as Liverpool end Sunderland recordRead more“Niggles,” Pep Guardiola said. “Fatigue. He said: ‘I don’t feel comfortable.’ With 3-0 and a lot of games and having Omar [Marmoush] – common sense to take him off.”The clean sheet raises City’s goal difference to +30, two behind Arsenal. Who knows: the metric may prove the decider when the crown is handed out in May. Guardiola, though, refused to embrace City being three points behind the Gunners.“We are not three points before they play Brentford, after that we’ll see,” he said. “It’s more important how we can be more consistent over 90 minutes. But a really good performance, one of the best. After Anfield it is important – these emotional games – the next one is always tricky.”You had to go back to April 2009 for the last timeFulhamdefeated City when a Clint Dempsey double helped them to secure a 3-1 win here. Since then, the aggregate score was 53‑21 to the home team – a terrible statistic for the visitors that would plunge further.Phil Foden, back in the league XI for the first time in five games, had a volley from outside the area deflected. Then, from inside, saw a shot saved by Bernd Leno.In continual rain, Marco Silva bemoaned Harry Wilson going backwards along the right, but a press ­featuring Antoine Semenyo, ­Haaland, Nico O’Reilly, Foden and Rodri meant he had scant other choice.Semenyo opened the scoring when Rodri sprayed a pass left to Matheus Nunes, he crossed, and Haaland leaped and missed, which caused Sander Berge to head towards his goal, where the forward struck for a fifth in eighth appearances.Next came Kenny Tete pulling Semenyo’s hair as City crowded ­Fulham’s area. “I went to attack the corner and I just felt a tug on my hair, I let the referee know,” ­Semenyo said. “They checked it and said there wasn’t enough.”View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo slides home Manchester City’s first goal against Fulham.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesFulham’s concession of O’Reilly’s second came when Haaland stretched to feed him near halfway and was taken down by Joachim Andersen. O’Reilly found Semenyo, carried on along the left, took the return and defeated Leno. City celebrated and Andersen was booked by Paul ­Tierney for the challenge.Fulham needed to steady themselves, but failed as Haaland scored. Receiving from Foden near the D a touch tipped the ball on to his left and he drilled beyond Leno.After a misplaced Marc Guéhi header allowed Wilson to feed Emile Smith Rowe, who narrowly missed, Guardiola ended the period jumping at his side’s laxness.In the reverse, helter-skelter ­fixture, City were 4-1 up by 48 ­minutes and ended hanging on fora 5-4 win. Could Fulham engineer something similar? No, was the answer despite there being no Haaland to contend with for the second half.City popped the ball about but Guardiola was no happier, so Tijjani Reijnders and Abdukodir ­Khusanov entered for Bernardo Silva and Nunes, as Silva made a triple change – Kevin, Rodrigo Muniz and Josh King for Samuel Chukwueze, Smith Rowe and Raul Jiménez.When Rodri, Guéhi and ­Khusanov combined near their goal ­suddenly City were upfield and Foden could release Semenyo: the move ­faltered but the flow here was City in their best mode.A Foden challenge on Calvin ­Bassey had him booked as City sought to slow the contest and protect the lead. Helpful, too, was a Wilson corner – a rarity for Fulham – he overhit all the way over to the left.By 70 minutes Rayan Cherki and Nico González were involved, as ­Guardiola freshened the legs more – Rodri and Foden making way – this after Donnarumma repelled, low, a Muniz effort.As the game petered out, Donnarumma tipped over from King, but with 12 games left City are where Guardiola wants them: in the hunt.Silva said: “Not good enough from us, we were not at the level and the demands of a game like this one. We didn’t play in the way we are capable of playing.”They were, in fact, very far off what was required.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The International Olympic Committee only recognises independent sovereign states and, as all the world, even the most distant corners of the US, now knows, Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. But the flag, which is known as theErfalasorput, was there in the grandstands at the Anterselva Biathlon Arena all the same, even if it wasn’t flying from rooftops above it. It was being waved by all the Danish fans who wanted to show their support for the only two Greenlandic athletes competing here at Milano Cortina.Their names are Ukaleq Slettemark and Sondre Slettemark, brother and sister, and both biathletes. They were born in Nuuk, and raised between Greenland and Norway where their parents, who are also biathletes, took them to learn the sport when they were children. For the past four weeks, the Slettemark siblings have been caught in the middle of a whirlwind of media attention. There aren’t many famous people from Greenland, Ukaleq explains, in what is perhaps the 20th interview she has had to do after she finished 52nd in the women’s 15km event.Winter Olympics 2026: Von Allmen’s hat-trick, GB eye first medal, ice hockey, and more– liveRead more“So of course, if there’s only one Greenlandic person everyone knows, I’m happy to defend my country and show people who we are and where we are on the map,” she said.There was a small band of six Greenlanders there to cheer them on, including Nivi Olsen, the minister for sport, culture, education and church. The world’s attention might have started to move on from this crisis. But of course, as Olsen says, the Greenlanders still live with the fear and uncertainty caused byDonald Trump’s grand plans for their island. Everyone in Nuuk would be watching the Slettemarks race anyway, she says, but their participation in the Games has become especially important this year, as a symbol of what Greenlanders are capable of.“Life is very difficult in Greenland,” Olsen said. “People are afraid. I think that Trump is crazy. I know it is a tough thing to say, but you can’t buy people, you can’t buy a country, there are people who live in Greenland, Greenland is our home, so we can’t understand Trump, we can’t understand how he can do what he does. But also we have hope. I can see the hope in people. And we stand together. And we fight together for our country.”View image in fullscreenUkaleq Slettemark crosses the line to finish 52nd in the women’s 15km biathlon.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianUkalek, who is only 24, has taken brilliantly to her role as an unofficial ambassador. She was wearing seal-skin gloves, made in Greenland, and Olsen also presented her with a pair of seal-skin slippers as a prize for her performance in the Games. “I chose them because I was worried she would be cold,” Olsen said.She was also wearing a bespoke ski-suit that she and Sondre had designed together. “It’s deeply inspired by Greenlandic culture, so it has the northern lights, it has these amulets that are inspired by the female tattoos calledkakiorneq, and it has a pattern that’s a mix of the Greenlandic flag and the biathlon targets.”They had the help of the Danish Olympic Committee to do it. “Honestly, I feel like everything that happened has brought us all closer together, especially from the Danish side,” she says. “We feel a lot more support. We feel people are getting more educated about Greenland and are actually interested in the wellbeing of Greenlanders. And also they are starting to see that Greenland is really very important strategically.”View image in fullscreenUkaleq Slettemark competes in her bespoke ski-suit which was deeply inspired by Greenlandic culture.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianFor years, Greenlanders have fought to win recognition from the IOC. They send their own teams to compete in the Island Games and the Arctic Winter Games. The issue has been raised repeatedly in the Danish parliament. But right now, Slettemark says, she is proud to be representing both countries.“You know, if we were going to compete for the Greenlandic flag here, we would have to become an independent nation and that’s such a big question. I think it’s every Greenlander’s dream to become independent far in the future. But right now, I’m very happy to be racing for the Commonwealth.“I mean, I feel like I still represent Greenland here.

Takes on roster building, on relevance, on playoff potential. And, of course, on kits.It at times feels like there is nothing soccer fans across the globe like more than discussing kits and kit culture. Supporters, even those entirely bereft of any fashion sense to speak of, start offering up terms normally reserved for the catwalk come release day.In that spirit, I, a man who can barely dress myself, have taken a shot at assembling what I consider to be the five most interestingMLSkits – good and bad – of the 2026 season.A new old look in San JoseView image in fullscreenThe San Jose Earthquakes’ Dead Kit.Photograph: MLSSan Jose’s so-called Dead Kit pays homage to one of modern music’s most influential acts, Bay Area legends the Grateful Dead. The colorful, tie-dye design is complimented by the Dead’s logo, along with the band’s wordmark at the rear of the collar.View image in fullscreenLithuanian men’s basketball, the peak of style in 1992.Photograph: Bongarts/Getty ImagesThe design evokes memories of the Grateful Dead’s previous venture into sports design: their partnership with the Lithuanian men’s basketball team at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The cash-strapped team ended up being largely funded by the Dead and sported some Dead-themed, tie-dyed warmups in return, going on to win a bronze medal.San Jose’s new look can also be read as a completely unintentional throwback to another iconic American soccer look, the infamous denim kit sported by the USMNT at the 1994 World Cup. That jersey, designed by Peter Moore – the same man who designed the first Air Jordan shoe – has long been considered among the most outlandish in the history of the sport – but it was very nearly tie-dye. Moore favored denim but his partner, Nike executive Rob Strasser, pushed hard for tie-dye. It’s a good thing he didn’t win out. As former USMNT legend Marcelo Balboa told me some years ago: “None of us would’ve even taken the field in that uniform. I’m not even kidding. There would’ve been a protest and a half.”Two decades later, things have changed. The USMNT’s own 2024 away kit – dubbed the American Icon Kit – looked a lot like tie-dye. And now, in 2026, the Quakes are thrusting the Bay Area’s flower-power to the forefront.A print gone wrongView image in fullscreenThe Philadelphia Union’s 2026 kit features a print with a variety of elements.Photograph: MLSA few MLS clubs incorporated graphic prints into their kits this year. The Houston Dynamo’s jerseys feature satellite photography of the city in an attempt to evoke a tie-in to the space program, one of the city’s hallmarks. The New York Red Bulls have gone with some sort of Slim Goodbody motif for their Roooted Kit. Their attempt at a homage to the “roots” of their club instead comes off as a viewable circulatory system.Perhaps nobody took the print motif further this year than the Philadelphia Union. Ahead of the American semiquincentennial, the Union’s 1776 Kit pays homage to the city’s vital place in US history. It’s emblazoned with all sorts of stuff: the Declaration of Independence, a portrait of Benjamin Franklin, Independence Hall and the American flag. If that wasn’t enough, it also features the iconic “join or die” colonial snake and the actual number 1776, lest you forget what they’re going for here.Design is subjective, but this thing looks awful. Modern soccer jerseys are more often than not designed to be worn by fans on the street, not players on the pitch, and this thing 100% reads streetwear. It remains to be seen, but I suspect this kit will look positively awful in motion.Philly’s role as the birthplace of the United States sort of required them to do a 1776 kit, but they missed badly here.A print gone rightView image in fullscreenLAFC’s 2026 home kit, featuring an all-over art deco print.Photograph: MLSMaybe the only team that got the all-over print motif right this year is, unsurprisingly, Los Angeles FC. Year after year, they continue to impress.Part of that can be attributed to the club’s colors, a black-and-gold palate that looks timeless in almost any application. This year’s kit – which the ad wizards at LAFC are just calling the 2026 Primary Kit – is no exception, incorporating Los Angeles’ rich art deco heritage. The club tried something similar in 2022, but this iteration buries their previous attempt at evoking classic Hollywood glamour.Like every other MLS kit this year (aside from Montreal’s, mysteriously), the LAFC kit features a unique gimmick: both the Adidas logo and the club’s crest itself are done as lenticular holographs. If you’re unfamiliar with the phrase, think of those “animated” baseball cards you used to see back in the day, where the photograph changes based on the angle of the card. US-based MLS clubs get stars in their crest, while Canadian clubs get leaves. It’s a cool, albeit pointless, gimmick.Another musical collaborationView image in fullscreenSt Louis City SC’s 2026 kit pays homage to Tina Turner.Photograph: MLSMLS has a rapidly expanding history of tying music and kit design together.Seattle, one may say,inventedthe music tie-in kit with their homage to legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix in 2021. Nashville took their own swing a few years later with their Man in Black Kit, a lovely nod to country music icon Johnny Cash. DC United made their own attempt last year with their Soul Kit, which was ostensibly a nod to the District’s Go-Go scene, and San Jose has the aforementioned Dead kit this year.St Louis City SC are taking their own swing at things with their Tina Turner Kit. Born in Memphis, the R&B/soul legend spent many of her formative years in St Louis. The team say it is the first time Adidas has partnered with a female artist on a professional kit, and they seem to have done a decent enough job of getting Turner’s energy into the shirt.The gold, shimmery print is reminiscent of the types of wild, flashy looks Turner wore early in her career – harkening back to her star-making 1970 appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. The jersey features her signature and silhouette to boot. I don’t know how that motif will look on, say, St Louis defensive midfielder Chris Durkin, but I’m eager to find out.DC yawn-itedView image in fullscreenDC United’s 2026 home kit, dubbed the Black and Red Kit.Photograph: MLSMLS has done better over the years to move away from so-called “clean” design, the lazy process that produced a deluge of white T-shirts season after season. Still, a few teams soldier on. Colorado, Vancouver and Charlotte have all phoned it in this year.Maybe no entrant is more bland than DC United’s 2026 kit, which they’re dubbing the Black-and-Red Kit, in case you forgot their colors. The lack of effort here borders on the absurd and is present right down to the design blurb the club supplied alongside the shirt. In a world of verbose, overwrought design explainers that border on the absurd, DC’s explainer is about the length of a haiku and somehow says even less.“The black and red are the pulse of DC United and this kit is a reminder of who we play for when we take the pitch … the fans, the future stars, the legends, and the next generation.”United’s early kits are among the league’s all-time best, and they’ve had some recent hits as well, including the long-awaited Cherry Blossom kit. This effort feels entirely unambitious – a good fit for a club that hasn’t made the playoffs in nearly a decade.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when confirmation finally came, the 21-year-old American could celebrate his first Olympic gold medal – and the opening chapter of what could become one of the defining campaigns of the Milano CortinaWinter Olympics.Skating in the second-to-last group, Stolz powered to an Olympic record time of 1min 6.28sec in the men’s 1000 metres, using a devastating final lap to deliver in his signature event and launch his pursuit of a potential four-gold haul across these Games.His time ultimately stood after a brief period of uncertainty triggered by a late-race judging decision that granted a reskate to Joep Wennemars – whoended Stolz’s two-year world championship reignat the distance last March – after it was ruled that the Dutch skater had been hindered earlier in the competition. The delay forced Stolz, Jenning de Boo and the rest of the field to wait nearly 15 minutes for Wennemars to skate again .At least 90% of the packed arena wore Dutch orange and the rollicking crowd roared “Joep! Joep! Joep!” as Wennemars returned to the ice. Skating alone, he never threatened Stolz’s mark. When he crossed the line more than two seconds off the pace, Stolz could finally celebrate, gliding through a slow victory lap with the US flag held aloft before posing for photos with his longtime coach, Bob Corby.Skating head-to-head with Dutch contender De Boo in the penultimate heat, Stolz did not threaten his own world record of 1:05.37, but comfortably lowered the Olympic mark of 1:07.18, which had stood for nearly a quarter century. His margin over De Boo – half a second – was commanding by 1000m standards, with China’s Ning Zhongyan taking bronze in 1:07.34.“It is not like it is different from any other race,” said Stolz, who finished 14th in the 1000m and 13th in the 500m as a 17-year-old Olympic debutant in Beijing. “It is just the fact you waited the last four years to finally get here again, and you get one shot to try and battle, which I was able to do. Just [a] feeling like no other.”Performing under the weight of dizzying expectations, Stolz responded with the same controlled, clinical skating that has defined his rise over the past three seasons. The race itself unfolded almost exactly along the blueprint that has made him dominant. Stolz opened aggressively but not recklessly, hitting the 200m split in 16.18 seconds – among the fastest early splits of the night – before settling into rhythm through 600m in 40.62.From there, he did what he has done all winter: closed harder than almost anyone in the field. His final lap of 25.66 seconds was among the strongest of the contenders and decisive against De Boo, who led early but faded slightly over the final circuit.De Boo’s intermediate splits underlined how narrow the margins were. The Dutchman was marginally faster early – 16.06 to 200m and 40.25 at 600m – but could not match Stolz’s closing speed, giving up more than three-tenths over the final lap alone.The final standings reflected the depth of the field but also the clarity at the top: Stolz first in 1:06.28, De Boo second in 1:06.78, Ning third, with Poland’s Damian Żurek fourth and Wennemars fifth after the reskate.The reskate itself added an unusual layer to an Olympic final that otherwise followed expected lines. Wennemars, initially timed at 1:07.58 and later granted another attempt under obstruction rules, failed to improve his mark on the second attempt, leaving the podium unchanged.Wennemars cut a devastated figure afterward, saying the collision that led to the reskate had effectively ended his medal chances.“My Olympic dream has been ripped apart. I am heartbroken, this is just horrible,” he said. “I was just racing my own line and then the Chinese guy blocked my road. I was fucked. I do not know what else to say.”He added that being asked to return to the ice so quickly – and to skate alone rather than head-to-head – left him at a clear competitive disadvantage.“The only way to still get a medal was to do the re-skate,” he said. “But in two days’ time nobody will be thinking about this moment, and I will still be without a medal.”For Stolz, the win immediately established him as one of the central figures of these Games and kept alive the possibility of a medal run rarely seen in Winter Olympic history.Stolz entered Milan targeting medals – and potentially gold – in four events: the 500m, 1000m, 1500m and the unpredictable mass start. Were he to complete the sprint treble as he did at two of the past three world championships, Stolz would become only the second American to win more than two golds at a single Winter Games – and the first since fellow speed skater Eric Heiden, whose five-gold sweep in 1980 remains one of the towering individual achievements in all of sport.Stolz has consistently resisted those comparisons.“I try not to think about the pressure too much,” he said earlier this week. “Once you get to the line, it’s the same thing you’ve been doing for years. Everything around you is just noise.”The numbers behind the hype have been difficult to ignore. Stolz entered the race as the world record holder and a two-time world champion at the distance. He was unbeaten in the 1000m on the World Cup circuit this season and has dominated global sprint speed skating since 2023, winning seven of nine possible world titles at the shorter distances over that stretch.The 1000m has historically been Dutch territory – the Netherlands had won the event at the previous three Winter Games – and the Milan field included multiple legitimate threats, including De Boo, Żurek and former Olympic champion Kjeld Nuis.For the United States, any medal would have ended a podium drought stretching back to Vancouver 2010. Instead, Stolz delivered something larger: the first Olympic gold of what could become a defining Games.His rise has followed a trajectory rarely seen in modern winter sport. Raised in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, he learned to skate on a backyard pond before developing at the Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee, emerging as a teenage prodigy with near-perfect natural technique. By 20, he was world all-round champion – the youngest since Heiden.What separates him from many champions is not just speed, but process. Stolz approaches skating like an engineering problem, obsessing over blade curvature, ice density and marginal aerodynamic gains in pursuit of what he calls “free speed”.The Milan venue itself added early-Games uncertainty. Built as a temporary Olympic track after outdoor venue plans were scrapped, the ice surface has produced some of the fastest Olympic times on record – another variable Stolz historically treats as something to solve rather than fear.The win now turns attention to the rest of his Olympic schedule. The 500m follows Saturday, with the 1500m next week and the mass start closing the long-track program. But Wednesday reinforced the same theme that has followed Stolz all winter: if he skates clean, he is extraordinarily difficult to beat.“It’s hard to say you will win four gold medals, if you haven’t even won one yet,” Stolz said. “Now that I’ve won one, I know what to expect. I felt how the crowd is, the energy, the ice. I think it’s going to be good.”Explore more on these topicsJordan StolzSpeed skatingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

She denied the crime for three years, claiming she had been a victim of identity theft, before finally admitting her guilt in a court hearing in Albertville last October after she was found to have photos of the credit card on her phone. “I confess the accusations but I don’t remember committing them,” she said at the time. “It’s like a blackout.”Simon explained at the time that she found her actions “incomprehensible” and that she was “working with a psychologist to understand what happened”. The crimes were committed in 2021, but only came to light later, after Simon had won the first of her 10 world championship titles.View image in fullscreenJustine Braisaz-Bouchet competes in the women’s 15km individual biathlon.Photograph: Martin Metelko/EPABraisaz-Bouchet found herself the target of extreme online abuse in the wake of the scandal. “It has made a lot of people angry,” she said. “The story came out in 2023, after Julia Simon’s great season, and for many people I was the troublemaker.”The French Ski Federation imposed a six-month ban on Simon, but five months of it were suspended meaning she missed one event at the beginning of this season but was still eligible to compete here. She helped the team win the gold medal in the 4x6km mixed relay on Sunday, when she was on the anchor leg.As Simon crossed the finish line she held a finger to her lips, but refused to explain why she had done it. “I put my finger to my mouth, it was for one person and they know who because we had a talk. But I won’t tell any more about it, it’s over.”Simon refused to talk about the conviction, or her ban, or anything except her gold medal. “I’m just focused on my sport, it is the thing I love the most, I had a goal and I put all my energy into it,” she said. “Yes, it was a difficult month, but today was the perfect result for me, it feels like a dream.”View image in fullscreenJulia Simon wipes away tears after she received her gold medal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe affair was the most high-profile of a series of scandals in the sport inFrance. Last year Jeanmonnot revealed she had received death threats from a gambler who was furious about losses linked to her performances, and another of the French team competing at these Games, Jeanne Richard, was briefly excluded from the national squad after she was accused of tampering with a gun belonging to one of her teammates.Biathlon is in the middle of a drive to reform ethical standards after the man who had run the International Biathlon Union for 25 years, Anders Besseberg,resigned in 2018 after he was accused of accepting bribesincluding an Omega watch, several hunting trips, a leased BMW X5, and the services of sex workers in return for protecting Russian interests during the state-sponsored doping scandal.

But the truth is international sport is still important to MoscowWed 11 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 10.06 ESTShareDuma member Vitaly Milonov didn’t mince words when asked four years ago about the international ban against Russian athletes.“There’s no point in humiliating ourselves and begging to be let in,” said the St Petersburg deputy, a member of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party. “We have our pride.” International events had been corrupted by the United States, he claimedin a 2022 interview, just weeks after the International Olympic Committee and other governing bodiesimposed the ban. “Only Russia can say no. Other countries will accept whatever nonsense the Americans force on them – teams of vegans, queers and lesbians.”Some Russian commentators have taken similar stances toward this year’s Milano Cortina Winter Games, asking why their athletes should even bother with the Olympics. The Paris Games were said to be a cesspool of un-Russian immorality – “the Olympics from hell,”one news siteproclaimed. And with the national team still excluded, competition this year will be subpar. “The Olympics have lost their importance as a global competition,” Milonovsaid in January.IOC president gives clearest signal so far that Russia could be at 2028 OlympicsRead moreDisgruntled Duma members can badmouth the Olympics all they want. The fact is the world’s biggest sporting event is still significant for Moscow, not only as a showplace for its top athletes but also as a political tool. As far back as the 1950s, Soviet leaders saw the Olympics and world championships as a means of demonstrating their country’s superiority. Putin has had this same aim throughout his decades in power, especially as his government has struggled to maintain infrastructure, public health and education. As political scientist Nina Kramareva explained to me, “Russia has nothing concrete to offer its own people. It has to give them gold medals.”To get its national team back in the hunt for Olympic medals, Russia must clear two hurdles. First is the ongoing fallout from the doping scandal that broke in 2014. After investigations by the World Anti-Doping Agencyrevealed a massive, state-directed operation, the Moscow testing lab and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) lost international certification. Russian athletes now submit their urine samples to Turkey.The Russians haven’t been entirely aboveboard in their attempts to regain certification. After the Moscow lab reluctantly handed over digital testing records, Wada tech specialistsfound evidenceof more than 20,000 deleted files. The cover-up led to sanctions imposed in 2020, requiring Russian athletes to compete at the Beijing and Tokyo Games under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee rather than the Russian state.In 2025, Russian anti-doping officials made their first appearance at the Wada conference in years, with Rusada chief Veronika Loginova declaring the agencyhad met requirements. The international body, however, states that Rusada is still not in compliance. Loginova is undeterred. Sheannounced her readinessto take over as Wada’s next president.The other hurdle to Russia’s Olympic return is, of course, the war in Ukraine. Within weeks of the February 2022 invasion, the IOC and other governing bodies banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from international competition. The following year, more than 30 nations, led by the UK and including France, Italy, and the US (the hosts of the 2024, 2026 and 2028 Olympics)affirmed their oppositionto Russian and Belarusian participation.Ukrainians angry with IOC after ‘betrayal’ of banning helmet with images of dead athletesRead moreMoscow slammed the ban, saying it brought politics into sport. That charge stung the sportocrats in Switzerland, who hate nothing more than being branded as political. “If politics decides who can take part in a competition, then sport and athletes become tools of politics,”saidIOC President Thomas Bach in March 2023, in response to the UK-led declaration. He offered sympathy to the people of Ukraine. “On the other hand,” he added, “we have, as a global organisation, a responsibility towards human rights and the Olympic Charter.” To Bach and the IOC, this responsibility meant opening a path for Russian and Belarusian athletes.Prior to the Paris Games, the IOC established a procedure enabling individual Russians and Belarusians to compete. Prospective Olympians had to be clean from doping, have no military connections, and have no record of supporting the war. Once approved by a special review panel, Russians and Belarusians were able to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs). (AIN status could not be granted in team sports, as any group of athletes would represent their nation.)In 2024, Moscow denounced the IOC’s concession as no concession at all. According to a sports official, Russian athleteswere expected to“renounce their country’s flag and anthem, their national identity, their civil rights”. Nonetheless, Russia launched a legal barrage to get as many athletes as possible cleared for this year’s Milano Cortina Games. When the AIN review panel rejected the application of cross-country skier Aleksandr Bolshunov, a Russian attorney based in Switzerland appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Bolshunov had won three gold medals in Beijing, and he was a favorite to win more gold in Italy.Infantino and Coventry backing Russia’s return shows sport’s soft power is in rotten hands | Emma JohnRead moreBolshunov’s lawyer argued that his application had been arbitrarily rejected with no explanation. “The athlete has fully complied with all the requirements of the AIN Policy,” the skier’s attorneyinsisted. The appeal made no mention, however, of Bolshunov’s promotion from lieutenant to captain in the Russian national guard after winning in Beijing – “a true inspiration for military personnel”,the guard’s commander said. The appeal likewise didn’t address Bolshunov’spresence on stageat the March 2022 rally at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium in support of the invasion of Ukraine.Bolshunov’s case illustrates the difficulties in bringing Russia back into international sport. The skier is by no means unusual in his military status. Most medals claimed by Russia at both Beijing and Tokyo were won by athletes affiliated with the military and security services. Similarly, Bolshunov is one ofseveral Russian athleteswho have expressed support for Putin and the war.As Bolshunov’s appeal shows, governing bodies shouldn’t expect Moscow to admit any fault in the vague “politics” blocking its athletes, just as there has never been admission of the state-run doping program. Nevertheless, sports federations appear ready to let Russia back in the game. Fifa President Gianni Infantinodeclared last weekthat the ban “has not achieved anything.” The IOC wants Russian and Belarusian athletes tocompete in the 2026 Youth Olympicsunder their national flags. This past November, the head of the Russian Olympic Committee, Mikhail Degtyarev,stated the Milano Cortina Games will be the last Olympicsin which Russians participate as neutrals.In the meantime, officials and former Olympians are calling on Russians to support their Individual Neutral Athletes. Sports mediahave dubbedthe 13 AINs the “Russian team”. As for the athletes who are excluded, they are also proof of Russia’s sporting prowess. After all, it’s not only politics that keeps talents like Aleksandr Bolshunov out of the Games; there is also a conspiracy to prevent the world’s best athletes from rightfully taking gold. As figure skating coach Tatyana Tarasovasaid of the governing bodies: “They wanted to eliminate the competition.”Bruce Berglund is a historian, writer, and editor.

If anything, he leans into it. He has watched himself move from being one of the older riders on the US team to, by some distance, the oldest. He speaks about it with a mix of pride and defiance, often joking that time is the only opponent nobody beats, even if, for now, he feels he is still holding it off.“Some people ask why age always comes up,” he said in New York late last year. “I love it. It’s part of the story. We’re all ageing – it’s coming for all of us. Father Time is the only undefeated opponent, but he hasn’t beaten me yet. Maybe one day. But not today.”Four years ago in Beijing, Baumgartner became the oldest Olympic snowboard medalist at the time when he and Lindsey Jacobelliswon mixed team snowboard cross gold. For many athletes, it would have been the perfect ending. For him, it became something closer to liberation.Winning stripped away the existential pressure that had defined much of his career – years of near-misses, years of fighting simply to stay funded, years of trying to prove he belonged in a sport skewing younger and more technical by the season. Now, he says, the equation is simpler: if he is competitive and having fun, he keeps going. And he believes the two are inseparable.That mindset has carried him into an almost unthinkable goal: potentially competing at the2034 Salt Lake City Games, when he would be 52. Not because he needs another medal, but because of what it represents.“The longer I do this, the more people that I can inspire,” he said. “If I’m 52 years old in 2034 and I’m still doing this, you have no excuse to go chase your dreams.”View image in fullscreenNick Baumgartner finally broke through for an Olympic gold four years ago in Beijing, winning mixed team snowboard cross with Lindsey Jacobellis.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesSnowboard cross, increasingly shaped by youth pipelines, sports science and early specialization, was not designed for careers like his. Some of his competitors were in elementary school when he made his Olympic debut in Vancouver. Longevity, in Baumgartner’s telling, is less mystery than ecosystem. He credits a support network built around more than podium results – sponsors, community and family who believe in the story as much as the sport.“I have people that care about what I’m doing and believe in my journey,” he said. “I want to use my story for good. I want to use my story to inspire more stories like mine from small-town kids.”That small-town identity remains foundational. Baumgartner still lives in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, commuting 90 minutes to a specialized training gym in Marquette twice a week, sometimes sleeping overnight in a van to maximize recovery and training windows. He speaks about the region less like an address and more like a personality.“I’ve been to 40 countries all over the world on my snowboard,” he said. “And Lake Superior is still the coolest thing I’ve ever seen. The people – they’ll give you the shirt off their back even when it’s 40 below zero.”Earlier in his career, Baumgartner helped fund his time on tour by working summers for a concrete company in Wisconsin, pouring patios, sidewalks and driveways. Weeks before the 2022 Beijing Olympics, he was still taking shifts alongside his brother, working overnight construction jobs that required maneuvering heavy concrete hoses across building sites before flying out to snowboard training camps. The work was physically punishing, particularly as he moved into his late 30s, but he credits it with helping build the durability that has defined his career.The environment, he believes, creates a baseline toughness. Survive Upper Peninsula winters and elite sport feels manageable.The durability also comes from how differently he trains now compared with his early career. In his 20s, he trained like an NFL player – high volume, traditional lifts. In his 40s, everything is precision-engineered for explosiveness and injury prevention.“I’m doing all fast-twitch explosive things,” he said. “Sprints, box jumps … We have a machine reading how fast I’m pushing the bar. If I can’t push it past a certain speed, we stop. We’re just smarter about how we do things.”Snowboard cross offers one hidden advantage to ageing athletes: experience. The event is chaos disguised as racing – elbows, edges, draft lines, crashes and split-second decisions.“I’ve seen so many kids that have all the talent in the world to beat me,” he said. “On paper they should crush me – and they never beat me. I’ve been in the trenches for too long.”The sport’s peak age has dropped dramatically – the top riders are now often in their early-to-mid 20s. But Baumgartner had arguably his best season at 40, a reminder that competitive maturity doesn’t always follow physical prime.View image in fullscreenNick Baumgartner competes in his first Olympics at Cypress Snowboard & Ski-Cross Stadium in Vancouver, Canada.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesOff the hill, fatherhood has quietly shaped the emotional center of his career. His son, Landon, was born in 2004, the same year Baumgartner turned professional. That means Landon has seen everything – financial uncertainty, injuries, disappointments and, eventually, Olympic gold.“Kids don’t listen to their parents,” he said. “But they watch. He’s seen everything: the ups, the downs, all of it.”When Baumgartner returned home to Michigan after the Beijing Olympics, thousands lined roads in freezing temperatures for a 70-mile parade. He rode through it with his son beside him – crying, laughing, filming – a moment that reframed decades of risk and sacrifice.The physical toll is real. He doesn’t pretend otherwise.“Body-wise, it’s good for 44, right? I definitely don’t feel the same as I did at my first Olympics at 28, but I put a lot of work in to make sure that the body holds up and the body’s strong and ready to compete against these kids.”“Yes, absolutely,” he said when asked if he hurts more now. “If I stop moving, I’m going to be in big trouble. But if I keep moving and take care of my body, I think I’ll be fine.”Which is why Thursday doesn’t feel like a closing act. It feels like another data point in a career built on stubborn defiance – of geography, of expectation, of ageing curves, of the idea that elite sport belongs only to the young.Baumgartner knows time will win eventually. He says that part out loud. But until the starts slow, until the legs stop responding, until the joy fades – he will keep lining up against riders young enough to have grown up watching him.At 44, that may be the most radical thing about him. Not that he’s still here, but that he still believes the best part could be next, whether on Thursday in Valtellina or eight years from now in Utah.“I would love to end in the States,” he said. “Is that possible? I don’t know. Are we going to find out? Damn straight. Because I’m going to push it, and at some point the body’s going to step in, and it’s going to say, all right, it’s time to give it up, but until that happens, we’re going to keep pushing as hard as we can. I think I’m going to be there – I really do.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026SnowboardingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2034featuresShareReuse this content"

It’s so complex. It’s ridiculously complex,” he said. “I sat in a meeting the other day and they’re taking us through it and it’s like you need a degree to fully understand it all.”Hamilton is far from the only driver to have expressed disquiet at the direction of the new regulations and how energy management, which will affect how drivers approach racing but is managed inside the car and by software, will not be comprehensible.The world champion, Lando Norris, recently expressed similar reservations that the complexity of what was happening within the car and how it affects racing would be hard to explain and largely lost on fans.The new power units are designed to maximise a trade-off between use of energy across a lap – including a boost mode of electrical power – and recovering that energy, calling for strategic driving and having to employ techniques such as “lift and coast” on straights to recover energy. It is a method that has been used before in F1 for fuel conservation but drivers including Hamilton have expressed concern it will now become too prevalent.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton is not the only driver to voice his concern over the new rules.Photograph: Kym Illman/Getty Images“If you look at Barcelona, for example, we’re doing 600 metres lift and coast on a qualifying lap. That’s not what racing is about,” he said.Bahrain is the second test of the season and runs until Friday. Max Verstappen was quickest in the first session in the morning with Hamilton in fourth, one second back from the Red Bull driver. Hamilton also spun at turn one where he locked up and lost the rear.He suffered no damage and continued. He was far from the only driver to slew the car as they come to grips with the challenges dictated bythe new engines.Braking hard into corners is vital for maximum energy recovery while there is an impetus at the same time in certain turns to maintain high revs to minimise turbo-lag on the corner exit, making for a tricky to manage combination.A final test is set for next week in Bahrain with the first race of the season in Melbourne on 8 March.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLewis HamiltonFormula One 2026Motor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

In today’s column, we endeavor to answer three of themGraham RuthvenWed 11 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 07.39 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAre Tottenham Hotspur really in a relegation battle?Last season’s 17th place finish was meant to be rock bottom for Tottenham Hotspur; a nadir for the club in the Premier League era that was awkwardly offset byglory in the Europa League. There is, however, no glory in what Spurs are going through this season and no guarantee that rock bottom isn’t still around the corner.Five points are all that separates the team from the bottom three after Tuesday’s defeat to Newcastle, with a home game against league leaders and north London rivals Arsenal coming up on Sunday. Spurs have two wins since the start of November – a run of 17 games. That’s relegation form, and on WednesdayThomas Frank was sackedafter just eight months as head coach.Ramsey winner for Newcastle adds to Frank woes to leave Spurs fearing the dropRead moreOf course, there are reasons. Key players have missed significant time through injury and suspension. Tottenham’s Champions League commitments have also clogged the schedule. That European campaign has, strangely, offered signs of hope – Spurs finished fourth in the league stage, in between Barcelona and Liverpool. A round of 16 matchup awaits there in March.Nevertheless, the reality of Tottenham’s situation is right there to see in thePremier Leaguestandings. Using their form of the last 17 games as a guide, Spurs are on course to finish with around 38 points, the same as last season when they stayed up comfortably. Last season, though, Tottenham had three historically bad teams below them to provide a cushion. This season, West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Leeds United are showing significantly more fight.If it happens, Tottenham’s relegation would be the biggest indignity ever suffered by a Premier League team. Newcastle going down (twice) was a shock, but they didn’t have the ninth-highest revenue in world football like Spurs do. They weren’t playing in the Champions League in the same season. Just because it’s unprecedented, though, doesn’t mean it can’t happen. Whoever replaces Frank has a huge task ahead of them.Could Cristiano Ronaldo leave the Saudi Pro League?View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo is reportedly returning to Al-Nassr after a two-week strike.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersSaudi Pro League side Al-Nassr are payingCristiano Ronaldoroughly $650,000 a day not to play for them. It’s been two weeks since the Portuguese forward last played or trained. Two weeks since he decided the only way to communicate his unhappiness at the way the Saudi club is being run was to go on strike.According to ESPN and other outlets, that strike is now over, with Ronaldo set to return to the team soon. Still, amid Ronaldo’s sulking and the gossip that he could be allowed to leave Al-Nassr and sign elsewhere, there is an important story unfolding about the changing landscape of Saudi soccer.Cristiano Ronaldo’s no-show leaves Saudi Pro League facing awkward questionsRead moreThe country’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) owns a 75% stake in four of Saudi Arabia’s clubs (Al-Ahli, Al-Hilal, Al-Ittihad and Al-Nassr), but wants all of them to be under private ownership by 2030. The plan is to use theSaudi Pro Leagueto invigorate the country’s private sector, and there is a sense that prioritisation among the clubs has already started in the way assets are being shifted around.Karim Benzema’s move from Al-Ittihad to Al-Hilal was an example. As was the fact that Al-Hilal spent over $80m on new signings in January while Al-Nassr had to make do with two free transfers. Al-Nassr are no longer the Saudi Pro League’s marquee club and that says something about the division’s future.Is Diego Simeone reaching the end of an era at Atleti?View image in fullscreenDiego Simeone has managed Atlético Madrid since 2011.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn the space of just four days last week, Atlético Madrid experienced whiplash. On Thursday, Diego Simeone’s team thumped Real Betis 5-0 to reach the semi-finals of the Copa Del Rey. By Sunday, though, Atleti had lost to the same opponents in a match that encapsulated why so many feel this will be Simeone’s final season at the club.‘His holiness’ Santi Cazorla leads the way as Oviedo find relief … and belief | Sid LoweRead moreAtleti have repeated the same cycle for years. It starts with Simeone vowing to modernise his approach; a promise his team will adopt a more expansive, exciting style of play. Attack-minded signings are made and a new age is declared, only for Simeone to revert to his default defensive-minded football soon after. Rinse and repeat.How many times are Atlético Madrid prepared to repeat, though? And perhaps more crucially, how much patience are new owners Apollo willing to show Simeone? These last few seasons have resembled the final phase of Arsène Wenger’s time at Arsenal, when the Frenchman couldn’t keep up with the modern game. Simeone may have reached a similar point in his managerial career.Now 13 points adrift in the title race, Thursday’s Copa del Rey semi-final first leg against Barcelona is an opportunity for Atleti to prove they can still beat Spain’s best. Simeone has been under pressure before and has found a way to respond. This time, however, feels different.Explore more on these topicsFootballPremier LeagueSaudi Pro LeagueCristiano RonaldoLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They had launched their legal action after the regional court of Madrid upheld a decision by the city’s commercial court that Uefa, the Spanish football federation and La Liga had practised anticompetitive behaviour and abused a dominant position in preventing the breakaway league. It is expected that Real will rejoin European Football Clubs (EFC), formerly the European Club Association. They had left in 2021 after the breakaway attempt.The EFC chairman, Nasser al-Khelaifi, welcomed the agreement. “Everybody has honestly done a fantastic job in good faith, and football will win after this,” he said.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It remains to be seen what shape the new agreement takes and whether A22, the companyformed to drive the project, will have any future involvement in European football strategy.

In finally ending Sunderland’s proud unbeaten home record in thePremier League, sixth placed Liverpool left themselves only three points adrift Manchester United and two behind Chelsea.Sunderland 0-1 Liverpool: Premier League – liveRead moreRégis Le Bris’s intelligent and well organised side did not surrender lightly but, with the excellent Florian Wirtz continuing to go from strength to strength in the No 10 role, Liverpool looked like champions and deserved to edge a match decided by Virgil van Dijk’s header from Mo Salah’s second-half corner.The only downside for Slot was the nasty looking ankle injury sustained by his stand-in right-back, Wataru Endo. Liverpool’s manager said it “did not look good” and he expects Endo to be “out for a long, long, time. It’s a serious one but how serious we don’t know. It will be assessed tomorrow.”That cloud apart, his mood was distinctly upbeat. “Sunderland are a good team with a good manager and it’s difficult to play against them,” he said. “But we controlled the second ball really well and from that we played some really good football. We were the better team. The mentality was excellent.”Le Bris acknowledged Sunderland had “clearly felt Liverpool’s quality”. As he put it: “If you fix one problem against them, you find you have to manage another. It wasn’t easy for them to win here. We showed character and identity. We showed composure and we were brave. We tried but it wasn’t enough. We faced a monster. Liverpool are composed and they have this ability to combine in tight spaces.”Although Slot’s side dominated possession it initially foundered in the face of a meticulously organised Sunderland defence. Then, with around 30 minutes on the clock, Wirtz met a pass from the influential, apparently renascent, Alex Mac Allister’s pass, took a steadying touch and decided to try his luck from the edge of the area.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk rises highest in a crowded six-yard box to head home Liverpool’s winner past the stranded Sunderland goalkeeper, Robin RoefsPhotograph: Owen Humphreys/PAWhile Robin Roefs did well to turn that one around a post, Sunderland’s goalkeeper was subsequently relieved to see a Wirtz shot rebound off the base of an upright after Andy Robertson’s cross bisected Le Bris’s backline.With Wirtz in increasingly catalytic mood as he assumed centre stage and Salah, sporadically ruffling Reinildo, Le Bris had reason to look more than a little anxious at times. Yet his team, too, had their moments. All kaleidoscopic positional interchanging going forward, Sunderland were being fully stretched yet remained very much in the game.It was the sort of match where they particularly missed their injured captain Granit Xhaka. Enzo Le Fée had dropped back alongside Noah Sadiki to fill Xhaka’s place at the base of ­midfield and his superior reading of the game and off-the-ball positioning ensured his side were able to make a series of important interceptions as Wirtz demonstrated precisely why Slot was so very keen to sign him last summer.Sunderland improved at the start of the second half but, still, they barely threatened Alisson’s goal and with the impressive Ibrahima Konaté winning his physical tussle with Brian Brobbey, a 25-yard off-target shot from Trai Hume was about the closest they came to scoring.View image in fullscreenThe impressive Florian Wirtz tries to evade Noah Sadiki.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersTellingly, once Liverpool began weathering a home storm briefly as intense as the torrential rain that had cascaded down on Wearside all day it took a vital block from Dan Ballard to deny Wirtz.A visiting goal was coming though. It arrived when Salah swung an excellent corner towards the far post and Van Dijk’s equally impressive header was helped on its inevitable trajectory into the back of the net by Habib Diarra.A delay ensued as Endo, deputising for the suspended Dominik ­Szoboszlai and putting in a very decent shift, received lengthy treatment – and pain relief – on the pitch after turning an ankle in evidently agonising fashion. Eventually the Japan international was carried off on a stretcher and replaced by Joe Gomez.It was a horrible way for Endo’s first Premier League start of the season to end but this most sodden of midwinter nights may yet come to be seen as a watershed in Liverpool’s hitherto troubled season.With the crushing disappointment of last Sunday’s defeat against Manchester City temporarily forgotten, almost anything suddenly seemed possible for Wirtz and friends.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Only Burnley and Wolves have worse home records.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesHeitinga was brought to Spurs in January to assist Frank, ostensibly to replace Matt Wells, who had left to become the head coach of Colorado ­Rapids. Heitinga, who was an assistant to Arne Slot at Liverpool last season, helping them to win the title, was sacked as Ajax manager in November.On Wednesday morning the club released a statement announcing Frank’s departure, eight months into a three-year contract with the team on a run of two victories in 17 in the Premier League.“We have been determined to give him the time and support needed to build for the future together,” the statement read. “However, results and performances have led the board to conclude that a change at this point in the season is necessary.”Spurs have given their players five days off to reset after the Newcastle match and prepare for the next one, which is the home derby against ­Arsenal on Sunday week. As such, the club have some time to finalise the move for the new coach and decide which of Frank’s staff to retain.When Frank left Brentford for Spurs, he brought the assistant coach Justin Cochrane, the head of performance Chris Haslam, and the analyst Joe Newton with him. Close to the start of the season, Nick Stubbings joined from Brentford to be the head of medical while Tom Perryman crossed over as a strength and conditioning coach. In December yet another Brentford staff member, Ted Munson, went to Spurs to become the head of nutrition.PosTeamPGDPts16Tottenham Hotspur26-12917Nottm Forest25-132618West Ham26-172419Burnley25-241520Wolverhampton25-328Tottenham have endured yet another long-term injury blow with the winger Wilson Odobert revealed to have badly damaged his anterior cruciate ligament against Newcastle.

We know the reality of where we are at the moment and in these kinds of situations you have to stick together and work harder.”Both teams came into this game in need of a lift, though Brighton’s need was perhaps more pressing.Defeat at home by Crystal Palacelast time out only augmented the argument against Hürzeler, when some Brighton supporters sang against their head coach.Thomas Frank’s departurefrom Tottenham further served to remind the fragility of the modern-day manager. For so long, Brighton have appeared almost foolproof, but are Hürzeler’s days numbered?He was happy to make big decisions. Carlos Baleba, booked within a couple of minutes for a lazy challenge on Morgan Rogers, was hooked after 22 minutes, Milner entering in his place to warm applause from all sides of the stadium for his 653rd top‑flight appearance.“Although we didn’t win, it is still a special night,” Hürzeler said of Milner reaching another milestone. “He is a role model for the young players, a top professional. He is unbelievably disciplined. It is a pleasure to work with him and we are grateful to have him in our squad, not only as a player but as a character.”View image in fullscreenJames Milner received a warm welcome from the entire crowd after he made his record-equalling appearance.Photograph: Nigel French/APLHürzeler felt keeping Baleba on was not a gamble worth taking, at least not in his side’s current predicament. Baleba trudged into the away dugout, dragging his blue-and-white striped shirt over his face as he took his seat.“In the end it is a bad decision from the referee [Peter Bankes] to give him the yellow card … wrong decision,” said Brighton’s head coach. “We had to avoid a potential second yellow card and protect a young player. I’ve seen these fouls so many times in the Premier League and 99% [of the time] they don’t give a yellow card. I really don’t get it.”The first real effort on goal came on the verge of first-half stoppage time, Emi Buendia’s shot deflecting off Joel Veltman and narrowly wide of a post. Half of the Holte End thought the ball rippled Bart Verbruggen’s net but it had, in fact, cannoned against the advertising hoardings.Villa struggled to penetrate Brighton, but Emery was delighted with a result that moved them five points clear of fourth-placed Manchester United and six of fifth-placed Chelsea. “We needed to win,” he said. “How? We just needed to recover confidence through the result.”Kadioglu produced a rare moment of quality when striking the woodwork, though the Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez more than played his part. Danny Welbeck laid the ball off to Kadioglu 20 yards from goal and the versatile Turkey full-back sent a blistering, swerving strike at goal. Martinez’s fingertips pushed it on to the bar.A few minutes before scoring, Mings headed away an awkward cross by the Brighton substitute Harry Howell. Just when it seemed the game would peter into a drab draw, Mings arrived at the front post for Bailey’s corner to find a winner via Hinshelwood.“Games are so tight, if it was 1-0 to them, everyone would say we were rubbish,” Mings said. “But fortunately we got the right result.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Trailing 2-0 to the £48m striker Jørgen Strand Larsen’s first goals forCrystal Palaceafter half an hour, it looked inevitable that Scott Parker’s side would match their club‑record 17-match winless run in the top flight that dates all the way back to 1890.Yet after all the misery since their last victory in October, everything changed in the space of seven scintillating minutes just before half-time.Burnleyhit back through Hannibal Mejbri, Jaidon Anthony and an own goal from Jefferson Lerma to record only a second away win of the season since being promoted. It keeps alive their slim hopes of survival, although Parker will know it will take several more results like this to conjure up the greatest of escapes.Manchester City 3-0 Fulham, Aston Villa 1-0 Brighton and more: Premier League – liveRead more“It means a lot – we’ve been through some real soul searching and tonight was everything that I have preached to this group,” the Burnley manager said. “That game will live with me for a long time – when the doubters were there and the adversity was against us, we managed to pull out a result which was incredible.”For Palace, it was a stark reminder that they are not out of the woods yet despite ending their own 12-match winless run with a cathartic victory against Brighton on Sunday. Oliver Glasner’s side appeared to be coasting towards only their third home win in the league this season that would have eased their own relegation concerns but were guilty of allowing their opponents back into the game with sloppy defending.View image in fullscreenDefender Jefferson Lerma (on the ground) watches the ball roll over the line, his own goal making it 3-2 to Burnley.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesThe decision not to bring in a replacement for their captain Marc Guéhi after selling him to Manchester City last month could come back to haunt them. “I didn’t recognise my team,” said Glasner, whose side have gone eight matches without a league win at Selhurst Park. “We had no one on the pitch to calm everyone down when things started going wrong and they started doing some crazy things.”The omens were not great for Burnley. Parker had never won a league match in London as an away manager and their team bus got caught in heavy traffic, causing kick‑off to be delayed by 10 minutes. “It wasn’t ideal but maybe we should have a few more of them,” he said.Despite struggling in front of their own supporters this season, Palace had not lost here against a promoted side since 2017 – a 4-0 defeat by Sunderland. There seemed to be little chance of that sequence ending when Strand Larsen hammered home a sumptuous through ball from Adam Wharton to open the scoring. Strand Larsen’s diving header that guided home the second from Lerma’s cross after a mistake from Kyle Walker appeared to have made Burnley’s task impossible.But the visitors gave themselves a lifeline when the outstanding Mejbri beat Dean Henderson with an excellent finish five minutes before half-time and then they found themselves ahead at the break. There was a huge question mark over whether Lesley Ugochukwu handled the ball in the centre circle before finding Anthony for the equaliser but there was no doubt about his finish into the bottom corner. The unfortunate Lerma could then only divert the ball into his own net after a header from Bashir Humphreys had been saved by Henderson. Palace left the pitch to a smattering of boos..View image in fullscreenBurnley’s Jaidon Anthony makes it 2-2.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesThey were sent out early for the second half having no doubt been on the end of some choice words from Glasner. But despite the introduction of their £35m forward Brennan Johnson, signed last month, Palace struggled to break down a stubborn Burnley defence. Daichi Kamada missed the target from a Daniel Munoz cross when he should have scored before Martin Dubravka’s brilliant save denied an acrobatic Ismaila Sarr in injury time.But it was Burnley’s small band of delighted traveling fans who were able to celebrate a rare victory that Parker will hope can revive their fortunes.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal have needed to rotate a little amid a hefty run of fixtures and although this was the first leg of a tie that would earn a spot in the Champions League quarter-final stage it was also the optimal time to rest legs, with Renée Slegers’ side havingearned a 3-0 win against Leuvenin their final game of the league phase.Arsenal were predictably dominant against the Belgian champions. Despite vital minutes being put into the legs of the returning Leah ­Williamson and ­several lesser used players, there was little doubt that they would break through the impressive ­Champions League debutants.“There’s high buy-in with what we’re doing at the moment and we have a lot of clarity on how we want to play our football,” Slegers said. “So, even if we make changes I don’t think you notice it as much. Of course, you have different players with different qualities, but the structure and the foundation is always there.”Quick GuideReal Madrid take first-leg advantage at Paris FCShowReal Madridremains on course for an all-Spanish quarterfinal against three-time champion Barcelona after coming from a goal down to win 3-2 atParis FC.After going behind in the 10th minute, Madrid needed just six minutes to turn the game around before halftime in the French capital.Caroline Weir equalized on a rebound from close range in the 39th and Athenea’s low shot finished off a fast counter in the last minute of the first half to put the visitors ahead.The 20-year-old forward Linda Caicedo controlled goalkeeper Misa Rodríguez’s long pass before before making it 3-1 in the 83rd before Maeline Mendy pulled a goal back in the 89th to narrow the deficit ahead of the second leg.Paris had taken the lead through Kaja Korošec, who was at the far corner to volley the opener into the roof of the net off a corner kick from Maelle Garbino.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Their opening goal came in the 22nd minute, with Caitlin Foord’s ball in from the right headed home by Maanum, and they extended their lead before the break with Smith side-footing in from Kelly’s cross. It was 3-0 within seven minutes of the restart, Smith’s clever one-touch pass to Foord sprung the offside trap and the Australian put the ball into the middle for Maanum to turn in from close range.Russo, on as a substitute, delivered Arsenal’s fourth, volleying home after Lowiese Seynhaeve failed to deal with Smilla Holmberg’s cross.Arno Van den Abbeel’s Leuven team delivered a playoff place in their first European outing, but chances were few and far between against Arsenal, their best attempt was Alixe Bosteels’ curling effort from 25 yards out forcing a save from Daphne van Domselaar in the second half.Van de Abbeel was philosophical about where his side are at in comparison to their opposition and ahead of a “difficult game” next week which they “have to enjoy”.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Alessia Russo is congratulated after scoring her sides fourth goal.Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP“There’s a big budget difference between us and Arsenal and I think as a league, as a country and as a club we have to find resources and we have to find a way to make women’s football even more attractive than it is already,” he said.“Today, I think there’s almost 1,000 Arsenal supporters here. That says something also about the popularity of women’s football in England and that is something we have to work on in Belgium to make women’s football more attractive and in that way find more resources for the evolution of our sport.”The arrival of Little with eight ­minutes remaining was welcomed raucously by the travelling fans, the 35-year-old’s incredible Arsenal career and continuing influence a cause for recognition and celebration and her manager was full of praise.“Kim is special,” Slegers said. “Everything she does is 100% and with so much detail, and she’s so humble.

She has so much control, but also much bravery in her game.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueLeuven WomenArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I don’t have the words yet and it will take a while to process it.”Asked to describe what had happened, she said: “Just a really costly technical mistake, which was tough very early in the programme because I knew that we lost bronze at that point.“But I also really wanted to not let the Olympic experience just disappear because of that, so it’s this battle of taking it in and doing my best the rest of the way while also knowing what I’d just done.”Gibson agreed. “When you don’t perform the way you want to on any day it’s tough to take, but at the Olympic Games it’s even harder,” he said.Gold went to the controversial French couple, Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron, with 225.82 points, after their routine earned them a top-scoring 135.64pts. Not everyone in the arena was convinced that such a high score was justified.The pair, who teamed up last year when Fournier Beaudry changed her citizenship from Canada to France, have faced deeper scrutiny. Part of that is down to allegations made by Cizeron’s former partner, Gabriella Papadakis, and the suspension of Fournier Beaudry’s former partner, Nikolaj Sørensen.View image in fullscreenThe gold medal winners Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron of France.Photograph: Claudia Greco/ReutersIn January, Papadakis’s memoir, So as Not to Disappear, called Cizeron “controlling” and “demanding”, allegations he has described as defamatory. When asked last week about the book, Cizeron said: “I’ve said everything that I needed to say on that subject.”In 2024 Sørensen was suspended for six years by Canada’s Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner for sexual maltreatment. The suspension has been overturned by the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada on jurisdictional grounds.The American couple, Madison Chock and Evan Bates, the reigning three‑time world champions, had to settle for silver on 224.39pts, after scoring 134.67 in their free dance routine.The one consolation for Fear and Gibson? Even if they had skated their best they probably would not have beaten the 217.73 by the Canadian pair of Paul Poirier and Piper Gilles, who claimed bronze.Fear’s and Gibson’s free dance score of 118.35 – 12th in the section – gave them an overall score of 204.32. Fear was in tears afterwards.Jon Eley, the performance director at British Ice Skating, said their routine did not reflect their quality. “I’m gutted,” he said.“They have shown over the last cycle and this season as well how good they really are. It was at the end of a sequence of twizzles, which had cost them points.“They practise it multiple times a day. It’s one of the toughest moves in ice dance. They are pushing the limits with all the different things they do. For them not to deliver on this stage is upsetting for them and us.”Fear tried to look on the bright side when asked what she would say to her eight-year-old self.“I think my eight-year-old self would be really proud of me,” she said. “I wanted to come out here and enjoy the Olympic experience and skate for me and skate for Lewis.”The pain was evident in her words. The performance means that British skating will have to wait even longer to scratch the itch that has been around since the early 1990s, while Team GB’s humdrum start to these Games goes on.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But in this time of full‑scale war some things are really more important than medals. At this point, I would say a medal is worthless in comparison to people’s lives and, I believe, in comparison to the memory of these athletes.”The IOC maintains that under Article 50 of the Olympic Charter, political statements are forbidden while in competition. However, theUkrainedelegation insists the helmet does not violate any laws because the helmet is about remembrance. It is unclear whether the IOC will allow Heraskevych to make his first run before disqualifying him or try to stop him before the start.View image in fullscreenVladyslav Heraskevych wears his helmet during practice on Wednesday, in which he recorded the quickest time.Photograph: Andrea Solero/EPA“The IOC has turned the situation with the ‘memory helmet’ into a theatre of the absurd,” Heraskevych said. “It is obvious that it does not violate any IOC rules.”The IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that while Heraskevych could wear a black armband, and speak to the press, he would not be allowed to wear the helmet in competition.“He can, and we would encourage him, to express his grief, but let me be clear,” he said. “It’s not the message, it’s the place that counts. There are 130 conflicts going on in the world. We cannot have 130 different conflicts featured, however terrible they are, during the field of play, during the actual competition.Asked what would happen if Heraskevych tried to wear his helmet in competition, Adams said: “I don’t think it is helpful to speculate. But obviously there are rules and regulations that the athletes themselves want us to enforce, and they will ultimately be enforced.”Adams also pointed to how the USA skater Maxim Naumov, wholost his parents in the Potomac air collision last year, had honoured them byshowing a photograph after he competed on Tuesday.“It’s a very emotional, very human, spontaneous human gesture,” he said. “In a sense it highlights what we are saying, this Ukrainian athlete, he can do the same. And we have loosened the rules – we are offering him to wear a black armband to commemorate his friends and colleagues who’ve lost their lives.“But for us, and for the athletes more importantly, the field of play is sacrosanct.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026International Olympic CommitteeWinter OlympicsUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Like, by and large, the ball (unless it was arrowing towards a fielder), England’s pursuit of a target of 197 never got off the ground, and after a largely pedestrian performance veered towards the end into a bilious combination of slapstick and horror they had been dismissed for 166 and, with seven balls remaining, been beaten by 30 runs.Had theknife-edge result against Nepal on Sundayfallen the other way this would already be another crisis in a winter full of them. As it is they will head to Kolkata, where they complete their group fixtures against Scotland and Italy, confident given the nature of their opponents of securing the wins they require to progress to the Super Eights but knowing they can afford no further stumbles.England lose to West Indies by 30 runs: T20 World Cup – liveRead moreWest Indies’ total of 196 was the third biggest of a World Cup still marked by largely moderate scoring, but it did not cause their opponents to be at all frantic. As a result England’s pursuit was always going to be judged either admirably or as puzzlingly calm, depending on its outcome.Even as their task grew increasingly difficult, and until it blundered into the realms of the truly far-fetched – duly inspiring a couple of manic run‑outs – there was no sense of panic, few wild swings and swipes.“One thing I would say is we were probably a little bit careful,” the England captain, Harry Brook, said. “With the power we had at the back end, myself included, I could have taken a risk a little bit earlier.“With that power and depth we have, we do think we can chase almost anything. Obviously today we didn’t.”View image in fullscreenSam Curran top-scored for England with 43.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APPerhaps they were comforted by their comparatively brisk early scoring – they stood at 67 for one at the end of the powerplay where West Indies had been 55 for three, and 93 for four at the halfway stage where their opponents had been 79 for four – but given the success enjoyed by Sherfane Rutherford and Jason Holder in particular as the first innings neared its conclusion, this was only storing up trouble.Clearly, England felt they had the players to do it, and unshakeable faith that one or more among them would settle down, get their eye in and start peppering the stands. The problem was that none did, and with Jamie Overton lasting just six balls, Tom Banton four and Will Jacks three, for all their vaunted depth England were swiftly scraping their toes in the shallow end.They struggled particularly during 12 overs of spin in which six wickets fell and their innings veered definitively off course, though Brook insisted this was freakish rather than fragility. “We played spin outstanding in Sri Lanka,” he said of their recent white-ball series against the co-hosts. “We’ve just had a bad day today.”With only Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran, who top-scored with 43, facing as many as 15 balls theirs was an innings that lacked outstanding individuals and destructive partnerships.By contrast Rutherford had led the way for West Indies, starting slow – after 13 deliveries he had scored only 10, off his next 16 he added 43 – before accelerating to finish unbeaten with 76 off 42.Really, though, their innings was a tale of three partnerships: Roston Chase and Shimron Hetmyer combined for 47 off 28, then Rutherford added 51 off 29 balls with Rovman Powell – despite Powell scoring a sober 14 off 13 – and another 61 off 32 with the free-scoring Holder, who finished with 33 off 17.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer was expensive in his four overs, going for 48.Photograph: MB Media/Getty ImagesFor England supporters concerned that disappointing performances against Nepal presaged an extended period of poor form for Jofra Archer and Adil Rashid, the evening brought only partial reassurance. Rashid, after a rare wicketless outing in the opener, was back to his sparkling best, taking two wickets and conceding just 16 runs in four excellent overs.But news of Archer was less positive: another 48 runs conceded, and of the 133 bowlers used in the tournament so far only USA’s Saurabh Netravalkar has been more expensive. He did pick up the wicket of Shai Hope, but with a short, wide delivery that was asking to be hit, and not necessarily straight to Banton at cover.“Everybody knows how good Jof is,” Brook said. “He’ll bounce back for sure.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026England cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamT20 World CupTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

In a separate move, Kansas City traded Claire Hutton, a 2025 midfielder of the year finalist, to Bay FC in a $1.1m transaction.The moves are the second and third largest intra-league transfers in NWSL history, trailing only the $1.25m Gotham FC paid the North Carolina Courage last year toacquire Jaedyn Shaw.Bethune, the No 3 draft pick by the Spirit in 2024, requested the trade, club president of soccer operations Haley Carter said in a statement.“After conversations about her desire to explore development opportunities in a different environment, we were able to structure a deal that honored her request while securing significant value for our club,” Carter said. “We evaluate every situation on its individual merits, and in this case, the alignment of player goals and organizational value made sense for all parties.”Bethune, 24, had five goals and 10 assists during her breakout rookie campaign for the Spirit in 2024 and earned a gold medal at the Paris Olympics with the US before a knee injury ruled her out for the final two months of the season. She received second team NWSL Best XI honors in her return last year, helping Washington to a second straight appearance in the championship.Gotham FC leave Champions Cup disappointed, but with an ambitious long-term planRead moreThe Spirit were arguably the NWSL offseason’s main character as they worked to sign Trinity Rodman to an extension within the league’s rules.With their star winger signed to fresh terms, consequential adjustments to stay compliant with league rules were inevitable. Washington’s squad is teeming with stars, including Colombia midfielder Leicy Santos, US midfielder Hal Hershfelt, Côte d’Ivoire forward Rosemonde Kouassi, Nigeria forward Gift Monday and Italy forward Sofia Cantore. Getting interleague transfer funds ($900,000) and allocation money ($100,000) will help to host so much talent.Still, few would’ve expected Bethune to be among the departures. She was among Rodman’s closest friends at Spirit, regularly linking up for TikTok dances in between goal celebrations. Bethune also provided a vital link between the midfield and forward lines, although she has already required three ACL surgeries and missed eight months from 2024 to 2025 after tearing a meniscus.View image in fullscreenClaire Hutton earned Best XI honors in Kansas City’s NWSL Shield-winning campaign last year.Photograph: Jay Biggerstaff/NWSL/Getty ImagesHutton broke out as an 18-year-old in her rookie 2024 campaign with the Current and has since cemented her place as one of the league’s top defensive midfielders, earning Best XI honors in 2025 and making 13 appearances for the US national team.“Bay FC is a club with real ambition, and that is a big part of why this move feels right for me,” Hutton said in a club release. “It’s clear from Coach Coates how detailed her vision is and how much she values challenging players to keep improving. The standards she wants to set and the environment the club is building really resonated with me, and I’m excited to join a group that pushes each other every day as we compete at the highest level while winning championships.”Four big predictions for the USWNT lineup after 2026’s first gamesRead moreAfter making the playoffs in their inaugural season, Bay sunk to second-bottom in 2025, failing to win in the entire second-half of the season. Turnarounds require talent, and Bay now have a rising midfield star for club and country. Hutton was vital to the Current’s record-setting regular season, capably shielding the backline while ushering the ball upfield with precision.The 20-year-old has also worked into Emma Hayes’s rotation. She was crucial to helping international teammate Ally Sentnor acclimate to the club, as the pair forged a friendship throughout years with the US youth national teams. She projects asa likely inclusion for the 2027 Women’s World Cupsquad.As for the Current, the moves fortify an already established area of strength – how they unlock defenses in transition and slower phases alike – while opening a potential weakness in Hutton’s ceded terrain. KC barnstormed the NWSL en route to the Shield with breakneck precision, and already boasted a talented attacking corps including two-time reigning MVP and Golden Boot winner Temwa Chawinga, Sentnor, US winger Michelle Cooper and three-time MVP finalist Debinha.Given injury concerns around both Bethune and Debinha, the move will help ease expectations from the 34-year-old Brazil international while not asking too much from Bethune in her first season. Hutton’s minutes will most directly be absorbed by Vanessa DiBernardo, a dependable two-way midfield veteran returning from maternity leave. Beyond DiBernardo, central midfield is awfully thin without Hutton as the team readies for theirfirst seasonunder Chris Armas.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Anthony had been a huge favorite to win gold after dominating her sport for a number of years, but finished last of the eight finalists.Slip up costs Australia’s Jakara Anthony defence of her moguls titleRead moreIn her first run of the finals, under a bright and sunny afternoon sky in the narrow valley of Livigno, Lemley was in firm control of her skis, always pinned one to the other, and landed well after two big jumps.In the second run – also known as the superfinal – the skier pushed on the speed, keeping her skis tight together and showing off great technique around the moguls and with a big grab on the bottom jump.“I was trying to focus on trusting myself. I’ve been working on that this whole season … and right when I pushed out of the gate, I said to myself, ‘Let’s go!’” Lemley told a news conference after the medal ceremony.Lemley’s medal fell apart as she was celebrating on the top of the podium just after she received it from Australian Olympic Committee President Ian Chesterman. Several athletessaw their medals breakacross the first days of Olympic competition, and officials have promised repairs.Anthony had a first fast, clean run for the finals, with smooth turns and a big grab on the bottom jump, but in the second she lost control in the middle section of the moguls, leaving her fall line, the straightest path down the hill.Her 83.96 score on the first run would have been enough for gold had she reproduced it in the second, but only the final score counts and Lemley’s 82.30 secured the American her first global title.Kauf, who got through to the final only hours before in the second qualifying round, delivered a fast first run down the hill, with tidy skiing through the moguls and strong jumps.In the superfinal she was strong and quick, with a big top jump, crushing through the moguls and performing a grab in the bottom air.“I definitely didn’t take the easy route into the finals ... but I think everything happens for a reason,” Kauf said.Despite scraping through to the second final round with a stylish technique but not so clean jumps, Laffont set a very high bar in the second run, showing off great precision and performing two big jumps with grabs.Japan’s Hinako Tomitaka also scored 78 but Laffont took the bronze as she was awarded a better score – 42.6 to 42 – for her turns in the final run.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUSA Olympic teamUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

That fell short of the 127.7 million US viewers who tuned in forPhiladelphia’s victory over Kansas Citylast year on Fox.However, this year’s Super Bowl became the most-watched program in NBC history as the network celebrates its 100th anniversary.Bad Bunny and jingoism lite: was this the Super Bowl where woke roared back?Read moreBad Bunny’s half-time showaveraged 128.2 million viewers. That makes it the fourth-most watched half-time show in history behind Kendrick Lamar (133.5 million in 2025), Michael Jackson (133.4 million in 1993) and Usher (129.3 million in 2024).This year’sSuper Bowldid set one television audience record. The audience for the game peaked at 137.8 million viewers during the second quarter, which is a record. That surpassed the previous mark of 137.7 million during the second quarter of last year’s Super Bowl. It is the fifth straight year the game has averaged more than 100 million viewers.This year’s audience ended a streak in which the last four Super Bowls had experienced audience increases, although that may be because this game was a fairly one-sided and dull affair on the field. Sunday’s game was just the second in Super Bowl history in which a touchdown had not been scored in the first three quarters. Seattle were up 12-0 going into the final 15 minutes.Meanwhile, theTurning Point USA half-time showfeaturing Kid Rock peaked at 5 million viewers at one point on YouTube.Nielsen did not measure any of the YouTube live stream viewership. Of the linear networks that carried the Super Bowl, the only one Nielsen measures is broadcast network Charge! Full Nielsen ratings for the prior week will be released on Wednesday.Half-time show on social mediaTotal social media consumption of Bad Bunny’s half-time show set a record of 4bn views after the first 24 hours, according to the NFL and Ripple Analytics. That represents a 137% increase over last year.The social media figures include fans, owned platforms, broadcast partners and influencers. The NFL said more than 55% of all social views came from international markets. Full global viewership for the half-time show is expected to be available early next week.Bad Bunny’s presence may also have increased the Spanish-language audience in the US. Telemundo averaged 3.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched Super Bowl Spanish-language broadcast in the United States. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the US since 2014.The audience peaked during the half-time show, averaging 4.8 million viewers – also making it the most-watched Super Bowl half-time in Spanish-language history in the US.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXSuper BowlBad BunnyNFLUS sportsNew England PatriotsSeattle SeahawksnewsShareReuse this content"

But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?Lucy Knightwith additional reporting bySumaiya MotaraWed 11 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 09.10 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleCalifornia-based Jacqueline Bowman had been dead set on becoming a writer since she was a child. At 14 she got her first internship at her local newspaper, and later she studied journalism at university. Though she hadn’t been able to make a full-time living from her favourite pastime – fiction writing – post-university, she consistently got writing work (mostly content marketing, some journalism) and went freelance full-time when she was 26. Sure, content marketing wasn’t exactly the dream, but she was writing every day, and it was paying the bills – she was happy enough.“But something really switched in 2024,” Bowman, now 30, says. Layoffs and publication closures meant that much of her work “kind of dried up. I started to get clients coming to me and talking about AI,” she says – some even brazen enough to tell her how “great” it was “that we don’t need writers any more”. She was offered work as an editor – checking and altering work produced by artificial intelligence. The idea was that polishing up already-written content would take less time than writing it from scratch, so Bowman’s fee was reduced to about half of what it had been when she was writing for the same content marketing agency – but, in reality, it ended up taking double the time.“I now had to meticulously fact-check every single thing in the articles. And at least 60% of it would be completely made up,” she says. “I would just end up rewriting most of the article. So something that would take me two hours when I was writing it by myself now took me four hours, making half the money.”To add insult to injury, Bowman’s few remaining clients have sometimes accused her of using AI to create her work. “I never use AI to write anything,” she says, but she has noticed that AI-produced copy can sometimes seem eerily similar to her own writing – which she suspects is due to large language models being trained on some of her previous work. She can’t afford to take any of the Silicon Valley giants to court – though she is grateful for the authors, likeGeorge Saunders and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who have done so.By January 2025, Bowman was no longer able to afford her own health insurance, which hammered home what she had already begun to suspect: “Writing is not going to work out for me any more.” She decided to bring her wedding forward (she and her partner are still going ahead with their planned celebration in March, but last year obtained a marriage certificate from their local courthouse) so she would be eligible to join her husband’s health insurance plan. But she knew a more drastic change would be needed before long.There’s a subsection of people who say: ‘Hey, AI took my job. I’m not going to an AI therapist’She remembered a psychology elective she had enjoyed in college, and wondered if she might be able to make a more secure living by becoming a therapist. “It’s not AI-proof” – Bowman admits that some people will be happy to useAI-powered therapy services, which already exist. “But there’s another subsection of people who are going to say: ‘Hey, AI took my job, AI ruined my life. I’m not going to go to an AI therapist,’” she says. “So in that way, I do think that there’s still going to be an audience who wants a human therapist.”Bowman decided to take action and retrain, “while I still do have a little bit of work”, and is now back at university studying to become a marriage and family therapist. She counts herself “incredibly lucky” because she is able to rely on her husband, and on any writing work she can still get, to make ends meet – but has still had to take out loans. She’s enjoying the course, and is “glad she has the opportunity to do it”, but it is not something she would have considered if her writing work hadn’t become untenable.View image in fullscreenJanet Feenstra, in her previous job as an editor in Stockholm.Photograph: Courtesy of Janet FeenstraJanet Feenstra, an academic editor turned baker based in Malmö, Sweden, also has mixed feelings about her career change, a choice she similarly made because of fears that AI would make her old job void. “It’s complicated because, in a way, I maybe should be grateful to AI for prompting this change,” she says. Feenstra now works at “a really cute bakery”, where she and her colleagues “roll out the dough by hand and it feels amazing”.“We listen to music and we dance and sing whenever we want,” she adds. “I have a lot more fun now, but I don’t want to be grateful to AI for this – I’m still a little bit bitter.” It felt like a forced career change, rather than one she was choosing on her own terms, she explains – not to mention the fact that she now gets paid less, travels farther to work and does a much more tiring job.Since 2013, the 52-year-old, who is originally from the US, had been working as a freelance editor alongside a part-time job at Malmö University doing what is called “language editing”: tidying up texts written by researchers whose first language isn’t English.“The standard of English here in Sweden is very, very high, so this was very specialised academic editing,” she says. “The international journals are very picky, so it required a certain expertise that we could offer.” However, in recent years, she began to hear people within the university talking about wanting to use AI. “It was scary. I felt like the writing was on the wall a bit,” Feenstra says. She began to realise that if a manuscript “is already quite good”, then an AI system prompted to meet academic journal requirements might be able to do the work she had been doing.View image in fullscreen‘Rolling out the dough by hand feels amazing’ … Janet Feenstra in her new job as a baker.Photograph: Courtesy of Janet Feenstra“I didn’t want to wait until it was too late,” she says. “I felt scared … I’m divorced, I have two children to look after and I need financial security.” So she decided to retrain in something she “was fairly sure that AI would not replace anytime soon”, and enrolled in culinary school.It wasn’t an easy transition. “I had to move out because I wasn’t able to afford my rent any more,” she says, which meant that her sons, who had previously lived between their parents’ two homes, had to live full-time with their father. While Feenstra embarked on her year-long training, she moved in with her partner, whose flat was too small to house her sons as well. Now, having worked in the bakery for five months, she has recently signed a contract on a new flat, which will have room for her sons. “I’ve had to work really hard: I’ve had to retrain, I’ve had to accept lower pay and conditions that are physically challenging,” Feenstra says. But securing the flat “is really exciting because it’s a goal realised”.Feenstra says it has been “an interesting journey” to go from a job typically associated with middle-class people to one seen as working-class. “White-collar work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, I’ve realised,” she says. “But it requires an adjustment. We’re so defined by our jobs and our class.”Perhaps those definitions of what counts as a “good” or “middle class” job will begin to change: a 2023 report on theimpact of AI on jobs and trainingin the UK by the Department for Education concluded that: “Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles.” And, rightly or wrongly, Feenstra is not alone in deciding that learning a trade is a relatively safe bet.Angela Joyce, the CEO of Capital City College, a further education provider in London, says: “We’re seeing a steady growth in students of all ages coming to us to do trades-based qualifications,” in subjects such as engineering, culinary arts and childcare. There is “definitely a shift” away from traditional academic routes, she says, which she attributes to the high numbers of unemployed young people – and “a good proportion of those are graduates”, she notes. That shift towards seeking vocational training is “in part linked to AI”, Joyce thinks, because people are looking for “jobs that AI can’t replace”.View image in fullscreenComposite: Rui Pu/The Guardian; Getty ImagesThat was certainly the case for Richard, a Northampton-based chartered occupational health and safety professional. After working his way up the career ladder for 15 years, the 39-year-old decided to jump ship and retrain as an electrical engineer.“Health and safety isn’t going to disappear any time soon because organisations can’t name AI as a responsible person or a duty holder for businesses legally,” he says. But a few years ago, he started to hear “mumblings of AI” within the industry, and saw organisations start to experiment with automating certain systems and procedures. He watched as AI began to be used for writing policies and safe systems of work, and realised that if a large portion of practitioners’ workload could be done by AI, then there might only be a need for “highly specialised managers. The rest of it’s probably going to go.”Though he decided to “pre-empt that” and pursue a different path, his main worry about AI taking over health and safety roles wasn’t actually that people like him would lose jobs – he finds aspects of AI “exciting” and accepts that it will inevitably shake up the way we work. His primary concern was that the implementation of AI might be “more of a cost-cutting exercise than it is about safety”. Richard cares deeply about the health and safety industry, which he entered after his friend was killed in a gas explosion at work.View image in fullscreenRichard, who retrained as an electrical engineer after 15 years in occupational health and safety.Photograph: HandoutHe has taken “a huge cut” financially since he has been working as an electrical engineer over the past year, but his new job does at least still have keeping people safe at its core. And there is the potential to make the kind of money he earned in his old job once he has more experience under his belt, he says, but “I’m a good five, 10 years off”. And that’s if automation hasn’t come for electrical work by then – Richard mentionsBMW’s testing of a humanoid robotas an example of how AI could affect trade jobs. Currently, though, the trades, in the UK at least, are “the most resilient to the levels of automation that AI is bringing in”, Richard believes. “Companies are capitalising on AI to remove one of their biggest costs, which is human overheads,” he says. “You need to pick something which has resilience. So, statistically, that is not your roles that are bureaucratic by nature, heavy in data and are just a bunch of processes which you repeat end on end. It needs to be something with high dexterity and some high problem-solving skills.”Carl Benedikt Frey, an associate professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, agrees that manual work “is going to be harder to automate”, but predicts that AI will have an impact “across a very wide range of industries” – trades included. “If the dishwasher breaks down in my home, I can take a picture and I can quiz the large language model of my choice, and I’m more likely to be able to fix it myself these days without calling an engineer,” he says. That’s not to say tradespeople are “doomed” – he cautions against making too many decisions based on “some hypothetical future scenario … We have to go by what’s actually happening in the labour market.” Which, now, is not a lot. “We’re beginning to see some studies suggesting more of an impact on entry-level work,” Frey says, but a reduction in entry-level job opportunities could also be attributed to higher interest rates, or post-pandemic recovery, he says.“As AI gets better, and its capabilities improve, I think it’s likely that we will see it on a bigger slice of the labour market. But we’re not seeing it yet.” In fact, Frey has now reassessed his earlier claim that 47% of roles were at risk of being replaced by computerisation, made inThe Future of Employment, the 2013 paper he co-authored with Prof Michael Osborne. “In that study, a lot of the jobs that we deem are highly exposed to automation are jobs in transportation and logistics because of autonomous vehicles,” he says. “It’s fair to say that it’s taken much longer for that technology to materialise.” Asself-driving carsdo begin to hit our streets, “we will see a lot of jobs being replaced in trucking and even in taxi services”, Frey believes. But his message seems to be don’t panic – at least not yet. “It might be a good idea if you are, say, in the early days of your professional career, to take the time that you still have to invest in training and figuring out other more viable career paths,” particularly if you work as a translator – one profession where “we’re already seeing that AI is having an impact, although we’re not seeing mass displacement by any means”. But if you are reaching the end of your working life, “you can probably ride the wave for a few more years”, he says.Roles the team don’t want to do – like email outreach and cold calling – we can get AI agents to do thatThe most significant AI-caused declines in employment and wages will be in jobs like software engineering and management consultancy, according to aKing’s College London studypublished in October 2025. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that there aren’t going to be new jobs that will be created,” Dr Bouke Klein Teeselink, who authored that study, notes. Historically, whenever there have been technological advances people have worried about mass unemployment, but it hasn’t happened, he says. “So there’s a part of me that is a little bit sceptical that all the jobs will disappear, but at the same time there is a reason to think that this technology might be different, in the sense that humans always maintained some type of absolute advantage over technology in certain domains. And that may no longer be true.”For now, while we can’t yet know the full impact AI will have on workers, “becoming really good at working with AI is probably going to be a skill that will pay off”, Klein advises. Which is what the Birmingham-based entrepreneurs Fayyaz Garda and Arun Singh Aujla, both 25, are attempting to do. Garda, who works in procurement, and Singh Aujla, who runs a social media marketing business, are in the process of setting up anAI consulting business, educating themselves about AI via YouTube. “It’s a growing market, and there’s definitely a space for it. So I’m hoping to try and get in there early,” Garda says. The plan is to employ a number of engineers to create AI systems that will answer phone calls, respond to mail and fulfil other tasks businesses need doing, he explains.“The AI consulting business is one way I’m upskilling to move with the times,” Singh Aujla adds. “AI won’t replace me, but it may take a large market share out of my business. So it’s always good to make an extra stream of revenue.” There are certain roles Singh Aujla would never replace with AI, though: “I would not replace my management team. You need that human interaction with your team,” he says. “But roles the team don’t want to do, like email outreach and cold calling, we can get AI agents to do that.”For some, it may well prove true that AI improves their work life by removing tasks they find tedious or difficult, giving them more time to focus on the more fulfilling aspects of their job. For others, though, it is the reason they have given up on their dream career. Paola Adeitan, 31, had her heart set on being a solicitor, and obtained an undergraduate degree and a master’s in law. She had planned to do the legal practice course, the final stage of training needed to qualify as a solicitor, “but I decided not to pursue that path because I felt like, with the change in technology, the AI, that might not be a viable path for me to carry on with,” she says. Friends of hers had struggled to get entry-level law roles, which she believed to be partly due to the increased use of AI at law firms.Adeitan still volunteers as a legal adviser, but her day job is in the health sector – although even that role could be affected by AI, she thinks, so she is remaining open to the idea that she might end up retraining again. “I do feel a sense of disappointment,” she says, “but the nature of work is changing. It’s very difficult now to decide what you want to do; you have to think carefully. It’s not about what you want any more; it’s about what is going to be there, what’s going to work.”If you’re lucky, what ends up working best could be something you really enjoy – as is the case for Faz, 23, who took a break from his geography degree at the University of Manchester in 2023 because of a family matter. Afterwards, it didn’t make sense to him to return to his degree. “I had to think about what was future-proof, I had to think about what was AI-proof. And it seemed like a lot of entry-level roles in the corporate sector were being taken over by AI. And because AI is so unpredictable, you never know if those more specialised roles will also become obsolete,” he says. So he has instead been training for a Level 2 qualification in electrical installation since September 2025. “I thoroughly enjoy it,” he says. Though he might go back to university at some point – his “ideal setup” would be a combination of working part-time for a council or a charity, while doing electrical work on the side – “right now, a tradie job is 100%, God willing, the correct choice. I’m fairly certain it will be future-proofed against AI.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Rui Pu/The Guardian; Getty ImagesBethan, 24, from Bristol, also enjoys her AI-proof job, working in a local cafe. But it comes at a cost: she has hypermobility spectrum disorder, which gives her severe joint pain and makes it hard for her to move around. “I can’t work long hours now because I’ve pushed my body past the point,” she says.Bethan’s old job, at a university IT helpdesk, “was the first job that I didn’t come home in pain from”, she says. But only a couple of months after she was hired, she and her colleagues were told the helpdesk was being closed down and replaced with an AI kiosk. “It was awful,” she says. The helpdesk staff tried to defend their roles, arguing that for students who didn’t speak English as a first language, or older students who weren’t computer-literate, having humans behind the desk may still be necessary. “It felt like we were getting completely ignored. They went ahead with it because they said they had to get a certain number of cuts to the budget.”Hospitality was the only other sector in which she had experience, so she ended up at her cafe job. “Feeling like I had to go back to hospitality, which was so bad for my body, was a horrible feeling,” she says. She is now on the lookout for an office job, but has struggled to find anything entry-level. “Those are the jobs that are vanishing because they’re the easiest to replace,” she says – but it also means it is impossible to get the experience needed for higher-up roles. Bethan worries that even if she does get an office job, she could lose it to AI again. “Is it worth all the effort of applying, getting my CV up to date, and potentially doing a couple of rounds of interviews just to find out at the end we’re going to be replaced again?”With more physically demanding jobs making up the bulk of what is now considered “AI-proof”, those who have made the switch from white-collar roles are having to adapt to the toll it takes on their bodies. The electricians Richard works with are typically in their late teens and early 20s. “Their recovery rates are a hell of a lot quicker than mine. So if I pick up an injury, for example, it takes me far longer to recuperate. Also, they can work far longer hours than I can,” he says.And though Feenstra enjoys the physicality of working in a bakery, she has been thinking about how sustainable this kind of job will be as she gets older. “That’s why I’ve been taking note of how the owners run the business,” she says, in case there is a possibility of running her own bakery one day. She is proud of how she is continuing to adapt to the changing world around her: “I want my sons to feel a little bit inspired by that,” she says. Yet she doesn’t feel she can offer them career advice. “How am I supposed to advise them when I don’t even really know if what I’m doing is the right path?” she says. “It’s really unsettling when you can’t advise them. If they have a passion for something and they want to do something, immediately you think, OK, is this even going to exist in the next 10, 20 years? That just kind of sucks.”More than a quarter of Britons say they fear losing jobs to AI in next five yearsRead moreBallerinas will still exist, says Klein. “No one is going to go to the ballet to see a robot do really good ballet,” the academic says. “Same for theatre, same for football, same for many other things where it matters that there’s a human.” He doesn’t think people will be wanting to confess to robo-priests any time soon either, or leave children in the care of AI. “There are just categories where we prefer to interact with humans, right?” For that reason, social skills will remain important, Klein and Frey agree. And though it might seem as if AI could make expert knowledge useless, Klein disagrees. “I have students who use AI naively, and therefore they have no idea whether the reports they produce are good or bad,” he says. “You need to have that expertise to be able to guide the AI to get it to do what you need it to do. So in that sense, I think the value of expertise might actually go up.”How such expertise will be developed, if entry-level jobs are being ditched in favour of AI systems, is a question that remains as yet unanswered, as is who will actually be able to buy a ticket to the ballet should large swathes of the population be put out of work. But Frey doesn’t think it is worth spending too much time worrying about that potential future – yet. “It could well arrive, but it matters a great deal if that happens in five years or 20.” While he acknowledges “there are reasons to be concerned”, Frey doesn’t think it’s time to “paint a scenario where everybody’s going to be out of work five years from now, and we need to rethink everything”.Share your experienceShare your experienceIf you've altered your career plans because of AI, tell us about it in the form below.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

This has included perpetuating fake stories such as a pub in Leicestershire refusing to admit members of the armed forces so as to not offend immigrants, and a six-year-old being abducted by an Asian grooming gang in Croydon.Bonehill-Paine told the Guardian he no longer held antisemitic views, providing proof that he had passed the government’s Prevent awareness course and that he had worked in counter-extremism education.He has described himself online as now holding “a deep affection for Israel”.In early 2015 Bonehill-Paine attempted toorganise a mass protest in Stamford Hill, north London, to rally “against the complete Jewification of the borough”, and later in the year tried to organise another in Golders Green, an area of the city with a large Jewish population.He promoted the latter with a cartoon image of Hitler and wrote that the event would be “an absolute gas”. He was sentenced to three years and four months in jail for inciting hatred against Jews.Later, in 2016, he was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment for abuse directed at the then Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, which included posting messages to his blog calling Berger “a rodent”, “evil money-grabber” and “a dominatrix”, and uploading an image of a rat with Berger’s face superimposed over it. He was jailed for another two years, which was added to his existing sentence.Bonehill-Paine said on Wednesday he was “extremely sorry for the pain and distress” he had caused Berger, and he hoped she could forgive him for his past actions, but had not reached out to her directly as he did not “want to alarm or distress her, even after a decade has passed”.The Crewkerne Gazette’s work has been lauded by publications such as the Sun, which featured a video created by the account showing Rayner rapping to a grime beat during her tax scandal.The Times called him the “Banksy of politics” and GB News interviewed Bonehill-Paine, who went by the online alias of Crewkerne Man, on air three days before his identity and past were uncovered.The account’s work has also been highlighted by politicians including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who shared a video from it on X, and Adam Dance, the Liberal Democrat MP for Yeovil, where Crewkerne is based.Dance also said on an episode of BBC Sunday Politics West that Bonehill-Paine’s work was a positive example of engaging audiences with politics.When asked about Bonehill-Paine’s identity, Dance said he wasnot aware of who was behind the Crewkerne Gazette account at the time of his comments, which were “about the transparent use of AI in politics, not about endorsing any individual. I absolutely condemn antisemitism and harassment in all its forms, and I do not support the person now revealed to be behind that account.”.In a YouTube video Bonehill-Paine posted on Tuesday he expressed regret for his past comments towards the Jewish community.. He said: “I felt very angry at how I had treated the Jewish community in this country. I wanted to do something to rectify it, so I began working in counter-extremism education.”He added: “I went across the country to colleges, schools, universities, working with the probation service, the police service, to try to help prevent other people from following in my footsteps.”He later told Channel 4 News: “What I am going to do is to continue doing what I’ve done for the last five years, six years, which is counter-extremism work, working to prevent people following in my footsteps, hopefully stopping people from making the same mistakes that I’ve done.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsAntisemitismHate crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s your first sign that things were going badly long before you got here. Exploring dark waves and desolated urban environments in a rowboat, they’re on a search for their lost friends across a world of rabid, malformed entities. As the children struggle with their outsize fears, so will you, but you’ve at least got the option to play co-op if you want someone on the couch to brave the horrors with.In the early 2000s, irreverent gaming blog Old Man Murray pioneered the “crate review system”. The rubric was simple: the sooner the player encountered their first wooden cube of heinous mediocrity, the more uninspired the game. Updating this method for 2026, we’ve got a few new contenders: how soon before you shimmy slowly through a gap, boost a companion over a high ledge so they can pull you up or tediously rotate some mechanism with the analogue stick? Reanimal pulls out all these hits within the first 20 minutes and, by the time the credits roll, six hours in, it feels as if developer Tarsier has wrung the final drops of interactive novelty from its formula of light exploration puzzles, tense but simple stealth and ghastly chases. And yet this grim fairytale is still difficult to put down.Tarsier’sLittle Nightmares gameswere rightly praised for how their imposing and exaggerated worlds hold up a creepy funhouse mirror to a child’s thoughts and fears. Adults are gangly and terrifying; work is bizarre; bureaucracy is uncanny. Reanimal draws from that same well of fear, but with occasional riffs that feel at odds with childhood disempowerment, such as moments where the kids pilot a tank, or find a big honking bazooka.Even your worst nightmare is more bearable with a traffic cone on your headThe world’s worn and weary architecture feels fascinatingly wretched, with assured cinematography and arresting scale. Concrete and steel creak out sorrowful stories of decay and disaster. The starring pair make their way through crumbling bulkheads, a rotting orphanage and a forest so dark and dense that sunrise as a concept feels like a fanciful myth. Obscured crawlspaces hide away moments of reprieve in the form of silly, sad little secrets, proving that even your worst nightmare is more bearable with a traffic cone on your head.Observing their confidence and resourcefulness, you get the sense these kids have been dealing with hell for a long time. But they’re still kids. You’ll clumsily swing a crowbar at giant seagulls, or take a break to use a rusted slide. You’ll play grandmother’s footsteps through a flooded basement, sneaking in time with clattering washing machines to hide the sound of your movement from the awful, lanky presence just a few feet away. Lovingly animated detail brightens up the murkiness; the kids will help each other up and dust themselves off after falls, and beds quiver when you jump on them. A lighter and lamp to banish the gloom provide small comforts, but comforts all the same.View image in fullscreenLovingly animated detail … Reanimal.Photograph: Tarsier Studios/THQ NordicAnd, yes, the handful of marquee moments spent running from or tussling with gargantuan creatures are spectacular. I will never turn my back on a pelican again as long as I live. Throughout, Reanimal drip-feeds clues to compelling mysteries surrounding the nature of its world and the children’s place within it. A shame, then, that it whiffs its apparent swing at recapturing the gut-punch of Little Nightmares II’s ending.One early sequence sees you creep through a dilapidated theatre while a projector flickers between macabre images. Reanimal, too, relies on a celluloid reel of darkly beautiful scenes: they’re undeniably memorable in isolation, they just don’t form an especially cogent whole.Reanimal is out 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPlatform gamesPuzzle gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeith StuartWed 11 Feb 2026 07.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 07.33 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleSomething weird struck me early on while watching the movie Iron Lung, which hasso far taken $32m at the box office, despite being a grungy low-budget sci-fi thriller adapted from an independent video game few people outside of the horror gaming community have even heard of. Set after a galactic apocalypse, it follows a convict who must buy his freedom by piloting a rusty submarine through an ocean of human blood on a distant planet. Ostensibly, he’s looking for relics that may prove vital for scientific research, but what he finds is much more ghastly. So far, so strange.The film was also written, directed and financed by one person – the YouTube gaming superstar Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach – who also stars. But that’s not the weird part, either. The weird part is that watching the film Iron Lung feels like watching Fischbach play Iron Lung the game. Maybe it’s the fact that he spends most of the movie sitting at the sub’s controls, trying to figure out how to use them correctly – like a gamer would. Maybe it’s that, as the film progresses, he has to solve a series of environmental puzzles linked by various codes, computer read-outs and little injections of narrative – just like in a video game. Long periods of the movie involve Fischbach trying to decide what to do next, the camera close up on his confused face. This is incredibly similar to watching hisYouTube videos about playing Iron Lung, an experience he often found bewildering. It was the most metatextual experience I’ve had in the cinema since The Truman Show – but I’m not sure this is what Fischbach intended.View image in fullscreenMetatextual … Iron Lung.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyOf course, there have been plenty of movies in which a character must escape an enclosed environment by solving a series of puzzles. It’s a whole subgenre of fun thrillers, from the Saw franchise to Buried to Fall. But the highly procedural nature of Iron Lung, the long sequences of pondering, the tools the character uses and the way that puzzles dovetail into each other to open new possibilities? That’s video gameplay. Even the way the backstory is revealed, via short, oblique flashbacks, is exactly how a game would use cinematic cutscenes to flesh out the universe. This is not a film of a game, it is a film of the experience of a game – a sort of narrativisedYouTubeplaythrough. I almost expected a comments section to appear instead of the closing credits.Iron Lung isn’t the only YouTube video sensation to be converted into linear media. The hugely successful Dungeons and Dragons YouTube channel,Critical Role, is now an animated TV series. Elsewhere, Adventure Time and Rick and Morty started on the web before they were transferred to TV (and then became games), and theatre has been experimenting with interactive immersive productions for a decade or two. There’s now a growing range of TV shows morphing into video podcasts (the new Harry Hill series, for example), andvideo podcasts morphing into TV. We now live in an age of hybridised entertainment experiences and as viewers we’re going to have to renegotiate our relationships with traditional media as a result.View image in fullscreenLegendary … A Minecraft Movie.Photograph: Warner Bros Pictures/APRemember the controversy over how audiences wereshouting out catchphrases and throwing popcorn during A Minecraft Movie? What they were doing was re-enacting the para-social experience of playing and/or watching Minecraft on a computer screen – but in a cinema. The auditorium became a physical equivalent of the Twitch/YouTube chat window, with the spectators participating in meme-like jokes. While watching Iron Lung, the teenagers behind me were pointing out tropes and Easter eggs that referenced Fischbach’s YouTube videos as well as the original game, like a sort of ontological hall of mirrors.Iron Lung can be enjoyed as an oblique and claustrophobic B-movie. Comparisons have been made with John Carpenter’s anarchic Dark Star, although I see a closer analogue in the cult sci-fi thriller ​​Hardware, in which a self-assembling killer robot terrorises a woman in her apartment. But beneath the familiar trappings of the contained thriller, Iron Lung’s origins as a game are also written into the experience, there for those in the know who are prepared to unpick the self-reflexive strands.Whatever you make of Iron Lung, I’m sure we’ll see more YouTubers migrating into film. I just hope it in no way leads to a Jake Paul-directed Rocky movie.What to playView image in fullscreenAdorably awkward … Hermit and Pig.Photograph: Heavy Lunch StudioHere is a game for those who want a role-playing adventure that won’t take 120 hours to complete or bombard you with dark, Tolkienesque lore.

There are puzzles to solve and sub-quests to tackle, all of it lovingly critiquing RPG conventions, such as turn-based combat and a levelling up system.

The game secured positive reviews for its pacy combat and exuberant visual style, but the fighting game scene is crowded, and even a potential user base of 100 million League of Legends fans wasn’t enough to secure large-scale curiosity.In December,Fifaannounced that its major new football sim would be coming in 2026, via a publishing deal with Netflix. The developer was named as the relatively unknown Delphi Interactive, and GamesIndustry.Biz hasan interesting interviewwith its founders about how new models are needed to succeed in an ever-evolving market. Personally, I think the important part is making a footie game as good asEA Sports FC, but I’m no CEO.On the subject of Electronic Arts, the company has kept itsSimsbrand going for more 20 years, and the latest add-on, Royalty & Legacy, shows why. It allows you to rule your own regal dynasty over multiple generations, bringing a note of epic grandeur to the usual gameplay recipe of building a nice house and then trying to stop the inhabitants accidentally burning it down.Writing for Eurogamer, Matt Wales explains why Sims fans just can’t wait to be king.

Did I miss it? If so, what was it?”This long-running debate seemed to reach peak interest in the late-2000s and early 2010s, when innovative, highly cinematic titles such asBioshock,Red Dead RedemptionandDeus Exwere expanding the narrative and emotional scope of games with dazzling new techniques. At that time every games site on the internet had its own “What is the Citizen Kane of video games?” article. IGN, for example, declared that Nintendo’s sci-fi adventure Metroid Prime fit the bill, because, like the Orson Welles film, it used a huge variety of genre tropes and technical tricks to achieve its ambitious aims. Even at the time, most people disagreed, but well done IGN for having a go.I think the debate died out because it sunk into self-parody – it represented the reflexive anxiety of a growing medium still living under cinema’s cultural shadow. Ten years later, we’re more comfortable with the understanding that not everything that happens in video games has to be analogous to the history of film. There are games as formally daring as Citizen Kane (The Stanley Project,Disco Elysium,Shadow of the Colossus) and there are games that tell stories with myriad narrative strands (The Last of Us,Life Is Strange,Mass Effect). But the whole package? Possibly not. Ultimately, I think the answer to your question is that it doesn’t matter. Games do different things from films and comparing them in this way doesn’t actually achieve anything. Having said that, the real answer isShenmue.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterYouTubeFilm adaptationsScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why did it take so long?Jamil SmithThe racism was not new. What was new was the inability to look past it. For a moment, at least, the blinders were offWed 11 Feb 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 12.02 ESTShareJohn from New Mexico, a self-professed lifelong Republican, called intoC-Span’s Washington Journalearlier this month with penitence on his mind.“I voted for the president and supported him,”he began. “But I really want to apologize.”The caller said he had been staring at an image Americans have seen far too often in recent days: Barack and Michelle Obama, the former president and first lady, with their mouths stretched into grotesque grins and their faces affixed to the bodies of apes.Posted to President Trump’s Truth Social accountthe night before the C-Span show aired, someone deleted it the next day – but what remained was theall-too-real outrage. John from New Mexico shared it.“What an embarrassment to our country,” the caller continued. “All this man does is tell lies. He is not worthy of the presidency. He takes bribes blatantly, and now he’s being a racist blatantly.” When the anchor, Greta Brawner, asked whether he had supported Trump in all three elections, John did not hesitate. “I did,” he said. “I was sucked into the stupidity of creating jobs. There are no more jobs. Things are worse than they were before.”To his credit, John did not sound as though he was seekingforgiveness. The image of the nation’s first Black president and first lady rendered as simians appeared to snap something into focus – belatedly, but unmistakably. The racism was not new; what was new was his inability to look past it. For a moment, at least, the blinders were off, and he was willing to tell the nation.Millions of voters continue to rationalize the same machinery John claims to have finally recognized, despite the president’scollapsing approval ratingsacrossnearly every major issue. They have cast a ballot, some as many as three times, for a candidate who is allergic to accountability.In American life, apology and regret have become substitutes for accountabilityThat can’t be healthy for the country, and it hasn’t been. The consequences of Trump’s second term have been both unmistakable and unforgivable. His administration has harassed and arrested journalists. The president and his family have enriched themselves on a staggering scale –$4bn, by the New Yorker’s count. Critical climate policy has beenhollowed out. Amid astruggling economyand crateringjob market, he and his acolyteskeep scapegoating immigrantsfor the country’s ills.The human toll is harder to tally, but no less real. We can calculate the lives lost to Trump’s catastrophic mishandling of bothPuerto Rico following Hurricane Mariaandthe Covid pandemicduring his first term, as well as his continuing promotion ofjunk science. We can document thedeathsandabusesinside immigration detention facilities. We can already see the global consequences ofdismantling humanitarian aidandenvironmental safeguards. Even so, the full damage – to institutions, to norms, to lives shortened – remains incalculable.The conservative commentator Ben Shapiro recently acknowledged Trump’s flaws, butargued they were not “disqualifying”given the alternative of Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. This is the calculus: not denial of harm, but acceptance of it as a tolerable cost. That acceptance is what requires accountability – not just the initial vote, but everything that followed while voters looked away.And yet, day after day, elected officials and commentators continue toagonizeover how to talk about Trump’s voters without offending them. I understand the political instinct. There’s a greater risk than discourtesy, however. Politeness too often curdles into absolution. In the effort to avoid honesty, responsibility quietly disappears.That is why I thank John for his apology – and why I refuse to accept it.This is not a personal slight. It is a political judgment. In American life, apology and regret have become substitutes for accountability. Remorse in politics tends to emerge only after harm is undeniable, irreversible or inconvenient to ignore. Apology and regret mark the end of a conversation when they should mark the beginning of one.We have seen this pattern before. The federal government has issued formal apologies for historical atrocities tied toslavery and racial subjugation, for theconquest of Hawai’i, forthe Tuskegee syphilis experiments– as well as, during the Biden administration, the abuse withinfederal boarding schoolsof Native American children. Some apologies, such as those issued to surviving Japanese American internees, went a bit beyond “sorry” andincluded modest reparations. These apologies, imperfect though they are, at least acknowledged harm.It’s good to seeeven a small number of Republicansnow demanding that Trump apologize for his latest racist post, but their rejection of true accountability renders those demands hollow. Some do not even seem to grasp the urgency of the problem. Senator Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate,deemed it“the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House”. That statement says less about Trump’s post than about Republicans’ long effort to strip the word “racism” of any meaning that might implicate their own power.Despite remarks like Scott’s, the exhaustion these moments produce is not personal. It is generational. As the nation approaches its 250th anniversary, it remains trapped in the same moral loop regarding race and racism: harm, denial, then belated remorse without repair. Apologies buy time, but for whom?Expressing regret is meant to be the start of a reckoning, but too often it feels like an abrupt ending. What Americans need to confront is not the denial of harm, but the acceptance of it as a tolerable cost – a choice repeated again and again, through policy, silence, and the machinery voters empower. If regret does not compel responsibility, it amounts to little more than moral convenience, a way to soothe conscience while leaving power and consequence unchanged. If they are truly sorry for supporting Trump, they must do more than just say so.Jamil Smith is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s vitriol signaling about their own perceived persecutionWed 11 Feb 2026 11.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 11.02 ESTShareCan someone explain to me why Megyn Kelly is so angry? In aninterviewwith Piers Morgan, the political commentator began ranting so hard about Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time show that I was starting to worry about her health.“I’m sorry Piers. To get up there and perform the whole showin Spanishis a middle finger to the rest of America!” she roared. “We don’t need a Spanish-speaking, non-English performing performer, and we don’t need an ICE- or America-hater featured as our primetime entertainment.”When Morgan challenged her about English being the official language of the United States, she quickly shot back. “This attitude that you have here is why you in Great Britain have lost your culture. You have ceded your culture to a bunch of radical Muslims who came in and took over and now it’s gone,” she said. “We’re not allowing that here. It’s not happening in the United States of America. That’s why President Trump was elected.”Naively, I had thought this interview was about the Super Bowl.Lucky for me, Kelly did return to the game. “Football, that kind of football, is ours. They call itAmericanfootball.” (I was glad for the clarification.) “And the half-time show, and everything around it, needs to stay quintessentially American. Not Spanish, not Muslim, not anything other than good old-fashioned American apple pie. There should be a meatloaf, maybe some fried chicken, and an English-speaking performer. That’s what the Super Bowl should be.”Definitely no nachos found on football night at the Kelly house, I quickly surmised. (Seriously, who eats meatloaf on game night?)Kelly wasn’t the only commentator whose reaction to Bad Bunny’s half-time show seemed outsized, if not just a little too extreme. The Federalistcalledthe show “a humiliation”, even linking it to the Great Replacement Theory: “The audience was not invited into a shared civic experience. Instead, they were required to bear witness to the replacement of their own culture.”Trump confidante Laura Loomerwroteon X: “There’s nothing American about any of this.” Conservative commentator Will Chamberlainopinedthat “yes the Bad Bunny trash was political and yes it’s about weakening and undermining the United States.” And Donald Trumpcalledthe show “a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country”, and said that “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying.”Actually, Mr President, according to a 2025reportfrom the well-respected Instituto Cervantes, the United States currently has approximately 45 million native speakers of Spanish, and another 20 million non-native speakers, which the institute defines as those with “sufficient knowledge to communicate in Spanish with native and non-native speakers”. At 65 million Hispanophones, the United States has more Spanish speakers than Spain. Thank you for your attention to this matter.This kind of vitriolic response blows back regularly from the right, with the force of an exhaust from a jetliner. It’s not virtue signaling. It’s vitriol signaling, and it’s part of the right’s attack arsenal. Even though it is now the party in power, holding both the executive and legislative branches of government along with a generally sympathetic US supreme court, the Maga-right believes that it is the one truly aggrieved population in the country. Not only does Maga believe this, Maga wallows in the idea of its own persecution. Maga sings songs to it. Maga celebrates it.That was precisely the mood at the “alternative” half-time show organized by Turning Point USA (TPUSA), the conservative organization founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last year. Dubbed the “All-American Halftime Show”, this extravaganza hosted four different country music singers – Brantley Gilbert, Gabby Barrett, Lee Brice and Kid Rock – who offered about 15 minutes of music as a tribute to Kirk, who was celebrated at the end of the show as a martyr for their cause.Those who dare decry the lack of diversity on stage at the All-American show simply failed to look deeply. There was country music sung by a white guy with a beard, country music sung by a white guy with a shorter beard, country music sung by a woman with blond hair and Kid Rock. Diversity is our strength.Erika Kirk, the current CEO and chair of TPUSA and Charlie Kirk’s widow,toldFox News days earlier that what’s “beautiful” about TPUSA is its ability to “provide an alternative that is pro-America, that is just pro-everything”. Meanwhile, some of the biggest applause of the night came when Brice trotted out a new song – Country Nowadays, in which he sang: “It ain’t easy being country, in this country nowadays.” Why, you ask? Brice will tell you: “The directions, the finger pointing, when everything goes up in flames.” Finger pointing. Right.At every opportunity, including the All-American half-time show, the right tells us that they find it very upsetting if you hurt their feelings. We should stop that. Apparently, it’s un-American.And this is what the right’s vitriol signaling ultimately comes down to. It’s long been the case that, to those who have power over others, equality looks a lot like oppression. The Maga world wants to elevate this moral hypocrisy into an angry talking point, then a meme, then a song, and then a veritable discourse on its own so it feels true, even when it’s not.Contrast this, then, with Bad Bunny’s official half-time show. There was nothing maudlin or self-pitying about his performance. It was joyous and complex, intimate and historical, and it managed to do all of that all at once. It felt like a celebration of life, and you didn’t need to follow the words, because you just needed to feel the beat. (Asked if people must know Spanish to appreciate this show, Bad Bunnysaid: “It’s better they learn to dance. There’s no better dance than the one that comes from the heart.”) The performance concluded with a big banner that read “The only thing more powerful than hate is love” and with Bad Bunny holding a football (the USA kind) with text that read: “Together, we are America.”That American conservatives saw that last line as “subversive” shows you the depths of the problem we face in this country. While some of us realize that we have and even like our neighbors, others seem to think we live, or should live, in a hermetically sealed-off land. The two positions are completely incommensurate, which is why, in this case, two halves – that is to say, two half-time shows – will never equal one.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsBad BunnyOpinionUS politicsSuper Bowl LXcommentShareReuse this content"

But the truth is international sport is still important to MoscowWed 11 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 10.06 ESTShareDuma member Vitaly Milonov didn’t mince words when asked four years ago about the international ban against Russian athletes.“There’s no point in humiliating ourselves and begging to be let in,” said the St Petersburg deputy, a member of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party. “We have our pride.” International events had been corrupted by the United States, he claimedin a 2022 interview, just weeks after the International Olympic Committee and other governing bodiesimposed the ban. “Only Russia can say no. Other countries will accept whatever nonsense the Americans force on them – teams of vegans, queers and lesbians.”Some Russian commentators have taken similar stances toward this year’s Milano Cortina Winter Games, asking why their athletes should even bother with the Olympics. The Paris Games were said to be a cesspool of un-Russian immorality – “the Olympics from hell,”one news siteproclaimed. And with the national team still excluded, competition this year will be subpar. “The Olympics have lost their importance as a global competition,” Milonovsaid in January.IOC president gives clearest signal so far that Russia could be at 2028 OlympicsRead moreDisgruntled Duma members can badmouth the Olympics all they want. The fact is the world’s biggest sporting event is still significant for Moscow, not only as a showplace for its top athletes but also as a political tool. As far back as the 1950s, Soviet leaders saw the Olympics and world championships as a means of demonstrating their country’s superiority. Putin has had this same aim throughout his decades in power, especially as his government has struggled to maintain infrastructure, public health and education. As political scientist Nina Kramareva explained to me, “Russia has nothing concrete to offer its own people. It has to give them gold medals.”To get its national team back in the hunt for Olympic medals, Russia must clear two hurdles. First is the ongoing fallout from the doping scandal that broke in 2014. After investigations by the World Anti-Doping Agencyrevealed a massive, state-directed operation, the Moscow testing lab and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) lost international certification. Russian athletes now submit their urine samples to Turkey.The Russians haven’t been entirely aboveboard in their attempts to regain certification. After the Moscow lab reluctantly handed over digital testing records, Wada tech specialistsfound evidenceof more than 20,000 deleted files. The cover-up led to sanctions imposed in 2020, requiring Russian athletes to compete at the Beijing and Tokyo Games under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee rather than the Russian state.In 2025, Russian anti-doping officials made their first appearance at the Wada conference in years, with Rusada chief Veronika Loginova declaring the agencyhad met requirements. The international body, however, states that Rusada is still not in compliance. Loginova is undeterred. Sheannounced her readinessto take over as Wada’s next president.The other hurdle to Russia’s Olympic return is, of course, the war in Ukraine. Within weeks of the February 2022 invasion, the IOC and other governing bodies banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from international competition. The following year, more than 30 nations, led by the UK and including France, Italy, and the US (the hosts of the 2024, 2026 and 2028 Olympics)affirmed their oppositionto Russian and Belarusian participation.Ukrainians angry with IOC after ‘betrayal’ of banning helmet with images of dead athletesRead moreMoscow slammed the ban, saying it brought politics into sport. That charge stung the sportocrats in Switzerland, who hate nothing more than being branded as political. “If politics decides who can take part in a competition, then sport and athletes become tools of politics,”saidIOC President Thomas Bach in March 2023, in response to the UK-led declaration. He offered sympathy to the people of Ukraine. “On the other hand,” he added, “we have, as a global organisation, a responsibility towards human rights and the Olympic Charter.” To Bach and the IOC, this responsibility meant opening a path for Russian and Belarusian athletes.Prior to the Paris Games, the IOC established a procedure enabling individual Russians and Belarusians to compete. Prospective Olympians had to be clean from doping, have no military connections, and have no record of supporting the war. Once approved by a special review panel, Russians and Belarusians were able to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs). (AIN status could not be granted in team sports, as any group of athletes would represent their nation.)In 2024, Moscow denounced the IOC’s concession as no concession at all. According to a sports official, Russian athleteswere expected to“renounce their country’s flag and anthem, their national identity, their civil rights”. Nonetheless, Russia launched a legal barrage to get as many athletes as possible cleared for this year’s Milano Cortina Games. When the AIN review panel rejected the application of cross-country skier Aleksandr Bolshunov, a Russian attorney based in Switzerland appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Bolshunov had won three gold medals in Beijing, and he was a favorite to win more gold in Italy.Infantino and Coventry backing Russia’s return shows sport’s soft power is in rotten hands | Emma JohnRead moreBolshunov’s lawyer argued that his application had been arbitrarily rejected with no explanation. “The athlete has fully complied with all the requirements of the AIN Policy,” the skier’s attorneyinsisted. The appeal made no mention, however, of Bolshunov’s promotion from lieutenant to captain in the Russian national guard after winning in Beijing – “a true inspiration for military personnel”,the guard’s commander said. The appeal likewise didn’t address Bolshunov’spresence on stageat the March 2022 rally at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium in support of the invasion of Ukraine.Bolshunov’s case illustrates the difficulties in bringing Russia back into international sport. The skier is by no means unusual in his military status. Most medals claimed by Russia at both Beijing and Tokyo were won by athletes affiliated with the military and security services. Similarly, Bolshunov is one ofseveral Russian athleteswho have expressed support for Putin and the war.As Bolshunov’s appeal shows, governing bodies shouldn’t expect Moscow to admit any fault in the vague “politics” blocking its athletes, just as there has never been admission of the state-run doping program. Nevertheless, sports federations appear ready to let Russia back in the game. Fifa President Gianni Infantinodeclared last weekthat the ban “has not achieved anything.” The IOC wants Russian and Belarusian athletes tocompete in the 2026 Youth Olympicsunder their national flags. This past November, the head of the Russian Olympic Committee, Mikhail Degtyarev,stated the Milano Cortina Games will be the last Olympicsin which Russians participate as neutrals.In the meantime, officials and former Olympians are calling on Russians to support their Individual Neutral Athletes. Sports mediahave dubbedthe 13 AINs the “Russian team”. As for the athletes who are excluded, they are also proof of Russia’s sporting prowess. After all, it’s not only politics that keeps talents like Aleksandr Bolshunov out of the Games; there is also a conspiracy to prevent the world’s best athletes from rightfully taking gold.

Maybe she was a double agent?Wed 11 Feb 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 13.00 ESTShareAntonia Romeo is expected to become thefirst female cabinet secretaryshortly, an appointment that is “controversial”, according to conservative commentators, since the mandarin is the“queen of woke”. But how did she come by that title? What are her woke credentials – and how did she rise to preeminence?The civil service itself often sets off the woke tripwire, owing to workplace conventions such as respecting people’s pronouns and having sick leave. Often it’s even less specific, a vague but fiery opposition confected by someone who is anti-woke. So Jacob Rees-Mogg might take issue with the civil serviceallowing home working, and it will be a classic battle against woke (similar to Nigel Farage lumping in council employees who work from home with thoseworking on DEIor climate). If you were asked to explain verbally why commuting to an office is conservative and working from home is liberal, you’d struggle: but nobody has to, because anti-woke warriors fight under the banner of common sense, which doesn’t have to show its workings.It wouldn’t be logical, however, to say Romeo was a controversially woke choice just because she was a civil servant; by that rationale, any cabinet secretary would be controversial. There are certainly conservatives who think so. One is named Liz Truss, who recently said on her YouTube channel that if there were a new series of Yes Minister, Humphrey Applebywould be a radicalised trans activist. To unpick that remark, as an analysis of the wokeness of the civil service, would take a while. But that isn’t the mainstream rightwing view on the civil service, yet.Romeo, furthermore, has held a high rank in every government since David Cameron’s. Was Cameron woke? You might say so,because of the huskies, and a remark he made (this is going back a bit) about wanting his party tobe more Polly Toynbee. As for those who kept Romeo on after Cameron, Theresa May was woke because she sometimes spoke thoughtfully about mental health. After that, it changes. Boris Johnson was anti-woke before the word even existed. Rishi Sunak spent 2023waging a war on woke. No self-respecting queen of woke would have worked under these people, unless as a double agent.How does woke start winning again? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreMaybe it would help to nail down what “woke” means. It’swell knownthat it was coined by African American civil rights activists in the 1930s, and that “stay woke” meant stay aware of racial prejudice and structural racist discrimination. When it expanded to encompass other prejudices in the 2010s, you could have argued, and some did, that there was a fine line between co-opting vocabulary as an act of intersectional solidarity and purloining a word in a way that made it less useful.But there’s no point relitigating that, because the word no longer means “having an awareness of structural oppression, both of oneself and of others, with a mind to rooting it out at source and creating a fairer and better society”. Now, as the case of Romeo illustrates, it can mean anything: it can mean you’re a civil servant or a woman, or a police officer or a teacher or an HR person, or a parking attendant or the king (although the king would never be called king of woke – he is somewhat a woke king because he believes in the climate crisis).The definition has no hard edges. It can be something you are or something you think, and it doesn’t even have to be about a person – it can be a membership organisation (the National Trust) or a set of institutions (the law courts). Applied to disability, it is particularly dismaying and all-encompassing, since if you have a disability and want not to be oppressed, that makes you superwoke, but all institutions and processes that accommodate you – whether that’s a local authority giving you a special educational needs (SEN) certificate, or the Department for Work and Pensions paying personal independence payment (Pip) – then become woke. The only way to be disabled and not to be considered woke would be if you embarked on a permanent campaign against your own rights.Gen Z, which seems to have a much more reflexive understanding of when a term is being strategically overdeployed, call everything woke as a way to neutralise the word altogether. Activities considered woke in my house include, but are not limited to: eating Weetabix without milk; revising in pyjamas; washing.Ultimately, wokeness is a label you can only avoid being applied to you by actively fighting it – by being anti-woke. It wouldn’t even be enough to simply say “I’m not woke”, because you’re leaving the door open. You cannot spectate the war on woke; you have to go over the top.The vagueness, the contradictions, the tautologies, the breadth, the hyperbole, the multipurpose uselessness of this word are all part of the point. It builds the concept as a spectre, you cannot grasp it or pin it down. It cannot be vanquished because, meaning a different thing in every context, every mouth, it can endlessly regenerate. It has to be fought because it corrodes everything about your nation and its story. But you must also accept that this is a forever war.It’s still not clear how the future cabinet secretary got to be queen of woke. I thought there’d be some kind of application process.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He should read it and fastJohn McTernanWhile things are terrible right now, he has a radical manifesto to draw on, a landslide majority and breathing space. But he must seize the dayWed 11 Feb 2026 09.54 ESTFirst published on Wed 11 Feb 2026 09.53 ESTShareAfter his worst week ever, could Keir Starmer be about to have a season of renewal? Quite possibly, if he learns from hisnear-death experience.When most leaders stumble, they don’t get a second chance: they are too exposed and their rivals pounce. As the saying goes, in politics your enemies are all on your own side – the opposition are merely opponents. But this isn’t a late third-term government running out of road with a slim majority and no new ideas. It’s only about a year and half in, with aradical manifestoanda landslide majority. As prime minister, Starmer not only has breathing space but also the most untrammelled power of any democratic leader in the global north. Even Donald Trump has individual states to contend with – the UK is a unitary system. So here are 10 steps Starmer can take to stay in office.1.Bring the current crisis to a close by publishing every single one of the emails and messages from Peter Mandelson to cabinet ministers, junior ministers and advisers. Look carefully for any attempts to influence government contracts. Take charge personally – this has to happen as soon as possible. And you need to decide quickly who will have to resign.2.Closing this issue frees you to pursue one of the agendas you are most personally committed to: restoring trust in politics. That needs to extend well beyond the initial steps suggested by yourchief secretary, Darren Jones. Again, own this. You have a second act, make it count. Implement all ofGordon Brown’s reforms.3.The resignations you will have to request will give you a range of vacancies. Use them wisely. Bring a visible end to factionalism. Reward talent, particularly in ideas and persuasion. You don’t need a government of all the talents – you need a government of all the storytellers.4.Refound the government on the politics that have always been yours – the politics of the soft left. It’s where the country is. Why did Nigel Farage cosplay social democracy last year when he posed as the workers’ friend andsuggested nationalising British Steel? Voters want to see an active government – and you believe in intervention. If the owners of Thames Water say they cannot abide by existingregulationsand trade profitably, then take the company from them at the low value they claim it has.5.Meet the voters where they are and answer their deepest needs. Although nationalisation was the right move, the biggest driver of the cost of living isn’t train fares; in 2024, aYouGov surveyfound that 21% of British adults never used trains. It’s housing. Rents are ridiculous, as are house prices. But building numbers will never shift unless the government starts building again like it did in the 1970s, when councils such as Southwark in London built thousands of homes. Government land is there to build500,000 homesover the rest of the parliament. Use development corporations and speed up the process, like Michael Heseltine did.6.Reindustrialise the country. Construction is one leg of the stool. Defence is another – procurement here is central to industrial strategy. Does that mean planning? Yes, it does. Once again, the man and woman in Whitehall know best in terms of the threats to our security and the deployment of resources to key localities. Pride in place can be a new arms factory.7.You need an emblem for your commitment to infrastructure. Thefirst new reservoirs for decadesare nice – and necessary – but not a statement of intent or a symbol of national renewal. So, reinstate HS2 to take growth to the north and give a victory to Manchester and Leeds. It was a failure of belief in Britain for the Tories tocancel it.8.Do the little things that matter. Look at how Zohran Mamdani has used Lina Khan tolook at the costs that annoy New Yorkers. She found a law that can cap the overpricing of beer in sports stadiums. Get the Competition and Markets Authority to do a similar project for you. Quality of life isn’t just costs, it’s also niggles such as getting out of online subscriptions or changing mobile phone contracts. Let pharmacists provide more care. Make Britain Easier Again.9.You know more than anyone that Brexit is the source of almost all that is wrong in the UK. Outside the EU, it is harder to have real management of irregular migration. Rejoining the single market is one of the few magic bullets for growth, productivity and prosperity. Given the centrality of the UK to the defence of Ukraine and the rebuilding of European defence and security, this is an ideal moment for you to get the right terms for the country. You have to own a positive pivot as well as sorting the problems that caused the current crisis.10.Above all else, burn up the road. Let this moment set you free. Return to the safety of the manifesto – it was radical and got a massive mandate in your landslide majority. Remember, none of the errors that have cut Labour’s support were in the manifesto. Get out ahead and stay ahead.John McTernan was Tony Blair’s political secretary at 10 Downing StreetExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourNigel FarageConservativesHS2commentShareReuse this content"

This is undeniable. The evidence is long and clear.Whether it be the 50% capital gains tax discount John Howard introduced in 1999, the continuation of negative gearing, or the use of first home buyer grants, government policies have overwhelmingly ensured more people are bidding for houses at auctions.What are the odds? The RBA has raised interest rates – for no real reason other than to meet the desires of speculators | Greg JerichoRead moreBut, as everyone knows, the more people bidding for a property, the higher the price goes.The government’s latest housing brain flub was the 5% deposit guarantee for first home buyers. Last year, I suggested it was set to be yet anothermiserable policy failure.And now the evidence is in.Thelending figuresreleased on Tuesday for the December quarter of last year cover the first three months of the deposit guarantee. In that quarter the number of people taking out first home buyer home loans rose 6.8% – the biggest one-quarter jump for two years.But it wasn’t a record, and certainly nothing like what we saw during the global financial crisis or pandemic years when the government went all out to encourage housing:If the graph does not display click hereAnd while there was a nice increase in first home buyers, the overall number remains pretty weak, especially when you take into account population growth. There are much fewer first home buyers relative to the size of the labour force than in the past.A big reason for this is that the cost of buying a home is so much greater now than it was 20 years ago.And this problem has been made worse due to the government’s 5% deposit scheme.Because while the number of first home buyers might have gone up, the amount of money they have borrowed went up much more. In the December quarter the value of all those first home buyer home loans went up 15.5% – more than double the increase in the number of loans.That means the average size of those home loans went up 8.3% in three months – a record one-quarter jump. It was also well above the 2.8% increase in the average size of home loans for non-first home buyers:If the graph does not display click hereIt meant that, in the December quarter, the average home loan for first home buyers hit a record $607,545:If the graph does not display click hereThe average value of a first home buyer home loan is now 12% higher than it was a year ago. Given wage growth in the past year has been about 3.4%, that means the cost of buying a first home has deteriorated at a terrible pace.And the impact is on everyone’s housing affordability.As I also noted last year, the announcement of the 5% deposit guarantee sent investors storming into the market trying to get in before the first home buyers.Those investors remain in the market. The growth of the value of investor home loans rose 32% in the past year – faster than the 22% increase for first home buyers and well above the 17% increase for non-first home buyers:If the graph does not display click hereAnd it all adds to the amount of money being bid on for houses.First home buyer loans usually make up about 17% of the total value of all loans, but in the December quarter they accounted for 27% of the increase in home loans.And we know that when the amount of money being loaned rises, so too does the price of property:If the graph does not display click hereThe good news isthere are rumoursthat the government might finally be looking at a housing policy that takes some of the heat out of the market, rather than adding to it.Rumours that the government will reduce or eliminate the 50% capital gains tax discount are growing.This would be a great policy move.As I havelong argued, the introduction of the capital gain tax discount helped turn the housing market into a speculators’ dream, and sent house prices soaring:If the graph does not display click hereData this week from the Parliamentary Budget Office also showed just how unequal the benefits of the tax discount are.The PBO estimates that in this current financial year the discount will cost $21.8bn in revenue forgone. The richest 1% will get 59% or $12.9bn of it:If the graph does not display click hereThe 5% deposit guarantee did what everyone expected – it made housing affordability worse. But if the government fixes the capital gains tax discount in the May budget, it will at least be able to say it is a government that finally delivered a housing policy that stops making the bad situation even worse.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at the Australia InstituteExplore more on these topicsHousingGrogonomicsAustralian economyAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It spills as it lands on the bar, sending a little eddy of suds down the glass, into the lattice of branded rubber matting, a place where neither scrubbing brushes nor a desperate human tongue can penetrate. Typical. My5p Reform windfall, gone in the clumsy flick of a wrist. I guard the pint carefully as I weave a perilous path to my table, quietly satisfied at pushing another struggling family closer to penury.Still, what is the pub if not a place for letting loose and sidestepping the usual laws of economics? It is surely no accident thatNigel Faragechose a Westminster boozer to launch his latest crime against mathematics last week, promising a £3bn tax relief for the hospitality sector – equivalent to 5p off a pint – to be paid for by the reinstatement of the two-child benefit cap.Never mind that HMRC’s own estimates blow a hole in his sums, assessing his buffet of inducements atabout £10bn more than budgeted. Within these four wood-panelled walls, anything goes. The questions will be softball and the banter will be legendary. No mate, no no mate, hear me out. You know how Labour took450,000 childrenout of poverty? What if we put them back in … and spent the money on pints for the lads instead?But, of course, attention to fiscal detail has never really been part of Reform UK’s personal brand. The optics are the point here, and while it was very sweet of the Labour press office to put out apolicy-based rebuttal– extension of World Cup opening hours, something called the hospitality support fund – as with most pub debates this is not really an argument that can be won with facts and figures. A more urgent and pertinent question is why the hard right has increasingly chosen this as its battleground, why this most public of spaces is becoming a sphere of political contention.Like many former public schoolboys, Farage loves to romanticise the pub as a sort of keyboard shortcut to working-class authenticity. One of his earlyGB Newssegments was called Talking Pints, where Farage and a guest would sit in a Paddington studio against an electronic backdrop of a traditional English pub, sipping from a beer placed in front of them by a member of the production staff and talking about, I dunno, probably “woke”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer pulls a pint at the Chainlocker pub in Falmouth in 2020.Photograph: Hugh Hastings/Getty ImagesThe same aesthetic survives today on Talk’s Sunday-afternoon show Grumpy Old Men, a show I swear was commissioned for the sole purpose of generating standup material for Stewart Lee. In it, three men sit in a similar studio in front of a similar pub backdrop and moan about topics ranging from Ulez to veganism to people who sneeze, with a rage so effortless and pure that you could almost swear they were producing it on demand for money.And so when the likes of Farage talk about saving the great British pub, when Reform’s Lee Anderson says “every pub is a parliament”, they are really evoking a very specific image: “a stereotype of pubs as spaces for older white men to sit and drink,” as the Green MPSiân Berry puts it. A kind of pub cosplay, the safety and impunity of an imagined past, a refuge where old white lads can say whatever they like without ever being challenged.Naturally this is a place shorn of society’s inconveniences: Muslims, families, the young people increasingly forsaking the pub for sobriety, digital socialising and cheaper supermarket drinking. Occasionally Grumpy Old Men will invite a woman on to the panel, who will be deemed an “honorary bloke” and have a moustache drawn on her.And the reason that this is fertile ground for the right is that for a broad swathe of society, the pub is objectively a brilliant invention. You love the pub. I love the pub. Indeed, I am typing these very words from a pub (The Sun of Camberwell). About 78% of these columns are written in the pub, and particularly attentive readers will invariably be able to spot the bit when the fourth pint begins to kick in and the hard details begin to blur into unfocused polemic, run-on sentences, made-up numbers.But the danger arises when we confuse one particular vision of the pub, one demographic, for the whole experience. The real beauty of the great British pub is its sheer versatility, the way the setting moulds around its people, the ability to choose your own adventure: desi pub, country pub, chain pub, gastropub, darts pub, gay pub, old man pub, gay old man pub, the pub with the trans pride flag hanging behind the bar, the pub with £20 roasts and a dog bowl in the corner, the pub that smells of hair where the pool table can be unlocked with a single well-placed hair clip.And while pubs are closing up and down the country – aboutone a day across 2024 and 2025– arguably as big a danger is the increasing homogeneity of the pubs that remain: devoured by the big chains, caught in a deadly pincer movement of societal change, institutional neglect and hostile licensing regulations. It is a handy fiction to imagine that all this can be fixed through tax tweaks alone, particularly from a party in thrall toneoliberal economicsandsuper-rich donors, being cheered on by the chair of Wetherspoons and the chief executive of Fuller’s.This is, in short, a battle that can still be won. Perhaps not by Labour, with its soiled reputation and talent for unintelligible jargon, but by those willing to fight for the simple malleable joy of the pub in all its forms. To reject the ersatz fantasy economics of Reform and its backers, a vision of the pub rooted in a past that never existed. Because – and every seasoned drinker knows this instinctively – every pub also has its crashing bores.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPubsOpinionReform UKNigel FarageGB NewscommentShareReuse this content"

That’s why I’m taking parliamentary action to curb itWed 11 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 06.12 ESTShareHow often have you slumped into an armchair and surfed various streaming platforms in search of escape? Even if not looking for them, you’ll have been bombarded by a vast array of crime procedurals made in the UK, the US, various continental jurisdictions and further afield. They are set in gritty urban and idyllic rural landscapes; in country houses and even submarines. Whether featuring hardbitten veteran cops or gifted middle-class amateurs, what they all have in common is murder.Middle England is seemingly addicted to these TV dramas and the books that inspired so many of them. The creativity that produces them is big business. But what if those who write or even just enjoy this form of popular art found themselves prosecuted for real crime, with their work or taste used as evidence of criminality? If you find this possibility ridiculous, spare a thought for the increasing number of young black men and boys charged with “gang-related offences” on the basis of their participation in, or mere engagement with rap and drill music. It’s as though prosecutors were watchingThe Night Managerand trying to send Hugh Laurie to prison.It is more than three years since the Guardian publishedan excellent pieceby Ciaran Thapar, a youth worker and writer, who shared his experience of refuting music evidence in a trial in which a group of young people faced charges of conspiracy to possess a firearm. Now, some white middle-aged police officers routinely put themselves forward as expert witnesses as to the appropriate interpretation of this predominantly youth cultural phenomenon.Reliance on this evidence to prove motive, intention or criminal propensity is prejudiced and prejudicial. It risks grave miscarriages of justice, not least when accompanied by the dangerous doctrine of joint enterprise. The Crown Prosecution Service doesn’t keep records on the use of rap music as evidence, but a study by the University of Manchesteridentified 68 casesinvolving 252 defendants between 2020 and 2023. This is probably a significant underestimate given that first instance trials are not often reported in the media or on legal databases. Two-thirds of the defendants in the Manchester study were black, and 12% were mixed race; 82% were under 25 years old, with 15% aged 17 or younger. More than half the cases were joint-enterprise prosecutions.View image in fullscreenAdemola Adedeji at an event in Canary Wharf, London, in September 2025.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIn the case of the “Manchester 10”, black teenagers were collectively sentenced in 2022 to 131 years in prison for conspiracy to murder and to cause grievous bodily harm. During the trial, a nine-second video clip of someone identified as one of the defendants, with drill music in the background, was used as evidence of hisgang membership. In closing, the prosecution silk told the jury that some of the defendants had become involved in gang culture “because they had an interest in drill with its themes of violence, drugs and criminality”. The appeal court found that a police officer hadmisidentified Ademola Adedejias the person in the video. The young man in question was of good character and had no gang connections. The video had nothing to do with gangs and didn’t even include rapping. Adedeji’s conviction was quashed, but only after he had served three years in prison.Equality before the law is an age-old principle of justice. It requires that no one be above the law’s reach, nor below its protection. The shameful events currently rocking our politics only highlight the dangers of entitlement and hypocrisy, and the obvious destruction of trust in our vital institutions when there is “one law for some” and no fair hearing for others. That is why I have joined forces with my old friend Doreen Lawrence and the Art Not Evidence campaign totable an amendmentto the victims and courts bill currently before parliament.It is a modest but vital reform that would create a presumption that creative expression on the part of a defendant should not be admissible unless four tests are met. First, the expression must have a literal rather than figurative or fictional meaning. Second, it must refer to the specific facts of the alleged offence. Third, it is relevant to an issue of fact in dispute, and, last, that issue cannot be decided by other evidence. In applying these common-sense principles, courts would have to consider various factors, including the artistic conventions of the genre in question. Experts should be truly independent. Further, in the rare cases in which creative expression was admitted, the judge would give directions to the jury not to be influenced by stereotypes.Racial stereotypes are a real danger in this context. A lack of knowledge or understanding of rap lyrics and imagery will ignore the symbolism, storytelling and exaggeration that are key features of one of the UK’s most widely consumed cultural forms. The misuse of the music in prosecutions also risks suppressing the enjoyment and expression of the art form in underprivileged communities that find it both creative and cathartic.The deputy prime minister, who is now the justice secretary, was the author of the groundbreaking 2017Lammy Reportinto the criminal justice system. Surely he will listen. Surely he must agree that just as the singing of rebel songs in north London pubs was never a reliable marker of terrorism, that the Police’sEvery Breath You Takedoesn’t prove Sting is a stalker, and that my love of Coppola movies doesn’t make me a mobster, for new generations in multiracial Britain, rap and drill is overwhelmingly art – and not reliable evidence.Shami Chakrabarti is a lawyer, Labour peer, former shadow attorney general and the author of Human Rights: The Case for the DefenceDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If their homes are shoddily built, what hope do the rest of us have?Wed 11 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 11.28 ESTShareEven multimillionaires can’t escape Britain’s cowboy builders, it seems. Last week, residents of One Hyde Park, the UK’smost expensive flats,won a £35m court caseagainst the contractor that built their homes. The high court ordered the construction company Laing O’Rourke to fix defective pipework that was discovered to be causing problems in 2014, only three years after the luxury development was completed.At the other end of the economy, tens of thousands of families are facing damp and mould issues also caused by botched building works. A National Audit Office investigation revealed in October last year that a staggering 98% of external insulation fitted under the previous government’shome-improvement schemeswas installed so ineptly that it will have to be repaired or replaced.Across the UK, an epidemic of similar stories reveals a brewing crisis in construction quality. New-build houses are regularly beset withshoddy workmanship. In Croydon, an almost brand-new35-storey tower is already so riddled with mould and leaksthat residents are being moved out for major repairs. Barratt Redrow, one of the UK’s largest property developers, recently uncovered £248m ofdefects across their portfolio.At every tier of society, the UK seems hamstrung by abysmal construction standards, unable to build anything without catastrophic bodges and eye-watering remediation bills. How did building in Britain get so bad?“We are the dinosaurs of construction in Europe,” Barbara Jones, a veteran builder with 45 years of experience on construction sites, tells me. “I work with people from lots of different countries and they are laughing at us. They think we’re ridiculous, that we don’t value skill. A tradesperson is nothing here. Whereas in Germany, it’s a very respected job.”When it’s developers v people, usually the money wins. I saw how one community came out on top | Jason OkundayeRead moreJones says there seems to be a devaluing of practical skills in schools – a process kickstarted when Britain’s Skills Training Agency, which had for decades offered rigorous tuition across a variety of vocations, wassold off under the Thatcher government. Despitewarningsthat privatisation would be unsustainable and could lead to asset-stripping and lower-quality courses, the Conservatives flogged the organisation to a private company in 1990 that wentbust only three years later. The fiasco precipitated a nationwide collapse of construction training, compounded by a lack of legal protection for specialist roles in the sector.In many developed economies, skilled construction jobs are strictly regulated in the same way as they are for doctors and lawyers, so that only fully qualified professionals can take on these roles. In Germany, which is widely considered to enjoy a significantly higher standard of construction than the UK carpenters, roofers, architects, bricklayers and plumbers must all be properly trained and accredited before they can practise. In the UK, however, anyone – regardless of qualifications – can be a carpenter orperform the functions of an architect.The UK’s extensive building regulations don’t protect us from sloppy construction, either. Britain hasthousands of rulesgoverning the design of new architecture, covering everything from the width of doorways to the gradient of staircases. But in practice, local building control inspectors are not able to double-check the quality of every brick that’s laid. It was once standard practice for developers to employ an independent clerk of works, as is still common on the continent, who’d visit construction sites frequently to monitor the quality of workmanship. These days, the role hasall but lapsedor is performed by the contractors themselves, in effect allowing them to mark their own homework.In the past, architects were often charged with overseeing build quality on the buildings they designed. But in recent years, a new type of construction contract has given builders more power to make changes to the projects they are working on without external oversight. The “design and build” contract has becomenotorious among architectsas a bodger’s charter, enabling unscrupulous builders to cut costs by, for example, swapping out high-quality materials for cheaper alternatives.Some have even arguedthat the design and build contract, under which architects are only involved as initial design consultants before builders take over responsibility for finishing a project, contributed to theGrenfell Towerfire tragedy.“There’s a culture of cost-cutting, whether for social housing or for high end,” explains architect Astrid Smitham, whose housing scheme in Barking, designed with Nicholas Lobo Brennan,won the UK’s most prestigious affordable housing prizein 2023. The pair have worked in Europe as well as in Britain, witnessing first-hand how much worse the culture of our construction sector has become as contracting firms cut corners to make more money and replace labourers’ day rates with piecework. This system sees builders paid a small fixed amount for each task they complete rather than an hourly wage, incentivising working as quickly as possible and cutting corners.Inferior modern materials have also played a role in the decline of UK building quality. In the past, British architecture was predominantly made with flexible and breathable materials such as Victorian lime mortar, which was able to handle temperature fluctuations, moisture changes and ground movements. Today, construction is dominated by cheaper, more rigid materials such as cement, which is prone to crack over time.So, what needs to change? Most importantly, the political appetite to improve building standards. The fact that the construction quality crisis has been brewing for so long without meaningful action from the government is, however, hardly surprising given how underrepresented construction workers are in politics. More than10% of the workforceare in a skilled trade occupation, but hardly any of our MPs have a background in manual labour. If theGreen party candidate Hannah Spencerwins the Gorton and Denton byelection, she’ll probably be the only plumber in parliament.Britain’s construction quality crisis isn’t a mystery, but the logical outcome of political choices. It’s the result of deregulation, privatisation and allowing the primacy of cost-cutting profiteers to supplant quality control and craft. When you rob building of its dignity, you don’t get efficiency; you get mould, leaks and devastating repair bills at every rung of the social ladder. Until those choices are reversed, we’ll keep building problems faster than we can fix them.Phineas Harper is a writer and curatorExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionConstruction industryPropertyCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

All the things that aren’t good government age a regime. Keir Starmer haspresided over a lot of woesin 18 months, making a young government look old.The premature decrepitude is more advanced, and more disturbing toLabourMPs, because it feels like continuity from the turbulent Tory regime that came before. The policies and personnel are different, but to the casual passing voter the sound of screaming and breaking crockery around Downing Street is familiar as a sign of a political problem family in residence.All the more so when it isPeter Mandelson’s namebeing howled in despair, conjuring memories of ministerial misdeeds from a bygone era. Starmer has only been an MP since 2015, but he looks broken under the cumulative weight of a decades-old incumbency.That explains the depths of the prime minister’s unpopularity. Even Labour MPs who are infuriated by all the errors of judgment – not least the calamitous choice of Mandelson as ambassador to Washington – think Starmer is a decent man with an honourable sense of civic duty. He is not a crook or a sleazebag. They understand public disappointment, but are stunned by how venomously it is expressed on the doorstep; the hatred.The problem isn’t only that change was promised and is being delivered too slowly. That is Starmer’s preferred diagnosis because it suggests he could still turn things around. But he is reviled by too many voters as the archetypal status-quo politician – the incarnation of everything people hoped they were disposing of at the last election.There is no coming back from that. MPs have been saying as much in private for weeks. Anas Sarwar, the party’s leader in Scotland, became the most senior figure to go public on Monday, calling for the prime ministerto stand down. The effect was to rally adefensive circlearound Starmer. Supportive cabinet statements were issued. He was warmly received at a meeting of the parliamentary party. The shards of smashed crockery were swept under a committee room rug.Most English Labour MPs agree with Sarwar’s analysis. They know their leader is a liability and unlikely to undergo some late-career metamorphosis into a beloved, visionary political commander. The only difference is proximity of electoral reckoning.Scottish Labour minds are focused on the Holyrood ballot in May and the increasingly remote chance of ending 19 years of Scottish National party rule. Sarwar’s campaign may not be saved by cutting the cord that lashes him to a zombie regime in Downing Street, but it has to be worth a try. Labour MPs at Westminster will come to the same view in due course, when their own seats are at stake.Some have reached that conclusion already and are exasperated by what they see as cowardice and denial in their colleagues. If the leader is taking them on a downward spiral towards defeat, they argue, every day without change lengthens the climb back towards victory.The rebuttal, and the view that has prevailed for now, is that change for its own sake replaces one problem with many others. Binning a prime minister so soon after winning an election would eliminate any doubt in voters’ minds that Labour is chaotic, incompetent, absurd. A contest may aggravate factional divisions instead of healing them. The winner would face the same intractable policy dilemmas that have defeated Starmer. The fiscal straitjacket tailored for the 2024 election manifesto would still apply, as would the political hazard involved in ripping it up.MPs who raise those reservations rarely believe that Starmer should lead them into the next general election. More often, they mean that a contest right now doesn’t suit their preferred replacement.Supporters of Andy Burnham have yet to devise a new route back into parliament for the Greater Manchester mayor after his candidacy for the Gorton and Denton byelectionwas blocked.Public faith in politics is now in the gutter. Here’s how Labour should drag it out | Polly ToynbeeRead moreWes Streeting was best placed to benefit from Burnham’s exclusion, but that was before the Mandelson scandal blew up. The health secretary says tales of his supposed tutelage under the disgraced grandee are smears. He haspublished WhatsApp correspondenceto prove that there is nothing sinister in the relationship. But even if the contamination is mild, any association with the most toxic name in British politics is reason for a Streeting campaign to wait until the radioactive cloud blows over.Angela Rayner can’t move against Starmer while hertax affairsare still under investigation. If that business ends messily for the former deputy prime minister and Burnham is still out of the picture, their combined supporters would struggle to agree on a “stop Streeting” candidate.The best-organised contenders don’t have a clear shot and so hold fire. That sends Labour’s speculative eye roaming ever wider. It scans the cabinet table – Ed Miliband, Shabana Mahmood, John Healey, Yvette Cooper – without a surge of inspiration. Then, with rising desperation and a soft spot for a hard man, it flirts withAl Carns, a capable-looking former Royal Marines commando and junior defence minister. But he only entered parliament in 2024. No one who gives serious thought to what the job of prime minister involves thinks it can be nailed with beginner’s luck.The number of names swirling around is an expression of panic in paralysis. It can be true that Starmer is incapable of getting Labour out of trouble and also that the process of replacing him makes the trouble worse. It is dangerous to have a contest in the absence of an obvious successor to unite the party and restore its standing in the country. It is also hard to judge if a candidate comes close to passing that test when there isn’t a vacancy.As long as Starmer stays in office, the fantasy of an ideal replacement is still available. His departure triggers a cascade of hard questions. Why did he fail?Whendid he fail? Where was the wrong turn on a road that took the party back into government after 14 years in opposition? Which policies should be preserved? On what basis?Those inquiries poke at delicate scar tissue on Labour’s deepest wounds – the gouging defeats and bloody compromises required to return to power. They raise all the hard questions that the party chose not to ask itself in 2020 because it was demoralised, exhausted from factional feuding and fed up with losing. Starmer’s offer then was deferral of existential pain by application of intellectual anaesthesia. He is serving a similar function now. Labour MPs feel the bitter angst inexorably rising, but stick with a broken leader because they can’t get another quick fix.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of May elections join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much of a threat is Labour from both the Green party and Reform and whether Keir Starmer can survive as leader of the Labour partyBook ticketshereExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

A decisionlast weekgreenlighting Bunnings’ use of facial recognition technology to routinely monitor customers provides a not-so-happy snap of how ill-prepared Australia is for the coming AI storm.On its face, the administrative review tribunal decision to overrule the privacy commissioner’s finding that Bunnings’ use of intrusive, high-impact AI was unlawful is a technical call. But the impact will be material.Concerns ‘AI slop’ used by University of Sydney-based institute to lobby for $20m gambling education fundingRead moreExpect retailers and others operating in public spaces toscale upthe capture of our biometric information, matching it against massive and often inaccurate external databases to make real-time decisions about whether we can access what used to be the commons.Bunnings argues it was acting on concerns about in-store violence, but it chose this crude tech solution that dehumanises customers and staff in the name of their safety.Covertly tracking customers has transformed the marketplace from a place of human connection to one of automated checkouts, monitored customers and staff forced todon body-camsto document the inevitable backlash.Our outdated privacy laws, which have not had a serious makeover in 40 years, are a feature not a bug of this dystopian cycle of automation and pivotal to the broader direction big tech is taking us.0:08Can you tell the difference between Guardian journalist's voice and an AI-generated 'clone'? – audioSignificant privacy reform had been a priority of the former attorney general Mark Dreyfus, and he managed to geta modest round of changesfocused on children’s privacy through the parliament before he fell victim to internal factional machinations after the 2025 election landslide.His proposed second round of changes should not be controversial: expanding definitions of “personal information” to include our digital footprint; ending “tick a box” consent to collect and exploit personal information, giving people the right to access and erase our digital footprint – and requiring greater scrutiny of high-impact AI such as facial recognition.We know fromregular pollingthat the public emphatically supports these changes; the challenge has always been to find a way to harness this support to counter the powerful vested interests that have resisted meaningful change in this area.The list of those seeking exemptions to the bill is long; small business, media and political parties all argue their special case, while the growing list of businesses that run on the extraction of our data will do everything to protect their patch.The progress (or otherwise) of these privacy reforms will be an early test of the government’s broader approach to AI, embodied in its light-touchNational AI Plan, which preferences the update of a phalanx of existing laws over bespoke guardrails and redlines in the name of “productivity”.This strategy might look simpler on paper, but with laws fragmented and spread across multiple portfolios, the risk is that each legislative fight will pit a cashed-up tech sector and vested industry interests against under-resourced pockets of civil society.A passing glance at the work required to prepare for the coming wave includes but is not limited to:copyright(as the tech industry reboots its bid to legitimise the theft of creative output),online safety(as AI dumps “nudify” apps and sexed-up AI companions on the market with seeming impunity),consumer protection(especially the automation of sophisticated scams),workplace laws(so workers might understand how their labour is being used to drive the models that will replace them), and an onlineduty of care(to hold those who deploy the technology accountable for the impact of their tools).It’s tiring just listing these challenges, but of even greater concern is that under the National AI Plan there is no sequenced, integrated approach to lining these issues up and creating a general set of principles for how they might be addressed.That’s why the foundations for any effective social compact with AI must be a robust set of privacy principles that establish the ground rules on the collection and trade of our personal information from web and search to observed behaviour – both online and in the real world.If the AI revolution meets even a fraction of its hype, the disruptions we face as workers, as consumers and as citizens will be profound. Surely it’s not too much to ask government to take ownership and give us a collective voice in what comes next.From location to keystrokes, Australian workers’ data is being gathered by employers – with little privacy protectionRead moreWhich brings us back to Bunnings and the model of routine citizen surveillance that it normalises.We are told we need to accelerate the AI race to beat the repressiveChinese modelof constant monitoring and social credits, even while similaridentification technologyis being deployed in the United States by ICE agents and theIsraeli military in Gaza.Poignantly, privacy laws were one of the principles that emerged from the horror of the Holocaust, recognition of the dangers inherent in classifying and centralising information about citizens after itemerged how IBMhad served the Nazi regime.Indeed, the first consumer privacy laws were enacted in the 1960s in West Germany and later that unified nation was a driver of theEuropean Union’s GDPR, which remain the closest to a balanced set of principles to deal with the information age.Way before the advent of social media algorithms and language models built on the illegal harvesting of our creativity, it was recognised that we needed refuges where we were not observed and could simply be ourselves.This space has eroded gradually, but the pace of its erasure is now accelerating – from documentation to occasionally affirm an identity, to a living digital footprint that is traded between companies, to a unique biometric profile that will pre-empt and shape our every move.Without stronger privacy protections we are all guinea pigs in a real-time experiment to upturn our once private lives. If we are ever going to draw a line in the sand it needs to be now.

He met his final days with courage, faith and grace,”reads a statementshared on Van Der Beek’s official Instagram page on Wednesday.“There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother and friend.”James Van Der Beek: a life in picturesRead moreIn November 2024, Van Der Beek revealed that he had been diagnosed with bowel cancer as he prepared to appear on US charity TV special, The Real Full Monty. Based on the classic UK movie The Full Monty, the show saw a group of celebrities strip off to raise awareness of cancer. In November 2025, Van Der Beek revealedplans to auction off memorabiliaand the “treasures” he kept from working on his TV shows and films to fund his cancer treatment.Born in Connecticut in 1977, Van Der Beek initially preferred sports to the arts, until a childhood football accident left him with severe concussion. Doctors advised him not to play sport for a year, so soon after that he turned his attention to acting and was cast as the lead, Danny Zuko, in a school production of Grease.Van Der Beek shot to fame in 1998 as Dawson Leery, the teenage film buff who was as obsessed with Steven Spielberg as he was with his neighbour and lifelong crush, Joey Potter (played by Katie Holmes). Later that year, he was voted one of People Magazine’s Most Beautiful People in the World. On the 25th anniversary of the show starting,Van Der Beek wrote: “Twenty-five years ago today, my life changed. Not gradually, not day-by-day … instantly. It was the culmination of five years of auditioning, hundreds of hours on stage, thousands of hours travelling, preparing, dreaming, hoping, hearing ‘no’ and making up reasons to keep going. But the shift was overnight.”The intense pressures of celebrity proved difficult to cope with given his youth. After Dawson’s Creek became a smash hit, hesaid in an interview: “Walking around at that time was very tricky because one autograph could turn into a mob scene. So I walked around in fear of teenage girls.”View image in fullscreenVan Der Beek as Dawson with Katie Holmes as Joey, Joshua Jackson as Pacey and Michelle Williams as Jen in Dawson’s Creek.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyFor years after the show ended, Van Der Beek was plagued by people asking whether there were plans to do a Dawson’s Creek reunion show or film. In 2017, he said: “I felt pretty complete putting that one on the shelf and not looking at him again.” But not long after he announced his cancer diagnosis, a charity reunion was set in motion with Van Der Beek and former co-stars Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson attached. However, health issues meant that Van Der Beek was unavailable on the day – so Lin-Manuel Miranda stepped in to take the role of Dawson.James Van Der Beek was so much more than just Dawson | Stuart HeritageRead moreVan Der Beek also appeared in movies including the American football teen flick Varsity Blues, in which he starred opposite Paul Walker, and in the adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s The Rules of Attraction, in which he played drug dealer Sean Bateman – younger brother of American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman – caught up in a love triangle. He increasingly played tongue-in-cheek roles: he tried to climb into a bedroom window in the 2000 horror parody Scary Movie as the Dawson’s Creek theme tune I Don’t Want to Wait played, before declaring “Wrong set”. He was later cast as a meta version of himself in Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, for which he was nominated for a Teen Choice award for male scene stealer in 2012. He also did multiple skits for the comedy site Funny or Die, including one calledVandermemesthat riffed on him going viral for his so-called “ugly cry face”.Fellow teen idols, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chad Michael Murray, were among those who immediately paid tribute to the actor on social media. “I’m so sad for your beautiful family,” Gellar commented on the post. “While James’ legacy will always live on, this is a huge loss to not just your family but the world. Fuck Cancer.”Murray wrote: “Sending love and light to your beautiful family. James was a giant. We’re so so so sorry for what you’re going through. His words, art and humanity inspired all of us- he inspired us to be better in all ways. God bless you guys.”Jennifer Garner also commented, “What a heartbreaking loss. So much love to you, Kimberly, and to your kids, as you navigate this tender time.”On Instagram, the actor Paul Walter Hauserpostedan image of the money he helped raise for Van Der Beek’s cancer treatment, along with the message: “Love you, James. I know you’re in Heaven being pampered with love. The Van Der Beeks will be in our daily prayers and we’ll be drumming up some money to support your beautiful family. Thanks for the body of work and for being one of the good guys.”Roger Avary, the Canadian-American filmmaker who directed Van Der Beek in The Rules of Attraction, praised the actor and friend as “a pillar of strength to me and my family during the hardest of times”.“I have never known anyone else quite like him,” headdedon X, “and rarely felt so close a working connection, and my heart is broken at the loss, and my thoughts and prayers are with his wife and children.”Van Der Beek is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and their six children, Olivia, Joshua, Annabel, Emilia, Gwendolyn and Jeremiah.Shortly after announcing Van Der Beek’s death, Kimberly published a link to a GoFundMe to help with expenses in the wake of his extended medical treatment. “My friends created this link to support me and my children during this time,” she wrote. “With gratitude and a broken heart.”According to thefundraiser, which seeks to raise $500,000 for the Van Der Beek family, his medical care costs “have left the family out of funds. They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time. The support of friends, family, and the wider community will make a world of difference as they navigate the road ahead.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

So I included a character wearing an alligator mask in my pandemic-themed masked ball’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 11 Feb 2026 09.57 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 12.51 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWhen Covid started, everybody was talking about masks. I thought about the face coverings we all had to wear, and I thought about masks more widely. I researched masked balls and carnival masks and read a lot about the many outbreaks of plague in Venice starting in the 14th century, and about pandemics in general.This photograph, Danse Macabre, was inspired by Covid. If you take a close look at the paper lamps hanging from the ceiling, you’ll see some Covid-19 viruses smuggled in among them. In the middle of the scene, a doctor in a plague mask – the type still sold at carnival in Venice – is dancing with the rat that caused the plague. The couple on the left reference the fact that the Bolsonaro-led Brazilian government at the time of the pandemic was accused ofallowing many Indigenous people to die unnecessarily[he denied any wrongdoing]. So those two deal with colonialism – the woman in the yellow hat represents an Indigenous person, the guy she’s dancing with is wearing a mask with the face of Pedro de Alvarado, a Spanish conquistador responsible for massacring Indigenous populations in Guatemala in the 16th century.Different countries measured social distancing in different terms. In Austria, for some unknown reason, we were told to stay the length of a baby elephant apart. I found a list of measurements suggested by different countries and discovered that in Florida, people were told to visualise a baby alligator. By including a character in an alligator mask, the social distancing gesture became a dance gesture. One of the dancers has a face mask with the virus on it. I designed it myself using an online platform that would print you your own mask – they really liked it and asked: “Can we use your design?”Countries measured social distancing in different ways – in Austria, we were told to stay the length of a baby elephant apartI got into this type of staged photography by looking at paintings, and am very interested in colonialism and postcolonialism, a field that informs much of my work. Danse Macabre is half of my Masquerade diptych. The other half is calledHidden Transcriptand includes characters from carnivals in different countries – there’s a lady with a rattle from a Peruvian carnival, a man in a New Orleans Mardi Gras headdress, a red mask from Andalusia and a Trinidadian devil mas character, like a blue dragon. They’re dancing behind a seated woman in a dress made of green curtain material, recalling the one worn by Scarlett O’Hara in the ball scene in Gone with the Wind. I took the two photographs on consecutive days, using the same models, in the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. Since it was about masked balls, I needed a nice floor.I used to use friends in my photographs, but found it is much better to use actors or dancers because they have a different feeling for their bodies. They’re better at moving, but also better at holding a position when I need them to. The summer of 2021, when this was taken, was one of the hottest on record in Europe and I was using lights which made it even hotter indoors. It was quite exhausting, especially for the woman playing the rat.We had a truck parked outside with a generator to power the lights. It made a slight noise, and someone living nearby called the police to complain he was being disturbed. They came, took one look and said: “Yeah, just park around the corner and forget about that guy.” I invited the guy in and asked if he wanted to look at what we were doing, but he refused. I think he just wanted to be angry.It’s not possible to immediately decipher all the meaning and research that goes into my photographs. What I provide is a surface that looks interesting and a title that might open some doors and make the viewer want to find out more.

A golden age of dissent, activism and culture ensued – but have we since gone backwards?Micha Frazer-CarrollWed 11 Feb 2026 11.58 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 12.48 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleOne afternoon in 1984, Farrukh Dhondy went for lunch, not realising he was about to become part of British television history. The Indian-born writer was working forChannel 4at the time on breakout multi-ethnic shows such as No Problem!, a sitcom about a family of Jamaican heritage in London, and Tandoori Nights, a comedy about an Indian restaurant. When Dhondy arrived at the Ivy, Jeremy Isaacs, the burgeoning broadcaster’s founding chief executive, ordered an £84 bottle of wine.“I thought, ‘What the hell is this all about?’” Dhondy says. It turned out Isaacs wanted him to be the next commissioning editor for Channel 4. “For God’s sake, I’m not an office job man,” he said. “I’m a writer.” But after a brief conversation with the Trinidadian activist-scholar CLR James, who was living with him while going through a divorce, Dhondy changed his mind.One show from the ‘assimilation era’ instructed Asian women not to barter in supermarketsFor the next 13 years, he was part of a radical wave of British TV that funded and supported ethnic minority storytelling in a way that hadn’t been seen before – or since. A new season at the British Film Institute in London, called Constructed, Told, Spoken, will explore this “counter-history”, screening archival episodes that tell the forgotten story of British multi-ethnic programming.Until the early 1980s, such shows had spoken to audiences of colour without collaborating closely with them. BBC Hindi programmes included Nai Zindagi Naya Jeevan (A New Life, a New Existence) andApna Hi Ghar Samajhiye(Make Yourself at Home), which focused on assimilation into British life after postwar migration.“They were extremely patronising,” Dhondy says, citing programmes that, for example, instructed Asian women not to barter at supermarket counters. BBC and ITV sitcoms such as Love Thy Neighbour and Mind Your Language mocked Caribbean and south Asian accents and cultures, and, Dhondy says, the broadcasters’ coverage of 1960s and 70s protest movements was perfunctory and repetitive.Sarita Malik, professor of media and culture at Brunel University of London, calls that the era of “assimilationist TV”. She explains: “Englishness was always positioned as dominant. [These shows] were geared towards producing a model ‘good minority’. Cultural difference – accent, humour, food, music – was accepted, but political difference was not. [They wanted] a kind of ‘difference without dissent’.”View image in fullscreenEnough is enough … Stuart Hall presents It Ain’t Half Racist Mum in 1979.Photograph: BFIBut dissent they got. Mirroring other anti-racist struggles of the 1970s, activist groups began to draw public and industry attention to racism on TV, with high-profile groups such asthe Campaign Against Racism in the Mediaorganising protests against racist programming including The Black and White Minstrel Show, and the Black Media Workers Association threatening strikes due to racism at the BBC. It was time for Britain’s new communities to join the national conversation – broadcasters could no longer afford to overlook them.Proposed under Labour, Channel 4 was launched in 1982, during Margaret Thatcher’s stint as prime minister, with a radical remit. It had a dedicated multicultural department and, as Britain’s first “publisher broadcaster”, it could commission independent producers who had been excluded from the industry. Mass audience broadcasting was already covered by the BBC and ITV, so the channel chose to serve previously undervalued audiences.With trade union membership still high and anti-racist organising growing, the broadcaster collaborated with grassroots groups, workers’ movements, activist-writers and independent film-makers under its commissioner of multicultural programmes, Sue Woodford. Dhondy, who was heavily involved in the anti-racist magazineRaceToday, the British Black Panthers and the Indian Workers’ association, was well placed to take up this work.Channel 4 adopted a philosophy called “direct speech”, meaning discussion should come directly from communities rather than mediated through industry professionals. TV was a natural medium for it, an it was still an emerging format by comparison with newspapers. To be truly part of national discourse, people of colour needed a life beyond what Dhondy calls “complaint programmes”: those shows about housing, education and employment that simply point out the existence of racism, as if explaining it to white audiences. “Oh, it’s racism, racism, racism,” he says. “It’s boring. Nobody wants to watch it.” Instead, Dhondy believed we needed sitcoms, drama, documentary, the lot.The most famous show to adopt the direct-speech policy in the 1980s was likely Bandung File, commissioned by Dhondy and edited by British-Pakistani writer and film-maker Tariq Ali and Trinidadian British Black PantherDarcus Howe. The documentary and current affairs programme was unique in its attempts to present “third world” and ethnic minority interests to Black, south Asian and white British audiences. Drawing on the political print-reporting of Race Today, Bandung File served communities of colour in practical ways. Programmes took on Black and Asian consumer issues and warned about changes to immigration and naturalisation law.View image in fullscreenChannel 4’s Asian magazine show Eastern Eye.Photograph: BFIAnd the show explored the many facets of racism, beyond caricature. One episode, Too Many Questions, looked at the nuances of racism at Britain’s border, observing that Black people from countries such as Canada are privileged over those from poor, majority-Black countries. The legacy of the show is still precious: Ali last week expressed concern thathe had not been invited to speak at its BFI screeningnext month, fearing the show’s vision would not be communicated (Ali has since been invited).This era also saw Channel 4’s Asian magazine show Eastern Eye and the African and Caribbean show Black on Black. The latter was the first British programme made by Black journalists –and the team included figures who would go on to achieve other firsts, such as Julian Henriques, the director of the first Black British movie musical, and Victor Romero Evans, star of the first Black musical to hit the West End.Dhondy says this kind of career progression was built into Channel 4’s strategy of training Black and Asian people as directors, producers and camera crew, as well as actors and presenters. The broadcaster funded small companies led by people of colour, giving them advice on how to get started in the industry, in a bid to decentralise production and get underrepresented communities working behind the camera.As Channel 4 became famed for its radical programming, the BBC and ITV also diversified their output. The BBC set up a production unit for African-Caribbean shows and launched Ebony, its first dedicated culture review aimed at the Black community. Xavier Alexandre Pillai, curator of the BFI’s season, says part of this interest was economic. “In local markets in the early 80s, programmes were produced to cater to diverse audiences.” When broadcasters were under scrutiny, Pillai says this communicated competence, the feeling “that the appointed broadcaster could be trusted to reach even those audiences considered marginal”.View image in fullscreenDirect-speech philosophy … Bandung File investigates racist border policing.Photograph: BFIBut by the turn of the millennium, around the time Dhondy decided to leave Channel 4, the economic, political and industry context had changed. The introduction of digital TV and Freeview intensified competition between channels, resulting in increasingly populist and sensationalist programming. Under New Labour, “multiculturalism” once again came to mean assimilation, and more politicised understandings of race fell out of fashion. Channel 4disbandedits multicultural programming department soon after Dhondy left, and pivoted towards commercial competition. The BBC and ITV followed similar paths.People today take representation to be the goal. But having mixed-race families in soap adverts solves nothingDespite their ability to provoke pessimism or nostalgia, the broadcasts in the BFI’s season are an important part of British media history, and help contextualise where we are today. When it comes to diversity on TV, broadcasters and critics often reinforce the idea that we are on a steady march towards progress. But this counter-history suggests quite the opposite: that the 80s may be thought of as a golden age for anti-racist TV and that we have, in some ways, gone backwards.Today, ethnic minorities may feel better represented on the small screen, but as of 2020, they made uponly 8%of those working in creative and content production roles, and 9% of those in leadership roles. Dhondy says: “People are taking representation as the ultimate goal. So what you get is Black or mixed-race families doing advertisements selling soap. This doesn’t solve anything.”View image in fullscreenA discussion among Black teachers in Open Door  in 1973.Photograph: BFIThe BFI archive also shows the importance of financial and structural investment. The movement for multicultural TV was successful due to dedicated units, huge levels of investment, and worker organising that directly threatened structures of power. The political landscape is different now. “Since the 1980s and 1990s,” says Malik, “we have seen a creeping depoliticisation of the case for more diverse representation – representation without structural challenge.”Pillai tells me that this is particularly true for nonfiction: “Looking back from the present, it is astounding to see episodes of Ebony where cultural views are unpicked as they interview people of West Indian descent who talk about the complexities of returning to the Caribbean, or TV that provides the historical context of present issues.” He points towards the British media’s failure to contextualise the conditions that led tothe 2011 riotsas a more recent example of a gap in reporting.Black teachers, trans women, cleaners and cons: how the BBC’s Open Door allowed ‘real people’ to let ripRead morePillai adds that too few people are aware that all this existed, and that, without this context, we’re at risk of revising history. “[Contemporary] dramas likeSmall Axeare fantastic, but these historical events are there, captured in real time: interviews with people who were atGrunwick, and coverage of theDeptford fire.”When we don’t acknowledge these accounts as part of our history, we also tend to paint a picture of the past that is unfairly bleak. “When people talk about representation in that era, the first thing they mention is Love Thy Neighbour or Mind Your Language” – two ITV sitcoms that have since become infamous for their racism. “[That’s] like if historians talked about television in the 00s and only mentioned Jeremy Kyle.”The reality is always more complicated. As Dhondy says, television is not just one thing – it reflects the national conversation. That conversation is multilayered, contested and not yet concluded. As the archive shows us, it could change at any moment.Constructed, Told, Spoken: A Counter-History of Britain on TV is atthe BFI, London, until 17 MarchExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTelevision industryChannel 4BFIDarcus HoweStuart HallBritish identity and societyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But instead of playing it in the traditional manner, she puts wobbling bits of cardboard between its strings or uses a sheep’s bone as a bow, and these weird interventions have become catnip for Instagram’s algorithm, getting her tens of thousands – sometimes hundreds of thousands – of views for each of her self-made performance videos. “Despite how it might appear, I’m a reasonably shy person,” she says.When Laurie Anderson’s robo-minimalist masterwork O Superman hit No 2 in the UK charts in 1981, thanks to incessant airplay on John Peel’s radio show, it was a signal of a media outlet’s power to propel experimental music into the mainstream. That’s now happening again as prepared-instrument players such as Sobek, plus experimental pianists, microtonal singers and numerous other boundary-pushing solo performers, are routinely breaking out of underground circles thanks to videos – generally self-recorded at home – going viral onTikTokand Instagram.You may have come across a cover of a Mitski songplayed on a sinister microtonal scale, or a piano piece where the playerfrantically draws a circle across the keys of a piano, or in the case of Brad Barr, a strained drone made by Barr pulling along piece of polyester through his guitar strings. It all suggests that the general public are actually a lot more receptive to weird music than many assume – but why is it all resonating quite so strongly?View image in fullscreenPrecious Renee Tucker performing in November 2025.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for Saint HeronThe success of these bedroom virtuosos is already moving into the real world: after getting millions of viewers of her expressionist solo piano and synth performances, Arkansas musician (and part-time piano teacher) Precious Renee Tucker was recently invited to perform for her hero Solange Knowles. “I’m definitely still processing everything,” she says. Her TikTok is a chaotic digital sketchbook of her lifelong friendship with the piano, captioned with enthusiastic exclamations such as “i don’t know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” and “music is fabric!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”. “I’m always releasing things without thinking too hard about the need to comprehend them,” she says. “It’s really these fragments of myself.”‘I feel like a mother to Björk’ – the amazing Meredith Monk on composing with growls, gasps, chirrups and yodelsRead moreOther experimental artists, such as Maddie Ashman and Bryan Deister, are captivating TikTok scrollers with microtonal music, which is essentially a great wilderness of dissonant notes hidden between the standardised western scale. “This blows my mind, it’s like we’ve been living in a musical matrix of prescribed noises that are ‘OK’,” reads one comment underone of Ashman’s songs.“I’m led by questions,” says Ashman, a British musician who makes microtonal pop filled with freakish harmonies and unpredictable vocal hocketing – a technique with interlocking melodic lines – reminiscent of that great hero of the avant garde, Meredith Monk. “I’m happiest when I’m moving between places, and approaching one instrument in the way I would approach another instrument.” During her four-year rise on short-form video platforms, culminating in the release of her debut EP last week, she’s embraced microtonality because it’s something few artists can do. “For a lot of people, their experience of microtonal music is them not being able to play it, and it hurts.”Ashman bases her videos around the element of surprise, starting with a playthrough of the raw microtonal scale, then pulling a beguiling song from it. “I suppose that works well for the algorithm,” she hypothesises, “because people have an expectation of what it’s going to be. Then we’re defying those expectations, and people feel something.”However, like Anderson’s chart success, these musicians are as divisive as they are prominent; each video is guaranteed to have a share of detractors, questioning the validity of the music. “People start having arguments on the comment threads,” Sobek says and, in her case, people often show concern for her instrument. “Because it’s this beautiful Renaissance instrument and I look like I’m bashing it, people are like, ‘How can you do that?’ But the way I play is actually quite gentle if you saw it in person. I’m saying that these old instruments don’t have to be behind glass. In a way, I’m bringing them to life more than someone who’s stuck trying to replicate history.”View image in fullscreenChloë Sobek performing the violone – with added cardboard.Photograph: Courtesy: Chloë SobekThat provocation means Sobek stands out on social media, an attention economy where every comment – positive or negative – is registered as engagement; mainstream musicians such as Rosalía and Jacob Collier have meanwhile driven interest in classical performance and music theory in recent years. But the success of Sobek, Ashman et al. is mostly down to genuine excitement from people who have become numbed by boring influencer culture and AI slop. “We are genuinely desiring something brand new, or at least to be inspired to have that perspective,” says Tucker. “To let go of the past and detach from what we’ve seen before, and have the courage to do something creative that hasn’t existed yet.”In a roundabout way, it’s a re-engagement with experimental art’s purpose: to provoke and gauge reaction by bending invisible rules. “That is my favourite part about the experimental realm,” Tucker says with a smile. “I’m not necessarily saying the way that I play is correct or the standard. I really love the conversations that come up: Is this acceptable? Does this sound good? What is this?” She compares the process to a lab full of scientists comparing notes.However, some comments underneath female artists’ videos veer into misogyny. “There’s definitely an element of me being a woman doing something that’s confronting,” Sobek says. “I get a lot of men having strong reactions, and I do wonder, would it be different if I was a guy? Whether it would be slightly more accepted?” Ashman sees a similar pattern of male self-elected experts questioning how “truly microtonal” her music is, but says that “we’re now in a society where the majority of people can laugh at them rather than being hurt too much, which is amazing to be able to say”.For all their online success, these artists are also anxious about appeasing the social media algorithms that promoted their videos in the first place. “Can I keep the same mindset of doing this for fun? Can I take a break, or do I need to keep making and push it out regardless?” questions Tucker.The 10 best experimental albums of 2025Read more“There’s always been gatekeepers,” Sobek argues. “We think that the internet has democratised things, but it’s still defined by this gatekeeping algorithm. It’s all the same thing.”Not only does this create pressure to post regularly, but short-form video could warp the idea of what experimental art actually is, in the eyes of those who have just discovered it via an algorithm. “It’s pushing this idea of spectacle, and I don’t think art is just about spectacle,” Sobek says. “I’ll post a video that’s more ‘musically serious’ and it won’t get anywhere near as much interest as the fun and crazy stuff.”But short-form video also offers new ways to express oneself – you can see it in the superimposed lyrics descending down the stairs behind Ashman in her videos, or how each of Tucker’s lo-fi, impulsive clips adds up to a singular body of work – and this is art in a uniquely public dialogue with its audience. “It is surprising,” Tucker says, “that this many people are willing to be in this place of the unknown, and not having such an immediate answer in such an immediate digital space where you can have every kind of stimulant you’d like. I’m proud of all of us for having the bravery to go there.”Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicClassical musicPop and rockSocial mediaTikTokInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s the nightmare the Oscar-nominated Byrne faces in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You. The star and its director reveal why backers were scaredWed 11 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 06.49 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You, for whichRose Byrnejust won a Golden Globe and is Oscar-nominated for best actress, is unmistakably a horror film. And yet how can it be? It’s the story of a mother, Linda, with a very sick child. You never see the child, only the outlines of the anxious medics. You never find out what’s wrong with her, only that it involves a feeding tube. Linda is going steadily crazy, because who wouldn’t? On paper, this is a painful yet heartwarming tale of love and adversity. Instead, it is claustrophobic and vertiginous. It sometimes has the panic-attack surrealism of an anxiety dream, and other times is so real you can barely look directly at it. I’ve never seen the maternal condition drawn as a trip to the abyss. The only film I’ve seen that’s anything like this is Eraserhead.“I was very influenced by that film,” writer and director Mary Bronstein says, carefully. She’s a fascinating conversationalist, frank and open but watchful. Byrne is more reserved. Both are darkly funny, all the time. They look Hollywood-polished, in this central London hotel, but fair play, they’ve just come out of a photoshoot. “Eraserhead is about a type of parental anxiety that only men can have,” Bronstein says. “And this is a film about a parental anxiety only a woman can have. In Eraserhead, he can leave and that’s his angst. Linda cannot leave. That’s hers.”It shouldn’t be seen as a betrayal to say: I can’t take this any more – I’m really angryThe fundamental terror of the film is that it doesn’t just say the unsayable, it puts you right in Linda’s frame, feeling things you’re not allowed to feel. What if loving your kid is actually destroying you and all you want to do is escape? “Can you love something so much that you smother it?” Bronstein wonders. “I’m trying to express things that are very uncomfortable, but that are very true, and are seen as very ugly because they’re considered a betrayal of your child. But it shouldn’t be seen as a betrayal to say, ‘I can’t take this any more. I’m really upset. I’m really angry. I’m really frustrated. I don’t know what to do.’ None of that means that you don’t love your child.”Seeing Byrne’s character unravel – “It’s not fair!” she explodes – is a bracing revelation about how narrow the parameters of acceptable motherhood are. “Even in the privacy of therapy,” says Bronstein, “she’s not allowed to say things like, ‘Why does that lady get to have a kid with no issues? And I have a kid with all these complicated issues?’”View image in fullscreen‘I’m going to embarrass you now’ … Byrne, left, and Mary Bronstein.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianIf I Had Legs draws on Bronstein’s own experience generally, but also specifically – in the sense that her daughter, who she has with US film director Ronald Bronstein, had a period of grave illness. (Now 15, she has recovered.) Bronstein’s directorial debut, the 2008 camping comedy Yeast, was acclaimed. Motherhood, she says, “took a bite out of my career, and a bite out of my life, and it took getting to crisis point where I totally disappeared into being my daughter’s mother, before I could ask, ‘Who is this person I don’t know any more? It was a true ego-death situation and that’s where the horror elements of the film come from. What I came to is, ‘Oh, I’m an artist. I’m a storyteller. I’m a film-maker. That’s what I am. And I’m going to radically try to do this with nobody’s permission.’ It took the total dismantling of my life to take that back.”The nature of the daughter’s illness in the film remains mysterious, partly because, Bronstein says: “If you spell it out too much, it becomes one of those stories about a mother running around trying to cure an illness.” The key example of that genre must be 1992’s Lorenzo’s Oil, and it would be impossible to overstate how different that film is from this one.View image in fullscreen‘My character definitely should not be practising therapy’ … Byrne with her Golden Globe.Photograph: Jesse Grant/2026GG/Penske Media/Getty ImagesOne US reviewer compared Byrne to Charlize Theron in Monster. It’s an amazing parallel to draw, because Theron is physically unrecognisable in that movie, hunched and hulking, while Byrne looks the same as she did in Bridesmaids, the 2011 comedy in which she plays the nervy, impossibly fragrant, way too perfect new best friend. Both women laugh at the comparison. “Not to take anything away from Charlize Theron,” Byrne says, “but that wasn’t ever the idea.”“I’m gonna embarrass you now,” Bronstein says. “Rose is a beautiful woman. So Linda, unavoidably, is a beautiful woman, who’s going through a really bad time. What does this person look like when she’s not taking care of herself? When she’s not wearing makeup? When she hasn’t slept? So it’s a de-evolution, but it’s nothing like Monster.”It’s as if the ugliness of the idea – the maternal experience as selfish, unhinged – has put a filter over what some viewers see. Linda is also not interested in sex, at all. She has to move into a motel at one point and meets a young man, played by A$AP Rocky. “Those were some of the hardest scenes,” Byrne says. “He’s such an enigmatic, charming guy and so gorgeous – and Linda is constantly dismissing him, being actively rude. My brain was, like, ‘He seems really nice. Are we sure she wouldn’t want to just have a chat?’ But she’s closed for business.”Bronstein takes up the theme: “I’m also subverting the idea of going into a man’s bedroom. What usually happens in a movie? Yeah, it’s not happening here. She doesn’t even have access to that side of herself.” Which is, I suggest, part of why motherhood occupies this bizarre place in the collective consciousness. “Mothers are held in this high regard,” says Bronstein, “at the same time as being completely dismissed. It’s very confusing. ‘Am I the most valuable thing in society, or am I at the bottom?’”One piquant twist is the fact that Linda, in the middle of a florid nervous breakdown, is herself a therapist, and we see her with a client who has postnatal depression, completely unequal to the situation. “Yes, she definitely shouldn’t be practising,” Byrne says. “When I read that in the script, I thought, ‘Well, that’s a pivot.’”View image in fullscreen‘He’s such a nice man, but she’s closed for business’ … A$AP Rocky and Byrne.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockBronstein has no beef with therapy, has been in and out of it since she was 14, has had good ones and bad ones. “My previous therapist said to me, just as an aside, ‘My therapist said …’ and my ears completely closed at that point, because all I was thinking, all I was obsessed with, was, ‘This guy has a therapist?’ But then, of course he does, because that’s ethical practice – then that guy has a therapist, who also has a therapist. Where does it end? Can you skip to the head therapist? It’s like the man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz. There is no wizard. There is no head therapist. Everybody is somebody like Linda, just a human being struggling.”Nobody, they say, ever asks about one of the film’s most challenging scenes, except for one schoolkid in a Q&A: Linda agonises over an abortion she had in the past, running through futile what-ifs, that maybe if she hadn’t done that, her daughter wouldn’t be ill, or she would have a different daughter, who wasn’t ill. “And I think that you can be politically pro-choice,” Byrne says. “Obviously I am. But at the same time, you acknowledge that it’s a difficult thing and it remains a trauma for some women.”“There are a lot of movies where people talk about abortion,” Bronstein says, “and I wanted to express something that I felt was authentic, and maybe not what people want to hear: which is that you can have an abortion, and get on with it, and that’s what you’re supposed to do. But for some people, it stays with them.”This isn’t, however, a film designed to get liberals to pore over their fine differences. Nor is it agitprop about the structural injustices of motherhood within late capitalism, though Byrne is droll and caustic about the US context, summing up its attitude thus: “We care about the baby when you’re pregnant, but once it’s out, you’re not going to get any time off work, you’re not going to get any day care, if you want any time off work, you have to claim having a baby as a disability.”The profound political challenge of this film is to the patriarchy, since the impossible contradictions and iron-clad taboos around motherhood are ultimately a way of making femaleness impossible. Was it tough to get it made? “I heard a lot of Nos,” Bronstein says, “and they were all qualified with, ‘What if we pulled back here?’, or, ‘What if we didn’t do that?’ I’m no dummy. I knew what they were saying. People were afraid that no one was going to like Linda. And that, for some reason, is very scary.”“We always said to one another,” Byrne adds, “the audience doesn’t have to love Linda – butwehave to.”If I Had Legs I’d Kick You is out on 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmRose ByrneinterviewsShareReuse this content"

A debut writer was showcased on its biggest stage last autumn (Nima Taleghani withBacchae). Now a canonical playwright is in a space associated with the new and edgy – although Terence Rattigan fans may not recognise his lesser-performed 1963 play.It charts the fall of a megalomaniacal Romanian financier, Gregor Antonescu (Ben Daniels), and his reunion with his estranged son, Basil Anthony (Laurie Kynaston). The latter has changed his name and is trying to make it as a songwriter when Gregor re-enters his life, beleaguered with corruption charges and on the verge of exposure.Director Anthony Lau has put a thoroughly new spin on this old yarn but one which sadly drains the emotion and tragedy. Set in a 1930s basement apartment in Greenwich Village, the production has been jazzed up for this jazz age. Georgia Lowe’s set design gestures to the silver screen, with credits written across one wall in an art deco-style font, lighting up every time the relevant actors/characters appear on stage.View image in fullscreenDeliciously charged performance … Isabella Laughland as Countess Antonescu in Man and Boy.Photograph: Manuel HarlanArtifice is underlined in other ways, with green baize all around and initially a central table that stands in for a room. It suggests a giant game of snooker, with characters playing each other perhaps, as they clamber on to tables or shift them around. Knock Knock is written on top of the gangway representing the door. Is this all a big theatrical joke?The first half is pulled down by the weight of its laboured reinvention. The drama is so arch that it seems operatic – the bigger the performances, the more you feel removed from Rattigan’s subtexts. Kynaston projects bewilderment and anger but never seems quite at home. Basil’s betrayal by Gregor, who attempts to pimp him out to an American businessman, Mark Herries (Malcolm Sinclair), in order to save himself, gets lost in the overheated conceptual fray.‘As evil as Iago’: the return of Terence Rattigan’s shocking Man and BoyRead moreSome characters bring a cartoonish edge, like Basil’s girlfriend, Carol Penn (Phoebe Campbell), with her exaggerated Long Island accent, and Herries’s comically tetchy lawyer (Leo Wan). Gregor’s wife (Isabella Laughland) struts on in silk pyjamas and heels to give a deliciously charged performance, but this former typist turned fake countess is too much of a type to feel real. There is strangely poised or slow-motion movement, especially by Gregor, in what seems like a heavily stylised mishmash of screwball comedy and financial thriller.It engages more when some of the theatrics are dropped, a little too late. Gregor is like a darker version of Jay Gatsby and so much distance has been created that his downfall becomes emotionally remote, his self-loathing rejection of filial love understood rather than felt.It is a shame because this is an explosive story about the corruptions of capitalism with present-day echoes of Jeffrey Epstein, but the concepts smother the drama.AtDorfman theatre, National Theatre, London, until 14 March.Explore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreTerence RattiganreviewsShareReuse this content"

The studio was stumped on how to publicise it … Truthfully, its success came from the people.”In 2014, Corttold the Guardianit was “a blessing and a curse” as it led to him being typecast, getting offered only weirdo characters. He turned down the role of Billy Bibbit in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest as he wanted the lead and, after Jack Nicholson was cast, later asked for it back, but it was too late.In the 1970s, Cort went on to star in comedy drama Why Shoot the Teacher? and a TV movie adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald’s Bernice Bobs Her Hair with Shelley Duvall. In 1979, he was in a car accident that left him with serious injuries, breaking an arm and a leg and requiring plastic surgeries.He later returned to acting with roles in 1980s films such as the Jamie Lee Curtis-led romance Love Letters and Tobe Hooper’s sci-fi horror Invaders from Mars. The 1990s saw him in Kevin Smith’s Dogma and queer classic But I’m a Cheerleader before he later appeared in films including Coyote Ugly, The Number 23 and Wes Anderson’s The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.Small screen appearances also included Ugly Betty, Criminal Minds and Arrested Development. His long list of voice credits includes animated Batman, The Mask and Superman series.Cort was in another car accident in 2011 in which his arm was almost torn off, which made it hard to find work in the years after.Explore more on these topicsFilmHarold and MaudenewsShareReuse this content"

Chair of judges and Labour peer Thangam Debbonaire said the longlist was “hopeful”, and represented “women writing excellently on a wide range of subjects, each uncovering something new about our world”.Among the best-known names on the list is the Booker prize-winning novelist and political activist Arundhati Roy, longlisted for her first memoir, Mother Mary Comes to Me, an exploration of identity, motherhood and the making of a writer, which Amit Chaudhuri described as “utterly absorbing” in aGuardian review.Quick GuideWomen’s prize for nonfiction longlist 2026ShowDaughters of the Bamboo Grove: China’s Stolen Children and a Story of Separated Twins by Barbara Demick (Granta)The Finest Hotel in Kabul: A People’s History of Afghanistanby Lyse Doucet (Hutchinson Heinemann)Don’t Let It Break You, Honey: A Memoir About Saving Yourself by Jenny Evans (Robinson)Art Cure: The Science of How the Arts Transform Our Health by Daisy Fancourt (Cornerstone Press)With the Law on Our Side: How the Law Works for Everyone and How We Can Make It Work Better by Lady Hale (The Bodley Head)To Be Young, Gifted and Black: Creativity and Race in the 21st Century by Kadiatu Kanneh-Mason (Oneworld)Artists, Siblings, Visionaries: The Lives and Loves of Gwen and Augustus Johnby Judith Mackrell (Picador)Ask Me How It Works: Love in an Open Marriage by Deepa Paul (Viking)Death of an Ordinary Manby Sarah Perry (Jonathan Cape)The Genius of Trees: How Trees Mastered the Elements and Shaped the Worldby Harriet Rix (The Bodley Head)Hotel Exile: Paris in the Shadow of War by Jane Rogoyska (Allen Lane)Mother Mary Comes to Me by Arundhati Roy(Hamish Hamilton)Finding Albion: Myth, Folklore and the Quest for a Hidden Britain by Zakia Sewell (Hodder Press)To Exist As I Am: A Doctor’s Notes on Recovery and Radical Acceptance by Grace Spence Green (Wellcome Collection)Nation of Strangers: Rebuilding Home in the 21st Century by Ece Temelkuran (Canongate)Indignity: A Life Reimagined by Lea Ypi(Allen Lane)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.British author Sarah Perry’s Death of an Ordinary Man, a meditation on grief, family and faith, centred on the death of her father-in-law, is also longlisted.Writing in the Guardian, Joe Moran called it “gem-like” and “special”, a book that “works its magic through the adamantine detail and quiet lyricism”.The academic and author Lea Ypi is nominated for Indignity: A Life Reimagined, which examines her personal family history alongside political upheaval across the Balkans, from the Ottoman empire to the aftermath of communism – a history “brought to life through Ypi’s novelistic style”, Sami Kent wrote in hisGuardian review.History and politics loom large on the list – the BBC’s chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet is recognised forThe Finest Hotel in Kabul, a people’s history of Afghanistan told through the shifting fortunes of the InterContinental hotel in the capital. Barbara Demick’s Daughters of the Bamboo Grove tells the true story of separated twins to illuminate the human consequences of China’s one-child policy, while Jane Rogoyska’s Hotel Exile looks at the history of the Hotel Lutetia in Paris, which was used as the headquarters of the German military intelligence service, the Abwehr, during the second world war.Contemporary social and cultural questions are tackled in works including Lady Hale’s With the Law on Our Side, an insider’s account of how the legal system works and how it may be improved; Zakia Sewell’s Finding Albion, exploring British myth and folklore; and Ece Temelkuran’s Nation of Strangers, on exile, migration and belonging. The longlist also includes books on art and science, from Daisy Fancourt’s Art Cure, on the health benefits of creativity, to Harriet Rix’s The Genius of Trees, a study of how trees have shaped ecosystems and human history.View image in fullscreenArundhati Roy has been longlisted for her first memoir, Mother Mary Comes to Me.Photograph: TT News Agency/AlamyOther longlisted titles include Jenny Evans’s memoir Don’t Let It Break You, Honey, her account of beingassaulted by a high-profile figure; Kadiatu Kanneh-Mason’s To Be Young, Gifted and Black, exploring creativity and race in the 21st century; Judith Mackrell’sArtists, Siblings, Visionaries, a dual biography of Gwen and Augustus John; Deepa Paul’s Ask Me How It Works, an exploration of love and desire in an open marriage; and Grace Spence Green’s To Exist As I Am,a doctor’s reflections on a life-changing spinal injury.Debbonaire said: “The books on this hopeful longlist are rigorous and researched, lyrical and flowing. They are drawn together by the originality and skill with which they have been written. This reading list carries relevance and truth for the future as well as holding significant value for the present day.”Claire Shanahan, executive director of the Women’s Prize Trust, said the longlist reflected the importance of hearing a variety of voices. “Reading and hearing a multiplicity of perspectives, experiences and ideas through nonfiction writing is more vital than ever – it is how we make sense of the world, it’s how we learn from the past, challenge injustice, and imagine new futures,” she said.The creation of the prize was prompted by research which found that only 35.5% of winners across seven major UK nonfiction awardsover the previous decadewere women.Last year’s prize went to Dr Rachel Clarke forThe Story of a Heart, while the inaugural winner was Naomi Klein forDoppelganger.The judges will announce a shortlist of six titles on 25 March, with the winner revealed on 11 June. The winning author will receive £30,000 and a limited-edition artwork known as the Charlotte.Alongside Debbonaire, the judging panel includes Roma Agrawal, engineer, author and broadcaster, Nicola Elliott, founder of NEOM Wellbeing, Nina Stibbe, novelist and memoirist, and Nicola Williams, crown court judge and thriller author.To browse all books on the Women’s prize for nonfiction 2026 longlist, visitguardianbookshop.com.

While his comrades were dying at the front, plenty of young men appeared to have dodged military duty and were now to be found carousing in Berlin’s packed bars. The women were no better: husbandless but flush with ration coupons purloined from soldiers on leave, they were busy gorging themselves. “If Berlin were Germany,” huffed the complainant, “we would have lost this war years ago.”Berlin had always been a case apart. The legacy of the wild Weimar years – all that artistic and political radicalism, not to mention louche living – had continued under the Third Reich. The city remained defiantly itself and, despite the efforts of high command, mulish about being told what to do. That, at least, had been the situation in 1941.By the time Ian Buruma’s father, a conscripted labourer from the Netherlands, arrived two years later Berlin had begun grudgingly to toe the line. The war was going badly now, with the Russians pushing in from the east, and American and British bombs dropping from the skies. Food was scarce, Jewish citizens were being disappeared daily and Hitler and Goebbels, both frequently in the city, were getting more anxious and crueller by the day. Now whenever Berliners met each other in a food queue or a bomb shelter their most likely greeting wasBleiben sie übrig– “Stay alive”.Nonetheless, argues Buruma, wherever you looked you could still find pockets of resistance. He isn’t referring here to well organised underground networks, but rather to ordinary men and women, not especially brave but still capable of doing the right thing. When Jews were ordered to start wearing identifying insignia, plenty of their fellow Berliners made a point of going up to them in the street and shaking hands. Young Leo Buruma, drafted in to work at a heavy engineering factory, took up with a Ukrainian girlfriend, pointedly ignoring the Nazis’ dictum that, as a “Germanic” Dutchman, he had no business consorting with an “inferior race”. It might not sound like much but, as Buruma puts it, “not everyone is cut out to be a hero”.These small acts of grace from 80 years ago can be hard to research. Buruma starts with his own father’s letters home, which he began to go through systematically after Leo’s death in 2020. The young man clearly didn’t want to frighten his family – he reports the after-effects of a heavy bombing as merely “quite a sight” – and was careful not to fall foul of the German censor. Reading between the lines, though, Ian Buruma pieces together an existence of outward conformity (Leo signs up to be an air raid warden) and inner protest (on Saturday nights he plays piano with the widow of a wealthy Jewish lawyer, an act that could have got them both locked up or worse).Other witnesses, such as journalists Ursula von Kardorff and Ruth Andreas-Friedrich, were careful to keep only scrappy and coded memos during the war, but subsequently reconstructed these into coherent narratives for publication. Von Kardorff could never be described as a resister, yet her memoir shows someone trying hard to remain decent in a criminal state. Her father, a successful portrait painter, had lost his teaching job thanks to his opposition to the regime yet her mother, a textile designer, continued to kit out the homes of the Nazi grandees. Ursula herself delivers warm clothes to Jewish homes but wonders if she is merely doing it to salve her conscience. Her real anguish is reserved for her brother who is fighting for Germany on the eastern front.None of this is morally coherent and yet, suggests Buruma in this wonderfully nuanced book, it was necessary if you wanted to stay alive, and knew yourself to be neither brave nor craven – but somewhere in the muddled in-between.Stay Alive: Berlin 1939-45 by Ian Buruma is published by Atlantic (£22).

They are an overlong celebration of underwatched films that take place in a room where, by the end of the evening, the bulk of those present have been told that they aren’t good enough to win anything. The whole thing is excruciating.But you know what’s much better than the Oscars? The annualOscars nomineesluncheon. This is when everyone who has been nominated gathers for a nice lunch. It isn’t televised, so nobody has to be on their best behaviour. No awards are handed out, so technically everyone invited is an equal. And, best of all, they take a class photo of everyone at the end.This is brilliant because not only does it act as a snapshot of the great and good in any given year, but mainly because it is genuinely impossible to have that many people look completely normal at the exact moment in time. So with that in mind, here are the annualOscarsluncheon class photo awards for 2026.Biggest showboater – Guillermo del Toro (front, centre)View image in fullscreenActing like a wacky usher at a wedding … Guillermo del Toro.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyWhen you look at an Oscars class, your eye is immediately drawn to the middle of the front row. Usually this is because this is where the greatest concentration of A-list talent clusters. However, this year it is becauseGuillermo del Toro– nominated forFrankenstein– has decided to act like a wacky usher at a wedding. Look at everyone else in the photo and you will see hundreds of people who aren’t sure what to do with their hands. Not del Toro, though, because he has opted to maniacally waggle them around like a 1920s showgirl. It gives the effect that this is del Toro’s party and everyone else is just a guest. Please also note thatPaul Thomas Andersonappears to be holding him back, in case he makes a lunge for the cameraman.Giantest man – Oliver Laxe (back row, tenth from left)View image in fullscreenUnstoppably huge … Oliver Laxe, back left, who is somehow taller than Stellan Skarsgård, back centre, and Jacob Elordi, back right.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyAs is traditional with a group shot, all the tall people get shoved to the back so they don’t accidentally end up obscuring a famous actor with their hulking shoulders. This year, the back row includedJoseph KosinskiandStellan Skarsgård(both around 6ft 3in) andJacob Elordi(around 6ft 5in). It had been assumed that Elordi, a veritable giraffe in the tiny world of Hollywood, would be the tallest person at the luncheon. But then in strode inSirāt director Oliver Laxe, who has to be at least eight feet tall. Laxe is unstoppably huge, to the extent that he pulls focus from everyone but del Toro. If he’s nominated again next year, please let’s start a petition to hang all the other nominees off his colossal frame like a human mug tree.Best disguised – Diane Warren (third row from back, second from left)View image in fullscreenBlending in … Diane Warren, dressed in all black, looks as if she’s trying to hide from the photographer.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyAs someone who has dedicated her life to writing pretty good songs for forgettable movies purely so that she can attend the Oscars, you worry that the Oscars luncheon is one of the only times thatDiane Warrenactually leaves the house. Quite often, she maximises on this by dressing boldly. But in the year that she is nominated for Dear Me, from Diane Warren: Relentless, the documentary about her life, she has changed tactic.. She’s a bit more muted, her hair and outfit melding into her surrounding nominees. She is also slightly too short to stand out, to the extent that a layperson could be easily convinced that she’s trying to hide from the photographer. This won’t do. When she is inevitably nominated again next year, let’s hope she opts for a big yellow feathery hat as a counterbalance.Most comfortable sense of self-worth – Ron Dyens (third row from back, third from left)An Oscar-winner already … Ron Dyens, centre.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyThere are several stages to spotting Ron Dyens in the class photo. The first is where you notice that, while everyone else is dressed to the nines, he is wearing a cat T-shirt. The second is where you realise that the cat on his shirt is thecat from Flow, which won best animated feature last year. The third and final stage is where you realise that, wait a minute, Dyens produced Flow. He got the nod this year for the animated short film Butterfly, and literally came to the Oscars nominee luncheon wearing proof that he has already won an Oscar. The balls of the man, frankly. Hopefully this sets a new precedent whereby next yearLeonardo DiCapriocomes dressed as the guy fromThe Revenant.Weirdest audition for a Guardian byline photo – Ronald Bronstein (back row, 11th from right)View image in fullscreenIs he coming for our jobs? Ronald Bronstein (in green jacket) poses like a Guardian journalist.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyThe co-writer ofUncut GemsandGood Time, and nominated this year forMarty Supreme, Ronald Bronstein will for ever be held in the greatest of respect. However, it has to be said that he spent the duration of the Oscars nominees luncheon class photo standing exactly – and I meanexactly– in the same way as Guardian journalists do when they’re posing for a byline photo. He’s dressed more smartly than usual. He’s pulling an expression that tries to be serious, curious and jaunty all at the same time (because you can’t predict the tone of the pieces you’ll write in the future). Most damningly of all, though, he is standing sideways while turning his head towards the camera. This isexactly how they make us do it at work! They have diagrams up and everything! Honestly, he could beRafael BehrorSimon JenkinsorPolly Toynbee. The bigger question is why he is even doing this. Is it a tribute? Is he taking the piss? Is he coming for our jobs? We need to know.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesGuillermo del ToroMarty SupremeOscars 2026featuresShareReuse this content"

The extended footage of Welsh in conversation is certainly engaging, as he discusses his writing and the movies it created, and his own youth in Edinburgh.Some of the rest of the interviewees aren’t quite so gripping, however, and the film is padded out with a fair bit of redundant anecdotage from people on the subject of getting hilariously wasted in Irvine’s company — or at least his approximate vicinity. As for one 90s ladmag-style story about Irvine doing some kind of Marquis de Sade-themed photoshoot in Ibiza’s Manumission club involving prising apart young women’s buttocks for the camera … well maybe you had to be there.Iggy Pop, whose Lust for Life featured in Trainspotting, is interviewed, and so is producer Andrew Macdonald, but interview footage with director Danny Boyle and the Trainspotting stars seems to have been cannibalised from junket videos they did back in 2017 forthe film sequel T2 Trainspotting(based on Welsh’s book Porno). Be that as it may, I would have liked to hear more from Welsh about the cities he loves and about other authors and music he loves – and more from other authors about how he influenced them. But it’s always a pleasure to hear from this uniquely funny and articulate writer.Beyond Trainspotting: The World of Irvine Welsh is on digital platforms from 16 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIrvine WelshTrainspottingT2 TrainspottingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is based on the autobiographical novellaThe Character of Rain by Belgian author Amélie Nothomb, published in 2000.Loïse Charpentier voices the role of Amélie, a little girl living in Kobe,Japan, with her Belgian family in the late 60s; mum, dad and older brother and sister. Until the age of three, she was in a persistent vegetative state, but was miraculously jolted free of it by a terrifying earthquake; yet she emerges quarrelsome and almost feral, to the despair of her parents. That is until her elegant grandmother Claude (Cathy Cerda) comes to visit and gives her a piece of narcotically delicious white Belgian chocolate, which causes Amélie to bloom into a lovely, biddable child who adores her Japanese nanny Nishio-san (Victoria Grosbois).But there are problems: the family’s icily distant landlady Kashima-san (Yumi Fujimori) not-so-secretly detests her western tenants – and despises Nishio-san for working for them – due to unresolved feelings about allied bombings during the war. And what will happen when Amélie’s grandmother has to leave? And when the whole family have to leave Japan, which Amélie now sees as her adored homeland?The animation itself is, in its way, a very charming mix of European and Japanese styles, and there’s a lovely final sequence, when Amélie revisits in memory her fractionally younger self in various scenes around the idyllic house and garden.Little Amélie is in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFilm adaptationsFamily filmsJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hadi is a former Sundance Lab fellow and his film lists Hollywood heavy-hitters Chris Columbus and Eric Roth among its executive producers – who may just have induced Hadi to sprinkle some old-fashioned Tinseltown sugar into the mix. The moment when the little girl gazes at her reflection in the river is surely inspired by The Lion King.Among the largely nonprofessional cast is the unselfconsciously excellent Baneen Ahmad Nayyef as nine-year-old Lamia, whose greedy teacher gobbles the apple she has brought to school for her lunch. This blowhard announces that the class must draw lots for which of them will bake the Saddam cake; it falls to Lamia. In addition, her pal Saeed (Sajad Mohama Qasem) – who has a crush on Lamia – has to supply the fruit for this party, on which only the teacher will be gorging himself. Lamia sets off into town with her grandmother Bibi (Waheed Thabet Khreibat) on a desperate shopping expedition, carrying her pet cockerel, Hindi, who gives a great animal performance and whose unpredictable crowings clearly forced the actors to improvise lines around him.They encounter Saeed, who has been groomed as a pickpocket by his beggar father and who intends to steal either fruit or something else to sell for fruit; these cake-ingredient searchers on their travels, like the bicycle thieves of old, encounter a succession of vivid characters, including a grocer who gives rare treats to a pregnant customer in exchange for sexual favours, and, in one grim sequence, a paedophile who offers to take Lamia to his apartment for some baking powder. The postman who gives Lamia and Bibi a lift in his car gets very excited about their mission: “I adore cake! It’s the greatest invention in human history!”But throughout the film, as if to spoil every happy moment and intensify every sad one, there are placards and posters of Saddam; there is hardly a street scene that isn’t complicated by a demonstration wielding Saddam posters and barging past the camera shouting their loyalty. This is, after all, life during wartime. The postman’s other passenger is a man blinded by an American bomb who is engaged to be married to someone he hasn’t seen, so it doesn’t matter if she isn’t beautiful.The film saunters and meanders along, accelerating occasionally to a mad dash for the many scenes in which the children are being chased by grownups. The cake-tasting itself turns out to be an explosively important climax.The President’s Cake is in US cinemas now, in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 February, and in Australian cinemas from 2 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsIraqSaddam HusseinPeriod and historical filmsMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Other times it stays in the past, like a historical curiosity, a museum piece, even a relic. Glen Tetley’s 1962 Pierrot Lunaire, apivot point in dance history, is an odd conjunction of these disparate aspects.Drawing fromcommedia dell’arteiconography, it tells the stylised story of moonstruck innocent Pierrot (Marcelino Sambé), the awakening of his desire through an encounter with many-faced Columbine (Mayara Magri), and the intervention of the dominant, manipulative Brighella (Matthew Ball). The set is sparse – just a scaffold, centre stage – and the dance style is a bold, efficient alloy of the long, lean lines of classical ballet with the gravitational pull, tensed angles and visceral gesticulations ofMartha Graham.Glimpses of the moon abound – in the many fleeting crescent shapes, in Pierrot’s upward tugs as if catching moonbeams. The choreography is clear, finely wrought, and purposeful: witness Pierrot and Columbine’s highly constructed duet in which they keep looking outwards, upwards, around, but not at each other. All three dancers, inscrutable in face makeup, embody their roles superbly, inhabiting the mood set by Schoenberg’s composed yet highly strung score, all atonal anxiety and sliding hysteria.View image in fullscreenHigh style … Pierrot Lunaire by Glen Tetley at Linbury theatre, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhich brings us to the somewhat hysterical and certainly antiquated Freudian iconography that drives the drama. There’s a key moment when (there’s no way to put this nicely) Pierrot parps Columbine’s boobs, and she slaps him and flounces off. It gradually becomes clear that Pierrot is Boy, shamed and punished for his burgeoning desires; Columbine is Woman, variously living doll, bow-wrapped bride and scarlet harlot; and Brighella is Man/Daddy, big and bad, and poking his wooden sword from between his legs. The combination of retrogressive crudeness and sadistic tone with high style, refined design and powerful performance is indeed strange – and creepy.AtLinbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, until 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceRoyal BalletBalletRoyal Opera HouseClownsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The octogenarian playwright, he recalled, “received us cordially”. Kilty went on to become an actor and playwright himself, and Shaw inspired his biggest success – this 1957 two-hander drawn from the author’s ardent if unconsummated correspondence with Mrs Patrick Campbell, the original Eliza in Pygmalion.Campbell’s magnificence is lost to memory, while Shaw’s plays slide from the repertory. Why bother with their antique sparring? This revival depends on feeling performances by Rachel Pickup and Alan Turkington as two outsize personalities skirmishing between courtship and combat.The first act centres on efforts to stage Pygmalion. “I will be your pretty slut,” Campbell writes; contractual negotiations are all pang and flirt. Each is quick to pique: “I will sit here and howl,” Shaw snaps. “All I ask is to have my own way in everything.” Rehearsals founder on her misfiring Cockney accent and his intemperate direction, but the show triumphs.We then watch their relationship fracture, especially when each attempts to mine their relationship in play or memoir. Meanwhile Shaw’s curiosity takes him behind the scenes at his mother’s cremation; his pacifism makes him furious rather than consoling when Campbell loses a son to the war.A modern theatre-maker might navigate this material differently: scholars now frame Campbell as a psychologically acute performer rather than stroppy diva. Stella Powell-Jones’ production doesn’t always help a fusty script: touching when speakers gaze out, unsure how a letter will be received, but strenuous when she has the actors declaim at each other.Calico-clad (with a cartoon of Shaw on Turkington’s T-shirt), the actors move between the cloud-stippled curtains of Tom Paris’s design. Pickup, chandelier earrings quivering in outrage, becomes touchingly still in old age; Turkington, petulant hands stuffed in his pockets, is easily wounded.Desire shadows their exchanges (“I absolutely refuse to play any longer the horse to your Lady Godiva!”) – are they merely, as Campbell states, “lustless lions at play?” These two cantankerous artists are enrapt in each other’s imaginations – though Kilty’s play can’t quite shake off the cobwebs.AtJermyn Street theatre, London, until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreGeorge Bernard ShawJermyn Street TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

They’re now better known for the BBC series where Laura – note the rhyming name – guided us through the quaint doings of village folk, as quiet rural routines encountered an industrial, urban future.InHammerpuzzletheatre company’s new adaptation, Laura’s own story is very much the focus. We follow her journey from a childhood in which her future is limited, and her reading actively discouraged. Jessica Temple’s Laura is a tender mix of game and sensitive, clever and unworldly. Alongside her, director Bryn Holding deftly musters his five-strong ensemble of actor-musicians into entire communities, be it fellow schoolchildren comically reciting a backwards alphabet, or pubgoers performing a drinking song you’ll be desperate to join.They’re also her family, bumping along on the cart that transports Laura from her humble hamlet to Candleford’s comparable whirl. Christopher Glover segues seamlessly from forbidding father to understanding uncle; Alex Wilson is searingly empathetic whether as brother Edmund, left behind in Lark Rise, or an Irish labourer hoping for news from home at the Post Office. It’s here – in Anna Kelsey’s immaculately dressed set – that Laura lands a job, under the energetic eye of Dorcas Lane (a bustling Rosalind Ford).View image in fullscreenImmaculate … The cast of Lark Rise to Candleford in a set by Anna Kelsey.Photograph: Pamela RaithTamsin Kennard’s script touches on feminism – Laura and Dorcas are “odd” women, like George Gissing’s spinsters – and politics (Laura’s father is apparently a liberal who abjures enclosures) without ever really embracing them. “All times are times of transition,” we’re told, but the narrative structure – which takes an unexpected turn in the second half – never lets us see quite what we’re moving towards. Genuinely touching encounters (Zrey Sholapurkar’s journalist is an awkward delight) lead only to homilies about not being able to have everything.And yet this is a past, and a company, you’ll be more than happy spending time in. Between Thompson’s writing – we hear the rain “plash like leaden bullets into the leaden water” – and the theatre’s period surroundings, this evocative production is an affectionate tribute to a people who do, in the memoirist’s words, deserve to be remembered.AtWatermill theatre, Newbury, until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreWatermill theatreTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

At least that’s how it felt to me, puttering along on the 27 to Paddington that isthe National Portrait Gallery’s trawlthrough Lucian Freud’s sketches, engravings and even childhood crayonings, daydreaming until my stop, with the occasional flash of colour and flare when one of the exhibition’s “carefully selected group of important paintings” rolled past.View image in fullscreenChurning out nonsense … Solicitor’s Head, a 2003 etching.Photograph: National Portrait Gallery, London/© The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman ImagesThis is a sad review to write. Freud seemed an unquestionable genius in his lifetime and I still stand in awe of the great modern paintings with which he won that crown. One of his 1990s portraits of “Benefits Supervisor”Sue Tilleytowers here, in every sense, her face slumped into her hand as she sleeps vertical in an armchair, while Freud eagerly inspects every pore and blemish on her big naked body and translates her into an ecstasy of oily greys, whites, purples, ridged, pockmarked, magnificent.But such peak moments are surrounded with so much dross it makes you doubt he was anything special. I wish I could lambast the curators for failing to do him justice, but when an artist leaves this many mediocre works for them to make a meal of, you have to face facts. Freud did churn out a lot of nonsense as well as his nuggets of greatness.I’ve always tried to avoid looking at his etchings but they are shoved in your face here as if they were highlights of his late years. They teeter between ordinary and awful. There just isn’t the niftiness and daring of the paintings: faces and bodies are defined with matted, heavily shaded edges that seem precious as well as laborious. At best they are posters. Two prints of Tilley seem like adverts for his art rather than manifestations of it.I laughed – and not kindly – at Man Posing, a 1985 etching of a nude model on a couch with his cock and balls up front between splayed legs. It’s not the genitals that are disappointing but his sad, stupid face, too big for the body. The result is weird without being witty or moving. Yet a small painting beside it of the same man in the same pose is dazzling, magic. The balls are deep pinkish red, flaming from his white flesh like a cockerel’s comb.View image in fullscreenStumbling about … Portrait of a Young Man, 1944, black crayon and chalk on paper, by Lucian Freud.Photograph: © The Lucian Freud Archive / Bridgeman ImagesFreud is an albatross of an artist, glorious when he flies on canvas, clumsy when he stumbles about in earthbound black and white. It is hard to see why he even bothered with etching when he was hitting his peak as a painter – was it for an extra few bob, or the old-masterly connotations of this medium in which Rembrandt and Picasso excelled, or just the need for a graphic outlet? For the NPG does make its point that Freud started out as a draughtsman first – a precise, patient observer of thistles, dead monkeys and the human face – and a painter very much second.Yet his meticulous drawing style palls unexpectedly as one early work after another is stacked up – and as for his childhood pictures from Berlin, a kid could have done them. This is where the show starts to seem indulgent, confused, soppy. You thought Freud was tough and cruel? His drawings of Kitty Garman and other beauties, as well as himself and male friends from the 1940s and 50s, look sentimental. He loves a pretty face, and in his 1946 chalk and crayon drawing A Girl, desire softens his eye.View image in fullscreenFlying on canvas … Portrait of David Hockney, 2002.Photograph: © The Lucian Freud Archive. All Rights Reserved 2025 / Bridgeman ImagesThis Freud is a nicer man but a lesser artist. Perhaps what has gone wrong here is that curators and art historians who don’t remember Freud as a living artist, and don’t feel him as contemporary, are starting to reevaluate him as a historical figure who is “interesting” rather than urgent. They dismally succeed in redefining him as a minor British artist, doing careful, stylish drawings that he translated, in the 1950s, into modest paintings. But this Freud died. There’s a rift in the middle of the show when it announces that, in the 1960s, he abandoned his fascination with drawing to plunge into pure paint. His terrifyingly brilliant 1963 Self-Portrait, a painted hand grenade of squinting eyes and bruised-looking flesh, announces the years without drawing.It’s at the moment he put down his sketchbook he became an artist who holds us. He chose paint – and painting from life, with models in front of him as he added another stroke of purple or black to their oily double. It may be that he was less intellectual than his mysterious personality suggested. He worked from instinct, not thought, and when he hit the vein he was great, but sometimes he missed. The NPG concentrates on the misses.Why put on such a perversely stupid exhibition? I’ve heard it said that Freud’s great paintings are hard to borrow because so many are in private hands. But if Freud’s collectors really are so uncooperative, they are risking their own investments. A few more shows like this and his prices will fall off a cliff.Lucian Freud: Drawing Into Painting is atthe National Portrait Gallery, London, 12 February to 4 MayExplore more on these topicsDrawingLucian FreudArtNational Portrait GalleryPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

I picked up my pen. A month of living in this Icelandic village and I was still unaccustomed to the impenetrable January gloom and the ferocity of the wind; its propensity to sound sentient. I had started to feel like the island was trying to tell me something, had a story it wanted me to write.Sauðárkrókur, a fishing town in the northern fjord of Skagafjörður, was all mountain, sea and valley. There were no trees to slow the Arctic winds, and I had already been blown sideways into a snowbank while walking home from Fjölbrautaskóli Norðurlands vestra, my new high school whose name I could not yet pronounce. At night, my dreams were filled with a soundscape of weeping women. When I woke, their wailing continued in the gusts outside. That was when I wrote. I wrote to understand myself in this new place. I wrote to understand Iceland, its brutality and its beauty.View image in fullscreenSauðárkrókur in Iceland’s north-west, with Mount Tindastóll in the background.Photograph: Hannah KentWhen I applied for a foreign student exchange at 16, I did not give much thought to where I would like to live. It was enough to have a year of respite from the pressure to decide what to do with my life. Since I was six years old, I had wanted to write,neededto write as one needs to breathe, but, influenced by wider social rhetoric regarding the arts, I had come to believe that writing wasn’t serious or worthy. Yet the thought of shackling myself to some other acceptable profession by way of university applications filled me with dread, and when the local Rotary club announced it would sponsor a student for a year abroad, I saw the opportunity as a lifeline. With no language studies under my belt, I was told that a host country would be selected for me based on “my personality”. When I received a letter informing me that I would be sent to Iceland, I was surprised. I knew nothing of this small Nordic island of 250,000 people. I wondered what we would have in common.By March, the winter winds had eased and the days lengthened into exquisite blue twilights. I was still overwhelmed by the difficulty of attending school, my unbelonging clear in the ongoing incomprehension and the stares that came my way, but writing about what I saw – the ravens circling, the fjord mirroring the height of the mountains – allowed me to step outside my loneliness. Each night, in the privacy of my bedroom, I let the words pour from me.View image in fullscreenHannah Kent beside the sculptureKona að strókka(Woman churning butter) by Ásmundur Sveinsson in Blönduos.Photograph: Hannah KentOne day, in Icelandic class, I started writing a poem in the margins of my notebook. Outside, I could see Mount Tindastóll, its snowy heights lit in pink from the late sunrise. I soon became so absorbed in pressing its beauty into paper that I did not notice my teacher, Geirlaugur, standing in front of me until he cleared his throat.“What is so important that it stops you from working?” he asked me, tapping the neglected exercises. He peered down at my notebook, reading sideways. “Poetry?”The place that stayed with me: I was cautious in showing my queerness, until a night spent dancing at a Tokyo gay barRead more“Fyrirgefðu,” I said.Sorry.The next day, when I returned to Icelandic class, Geirlaugur summoned me to his desk.

He had included an inscription:To Hannah, From one poet to another, Geirlaugur.“Keep going, and you will be published one day,” he told me. I was struck by his seriousness, the absence of any condescension.“I hope so,” I replied.He shook his head. “You will be. Just keep going.Áfram.”View image in fullscreenThe writer at the Goðafoss waterfall in Iceland’s north.Photograph: Hannah KentFrom that day onwards, my relationship with Iceland shifted. I hurled myself into learning Icelandic and reading Icelandic novels, and the more I comprehended, the more I understood that Geirlaugur’s poetic sensibility was not an individual quirk but, rather, indicative of a wider cultural appreciation. I read Independent Peopleby the Nobel prize-winner Halldór Laxness, where the farmer Bjartur composes stanzas while he labours. I read the Sagas of the Icelanders, where poets are ranked equal to warriors in prestige. As I found friendship and belonging in Sauðárkrókur, I realised that Icelanders’ respect for authors had not abated. One friend told me proudly that Iceland is a nation of writers: one in 10 would publish a book in their lifetime. Nowhere else in the world were as many titles published per capita.I would not have become a writer were it not for Iceland. The enthusiasm for literature I saw around me that year – and the many times I have returned to the country since – renewed my confidence in the worthiness of writing as a vocation. Iceland herself, her sentient winds and blushing mountains, remain my muse. And if I feel the old self-doubt, the worry that I should be doing other things, I remember Geirlaugur’s gruff voice. “Áfram.” Onwards.Explore more on these topicsIceland holidaysThe place that stayed with meAustralian lifestyleEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is cold, unusually dark and a film of ice is forming on the lake. I’m sitting in an unlit wooden sauna, alone, in immense silence. The only noise is the soft ticking of the stove as the heat rises. Across the water are ghostly silver birches and dark pines. Above them, Orion’s Belt shines bright. This vivid experience feels like midwinter in Canada, Finland or anywhere else about 60 degrees north. So it’s bizarre to know I’m a few miles south-west of Great Yarmouth.Fritton Lake is an anomaly. Like the Broads to the north, this deceptively big, sinuous lake was largely created by medieval peat-digging, but it’s nothing like its Norfolk cousins. Set in a sandy, hilly landscape of heaths and pines, the northernmost outpost of the wildlife-rich strip of sandy heathlands running up the Suffolk coast, the lake is deep and two miles long but so hidden by trees that many people don’t know of its existence.Over the past five years, Fritton Lake has been transformed by a rewilding programme. Landowner Hugh Somerleyton is the co-founder ofWildEast, anow-national movementencouraging people to pledge to “wild” at least 20% of their garden, park, playground or farm. Fritton and its surrounds represent Somerleyton’s 25% rewilding contribution, while he farms the rest of his 2,020-hectare (5,000-acre) estate regeneratively.View image in fullscreenFritton Lake’s heated swimming poolI’ve brought my family for a winter weekend seeking wildness in far-eastern England. Arriving after nightfall, my first impression is simply darkness. Anything as suburban as a lit walkway or illuminated sign is not found here. But we locate our self-catering cottage, one of a range of accommodation options that includes chic wooden cabins (some with hot tubs) and B&B rooms in the cosy pub turned clubhouse that is now is both a holiday destination and a high-end members’ club.The highlight of our first night is a (very) quiet private 30-minute session in the lake’s magical floating sauna. Between pub and sauna are courts and pitches for tennis, basketball, football, cricket, croquet, pétanque and pickleball. Down by the lake are canoes, kayaks, rowing boats and paddleboards. Passing the heated outdoor 22-metre swimming pool with fire pits at either end is like stepping through a set for a film about a 1960s Cliveden pool party featuring Christine Keeler, except there is a solitary swimmer doing laps as the pool steams alluringly in the chill night air.It feels like midwinter in Canada or Finland. So it’s bizarre to know I’m a few miles south-west of Great YarmouthThe next morning, I wake up to another silence so deep it might swallow me. Huge flocks of jackdaws and rooks fly overhead as we stroll through rewilded grassland to the pub for a hearty breakfast. Afterwards, my son Ted and I set out on a Fritton “safari”. Our guide, Matthew, is a fast-talking, east London-raised botanist-horticulturist-entomologist-mycologist. We jump in an old-fashioned, cream-coloured motorboat and putter slowly across the lake, which is superb for swimming and also enjoyed by pike, eels and, in winter, teals, shelducks and egrets. In summer, an osprey occasionally hunts for fish here, while “all the owls” – little, short-eared, long-eared, tawny and barn – are seen nearby alongside six endangered amphibian species.View image in fullscreenThere are deer and stags on the estate.Photograph: Max Ellis/AlamyOn the far side of the lake, the wildlife area is only open to those on guided tours (and Scout groups). We climb into an open-sided 1976 Austrian Pinzgauer 4WD and Matthew bumps us through the woods. Amid last year’s bracken, we spy an enormous shiny black shape slumped under a pine. A hippo? Creeping closer, we find that the shape is a pair of huge black pigs that Somerleyton has “retired” to the woods. They flick floppy ears out of their eyes to examine us. Their rootling mimics wild boar lost to this landscape, disturbing the ground and assisting wildflower germination; former arable fields are filled with oxeye daisies in summer. We admire the long-horned Highland cattle roaming free, while a buzzard cries in the sky above.I duck into the lake, cracking ice as I gasp with the delicious cold shockTed spots a muntjac and a fallow deer, and then Matthew screeches to a halt with excitement. “King Conan’s sons!” he whispers. There, crossing our paths are two magnificent red deer stags, although apparently not quite as magnificent as King Conan himself. “They are the princes,” whispers Matthew. They observe us, seemingly unafraid, from 15 metres away.On our return across the lake after an otherworldly three-hour experience, two kingfishers pirouette around our boat, shining iridescent orange and turquoise against the dark water.My kids are mortified when I arrive at the pub for dinner wearing my Dryrobe, but if it is socially acceptable anywhere, it must be here. I need it for another sauna session that follows an amazing steak from a menu emphasising local/seasonal food, with good veggie options too. An owl calls on the walk back to the cottage.View image in fullscreenThe writer spotted kingfishers on his ‘safari’ around Fritton Lake.Photograph: Lisa Geoghegan/AlamyOn Sunday morning, I rise before dawn to exploreCarlton Marshes, a Suffolk Wildlife Trust nature reserve that’s a 20-minute drive away. The sunrise fills the vast sky with pink, and I have the seemingly endless marshes of the Waveney to myself, silent reeds silvered by frost. A Chinese water deer watches me, its teddy bear ears twitching, as I circle round the reserve, which is a haven for rare dragonflies and the spectacular fen raft spider in spring and summer. Although this coast is dominated by the surprisingly large conurbation of Great Yarmouth, Lowestoft and surrounding villages, Gorleston-on-Sea’s sandy beach offers another great stroll with seabirds and salty air.Later that day, while my wife, Lisa, does a yoga class, I head for a farewell sauna and find the open session is packed with a friendly crowd of regulars who say they wish Somerleyton would build another sauna or two. I pop outside and duck into the lake, cracking ice as I gasp with the delicious cold shock.We head home much less frantically than we arrived – a sign of the nourishment provided by a weekend of painterly light, stripped-back landscapes, cold water, warm hospitality and the gorgeous avian soundtrack of this wild, wintery east.The trip was provided byFritton Lake. Clubhouse rooms from £130; two-bed cabins from £275.Explore more on these topicsSuffolk holidaysNorfolk holidaysEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nothing says “I love you” more genuinely than a decadent tray of delicious things to savour between the sheets. Because V-Day falls on a weekend this year, you can do better than just buttered toast and an unbidden cup of tea. Whether it’s sweet or savoury (or even a cheeky cocktail), I’ve got you!Saffron crepes with cavolo nero and smoked trout (pictured top)These French crepes are given the Midas touch with a pinch of saffron. Use your favourite fish – mackerel and salmon also work well here.Prep20 minSteep20 minChill30 minCook30 minMakes4250ml milk1 pinchsaffron strands40g unsalted butter, plus extra, melted, for brushing1 egg, lightly beaten½tsp salt75g buckwheat flour2 tbsp plain flour150g hot smoked trout, flakedCreme fraiche, to serveFinely grated zest of1 lemon, to serveFor the cavolo nero2tbsp olive oil,plus extra to finish1 garlic clove, peeled and finely slicedFinely grated zest of1 lemon1 pinch chilli flakes(optional)200g cavolo nero, leaves stripped and choppedSea salt and black pepperWarm 50ml of the milk in a small saucepan until it’s lukewarm, then crumble in the saffron, take off the heat and leave to steep for 20 minutes.Put the butter in a small saucepan on a high heat until foaming and nutty, then take off the heat and leave to cool.Put the butter, egg, saffron and milk in a blender and blitz until just combined. Add the salt and both flours, blend until smooth, then refrigerate for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1 and line an oven tray with baking paper. Put a 21cm crepe pan on a medium heat, brush with melted butter, then add 60ml of the batter, swirling to spread it evenly over the base of the pan. Cook until the edges turn golden, then transfer to a tray and keep warm in the low oven while you cook the remaining crepes.For the cavolo nero, put the olive oil in a pan on a low heat, add the garlic, lemon zest and chilli, if using, and infuse for about five minutes, until the garlic is just fragrant. Add the cavolo nero and stir-fry for a few minutes until wilted. Season with sea salt and pepper, and finish with a little olive oil.To serve, divide the crepes between two plates, stuff each one with the greens and smoked trout, and fold over. Serve warm with a dollop of creme fraiche and some grated lemon zest.Dutch baby with caramelised pears, tahini and dark chocolate sauceView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s Dutch baby with caramelised pears, tahini and dark chocolate sauce.This large, fluffy pancake makes an excellent base for sweet and savoury fillings. Berries and ice-cream or cheese would be excellent, but pears, dark chocolate and tahini are especially decadent.Prep10 minRest30 minCook40 minServes4125g plain flour3 eggs250ml whole milkSalt1 small knob butterFor the caramelised pears50g butter3 small pears, cored and cut into quarters50g light brown sugar1 splashvanilla extractFor the chocolate tahini sauce100gdark chocolate, broken up25g butter80g tahini1-2tbsp maple syrup1 pinch salt1tsptoasted white sesame seeds, to garnishHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Whisk the flour, eggs, milk and a pinch of salt until smooth, then leave to rest for at least half an hour – it’s fine overnight in the fridge, if you are organised.When you are ready to cook, put a 30cm shallow casserole or heatproof pan in the oven and, after a few minutes, add the knob of butter. Wait four to five minutes, or until it’s very hot, making sure the butter doesn’t burn. Quickly take the dish from the oven, pour in the batter, return to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, by which time it should be very puffed up and golden brown on top. Don’t open the oven, not even for a peek.Meanwhile, make the pear compote and chocolate sauce. In a large frying pan, melt the butter on a medium-high heat, lay in the pear quarters cut side down and cook until browned; turn and repeat on the other side. Sprinkle over the sugar, a tablespoon of water and the vanilla extract, and swirl to combine. Over a low-medium heat, cook the pears, turning them regularly, until soft and caramelised.To make the chocolate sauce, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water until completely smooth. Add the butter, tahini, maple syrup and salt, and stir until smooth.To serve, spoon the pears into the Dutch baby, drizzle over the chocolate-tahini sauce and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.Lady marmalade breakfast cocktailView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s lady marmalade breakfast cocktail.Marmalade isn’t just for toast.

Inspired by Auguste Escoffier’s exceptionally simple tartare, I’ve given his recipe a zero-waste twist by using whole boiled eggs and swapping in pickle brine from a jar of gherkins or capers to replace the vinegar. Everything else is optional: tarragon, mustard, cayenne … add what you like or have in store.Traditionally, tartare sauce is delicious with fish and chips, calamari or in a chicken sandwich, but I also like it tossed through potato salad with tinned sardines and radicchio. It’s also great as a dip with crudites and on top of a steaming jacket potato.Boiled egg and gherkin brine tartare sauceMyboiled eggtartare sauce uses whole eggs, blended with a little gherkinbrinefor acidity and flavour. I like to makemayonnaisewith extra-virgin olive oil – though some find it a little bitter – I love the flavour. Avocado oil or a cold-pressed sunflower oil also work well.We enjoyed it tossed through a potato salad withtinned sardines, and bowl of radicchio. But traditionally, tartare sauce is delicious enjoyed with battered fish andchips, calamari or in a chicken sandwich. It’s also great served as a dip with crudites and on top of a steaming jacket potato.To boil the eggs, place them in a small pan covered with cold water. Place on a high heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, cook for three minutes, then turn off the heat. Cover and leave for another three minutes. Refresh under cold water, then peel.If your mayonnaise splits while blending, don’t fret – decant the mixture from the blender, add a whole raw egg, then blend continuously while slowly drizzling the split mixture back into the egg until it emulsifies, adding more oil if necessary.Makes350-400ml, to serve 103 hard-boiled eggs1 tbsp pickled gherkin or caper brine,or white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar or lemon juice200ml cold-pressed oil(extra-virgin olive, avocado or sunflower)1 spring onion, green and white parts separated, green part finely chopped, or 5g finely chopped chivesOptional extras1 tbsp gherkins, finely chopped1 tbsp capers, finely chopped5-10g soft herbs(tarragon, dill, parsley, chives), stalks and leaves finely chopped1 tsp mustard(English, wholegrain or dijon)1 tspWorcestershire sauceA pinch of cayenne pepperor a dash of hot sauceSeparate the hard-boiled eggs into whites and yolks, placing two egg whites and all the yolks into an immersion blender jug or food processor. Add the pickled gherkin or caper brine and finely chopped green part of the spring onion.Blend together while very slowly trickling in the oil until thick and emulsified.Roughly chop the remaining egg white and white part of the spring onion and fold into the mixture. Fold in any optional extras such as the chopped gherkins, capers, herbs, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper.
