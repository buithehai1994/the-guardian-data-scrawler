This applies both to those who voted remain and those who voted leave at the 2016 referendum. Some of the leave voters in our groups expressly said that their votes had been a mistake, while others said politicians had failed to deliver on the promises of the leave campaign.“We showed messages both for and against doing a deal and they found the message in favour more persuasive. A strong majority across all groups, including groups considering voting Reform, endorsed doing a deal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After years of muddling through, we need a new approach that honours the referendum result while giving us a much-needed closer trading relationship with EU.“With an increasingly volatile and unpredictable global economy, it’s more important than ever that we secure our trading relationship with our closest neighbours.”The campaign for closer ties with Europe will be discussed among British trade union leaders at a meeting next week.Starmer has often spoken of his hopes for a reset of relations with the EU but has been cautious on an EU proposal for greater youth mobility, including easier travel, study and work opportunities for under-30s.The prime minister’s own priorities are a new veterinary agreement, deeper cooperation on security and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Starmer has also said he wants “an ambitious UK-EU security partnership to bolster Nato”. France is likely to push for securing long-term fishing access in UK waters.Starmer will host von der Leyen and Costa on 19 May to kick off more formal talks at the first UK-EU leaders’ summit. Nowak said it was vital that trade unions were involved in those talks from the beginning.Though there is a major drive to improve the UK’s sluggish growth through removing trade barriers with Europe, senior figures in No 10 are wary of any measures that might be characterised as a return to free movement or to the EU single market and customs union.Nowak said it was clear that a new deal must “honour the referendum result while giving us a much-needed closer trading relationship with the EU”.Explore more on these topicsTUCForeign policyTrade unionsBrexitEuropean UnionKeir StarmerUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

And they don’t have the cards,” Trump said. “In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing withRussia.”Asked whether the Russian leader was taking advantage of the pause in US intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine, Trump replied: “I actually think he is doing what anybody else would do.”American severance may be averted, but Europe’s leaders must fear the worstRead moreSenior US and Ukrainian officials plan to meet in Saudi Arabia next week asVolodymyr Zelenskyyand his advisers seek to revive relations with the US after a botched summit in the Oval Office during which Trump told Zelenskyy he was “gambling with world war three”.Russia launched a massivedrone and missile attackon Ukrainian energy facilities on Friday in the wake of the US decision to halt intelligence sharing with Ukraine that had helped it target incoming fire.1:04Russia launches strikes across Ukraine after US halts intelligence-sharing – videoSpeaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said: “We’re doing very well with Russia. But right now they’re bombing the hell out of Ukraine.”He added: “I think he [Putin] wants to get it stopped and settled and I think he’s hitting them harder than he’s been hitting them and I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.”In his remarks, Trump once again said he had good relations with Putin, despite the fallout from his first term when suspicions of backroom deals between the two leaders led to political scandal.“Despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax I’ve always had a good relationship with Putin,” Trump said. “He wants to end the war. And I think he’s going to be more generous than he has to be.”Earlier on Friday Trump had threatened new sanctions and tariffs on Russia in response to Russia’s latest attack.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said: “Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a cease fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!”Trump’s vague threat was in contrast to the punitive steps he has already taken against Ukraine, including anend to US military suppliesannounced earlier this week and the intelligence shutdown.On Friday the US aerospace company Maxar Technologies disabled Ukraine’s access to its satellite images after a request from theTrump administration.There were reports that Ukraine’s position on the battlefield had worsened as a direct result of hostile US actions. One source said Ukraine’s drones – used extensively across a 620-mile (1,000km) frontline – were “10-15% less accurate” than before.According to Ukrainian media, North Korean troops havemade significant gainsin Russia’s Kursk oblast, where Ukrainian combat groups seized territory seven months ago. The North Koreans broke through Ukrainian defences south of the Kyiv-held Russian town of Sudzha, cutting off a key road,reports said.Ukrainian troops are now at risk of being encircled, they added. One soldier fighting in the area said the road connecting the enclave with the Ukrainian city of Sumy was still open but under constant attack from Russian drones. “The situation is bad,” he messaged.Zelenskyy saidMoscow launched overnight attacks on Ukraine’s energy and gas infrastructure. It targeted facilities in several regions on Friday, including Odesa and Poltava, using nearly 70 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 attack drones.“All of this was directed against infrastructure that ensures normal life,” Zelenskyywrote on social media. “Currently, repair and restoration work is ongoing.” He said several people were injured when a missile hit a private building in Kharkiv.Zelenskyy is due to travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salman. “After that, my team will stay in Saudi Arabia to work with our American partners,” he wrote. “Ukraine is most interested in peace. As we told Potus [the president of the US], Ukraine is working and will continue to work constructively for a swift and reliable peace.”The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, are expected to hold talks with Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy’s office, and Ukraine’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov.The Trump administration has piled further pressure on Ukraine amid apparent US attemptsto replace Zelenskyy. “I think Ukraine wants to make a deal because they don’t have a choice,” Trump said on Thursday. “I also think that Russia wants to make a deal because in a certain different way – a different way that only I know – they have no choice either.”In the face of escalating US hostility, Zelenskyy has set out a tentative ceasefire plan. On Friday he suggested a ban on the use of “missiles, long-range drones and aerial bombs” as well as a suspension of military operations in the Black Sea.“Ukraine is ready to pursue the path to peace and it is Ukraine that strives for peace from the very first second of this war. The task is to force Russia to stop the war,” he posted on X.Since US and Russian negotiators met in Saudi Arabia last month, the Kremlin has dramatically stepped up its air war against Ukraine. Its advance on land in the eastern Donetsk region has largely stopped, with Ukraine’s armed forces carrying out counteroffensives in some areas.An overnight strike in Kharkiv injured eight people and damaged nine residential buildings, officials said. An adult and a child were injured in Poltava oblast when a missile hit two housing blocks, the energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said.Despite the US weapons cut-off, Ukraine is still able to shoot down some – but not all – enemy missiles. On Friday, Zelenskyy said French-supplied Mirage 2000 aircraft were used for the first time together with F-16 fighter jets to protect Ukrainian skies.He said: “The Mirages successfully intercepted Russian cruise missiles. Thank you! I also want to recognise the performance of our anti-aircraft missile forces, army aviation, all our electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups.”The Kremlin, meanwhile, said Russia may have to respond to what it said were EU plans to boost its military capability and cast Russia as its enemy. The comments were made after Thursday’s meeting in Brussels, in which EU leaders agreed a plan for ahuge rise in defence spending.“We see that the European Union is now actively discussing the militarisation of the EU and the development of the defence segment. This is a process that we are watching closely, because the EU is positioning Russia as its main adversary,” the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

The couple’s partially mummified bodies were discovered last month at their home in New Mexico.The 95-year-old Hackman may have lived for as long as a week after Arakawa’s death, she said. Officials speculated that he may have been unaware she was deceased.“He was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that’s what resulted in his death,” Jarrell said.The press conference New Mexico authorities held on Friday provided some answers in the mystery of what happened to the couple. Hackman and Arakawa were discovered last week after a maintenance worker, concerned when no one answered the door, contacted neighborhood security, who spotted their bodies through a window and called the police. One of their three dogs was also found dead.The Santa Fe county sheriff’s office said it did not suspect foul play. But officials could not immediately determine what happened to the couple as there were no signs of trauma to their bodies and tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.At the press conference on Friday afternoon, the sheriff, Adan Mendoza, revealed that investigators had been able to piece together Arakawa’s final days and found that she had picked up her dog, who was later found dead nearby, from a veterinary appointment on 9 February and that she had responded to emails and went out shopping on 11 February. The last known activity from Arakawa was that day, the sheriff said.Arakawa’s death was linked to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Exposures occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas.Hackman’s pacemaker last showed activity on 17 February, nine days before maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Officials said it was “reasonable to conclude” that Hackman died around 18 February.Arakawa was found with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on the bathroom counter, while Hackman was found in the home’s entryway.One of the couple’s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed of the dead animal.When they were found, the bodies weredecomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe’s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200ft (2,200 meters).Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including The French Connection, Hoosiers and Superman from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.The couple’s stucco, Pueblo-revival style home sits on a hill in a gated community at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains. Santa Fe is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood’s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

He again criticised Farage, saying Reform was “our party as much as it is Nigel’s”.He also explicitly linked the allegations to his decision to criticise Farage, saying that the day after he had done this, he had received “a knife in my back over false allegations”.In a joint statement by the chair, Zia Yusuf, and Reform’s chief whip,Lee Anderson, they said they were “obligated to disclose that the party received complaints from two female employees about serious bullying” in Lowe’s offices.One of the complainants worked in Lowe’s parliamentary office and the other in his Great Yarmouth constituency office, they said, adding: “We understand complaints have been made to parliamentary authorities.”The statement said: “Evidence was provided to us of workplace bullying, the targeting of female staff who raised concerns, and evidence of derogatory and discriminatory remarks made about women, including reference to a perceived disability.“We feel we have a duty of care to all our staff, whether employed directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we appointed an independent king’s counsel to conduct an investigation into the veracity of these complaints. To date, Mr Lowe has yet to cooperate with this investigation.“In addition to these allegations of a disturbing pattern of behaviour, Mr Lowe has on at least two occasions made threats of physical violence against our party chairman. Accordingly, this matter is with the police.”A Reform spokesperson said Lowe had lost the party whip in parliament.In a reply sent to the Guardian and posted on X, Lowe said he was “disappointed, but not surprised” at the statement, and that he had fully cooperated with the KC, saying she was “shocked” at what had happened.He said: “Allegations of physical threats are outrageous and entirely untrue. I have never made any derogatory comments about women, or those with disabilities. This is a lie. These allegations are not even referring to me. I will be seeking legal advice immediately.“There is no credible evidence against me, as the KC has stated on numerous occasions.”On Thursday, Lowe, the former Southampton FC chair, criticised Farage’s leadership in an interview.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also suggested he could leave the party unless it was centred less around Farage’s “messianic” leadership, and had a formal frontbench. There has been speculation within Reform about tensions between Lowe and Farage, especially after Musk’s intervention.Farage responded angrily, saying Lowe would not have had a chance of winning a seat without his leadership of the party.In his statement, Lowe said it was “no surprise that this vexatious statement has been issued the day after my reasonable and constructive questions of Nigel and the Reform structure”.He added: “I have been pushing for this behind the scenes for many months, with zero success. I have been frozen out of meetings, policy discussions, press conferences and more. My repeated requests for better communication and regular meetings have been ignored and mocked.”The statement went on: “If they want to kick me out over false claims, they’ll have to finally present some credible evidence against me. There is none, as the KC has just told me.“A complete inability to accept even the most mild constructive criticism without such a malicious reaction is not effective leadership.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageLee AndersonnewsShareReuse this content"

The law was imposed by China to quell dissent after pro-democracy protests in 2019.Lai isthe founder of the now-shuttered Chinese-language tabloid Apple Daily,which supported the protests, and he is one of the most prominent figures to be prosecuted under the law. The collusion offence carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, while Lai also faces a charge related to “seditious publications”.“It is desperate now,” Sebastien Lai told journalists at a briefing in London organised by the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) rights group. “I really don’t know how long my father has.”UN rights experts have called for Lai’s release, as have western governments including Britain.A UK government spokesperson said: “British national Jimmy Lai’s case is a priority. We continue to call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately release Jimmy Lai.”Last year Starmer raised Lai’s case with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and has said securing his freedom was a priority for the government.UK-based lawyers for Hong Kong activist Jimmy Lai targeted by Chinese stateRead moreBut in London, Lai’s legal team said more urgency was needed. One of his lawyers, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, said delays in proceedings coupled with Lai’s age, health and conditions of detention could lead to “a British national dying in prison for being a journalist and for standing up for democratic values.“That’s why there’s such an urgency today to actually getting on with sitting down to talk to the government,” she told journalists.RSF’s UK director, Fiona O’Brien, said Lai’s plight had reached a “pivotal moment”. It was, she said, “a case about the values of press freedom for which he has fought his whole life”.But Sun Qingye, the deputy chief of Beijing’s national security apparatus in Hong Kong, on Friday dismissed the idea of freeing Jimmy Lai. It was wrong to put pressure on judges, he added.“This matter must be dealt with according to law,” Sun told reporters on the sidelines of Beijing’s annual political gathering. “Why grant a pardon? What would be the reason?”In Hong Kong, Lai’s lawyers concluded their defence on Friday, a day after he wrapped up his testimony. The case was adjourned to 28 July for closing arguments.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no motive for them to lie and [the claimant] has not suggested any, beyond making wild allegations as to an alleged conspiracy.“These witnesses have remained willing to give their evidence voluntarily despite the fact that, over the course of litigation, [the claimant] has published a number of statements on social media and elsewhere expressly or impliedly denigrating those who have made allegations against him, no doubt in the hope of deterring women from cooperating with [the defendant].“[The claimant] went so far as to threaten one of the women, ‘Imogen’, with a report to the police if she did not agree to meet [the claimant’s] solicitors. She did not agree and he carried out his threat.”Millar said the women had chosen to give evidence “at personal cost” as they would have to “recount and relive in public experiences that were personal and private and, at best, deeply unpleasant for them”.In oral submissions, Millar told the court that, before publication, there was a three-and-a-half-week investigation by two reporters overseen by the Guardian’s head of investigations working very long hours.Millar told the court the journalists independently corroborated the initial allegations received by the Guardian.He said that by the time of the publication of the sixth article, the journalists had spoken to 34 sources with credible first-hand allegations against Clarke. He said this was “an unusually high number”.For Clarke’s arguments to succeed, Millar said “the allegations received by the Guardian all have to be lies”, stressing that there was no independent evidence to suggest this.According to GNM’s written submissions to court, its evidence will include claims that Clarke:Touched an actor close to her vagina with his erect penis during filming of a sex scene.Exposed his erect penis to a producer who worked for him and later sexually assaulted her while they were away on business in Los Angeles.Secretly filmed a young actor’s naked audition.Followed a production coordinator into a cubicle in the women’s toilets and propositioned her.Shared explicit photographs of women without their consent.Made inappropriate sexual comments to women.The former Doctor Who star, who was in court, denies all the allegations. Philip Williams, appearing for Clarke, said the actor was seeking £70m in damages if successful in the six-week trial.The biggest libel award in British legal historyis believed to be £1.5m.Williams said in written submissions that his client was the victim of a conspiracy that sought “to cause irreparable damage to the claimant’s reputation and consequent financial loss. The conspirators did this by creating and/or corroborating and/or relaying and/or reporting false and fabricated allegations of rape, sexual assault, other sexual misconduct and false and/or exaggerated claims of sexual harassment.”He said the Guardian’s sources were motivated by “maliciousness … plainly aimed at sabotaging the claimant’s Bafta award [awarded in 2021 for outstanding British contribution to cinema]”. The award was later suspended.Williams claimed the Guardian had “been caught up in a nasty conspiracy”.Williams said the Guardian had “played the role of judge, jury and executioner” of Clarke’s career and reputation. In oral submissions he said the Guardian’s reporting had “more holes than a colander”, was untrue and that the publisher did not reasonably believe it was in the public interest.“They didn’t carry out the investigations properly,” he said. “The answers were there in plain sight, the contradictions were there in plain sight, the dishonesty was there in plain sight.”He added: “Without proper proof, the Guardian’s journalists still recklessly proceeded to publication.”Clarke does admit commenting twice on the buttocks of a standby art director for film and TV who worked for him on his film Brotherhood. But he says he apologised, including formally at a meeting, and his apology was accepted.Clarke says some of the complainants continued to work with him and maintained positive relationships with him, which he claims they would not have done if the allegations were true.He said in some cases it was his accusers who had made sexual comments to him or engaged in consensual “banter”.Clarke also claims there are inconsistencies in witness statements, including in timelines, which make it impossible that specific incidents took place as alleged.The trial is expected to last about five weeks, with Clarke due to begin giving evidence under oath on Monday.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

They facilitated the works and directed the other organised crime gang members to the illegal road digs.Graham Roberts.Photograph: North West Regional Organised Crime Unit/PAGraham Roberts, known as “Ganny”, was “the skilled worker of the company” and “an integral part of the operation”, according to the CPS. A cable jointer by trade, he did the physical fitting of the new electric cables.Others were groundsmen and responsible for making the work look legitimate. The group would use WhatsApp to communicate about “work” and work in “plain sight”, wearing high visibility clothing.Ross McGinn.Photograph: North West Regional Organised Crime Unit/PAAll of the men pleaded guilty to encouraging or assisting an offence and conspiracy to abstract electricity. McGinn, who wiped away tears as he was jailed for five years and four months, and Andrew Roberts, who was given the highest sentence of six years, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal. Two other men will be sentenced at a later date.James Allison, senior crown prosecutor with the CPS’s Mersey-Cheshire’s Complex Casework Unit, said the men played a vital role in assisting organised criminals to set up large numbers of cannabis farms all over the UK.“The pretence of being genuine workmen digging up the road and repairing utilities was the perfect disguise.“But they were working with and for Albanian nationals and other gangs to assist with the setup of cannabis farms by interfering with the mains electricity to power the farms.“The term ‘professional enablers’ for organised crime describes their involvement.“The work they did to divert the electricity was described by a professional electrical inspector as poor and often dangerous.“They no doubt thought they would get away with their criminal operation but they were wrong and are now behind bars.”A photo found on a phone showed Roberts with burns to his face thought to have been caused while he was at “work”.The investigation found the men were involved in incidents in England, Scotland and Wales. Forces including the Metropolitan police, Avon and Somerset, Durham, Gloucestershire, Humberside, Kent, Leicestershire, Norfolk, Northumbria, Thames Valley, West Mercia and South Yorkshire were involved.Explore more on these topicsCrimeDrugsCannabisPoliceUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Videos of the massacre show people dressed in civilian clothes piled on top of one another as women wailed. Another video in a second town showed gunmen executing seemingly unarmed men who were crawling on their hands and knees away from them.The Guardian was unable to independently verify either of the videos.Syria’s interior ministry said some “individual violations” had taken place as a result of people heading towards the villages being attacked by Assad loyalists, but did not claim responsibility for the alleged executions. “We are working to put a stop to these violations that do not represent the Syrian people as a whole,” an interior ministry source told Syria’s state broadcaster.The Guardian asked for a specific comment from the interior ministry on the SNHR’s claims, but did not receive a response by the time of publishing.The UN special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, urged protection for civilians as clashes intensified. “There is clearly an immediate need for restraint from all parties, and full respect for the protection of civilians in accordance with international law,” Pedersen said in a statement.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises as members of the Syrian security forces battle a nascent insurgency in Latakia.Photograph: Karam Al-Masri/ReutersGovernment forces continued to battle with Assad regime loyalists late on Friday night, launching a military operation in Qardaha, Latakia, the home town of the former Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, according to state media.A source in the military of defence said security forces were targeting the buildings and hills around the town where former regime elements were hiding out.The two-day, coordinated attack was a marked escalation by loyalists to the former government against Syria’s new rulers.The new government in Damascus is struggling to consolidate its grip over the country. An Israeli incursion in south-east Syria, as well as an economic malaise perpetuated by western sanctions, threaten to undermine the fledgling authority’s rule.The attack began in the town of Jableh, Latakia, on Thursday but soon spread to other areas. Gunmen cut off roads in the countryside and seized control of areas in the towns of Qardaha and Baniyas.A video released by a former Assad regime officer shortly after the operation began called on Syria’s various sects to rise up against the government in Damascus in what it dubbed operation “coastal shield”.Lengthy military columns of security officers and militias loyal to the government in Damascus quickly started heading towards Latakia from across Syria to quell the rebellion. Government forces began to carry out “combing operations” to catch gunmenA curfew was established on the coast provinces and in Homs province, with people instructed not to leave their homes until 9am on Saturday.“Civilians are being killed two blocks down from me. The fights are becoming bigger, I have no clue what’s going to happen,” said a resident of Jableh over the phone while sheltering in their home on Friday.Saudi Arabia condemned what it described as “crimes” by “outlaw groups” and reaffirmed its backing for the new authorities.9:25A journey through the new Syria: what is the future after Assad? – videoSyria’s coast is populated by Alawites, the sect from which the Assad family hailed, though most of the sect had no relation to the former regime. Mutual suspicion between Alawites in the coastal region and the new rulers of Syria has persisted since the toppling of the Assad regime.Despite assurances that minorities, including Alawites, would be safe in the new Syria, Alawite communities have been subject to a number of revenge killings since December.In one case, on 31 January in the town of Arza, in Homs province, eight men were asked if they were Alawite and then executed with a bullet to the head. Ten more men were executed in Arza on Friday, with their bodies left out in the open, SNHR reported.Syria’s new rulers have said the killings were “individual cases” committed by individuals and groups unaffiliated with the government in Damascus, but that has done little to quell the growing fears of Alawites.The new Syrian authorities have come under criticism for not being inclusive enough of Syria’s religious diversity and its vast civil society. A transitional government is to be announced in the coming weeks, the makeup of which will be a key test for the new rulers of Syria’s commitment to pluralism.Explore more on these topicsSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We ask that they bring the dogs … that are certified to find human remains and bones,” Índira Navarro, a representative of the collective,told AFP.The crematorium was found on a ranch that was secured by authorities several months ago, in an operation that led to the arrest of 10 armed people, the release of two that had been kidnapped, and the discovery of a body.The ranch, which included a rudimentary kind of obstacle course, is thought to have been used as a recruitment and training centre for new members of theJalisco New Generation cartel.‘An atmosphere of terror’: the bloody rise of Mexico’s top cartelRead moreThe Jalisco cartel,recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration, is one of Mexico’s most powerful organised crime groups and is involved in the trafficking of drugs and people across the country and internationally.Authoritiessaidthey had been unable to explore the extensive ranch fully when they first found it, and that the ovens and bones found this week had been “hidden under a layer of earth and a brick slab, which prevented their detection in the initial inspection”.When members of the collective arrived at the ranch this week, they found a shed with clothing, handbags, backpacks, suitcases and shoes scattered across the ground. Within a few hours they found the first of three underground ovens.Authorities are yet to determine how many people the remains found on the ranch may belong to.According to the National Search Commission, Jalisco has almost 15,000 missing people, making it the state with the most disappeared people inMexico.Across Mexico, more than 100,000 people are registered as disappeared.But that figure could be an undercount, given that many fear to report cases to the authorities.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Another message followed on Telegram: “Can we look into this guy or would it raise too many questions?” And so a spy ring of Bulgarians based in Britain but working for Russia began to form.The author was Jan Marsalek, a fugitive businessman accused of involvement in a €1.9bn fraud on the German payments company Wirecard – and an agent forRussia. Earlier that year he had fled to Moscow, and now he had time on his hands. The message’s recipient was Orlin Roussev, 47, an IT specialist and private investigator who had been based in the UK for several years – and somebody Marsalek appeared to know well.Their target was a high-profile investigative journalist who specialised in investigating Russia’s spy agencies. Earlier that day, Grozev and colleagues at the Bellingcat website had published a major investigation. They had implicated eight members of Russia’s FSB spy agency – and by inference Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin – of poisoning the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with novichok,lacing his underpants, it later emerged, with the neurotoxin.graphicAfter hundreds of hours of surveillance of Grozev,and a few weeks before the spy ring was rolled up by British investigators, Marsalek messaged Roussev to say he did not find the journalist an appealing target but “apparently Putin seriously hates him”.What followed in the two and a half years after that first message was sent was not one plot, but several. At Marsalek’s direction and funding, Roussev built a network of Bulgarians whose activities stretched acrossEurope– from Vienna to Valencia, Stuttgart to Montenegro.Their work included intensive surveillance, magnified by talk of kidnap and murder, but there was also bluster and bravado, amateurish planning and chaotic mistakes. And in the background was a tangle of relationships, a love triangle and a fake cancer diagnosis. All three defendants told the court they had been manipulated, and two of the three even said they had thought they were working for Interpol, not Russian intelligence.Much of this played out in court seven at the Old Bailey during a three-month trial of three of those involved, described dismissively by Roussev as “the minions”. The defendants were each charged with a single count of espionage, which they denied – saying they had been manipulated. But the most revealing details emerged in the extraordinary dialogue – across 78,747 Telegram messages – between the ringleader, Roussev, and his boss, Marsalek, that police had been fortunate to find. The key breakthrough, officers acknowledged, was finding the messages on Roussev’s phone: the IT specialist had forgotten to press delete.Body-worn camera footage of Roussev’s arrest at his home, a former guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, shortly after 6am on 8 February 2023 shows officers finding hundred of thousands of pounds’ worth of IT equipment piled up in several rooms in what Roussev called his “Indiana Jones garage”. With police officers at his throat, Roussev boldly tried to claim “I think it’s the wrong place” – but the weight of evidence was such that he pleaded guilty to espionage before the trial began.1:16Footage shows police arresting Orlin Roussev at his residence – videoIn December 2020, when Marsalek asked Roussev to start collecting information about Grozev, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was still more than a year away. In Britain, MI5 hoped that Russian spying was at a low ebb. After the UK had expelled 23 Russian diplomats іn 2018 after thepoisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, Moscow was believed to no longer have any traditional embassy-based spies at its disposal.Keen to maintain its espionage activities however, the Kremlin concluded new methods were needed, recruiting criminals and the naive, often without training, to carry out its dirty work.Prosecutors and police concluded the spy ring was involved in six main plots. The first – and one of the two most important – was the intensive surveillance of Grozev across Europe, coupled with efforts to seize his laptop, a particular obsession of Marsalek’s. Grozev had worked with Navalny – before the latter’s ill-fated return to Russia – on the investigations exposing the poisoning plot and its links to the FSB, which had embarrassed the Kremlin.“Our friends are 95% certain Grozev is ‘managed’ by MI6,” Marsalek wrote in January 2022.Jan Marsalek.At Marsalek’s direction, Roussev first orchestrated the surveillance of a villa linked to Grozev in his native Bulgaria. The effort then expanded to Vienna, where the journalist lived, and then to following him to a Bellingcat conference in Valencia, Spain.A camera was trained on Grozev’s apartment in Vienna, though they discovered he was living at his father’s flat out of town. His post was intercepted. Marsalek and Roussev discussed hacking his wifi in Vienna – and they regularly debated kidnapping him or worse, though abduction plans did not develop. It “feels like we must poison him next, just to live up to past stories”, Marsalek wrote to Roussev in September 2021.Roussev found a way to obtain airline reservations and told Marsalek he was paying somebody at Swissport, which provides airport services, €1,000 a month to access the system. They monitored Grozev’s travel plans and worked out he was going to the Bellingcat event in Valencia in September 2021. Plans were made to follow him, but Roussev did not carry out surveillance himself – in fact, he was not described as having left the UK at all. To carry out the operations on the ground, Roussev needed a team.Biser Dzhambazov, 43, was a medical courier working in London and a close friend of Roussev. The operation’s number two, he called himself Max, or “Mad Max”. In his WhatsApp chats with Roussev, he called himself “Van Dam”, after Jean-Claude Van Damme, while his boss was “Jackie Chan”. Dzhambazov was described in the trial as a larger-than-life character, always laughing and joking – “the soul of the party”, one defendant said. Like Roussev, he pleaded guilty and did not appear or give evidence in the trial.In August 2021, as the surveillance of Grozev in Vienna was getting going, Dzhambazov’s personal life was becoming more complicated. He had known Katrin Ivanova, 33, a lab technician and the first defendant in the spy trial, since she was 17 and had lived with her for years. They worked at the same firm and lived in a one-bedroom flat in Harrow, north-west London. But that spring he had met the second defendant, Vanya Gaberova, 30, a beautician, and by August he was declaring his feelings for her – insisting his relationship with Ivanova was effectively over.View image in fullscreenA selfie of Vanya Gaberova and Biser Dzhambazov shown to the jury.It was not, and Dzhambazov ended up dating both women. (Neither of the women had met before the trial began; both ended up having to sit in the dock). When police moved to arrest Gaberova, also shortly after 6am on 8 February 2023, they found her in bed with a naked Dzhambazov in a flat near Euston that he and Ivanova were supposed to have moved into one day. He had falsely told both women he had brain cancer, and used the lie and his surveillance activities to create opportunities to spend time with Gaberova away from London, or by himself.Ivanova’s defence was that she had been manipulated by Dzhambazov, with whom she said she had been in an abusive relationship, though it was not violent. She told the jury she had no idea she had been spying for Russia, portraying herself as apolitical. Instead, she said she had been told Grozev was a corrupt journalist and she was going to help expose his relationship with an arms dealer.The chief prosecutor, Alison Morgan KC, used Ivanova’s personal life to try to show she was not a naive victim but somebody with her own judgment and agency. Morgan described Ivanova as a liar but “not a stupid person”, and she forced her to admit to the court that she had also been having an affair.“Who’s Stoyan?” Morgan asked. Ivanova demurred before admitting she had had an affair, but she fought back. Yes, she and Dzhambazov had had an open relationship, but she had told him what she had done, whereas he had “been in a parallel relationship with somebody for 18 months”, she said.After police arrested Ivanova at work, they recovered 11 fake passports and identity documents in the flat she shared with Dzhambazov – of which she said she was unaware – and several surveillance devices, which she acknowledged she had known about, though she said they belonged to Roussev. The most memorable of these was a spy camera hidden in a large modified plastic Coca-Cola bottle and another hidden in the flower of a Minion toy from the Despicable Me film series, both of which were passed to a curious jury for inspection.View image in fullscreenA spy camera hidden in a Coca-Cola bottle, recovered by police from a flat in Harrow, north west London, where Biser Dzhambazov and Katrin Ivanova livedGrozev was followed by Ivanova while taking a flight from Vienna to Montenegro in June 2022. To keep an eye on him, she wore a pair of surveillance glasses. Except, when it came to proving that he had got on the plane, she chose to photograph him on her mobile phone and send the picture to Dzhambazov.The process of monitoring was neatly recorded by the special glasses and the footage of Ivanova recording herself was obtained by police and played to the jury as an example, prosecutors said, of the level of surveillance of the journalist.0:26Ivanova records Grozev on plane with surveillance glasses – videoAnother target of interest to Marsalek was a Russian investigative journalist living in exile in the UK, Roman Dobrokhotov. Scanning of flight records by Roussev, with the help of the corrupt Swissport employee, had found the journalist was due to fly from Budapest to Berlin on 26 November 2021. “I absolutely LOVE that airline system,” Marsalek wrote when Roussev told him the news, and he said he would “love to kidnap” him.Roussev was able to book tickets for Ivanova to sit in seat 4B next to Dobrokhotov. Ivanova covertly filmed the reporter during the flight, coolly placing her phone on record and leaving it in a pocket in a TK Maxx bag. She even managed to see and memorise the pin to unlock his phone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ivanova told the jury she took on the job simply because she was asked to by Dzhambazov. “I was supporting a partner,” she told the court, and insisted she felt no fear in secretly recording the reporter.By this stage, Dzhambazov’s relationship with Gaberova was in full swing. The beautician told the court he made her believe he worked for Interpol and produced a fake badge and photo ID. She had told him “my dream is to be police” and enthusiastically went along with his story. He had told her he had a lot of free time on his surveillance jobs and invited her to Valencia in September 2021, where he was planning to follow Grozev. For her, it would be a “free holiday”, she said.Their relationship started there, Gaberova told the court. Dzhambazov told her he would break up with Ivanova, who was arriving in Valencia the next day. Ivanova came and went, and the new couple stayed on at the luxury Valencia Palace hotel, where they had been able to book a room – going €1,900 over budget. Unbeknown to the Bellingcat team, they watched Grozev, who breakfasted every day at 9am. At one point, Dzhambazov asked Gaberova to follow Grozev, she said. He told her Interpol often used untrained people to help because they did not stand out in a crowd. Dzhambazov had “an answer for everything”, Gaberova told the court.View image in fullscreenJurors were shown this mundane surveillance image taken of Christo Grozev having breakfast at the Valencia Palace hotel.She said Dzhambazov also asked her to befriend Grozev on Facebook, having told her he was “a bad journalist”. She did and he accepted the request. Unbeknown to her, once they heard of it in late September 2021, this development got Marsalek – with whom none of the three defendants communicated – and Roussev excited. In messages read out in court, they said they thought they could somehow lure Grozev into a honeytrap. “I hope she doesn’t fall in love with him,” Marsalek wrote, saying he had had that problem before. In reply, Roussev argued: “You are using the wrong type of girls,” and that Gaberova was “very very assertive and strongly independent … true sexy bitch”.Chain of messages between Roussev and Marsalek discussing defendant Vanya GaberovaLike Ivanova, whom she had not met before their arrest, Gaberova said in court she had been manipulated by Dzhambazov and that she had largely been duped into believing he worked in Interpol’s economic crime department and she was helping him. After a while, she said, she did become suspicious about his brain cancer story, but she tearfully told the court she believed him again after he sent her images of himself with what was obviously toilet paper around his head. He told her he was recovering from surgery and she believed him. “I thought it was like a bandage in a hospital,” she said.View image in fullscreenA screengrab from Telegram of Dzhambazov, wearing what appears to be loo roll on his head, while on a video call with Vanya Gaberova.But she struggled to explain what she had been doing in Montenegro on another surveillance operation aimed at a Russian in exile, and insisted she had accepted Dzhambazov’s story about Interpol and requests for help – such as befriending Grozev on Facebook – at face value. Before her arrest she had thought nothing was amiss, she said, but when pressed by Morgan in court during cross-examination, she responded with an emotional outburst: “Seeing this now, I was manipulated, used, exposed – everything.”The third and final defendant in court was Gaberova’s ex-boyfriend Tihomir Ivanchev, a painter and decorator, who was arrested a year after the two women. The most peripheral of the three, he said he was recruited by Gaberova and Dzhambazov to help with the surveillance of Grozev in Montenegro. Unlike the two other defendants, who chose to undergo cross-examination from Morgan, he did not give evidence, but he was the only one to have given a detailed police interview.Ivanchev described his recruitment by Dzhambazovin a conversation outside a pub in the autumn of 2021. He said he was not shown any fake ID by Dzhambazov, but was persuaded that he worked for Interpol when Dzhambazov showed him some pictures of faked passports from his phone. Ivanchev said he was asked to help Dzhambazov, though there was no training and no equipment was provided. Ivanchev was asked to go to Vienna where he would take some pictures relating to the surveillance of Grozev on his own phone, for which he would be paid €200 a day plus expenses – though this was cut to €150 after he was accused of being lazy. “There was too much pressure for this money,” he told police.Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, a painter and decorator living in Enfield north London, was arrested a year after his two co-defendants.“Who are Interpol to you?” one of the interrogating officers asked, deadpan. In reply, an embarrassed-sounding Ivanchev didn’t have much to say, offering: “From the movies,” and: “Just, uh, chasing criminals,” before he acknowledged his involvement, “right now the dumbest thing I have ever done in my life”.If Marsalek was the scheming general, Ivanchev was like a fresh Russian soldier sent to Ukraine – untrained and deployed without much consideration for his future.The final and most serious plot that unfolded in court related to planned surveillance of the US Patch barracks in Stuttgart. By now it was October 2022 and the war in Ukraine had been running for more than half a year.At the plot’s heart was a highly sophisticated, military-grade Razor II surveillance device costing an estimated £120,000. The size of a toaster, the device is capable of capturing the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (Imsi) numbers that uniquely identify each mobile phone on a network – and the plan was to covertly use it in Germany. After the verdicts, investigating officers said they had never seen such a device in criminal hands before.“On an entirely separate note, can we use the IMSI catcher in Germany? We need to spy on Ukrainian [sic] at a German military base,” Marsalek wrote to Roussev on 19 October 2022. The belief was that Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to use Patriot air defence systems there, and by placing the Imsi catcher nearby it could mop up mobile numbers belonging to the soldiers. Fast-forward a few months and if the numbers obtained could now be found in a concentration in Ukraine, it could point to the location of a Patriot battery, a significant piece of military intelligence.A day later, Roussev set up a WhatsApp group, with Dzhambazov as a member, outlining plans for observation “of the entrance to a training regiment for Ukrainian soldiers” and to try to find a flat to rent and cars to hire. Dzhambazov flew out to Stuttgart with Ivanova, and on 31 October the pair walked around the perimeter of the base, with her filming on her mobile phone.In her evidence, Ivanova said this was when she first openly raised concerns with Dzhambazov. She told the court she was happy to go to Germany because it was a rare chance to see her father, and she said she was baffled to be asked to visit the base. “Multiple times I was questioning him: ‘What are we doing here?’,” she said, but her concerns were dismissed. “You are being a headache with your questions,” he had said, she recounted. In any event, the pair took video of the site’s perimeter that day and the day after.The car to contain the Imsi catcher was rigged up with a large red button at the front on the left above the air conditioning vent. Prosecutors said this was to power up the surveillance device.Reconnaissance completed, the planning for the audacious operation continued. “Our friends here have asked to ask you/the team to be extremely careful,” Marsalek warned in early December. Roussev managed to buy a left-hand-drive Chrysler for £4,200 in cash from a secondhand dealer in the UK. A plan was made to secrete the Imsi catcher within and power it with an extra car battery. Police found the car in a community garage attached to Dzhambazov and Ivanova’s flat in Harrow, and it had been rigged up with a large red button at the front. “It might as well say ‘press go for Imsi’,” Morgan theatrically told the court.Police believe the plan appeared to be technically sound, but it was foiled days before it was due to be carried out by the pre-dawn arrests of Roussev, Dzhambazov, Ivanova and Gaberova.Investigators traced more than €210,000 of money flowing from Roussev to the others involved, principally indirectly via Dzhambazov. For all the soap opera of relationships and behind-the-scenes boasting, Cdr Dom Murphy, the Met’s head of counter-terrorism, said the spy ring’s activities were sophisticated, they engaged frequently “in lifestyle surveillance”, and “the concern is what is it [the information obtained] going to be used for”.Today, Grozev lives in New York, away from his family, because Europe is no longer safe enough. And as the events described at the Old Bailey demonstrate, Russia’s threatening efforts persist and increase.Explore more on these topicsEspionageCrimeRussiaBulgariaEuropeJournalist safetynewsShareReuse this content"

The crisis over Ukraine has very much pushed the UK closer towards the centre stage than at any point since Brexit. But is this a new era or a false dawn?One thing is certain: the optics of engagement have changed. Starmer never shared Boris Johnson’s almost active pride in stoking a row with Brussels, but particularly before the election his advisers were wary of reminding voters about his past as a diehard remainer.With support for Ukraine about as close as the UK gets to an all-party consensus, things are very different. Starmer can be photographed at the very centre of a gathering of mainly European leaders,as he was on Sunday, safe in the knowledge that even Nigel Farage will praise him for his diplomacy.Donald Trump’s apparent abandonment ofUkraineand reversal away from decades of Nato defence guarantees “has really accelerated the rapprochement between Britain and Europe, not just the EU”, said Peter Ricketts, the former senior UK diplomat and government national security adviser, who is now a crossbench peer.“All the reports I’ve heard from European friends in Brussels and Paris and elsewhere are that they are impressed and pleased with the Sunday meeting, and the sense that Britain is back in its natural place as a leader in European security,” he said. “It has taken the crisis, in a way, to really galvanise the improving relations that were already under way.”This is happening amid what could be seen as a wider political shift. Polls about Brexitincreasingly showthat many voters view it as a mistake, and while there is arguably minimal appetite to revisit an issue that crippled UK politics for several years, trade unions are nowpushing for closer EU ties.So could the necessities of supporting Ukraine help smooth the way for a close EU-UK relationship on trade? Lord Ricketts said he would be surprised if any of these Brussels red lines were suddenly blurred.“I would draw a distinction between defence issues and the treaty-based issues about trade, fishing and energy markets and so on, which are all rooted in EU texts or EU-UK legal texts, which are going to be slower to change,” he said. “I think even with a crisis in Europe, in those sorts of areas it’s going to be slow going.”Ukraine is to an extent a distinct issue. Defence links are often separated from Brussels, while the still-emerging “coalition of the willing” to fill the security vacuum covers some non-EU European states such as Norway, as well as Canada and potentially Australia.“The defence and foreign policy wonks were already comfortable with a closer relationship with the UK,” said Ian Bond, another former UK diplomat, who is deputy director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank. “The problem is what happens in other parts.”He added: “The thing will be to keep as much as possible of the new relationship at the level of leaders. Macron gets it, I think that when Friedrich Merz becomes German chancellor he will get it.“If their fishing ministers don’t get it, that’s something which hopefully they will manage domestically, rather than the reset of the EU-UK relationship coming to a grinding halt over how many sand eels Danish fishers are allowed to catch off the Dogger Bank.”And what of the domestic political considerations for Starmer? According to Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at the University of Bristol and the deputy director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, these are thus far relatively minimal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But now a row over a billionaire maverick has thrown the Royal Society into crisis, splintering the fellowship and raising existential questions about its role in society.A growing number of scientists have called for the academy to investigate the conduct of Elon Musk – who was elected a fellow in 2018 – resulting in apassionate debateat a meeting of the scientific body on Monday evening.Critics claim Musk’s behaviour has violated the Royal Society’s code, citing hisincendiary comments about British politicians, his calls for the American doctor and scientist Anthony Fauci to be prosecuted, and his role in slashing research funding through his work with the so-called US “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – among other acts.Royal Society urged to expel Elon Musk as fellows sign open letterRead moreSeveral fellows have even called openly for Musk to be ejected from the academy.“I thinkElon Muskshould be expelled from the British Royal Society,” the Nobel laureate and AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton wrote on X. “Not because he peddles conspiracy theories and makes Nazi salutes, but because of the huge damage he is doing to scientific institutions in the US. Now let’s see if he really believes in free speech.”Musk replied: “Only craven, insecure fools care about awards and memberships. History is the actual judge, always and forever. Your comments above are carelessly ignorant, cruel and false. That said, what specific actions require correction? I will make mistakes, but endeavor to fix them fast.”Perhaps it is just such a volte-face the Royal Society is banking on. Because despiteprivate communications, anopen letter signed by more than 3,500 membersof the scientific community,resignations by fellowsandjournal editorsandMonday’s meeting, the academy has yet to comment on the tech entrepreneur.While Musk’s behaviour is very public, the Royal Society insists its handling of concerns remains confidential. Fellows have been instructed not to talk to the press while the academy itself has released only abroad statement after Monday’s meetingoutlining fellows’ concerns about cuts to research funding in the US and the need for the society to step up its efforts to advocate for science and scientists.“The society agreed to look at potential further actions that might help make the case for science and scientific research and counter the misinformation and ideologically motivated attacks on both science and scientists,” the statement added.What form that might take is unclear. The Guardian understands a letter will be sent toMusk from the Royal Society(although its contents have yet to be decided) and – at present – no formal proceedings or investigations are under way.It is not the first time Musk has divided opinions among the fellowship. Not everyone was happy when he was proposed for election – an honour apparently bestowed for his work in fields including space travel and sustainable electric transportation.Becoming a fellow of theRoyal Societyis often seen as the pinnacle of a long research career. But Musk is a businessman, not an academic, and some argue that he is not himself an innovator.At the heart of the latest furore is whether Musk has violated theacademy’s code of conduct, which includes the stipulation that fellows shall “not act or fail to act in any way which would undermine the Society’s mission or bring the Society into disrepute”.“I haven’t yet come across anybody who has made a clear argument that actuallyElon Muskis not in contravention of the code of conduct,” said Stephen Curry, an emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, who – while not a fellow – wrote the open letter many fellows signed.Curry said rebuttals had focused on concerns about punishing people for their political views. “But I reject that completely,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe Royal Society is based in Carlton House Terrace in central London.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesProf Dorothy Bishop, a leading expert on children’s communication disorders, revealed that after she and other fellows initially raised concerns about Musk’s behaviour in the summer of 2024 and a lawyer for the academy determined Musk had not breached the code. The group subsequently set about gathering further evidence of breaches but for Bishop the situation became untenable. Sheresigned her fellowshipin November.In February, another fellow, ProfAndrew Millar, followed suit.The Royal Society’s documents set out that if an investigation into allegations of misconduct is upheld, the matter would pass to the conduct committee, a hearing would take place, and – if misconduct is deemed to have occurred – sanctions would be applied, with expulsion among the options.Yet Bishop said no fellow has been ejected from the academy in more than 150 years.“It does suggest that the statutes are worded so that it is virtually impossible to do anything about fellows who breach the code of conduct,” she wrote inher resignation statement.One of the few fellows to be ejected was Rudolf Erich Raspe, who was booted out in1775after being charged with “divers frauds and gross breaches of trust”.Expelling Musk might bring new headaches, not least as he isnot the only controversial fellow. In inviting fellows to Monday’s meeting, the academy’spresident, Sir Adrian Smith,said: “The business of the society is the advancement of the cause of science through rigorous rational scientific debate and council considers that we are on difficult ground if the society makes judgments as to the acceptability of the views or affiliations of our colleagues.”Expelling Musk could also be politically difficult at a time of heightened tensions between the UK and US. Some in the scientific community are adamantscience should not be politicised, and have arguedrevoking Musk’s fellowship could undermine trust in science.“In a nutshell, my argument is that the public trusts scientists more than politicians because it believes they are impartial and objective experts. Scientists who stray beyond the evidence and become campaigners or advocates for particular policies risk losing that trust,” Fiona Fox, a fellow of the Royal Society and chief executive of the Science Media Centre, wrote. “My worry is that ejecting Musk from the Royal Society would be seen as a political move.”Otherscientists who have voiced support for Muskhave argued that, despite his actions being reprehensible, Musk has made huge contributions to engineering.At present, the Royal Society insists “any issues raised in respect of individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence”. But some fellows back public action suggesting that, regardless of whether they launch an investigation – something that is required to be confidential under the organisation’s rules – the Royal Society should release an open letter or public statement condemning Musk’s attack on science.Fundamentally, it seems, the Royal Society must decide, and explain, where its red lines lie – not only in theory, but in practice.Explore more on these topicsRoyal SocietyIsaac NewtonElon MuskCharles DarwinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I feelas though whoever married her son would never be good enough.Having grown up in eastern Europe, she came to the UK in the 1980s having met and married my father-in-law in her home country. She has been deeply unhappy here and in her marriage. She seems to hate anything “British” or representing British culture and so I feelI have become a representative of that.She has recently startedwatching right-wing news and has a deep mistrust of any mainstream media.She regularly sends out petitions for her family members to sign. My husband and her daughters ignore these. Friends of hers who have engaged or pushed back end up in huge arguments with her. She is totally unreasonable and always turns it round so that she isthe “victim”. I feel quite passionate about politics and feelshe should be pulled up on heropinionsand that ignoring themalmost reinforces her as being correct.I recently replied to a particularly incendiary petition she sent me with “I’m sorry, I can’t sign this”, and I questioned the facts. She then replied to me by accident, thinking she was sending her text to someone else, where she pitied my husband for living with me. I replied to her saying I think she had meant it for someone else, she ignored that.I am so upset. My husband has spoken to her but she manipulates him and ended up telling him how lonely she is and lied about the message. My husband has grown up with this manipulation and I feel angry that he doesn’t showanger or upset that his mum would say this about me.I would like her to apologise to me.I feel for you. Having family members with extreme and misinformed political views is upsetting and exhausting. But you have chronicled yourself how entrenched your mother-in-law is. So I fear we must be realistic.I went to Association forFamilyTherapy and Systemic Practice-accredited psychotherapist, Hannah Sherbersky, who said: “This sounds like a very difficult situation. Your mother-in-law sounds terribly unhappy, and her situation in terms of her suspicion and beliefs may be escalating. In some ways, however, this is not the problem.”Your husband needs to protect you, his wife. I would encourage him to give his mother lots of love – but be really firm tooWhenever we talk about problems with in-laws (and Sherbersky and I did a whole podcast on it which you can listen tohere) the most important thing is for the couple to establish a united front. If this can happen – and unfortunately it so often doesn’t – then at least you have this united bond.Sherbersky said: “I would want to encourage you to get your husband to see that the stakes are high in terms of potential family estrangement, and that the kindest thing he could for both of you is to get a few issues really clear.“I would clearly communicate to your mother-in-law,” she added, “that you and your husband’s values are not the same as hers; that you do love her, and do want her to be part of the family, but you cannot support and agree with her values. For that reason, you will not be involved in any future conversations about it. And your husband needs to stick to that and protect you, his wife. I would encourage him to give his mother lots of love and support – but be really firm and clear with her too.”We know this sounds easy to say but hard to put into practice but it’s key. Could you get the sisters on board too?What you then have to try to do is to not engage in any conversation or message about it. I know you feel a moral responsibility but I don’t think you will ever change her mind: just entrench her further. It will be hard at first to switch off but easier in time and with practice. Wanting an apology, at least a heartfelt one, is ambitious. You’re giving your mother-in-law a lot of power, but in some ways you need to unplug from her.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Those days are gone.Most of our kids get more nutritious lunches than we ever did, and that’s great. But food waste is a serious problem. You don’t necessarily need to opt for the elaboratebento boxesthat have become de rigueur in recent years, but it’s worth considering how we pack it and what will actually get eaten.Claire Thomson’s recipes for back-to-school packed lunchesRead moreDon’t over packA2019 studyestimated that each year Australian students throw away 5 million sandwiches, 3 million pieces of whole fruit and 3 million items of packaged food. Mark Boulet, the study’s lead researcher, says getting kids more involved in choosing and preparing the food they bring to school is a crucial step in bringing those numbers down.The first thing parents should think about is how much food they’re sending to school with children. “Everyone wants to look after their kids but that ‘just in case’ food often gets wasted,” he says, adding that too often “we give them far more than they can get through in the given time at school”.It pays to be aware then of what their eating schedule looks like: when and where your child has a chance to eat and how much time they have. Ask your kid, check in with their teacher and start to develop a suitable school day menu around that.What’s on the menu?Packing things your child is familiar with and enjoys eating is obviously a good first step, but that doesn’t mean hitting the chips and choccy milk aisle. Most processed and packaged food is going to be less nutritious and will produce more waste than food you can make at home and send in reusable packaging.Of course not everyone has time or inclination to prepare homemade everything, but provided the ingredients you use aren’t ultra-processed, a good old-fashioned sandwich, some fresh produce and a treat should be nutritionally adequate and limit packaging waste.Pack it rightWho among us doesn’t remember the disappointment of a soggy tomato sanga, squishy pear or damp crackers at recess? “If it’s not stored and packaged properly it can become pretty unappealing by lunchtime,” Boulet says.He reminds us it’s worth investing in the right kit (cooler bags, ice blocks and containers that don’t cross-contaminate) to ensure food makes it to lunchtime as something you’d be happy to eat yourself.Get kids involvedEvery parent knows their child the best, but Boulet reckons we often do more for them than is needed – and it’s good to think about what they’re capable of doing themselves. Boulet’s study indicates that working with kids on a reasonable shopping list for lunch and taking the time to teach them how to prepare parts of it – even if that is just putting things in the cooler-bag – is empowering and can make a big difference in how interested they are in it come lunchtime. His advice: “Start earlier than you think.”Lunch recipes for your bento box | The lunch boxRead moreDon’t ‘go crook’There’s not much more disgusting and infuriating than unpacking a lunchbox at day’s end only to find a pile of mutilated, half-eaten scraps. But Boulet says it’s imperative parents don’t “go crook when food comes home uneaten”. He says some waste is inevitable and we should encourage kids to bring home any leftovers, moderate our reactions and assess the waste together so it can be used to inform future choices.“Have that dialogue around their tastes and what they actually feel happy and comfortable eating in the confines of the school day.”It’s a moving targetLike most things with young kids, what works for lunch is not a set-and-forget thing. “It’s never static, checking in with kids every day is important,” Boulet says.Boulet, a parent himself, says he is more than sympathetic to how tedious it can be to make school lunches a focal point of your week any more than is strictly necessary.“The food provisioning routines in most family households are pretty tightly wired, so there’s always a bit of discomfort that comes with change. But we have found that if you can sit with that for even a short period of time, you will quickly see a pretty significant change in how much food is getting wasted during the school day.”Share your experienceWhat are your strategies for reducing waste in school lunches?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

She talks about cuppas with Sarah Lancashire and hitting it big in her 50sFri 7 Mar 2025 08.00 ESTShareIt may be one of the most devastating scenes in the history of British television. In the final series ofHappy Valley, Catherine Cawood begins to understand that her sister Clare has betrayed her, and has been lying about where she is. Catherine watches Clare from outside a cafe, then walks in, sits down at Clare’s table and says one iconic word: “Hiya.”Siobhan Finneran, who played Clare for a decade, pops up on my laptop screen. Surely there is only one way to start the conversation. “Hiya,” I deadpan, in my best Sarah Lancashire voice.“Hiya,” Finneran says, cheerfully.“No,” I say, and try again. “Hiya.”She smiles politely. Surely you get “hiya” all the time? “Where’s that from? Benidorm?” she asks.Finneran is perched on a floral sofa, vape in hand. She stopped smoking six months ago, and this has helped keep her off the cigarettes. “Oh, it’s revolting, darlin,” she says. (She says darling a lot, more a northern “darlin” than a luvvie’s “dahling”). Finneran grew up in Oldham and still lives in Saddleworth. “I keep buying the worst ones in the vain hope that I’ll stop. This is called Strawberry Ice.” She giggles. “Absolutely ridiculous. It’s embarrassing asking for them: ‘Two packets of Watermelon Surprise for me.’ Awful!” She’d much rather have a rollie, she admits. “I liked smoking, all day long. So it’s meant I’m not doing that, which is great. But at some point, it will stop. We hope.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d never been the princess’: Siobhan Finneran.Photograph: JF/ITVFromHappy Valleyto Downton Abbey toAlma’s Not Normal, Finneran is a fixture of quality British television. But, amazingly, despite a career so lengthy she had her first role in 1987 and spent nearly a decade in TV sitcom Benidorm, it is only now, in her late 50s, that she is about to get her first top billing in the new ITV thriller Protection. She plays DI Liz Nyles, who runs a witness protection scheme. Can it really be right that this is her first leading role on TV? “Yeah, maybe, darlin. I don’t know. Probably? I’m trying to think. It probably is.” She is clearly not bothered by it. “As long as I can get up and do my job and I can remember my words, that’s really what it’s all about, because I’m much happier, as you always are on a set, working in a team.”I was so gripped by Protection that I was shouting at the screen. It puts practically every character, on all sides of the law, in danger, and refuses to let you trust anyone as deception builds upon deception. “That’s good, if you’re shouting at the telly. I do that all the time. You should go on Gogglebox.” Maybesheshould go onGogglebox. “But I don’t like being on telly other than playing a character. And I’m not sure people need to see me eating bags of Revels and shouting things at the telly.” She likes her private life to be private. Interviews, she says, are “like a form of torture. You haven’t got a character to hide behind. But I’ve got my vape and a glass of water, so I’m all right.”She is happy to talk about acting, though. “Oh, I can talk to you about that, darlin, I can easily talk to you about that,” she says. Her grandmother was a seamstress who loved the theatre. As one of the oldest grandchildren, Finneran would be taken on day trips, getting the train down to the RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon to see whatever was on at the time. “Something must have gone in, or something must have excited me, or there was something I was fascinated by,” she says. She always knew, somehow, that acting was what she’d always wanted to do. “But I didn’t really understand how you got into it.”A careers adviser nudged her towards what was then Oldham Technical College, and its theatre studies A-level course. Jane Horrocks went there. Sarah Lancashire was a couple of years above her. “We did think we were like the kids from Fame. We’d do music, dancing, singing, and then we’d do acting.” She was there for two years, and when she left, did “bog standard jobs” for a while. Through a friend’s mum, she heard about a casting call for a film calledRita, Sue and Bob Too. She was 19 when she got the part of Rita. The now celebrated British film, about a married man who has an affair with two schoolgirls, was written by the lateAndrea Dunbar, who adapted it from her play, and was set and filmed on an estate in Bradford. It was 40 years ago, she points out. “And I can’t remember what I had for my breakfast! I just remember it being a bit of a blur. I was probably terrified every day. It was like another language. It was another world, completely, that I knew nothing about.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m happier on a set, working in a team’: Finneran in Protection.Photograph: Matt SquireFor a long time after that, she didn’t act at all, even though it seems, to the casual observer, as if she’s been working solidly ever since. “That’s a really great myth,” she laughs, good-naturedly. Over the years, she did the soaps (Coronation Street and Emmerdale), plenty of dramas and a handful of earlySally Wainwrightshows. “I’ve only been in work consistently, I would say, for the last 19 years. I’ve done the complete opposite to a lot of people. I hit 40, and started to pick up regular characters, as opposed to three lines as the woman who lives next door, or, you know, a scene as the sister-in-law.”In her 30s, she did turn up as a regular in Paul Abbott’sClocking Off, alongside her old friend Sarah Lancashire, but after that, she had another period of not working. “You sometimes look back and think, yeah, I made a decision not to work when the children were small.” She has two children, now in their late 20s. “But I don’t think I’d made a decision. I think there probably wasn’t a lot of work coming in, and that just fitted in quite brilliantly with the fact that I had two kids under the age of two.”Towards the end of the 00s, that all began to shift. In 2007, Finneran was cast as the mouthy matriarch Janice Garvey in the hit holiday sitcom Benidorm. A couple of years later, she appeared as the vicious housekeeper Sarah O’Brien, a villain of earlyDownton Abbey, where she remained for three series. “People were seeing me playing the wonderful and loud and fabulous Janice Garvey in a comedy, and then they were watching me playing, again, a fabulous, but completely nasty piece of work, Miss O’Brien. I don’t know if people were sitting at home going, oh, she can do that, and she can do a bit of that. That might be what it was.”Does she have any idea why her career took off after she turned 40? “I don’t, really. I’d never been the princess. A lot of the actresses I know were the pretty ones who, from leaving drama school, could play the girlfriend or the pretty sister. I was never in that casting bracket.” But with Benidorm and Downton, she found her feet. “I was just very lucky that those two jobs, that were so very different, were happening around the same time. It’s the luck of the Irish, isn’t it?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My mum’s family were Irish. My mother’s father’s family was Scottish. I am a bit desperate to do one of those … what are they called?” I assume she means the BBC genealogy series, Who Do You Think You Are?, but when I suggest that, she hoots. “No! I do love watching that, and I’m nosy enough to want to find out more about my family. But I mean those DNA tests,” she laughs.In recent years, she has appeared in two knockout shows. She remembers getting the script for the first three episodes ofHappy Valley. “I couldn’t breathe, reading those scripts. I sometimes lose the will to live, reading [scripts], because you just think, whatisthis? That’s me being really brutally honest. But with that, I remember ringing my agent the next day and going; ‘Oh my God, it is fucking brilliant.’” It meant she got to work with Lancashire again. “I love working with Sarah. We have a good time together. And I think that sisters relationship is just so true to life. One minute, they’re literally spitting at each other and the next they’re making each other a cup of tea and having a chat.”And then there was Alma’s Not Normal, in which she plays Lin, Alma’s mother and another long-term addict with mental health issues, who is repeatedly let down by social services and the state. “It’s like I’ve said about Happy Valley: you get a script like that, and you’d have to have some serious holiday booked, or you’d cancel a holiday for that. You just go, this is a work of genius.”She was scared of playing Lin at first, because the character is “very, very big”.“If you think about an unfiltered, unedited six-year-old, it’s sort of that energy. She does say exactly what she thinks about things, and it’s probably what everybody else is thinking. She just says it. She’s honest. And what I love about her is that she’s optimistic,still. She’s still got hope. And you think, how the fuck, when you’ve been treated the way she’s been treated? That’s massively appealing to me, in another human being.”I wonder if Finneran feels optimistic about the gloomy state of British television. Amid budgets cuts and slashed production rates, what does she think the future holds? “I don’t understand that, in terms of the production companies. From my point of view, what I see is really brilliant actor mates of mine who are not getting any work. I’ve never known the industry be as bleak, in terms of that. And I mean people who consistently have worked for the last 30 years, who’ve spent the last two or three years with nothing.” She hopes it will pick up soon. “We’ve been told for the past two years that it was down to the strikes in America, and that next year will be better. Well, we’re now two years on from that, and it doesn’t seem to be picking up. I don’t want to sound like a wanker saying that, because I have had work, so I know there’s stuff being made. But I just know there’s not the quantity of work that was being made maybe even five years ago.”I don’t think you sound like a wanker. “Well, that’s good,” she says. “But it’s tough out there. And for kids starting off now, fucking hell, I don’t know. So many regional theatres closing and all of that.” She pauses, vape still in hand. “We just have to be optimistic, don’t we? We have to be a bit more like Lin. Less editing of ourselves, and far more optimistic about the world.”Protection is on ITV1 and ITVX on16 March.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionHappy ValleyDownton AbbeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can I ask colleagues what they earn? The experts’ guide to modern money etiquetteFinancial experts answer pressing questions: from how to split the bill or who should pay on a first date, to how to get a discountLaura WhateleyFri 7 Mar 2025 10.00 ESTShareNavigating a cost of living crisis in a world where we can tap and spend without a thought is changing the way we manage our personal finances. Whether asking our boss for a pay rise or negotiating splitting the bill with friends, we have to confront our discomfort about discussing money. But the emotional stakes can feel precarious. So how do we navigate this new money etiquette?Who pays on a first date?You might not be ready to share your credit score on your dating app profile, but don’t be afraid to set out your financial boundaries.The cost of living has made people more understanding, according to Dr Caroline West, a sex and relationship expert for the dating app Bumble. “It’s totally normal to stress over the financial side of dating, like who pays for what, or whether to split things 50/50. These debates aren’t disappearing any time soon, but my advice is to always be upfront with yourself about your expectations and limits, and make sure to communicate them.”According to Bumble’s stats, more people are choosing alcohol-free “dry dating” and low-cost, low-pressure first meetings. Almost a third of 18- to 34-year-olds say they’d suggest something like a walk for a first date. Gen Z are also much more comfortable bringing up money that early, with only around one in 10 UK singles aged 18 to 34 saying they would never do it, compared with a quarter of 45- to 54-year-olds.Should we have a joint account?Running a household on one salary is less viable than it used to be. Romantic couples, married or cohabiting, need to find a way to blend incomes that feels fair. This goes for anyone working out how to divide the bills with platonic housemates or family members, too. A joint account can help. You can open one with one other person, and sometimes two or three, but it gives all account holders equal rights to withdraw money or run up debts, so you need trust. It also links your credit files, which means you should have an understanding of each other’s financial mistakes to protect your own ability to borrow money in the future.How do I split the bill with friends and family?View image in fullscreenIllustration: Nathalie Lees/The GuardianCan you afford to ignore who had a starteranda pudding? Or if you’re a teetotal vegetarian, are you paying for everyone else’s steak and malbec? And how do you divide up the dreaded group holiday supermarket shop?Apps such as Splitwise have increasingly become the answer, doing the painful work of asking friends for money on your behalf. You add a group expense, everyone pitches in with what they have laid out for, and you can send a request to “settle up”.Others agree on a budget before the event and put someone in charge of a kitty. PayPal has a new pooling feature, where you can create a tab on your account and share the link with friends and family via email or WhatsApp. They contribute directly using the link, and when the kitty reaches its target you can transfer it all to your PayPal balance and into your bank account. That way you become the nominated “banker”. This is good for group holidays.It’s one way to avoid what Alex Holder, author of the book Open Up: How to Talk About Money, has coined “the mate wait”: “the undetermined amount of time one spends waiting to be reimbursed by another person for shared expenses”; see also, the “mate weight” – the emotional burden of debating whether the £4 coffee is worth mentioning again.Can I ask for a discount?Haggling may feel horrifying to many British people, but it is now widespread. The areas in which you’re most likely to be successful are with subscription services and household bills, big-ticket items that are already on sale, insurance and breakdown cover, and also independent businesses and preloved shopping.Luckily for the more reserved among us, you can also haggle via online chat. “It’s becoming more acceptable to give it a go,” says Molly Mileham‑Chappell, consumer expert at website TopCashback. Secondhand selling app Vinted even has a “make an offer” button, and many items on eBay do too.If a lower price isn’t an option, ask if there’s anything else they can do. They may throw in perks like free shipping or upgradesIf it’s a subscription service, you might state you are unhappy with the renewal price and considering leaving. Or if it’s a one-off purchase, you might say you narrowly missed a promotion on the product.“If a lower price isn’t an option, ask nicely if there’s anything else they can do. They may throw in perks like free shipping, upgrades, or generate a discount code. Consider starting a chat at the end of the day, or closer to the end of a retailer’s sales period when they may be keen to hit targets and bend a little,” says Mileham-Chappell. “Always have a ‘get out’ phrase up your sleeve too, in case you need to think on it: “‘I’ve got to pick up the children from school now, can I come back to you later?’”Should I ask colleagues what they earn?Many employers discourage their employees from discussing salaries, but they have no legal right to do so, and this is being frowned upon as a way of cementing inequality in the workplace, so go ahead, says Daniel Zhao, lead economist at the workplace community Glassdoor. Its salary negotiations section has insights into how others are managing these conversations in their own offices.“Pay transparency is an important tool for workers to ensure they are being paid what they deserve, and has the potential to mitigate pay inequities by revealing gaps that might otherwise have hidden in the shadows,” says Zhao.He does, however, warn people to try not to take discussions about pay at work too personally. “A colleague may be paid more because they have responsibilities or experience you aren’t aware of. The most common mistake when asking for a raise is simply saying that your colleague makes more than you as your argument. Pay transparency is good to help you benchmark what you can ask for, but it alone cannot make the argument.”So how do I ask for a pay rise?Many of coach Bryony Williams’ clients come to her specifically wanting to work on asking for a pay rise. The founder of consultancy The Glass Female says three themes tend to reveal themselves. “Clients think someone else is getting more and feel undervalued where they are; they’re not happy at work and they see financial compensation as the plaster to make them happy again; or they’re under financial strain and the desire for a raise comes from external pressure.”She says that she encourages clients to do their homework on how much is reasonable to ask for – websites such as Glassdoor and Payscale can help.Consider your experience and location – and, crucially, be honest with yourself. What is driving your desire for more money? Is it your personal financial circumstances, a goal, a debt you wish to pay off, or is it simply appropriate for your level, experience and leadership? There’s a difference, and the latter needs to be the case for your request to be successful.“If you can reframe money as maintenance and remove the emotion, it is easier to be confident. We often feel we want more money because we desire validation or recognition for our efforts. There are opportunities to satisfy those needs with our own positive affirmation, a rewarding conversation with a manager or even great feedback.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Should you still tip everyone that prompts you? Adrian Harris, founder of thankU Cashless Tipping, an app that lets you leave a tip with your phone, believes there’s a difference between adding 50p on to the cost of a flat white that you’ve queued for and collected from the counter, and giving cash to the colourist in a salon who spends three hours doing your highlights. In the hairdressing world, £10, £15 or £20 is, he says, “very normal”.Caroline Larissey, chief executive at the National Hair and Beauty Federation, says typical tips range from 5% to 20% of the cost. “Some clients tip assistants who wash their hair, others tip their stylist, and some tip both. Your hairdresser understands that tipping is optional and won’t be offended if you don’t.”If there is a particular person you wish to tip, ask them how they would like to receive it (either in cash or via an app, for example).UnderUK legislation introduced in 2024, 100% of money left, including service charges on bills, must go to the staff, but each venue can decide how it should be distributed.“A cash tip will allow them to keep it themselves,” says Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality. “Leaving a tip on the bill or behind on the table will benefit the whole team, from front-of-house to chefs and kitchen porters working hard in the kitchen.”If you can’t afford to tip, Larissey suggests you leave a positive review online instead.Should I lend money to friends or family members?A recent study published in the Journal for Consumer Psychology found that people who lend money to friends frequently feel they deserveoversight on the cash and how the borrower spends it. Alarmingly, this judgment persists even after the loan has been repaid. Work hard to avoid this, says Keith Barber, director of business development at the Family Building Society, particularly if you are, as is now so common, helping adult children on to the property ladder or with expenses such as childcare or fertility treatment.“You’ve got to be very clear about the terms on which the money comes over. But I think that’s at the end of the conversation, rather than the beginning. You need to start with: what are your children’s goals? What are their ambitions? What do they want to do?”The idea is to really listen to why they need the money, rather than impose on them what you think the money should be for, and therefore how much they need.If you’re willing to help someone, you’ve got to be willing to let go of that money, assuming you can afford to give it rather than loan it“If you’re willing to help, you’ve got to also be willing to let go of that money, assuming you can afford to give it rather than loan it.” And if you are helping with a property deposit so your children can get a mortgage, most banks will want to see in writing that the money is a gift with no strings attached.Lending and borrowing between friends and siblings is becoming more common, too. Barber has seen cases where one sibling is better placed financially and wanting to help another buy a property. In this situation, the same rules of not expecting oversight should apply.Drawing up a written loan agreement is a helpful way to ensure there isn’t any miscommunication. State how much is being loaned, for how long, what it is for, whether any interest is due and any other terms you feel are important to note, such as what happens if your loved one can’t pay on time. If it’s a small amount, you could do this informally between you. But you may want to seek legal advice if it’s tens of thousands of pounds.Tara Edwards, a private client executive for Wellers Law Group, says agreements in writing are also important when it comes to how you want to leave an inheritance. This helps avoid any misunderstandings that could have legal implications. For example, not understanding someone’s motivation could result in a claim on your estate, as well as heartache.Howdo I broach the potentiallysensitive topic of how muchmy partner spends or saves?Joanna Harrison, couples therapist and author ofFive Arguments All Couples (Need To) Have and Why the Washing-Up Matters,says discussing money anxieties could throw up a lot of shame. “One person might want to protect their partner by not bringing it up. How do you make it not feel intrusive? How do you not make someone feel defensive?“I think a helpful way is not ‘Can you give me a form with all your money details,’ but to be really curious with each other about what your attitudes to money are.” For example, what did your partner or friend grow up with? What were their experiences of money as a child? This can tease out whether someone may be afraid of getting into debt, or why they might feel it is important to have their own private bank account.She suggests you have a conversation about having the conversation. “‘How would you feel about us being transparent with our finances?’ is a very different way of starting off a conversation than saying, ‘I want you to be transparent.’”Explore more on these topicsMoneyRelationshipsDatingWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Aged five, the son of two musicians – and by all accounts already showing talent as a pianist – he was famously presented with his first set of vibraphone mallets backstage at a gig by Lionel Hampton. If you wanted to take a romantic view, you could look on that as an act of benediction: the man who had more or less singlehandedly popularised an instrument that had previously been viewed as a novelty passing on the mantle along with his mallets. Hampton had broken racial barriers in the process: at a time when jazz bands were almost entirely segregated, Hampton and pianist Teddy Wilson’s work with Benny Goodman’s quartet was subtly acclaimed by one critic as “the most beautiful example of men working together to be seen in public today”.For a time, it looked as if Ayers was following in Hampton’s footsteps. By the time of his debut album, 1963’s West Coast Vibes, Ayers was clearly carving out a space for himself in the jazz world. Running through versions of Charlie Parker’sDonna Leeor Thelonious Monk’sWell You Needn’t, he was already his own man: a little hotter in his approach to the vibraphone than Milt Jackson, less inclined towards the avant than his friend Bobby Hutcherson.But, as it turned out, playing post-bop standards wasn’t Ayers’ destiny. You could already sense him looking beyond jazz by the late 60s. He started confidently essaying contemporary pop, and seemed to have a particular thing for Laura Nyro’s album Eli and the 13th Confession: her Stoned Soul Picnic provided thetitle trackof his 1968 album;Emmieturned up on 1969’s Daddy Bug, in among bossa nova tunes, and a surprisingly funereal, noir-ish take on Bacharach and David’sThis Guy’s in Love With You.Ayers was just getting started: you could divine a lot from him naming first his 1970 album Ubiquity, then his new band. On their 1972 debut He’s Coming, their music appeared to go everywhere: constantly switching from jazz to soft soul to hard funk to Gil Scott-Heron-ish proto rap, displaying both extraordinarily catholic taste in covers – the Hollies’He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother, I Don’t Know How to Love Him from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s Jesus Christ Superstar – and Ayers’ increasing talent as a songwriter, most notably on the superb, dramatically orchestratedWe Live in Brooklyn, Baby.It was jazz-funk before anyone came up with the phrase – although infinitely tougher and less smooth than the music said phrase later came to encapsulate. What the kind of jazz purist who felt Miles Davis’s Bitches Brew represented a craven capitulation to commerciality made of it can well be imagined, but that really didn’t matter. For the rest of the 70s, Ayers produced one fantastic album after another – Red, Black and Green, Vibrations, his incredible soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film Coffy – gradually honing and homogenising his style until it reached a point of perfection on 1976’sEverybody Loves the Sunshine.If the utterly blissful title track understandably became Ayers’ theme song, it’s ultimately just one moment among many:Hey Uh-What You Say Come On, The Third Eye,Keep on Walking. Its sound was effectively reprised on Come Into Knowledge, the solitary album by RAMP, a sophisticated Cincinnati funk band whose name – an acronym for Roy Ayers Music Productions – told you everything about Ayers’ level of involvement: ignored on release in 1977, its blend of silky, wide-eyed soul and hard-edged funk took on a new lease of life after A Tribe Called Quest sampled one track,Daylight, on their 1990 hitBonita Applebum, adding their names to a faintly mind-boggling list of artists and producers who have plundered Ayers’ back catalogue for beats: Dr Dre, Mary J Blige, J Cole, Tyler, the Creator, J Dilla, Kendrick Lamar, Public Enemy, Erykah Badu, Madlib and Tupac among them. Ayers’ samples are the link between Deee-Lite’sGroove Is in the Heartand NWA’sFuck tha Police; they’re also probably the only thing that MF Doom had in common with the Backstreet Boys.Ayers’ beats are the only thing that MF Doom had in common with the Backstreet BoysAyers was a great bandleader in time-honoured jazz style, capable of attracting incredible musicians (David Bowie pinched both drummer Dennis Davis and guitarist Carlos Alomar from Ayers; after Davis’s departure, Bernard “Pretty” Purdie took over on drums), and spotting talent in its nascent state. He alighted on songwriter Edwin Birdsong when he was a recently demobbed soldier struggling to make his way in New York’s jazz scene; he gave vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater a starring role on the Coffy soundtrack at the start of her career. He was also able to move nimbly with changing times: the sound of disco lurked in the background of Everybody Loves the Sunshine, but on the following year’s Lifeline, he and Birdsong plunged wholeheartedly into the genre, producing one of its indelible classics, the sparklingRunning Away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

But if said detractors thought the direction he was heading in was now obvious, they were in for a shock. Hot on the heels of 1980’s slick Love Fantasy came Music of Many Colours, a collaboration with Fela Kuti consisting of two raw and implausibly thrilling side-long tracks recorded at the end of a joint tour in Africa that perfectly melded Kuti’s Afrobeat and Ayers’ jazz-funk. Its influence continued to course through Ayers’ subsequent albums Africa: Center of the World and 1983’s Lots of Love. He was concurrently producing slinky post-disco for Eighties Ladies and their singer Sylvia Striplin – the latter’s debut solo album Give Me Your Love is a particular delight that, like the RAMP album before it, belatedly became a rare-groove classic. He might have stopped using the Ubiquity name, but his sound was still everywhere.Ayers kept releasing new albums, but never quite regained the commercial form he had found at Ubiquity’s peak, and his output began to slow as the 80s drew to a close. But by then, it scarcely seemed to matter: the attentions of crate-digging producers and DJs alike meant that Ayers’ name was rightly revered by a new generation of artists. His influence hung very heavy indeed over both acid jazz and neo-soul – he worked with Badu and Alicia Keys – and, whatever twists and turns hip-hop took, Ayers’ music always seemed to have a role within it: he turned up alongside Branford Marsalis and Donald Byrd on Guru’s acclaimed solo album Jazzmatazz in 1993, then again 22 years later, in an entirely different rap era, on Tyler, the Creator’s Cherry Bomb, dubbing the latter “a lovely young man”. He toured relentlessly, claiming he wanted to be on stage “until I die”, a feat he very nearly achieved.“Everybody is important,” he reasoned, “so it is important I reach as many people as possible with my voice.” That seems the perfect explanation not just for his constant gigging, but Roy Ayers’ whole, boundary-free musical approach.Explore more on these topicsMusicHip-hopJazzDiscoDance musiccommentShareReuse this content"

These are momentous times for the Norwegian football club in the agricultural south-western region of Jæren. Last season they were promoted back to the Eliteserien, the top division, for the first time in 22 years in front of a capacity crowd of 5,000 and excitement is building before the start of the season at the end of March. Fans hope they can return to heights not seen since they won the cup in Oslo in 1987 – which would have been considered the club’s crowning achievement were it not for the rise ofErling Haaland.In the brittle, banter-fuelled world of English football, it might feel as if Haaland’s star is waning this season. It is easy to forget he is second only to Mohamed Salah in the Premier League Golden Boot after winning it in the previous two seasons. At the age of 24 he is the all-time Norwegian national team top scorer (38 in 39 matches), and a Champions League, Premier League and Austrian league winner. The school playground of my six-year-old son, Ernest, is no longer consumed by the great Messi-Ronaldo debate but instead is alive to the shouts of “HAAAAARRR-LAND”.View image in fullscreenErnest and Greta Hatton-Burrows on the top floor of Bryne’s only skyscraper, where they can view the artist Pøbel’s mural of Erling Haaland.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIt’s a thrill, then, to take Ernest and the rest of my family to Norway’s latest attraction:the Haaland safari. Bryne FK have even arranged for us to stay in the “Haaland suite” of the local Hotell Jæren, where a mural on the wall of the living space depicts Erling at different stages of his career, starting as the milk-haired boy playing for Bryne FK. My wife, Hayley, and I walk with our children from the hotel through cold blasts of North Sea air to meet the club’s marketing manager, Bjørn Hagerup Røken, and his brother Frode Hagerup, who is on the board and works in local tourism – at the windswept Bryne stadium.With them are some pension‑age fans, including Sandve, who volunteer to take tourists around on the Haaland safari among other tasks from cleaning the stadium to stocking the shop. “We know the club,” says another, Endre Refsnes. “And we love the club.”This summer, tourists from the British cruise ship Iona that docks in Stavanger have a choice: visit the natural wonder of this area of Norway, Preikestolen (the pulpit rock), or be led around a frayed football ground and the other Haaland safari stopping points for which participants are charged 750 Norwegian kroner (£54). The tour, available in English and Norwegian, started as a bit of fun a couple of years ago but it is becoming part of a serious stab at putting Bryne FK and by extension the town itself on the map. Frode says Manacor, Mallorca, where Rafael Nadal is from, and Madeira, the home of Cristiano Ronaldo, are models.View image in fullscreenErnest Hatton-Burrows (six) and Greta Hatton-Burrows (eight) play, while Frode Hagerup, daily manager at Opplev Jæren, shows Tim Burrows another mural.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianWe start at Jærhallen, an indoor training facility rebuilt a few years ago and opened by a surprise visit from Haaland (local kids training at the time didn’t believe it was him). It was initially built to keep players dry because this area of Norway is milder but also wetter. It is open every day for anyone to come and hone their skills – and it is free. Inside, a recently signed young player from Nigeria is pinging balls across the hall.Haaland is the son of the tough-tackling former Nottingham Forest, Leeds andManchester Citymidfielder Alf-Inge Haaland, and lived in England until the family returned to their homestead of Bryne in 2003. He was fast-tracked to play for Bryne at 15, famed for a turn of pace, intelligent runs and lethal finishing after thriving under the tutelage of the youth coach Alf Ingve Berntsen, whose inclusive, person-focused approach led to outstanding results. Endre shows us thedrylaveggen, rebuilt in tribute to the wooden wall where young Erling would try to hit the exact same point over and over again. The word“dryla” is common only in Norway’s south-west. “It typically refers to hitting or kicking something with tremendous force,” writes Lars Sivertsen, in his biography of Haaland. “The most accurate and phonetically pleasing English translation is probably ‘to wallop’ something …”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Marketing manager Bjørn Hagerup, Røken Frode Hagerup, daily manager at Opplev Jæren (regional marketing), and volunteer Kjell Hammervold at Bryne Stadium.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianBefore we leave the Jærhallen, Endre points out the enormous pictures of Haaland and Tuva Hansen, who plays for Bayern Munich’s women’s team, alongside a caption in Norwegian: “We will sow the joy of football, nurture talent, and harvest miracles.” This might make Haaland sound like a freakishly big prize-winning vegetable. But it isn’t just sloganeering. The club’s philosophy ties in with the agricultural character of the Jæren region. Work to turning the rock-strewn hillsides into arable land using only spades, before heavy machinery, was backbreaking, and contributed to the mythos of Jæren as a place where hard work was a prerequisite.View image in fullscreenThe ‘VIP’ tractor section at Bryne Stadium.Photograph: Svenn-Olav Sele, Bryne FKBryne FK have a section of the stadium where farmers can drive their tractors in to watch the game. When the club played Viking FK in the 2001 cup final in Oslo, the Norwegian press reported how a convoy of tractors had travelled laden with cucumbers, cabbage and broccoli to deliver to people they met along the way, before parading through the capital, turning it a sea of red and white. Yet the fans’ plan to use sheep bells to create a menacing din during the game didn’t work, and Bryne lost 3-0.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His posts about drinkinghis “magic potion”, milk fresh from the farm, have given local dairies a boost. Growing up, Haaland drove tractors on the farm of his uncle Gabriel Hoyland, a former star player for Bryne who these days is a potato farmer with a passion for Burnley FC. A picture of Haalandon his uncle’s blue tractora few seasons back has become so iconic in these parts that I am advised to visit the same style of tractor – a Super Dexta made by Fordsons in the 1960s – in a dedicated space at the fascinating Vitengarden museum. When I visit the next day, there are some old boys looking at the older models as if ogling classic sports cars.We arrive at the club shop. A cluster of Manchester City shirts hang among the red and white merch – the locals buy City shirts, but not so much the tourists, who want an authentic home shirt. Like all Norwegian clubs, Bryne are owned by the members, but commerce is still vital to their existence and they have a natural entrepreneurial streak to woo business: in the 1980s they were the first Norwegian club to create a VIP area. Now Bryne are back in the top division, investment is needed, but Bjørn says they still have to be “smart in the transfer market”. The rise of Haaland internationally has coincided with a revival of fortunes for Bryne FK. When Haaland was sold to City, the club were compensated to the tune of 10m NOK (£710,900). Some hope Real Madrid will one day swoop for him, meaning another payday for the club, particularly now he has signed a nine-year contract.View image in fullscreenMarketing manager Bjørn Hagerup and Røken Frode Hagerup, daily manager at Opplev Jæren, in the Bryne FK shop.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianWe head out of the club shop and take a look at the playing surface. “We are only one of few teams in Norway in the top level that are playing on natural grass,” says Sandve. The groundsman is – what else? – a farmer, “so he knows how to do it”, says Endre. The grass will soon be put to the test, when Bryne kick off the new season against last year’s champions, Bodø/Glimt, on 30 March.After playing Where’s Erling? while looking at old youth-team squad photos in the clubhouse, we head into town, passing the high school Haaland went to en route to Forum Jæren, the tallest building in Bryne. From the top you can see the sea, the mountains, the whole town. We look down at the mural of Haaland on the side of a former dairy by the Bryne-born street artist Pøbel, who used a fire extinguisher filled with yellow paint to create it. It is the first thing visitors on the train see as they arrive. We pass a more modest piece, a tribute to Alf-Inge Haaland, designed by Frode’s 12-year-old son, before we head to the last attraction – a mural depicting a cartoon Erling affecting his trademark meditation celebration, positioned next to Wen Hua House, his favourite Chinese restaurant, where you can buy a Haaland special (sweet and sour chicken and rice).View image in fullscreenErnest Hatton-Burrows enjoys himself at the Bryne FK stadium.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIt is hard to tally the small, parochial details of Haaland’s hometown with his gargantuan stature around the world. I notice for the rest of the trip that every shop sells Haaland-branded ice lollies, and talk to Ståle Økland, a former politician and writer whose father, Arne Larsen Økland, played as a star striker for Bryne in the 1970s and 80s. “I remember I was in Japan last year,” he says. “We were up in the mountains hiking. When we met some of the locals, they asked us where we came from, and we said Norway.

Of course, one hesitates to make the comparison, not least because Donald Trump would like it. And because the Godfather is an archetype of strength and macho glamour whileTrump is weak, constantly handing gifts to America’s enemies and getting nothing in return. But when the world is changing so fast – when a nation that has been a friend for more than a century turns into a foe in a matter of weeks – it helps to have a guide. My colleague Luke Harding clarified the nature of Vladimir Putin’s Russia when he branded it theMafia State. Now we need to attach the same label to the US under Putin’s most devoted admirer.Consider the way Trump’s White House conducts itself, issuing threats and menaces that sound better in the original Sicilian. This weekthe president saidthat a deal ending Russia’s war on Ukraine “could be made very fast” but “if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long”. You didn’t need a translator to know that the somebody he had in mind was Volodymyr Zelenskyy.On Thursday,Trump was confidentthat the Ukrainians would soon do his bidding “because I don’t think they have a choice”. Almost as if he had made them an offer they couldn’t refuse. Which of course he had. Byending the supply of military aidand the sharing of US intelligence, as he did this week, he had effectively put a Russian revolver to Ukraine’s temple,its imprint scarcely reduced by Trump’s declaration today that he is “strongly considering” banking sanctions and tariffs against Moscow, a move that looked a lot like a man pretending to be equally tough on the two sides, but which should fool nobody.He expects Zelenskyy to sign away a huge chunk of Ukraine’s minerals, the way Corleone’s rivals surrendered their livelihoods to save their lives.This is how the US now operates in the world. Dispensing with the formalities during his annual address to Congress on Tuesday, Trumprepeated his threat to grab Greenland: “One way or the other, we’re going to get it.” That recalled his earlier warning to Copenhagen to give him what he wantsor face the consequences: “maybe things have to happen with respect to Denmark having to do with tariffs”. Nice place you got there; would be a shame if something happened to it.It’s the same shakedown he’s performing on the US’s northern neighbour. Canada’s outgoing prime minister Justin Trudeauspelled it out this week, accusing Trump of trying to engineer “a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us”, adding that: “We will never be the 51st state.” It’s a technique familiar in the darker corners of the New Jersey construction industry: a series of unfortunate fires that only stops when a recalcitrant competitor submits.Both the substance and the style are pure mafia. Note the obsession with respect, demonstrated in last week’s Oval Office confrontation with Zelenskyy. Between them, JD Vance and Trumpaccused the Ukrainian leader three timesof showing disrespect,sounding less like world leaders thantouchy Tommy DeVito, the Joe Pesci character in Goodfellas.Note too the humiliation of subordinates. In his address to Congress, the president introduced secretary of state Marco Rubio as the man charged with taking back the Panama canal. “Good luck, Marco,”said Trump, with a chuckle. “Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong.” Cue anxious laughter from the rest of the underlings, briefly relieved that it wasn’t them.It’s hard for aides and opponents alike to keep up because power is exercised arbitrarily and inconsistently. Tariffs are imposed, then suspended. Indeed, one reason why import taxes so appeal to Trump is that they can be enforced instantly and by presidential edict. That extends to the exemptions Trump can offer to favoured US industries. As MSNBC’sChris Hayes observed: “This is very obviously going to be a protection racket, where Trump can at the stroke of a pen destroy or save your business depending on how compliant you are.”Because, naturally, Trumpism does not confine the Cosa Nostra tactics to foreign affairs. This weekReuters reportedthat several federal judges in the Washington DC area had received pizzas sent anonymously to their homes, a gesture that police interpreted as “a form of intimidation meant to convey that a target’s address is known”. Already rattled by a fusillade of posts from Elon Musk denouncing as “corrupt” and “evil” those judges who have stood in the way of his ongoing demolition of large swathes of the federal government, the judiciary is now fearful for its safety. “I’ve never seen judges as uneasy as they are now,” said John Jones, who retired from the bench in 2021.Whether neutering the judges – “Thank you again, I won’t forget,”Trump told John Roberts, chief justice of the supreme court, as he slapped him on the back this week – or movingto control the press, it’s all straight out of the Corleone playbook. The effect has been remarkably swift, with a strange silence falling on America’s public square.One Democratic congressman saysRepublican colleagues have told him they won’t criticise Trump because they worry for their physical safety and that of their families.But it’s not just politicians. “University presidents fearing that millions of dollars in federal funding could disappear are holding their fire. Chief executives alarmed by tariffs that could hurt their businesses are on mute,”according to the New York Times, which again cited the growing anxiety among would-be critics that online attacks from Musk and Trump could lead to violent assaults on themselves or their loved ones.All this protects Trump, encouraging him to ape the corruption and callousness of a mafia don. See how blatantly he now charges individuals to dine with him at Mar-a-Lago:$5m for a one-on-one, $1m to be part of a group. In case you didn’t get the message, Trump has announced that the US willno longer enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibited Americans from bribing foreign officials, while his attorney general has dissolved all of the kleptocracy-related task forces at the Department of Justice. As for callousness, note Musk’s glee at feeding the US agency for international development“into the wood chipper”,therebyensuring death comesto the sick and the starving who relied on US medicine and food.At least the Corleones were guided by their own supposed code of honour. They believed an act of service had to be remembered and, in time, reciprocated. But Trump has gone to court rather than pay suppliersfor work already donefor the US government and has no memory of those to whomthe US owes a much greater debt. How else could his vice-president so glibly forget the blood spilled by America’s allies, including the UK, when hedismissed the offerof “20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years”?These are despicable people, lacking even the morality of the hoodlum – and now they run the country we have regarded as our closest friend since the Edwardian age. Given all that, of course British politics should be contemplating a radical new direction, whether that means an economy rewired for rearmament or a rapprochement with the European Union, given that the world of the Brexit vote of 2016 has vanished and to stand apart from our nearest neighbours is now not only stupid but dangerous. When the planet’s most powerful country has become a mafia state, you do whatever it takes.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistOn 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as theydiscuss Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall London, and live streamed globally.

Seems a perfect fitFri 7 Mar 2025 07.46 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 10.22 ESTShareYou may well be aware thatBackpfeifengesichtis the German word for a face that is worthy of being slapped. Even so, how has this not been internationalised? Or at the very least Americanised, where its dictionary definition would presumably be adorned by a picture of the face of US vice-president JD Vance – already faultlessly playing the role of worst American at your hotel. You can immediately picture him at breakfast, can’t you? Every single other guest on the terrace with their shoulders up round their ears, just thinking: “Where is he now? How unbearable is he being NOW?” Next, imagine breakfast lasting four years.I say theBackpfeifengesichtdefinition would be accompanied by JD Vance’s face … but then again, what is the face of JD Vance? The internetis awashwith people suffering an acute case of not being able to remember it any more, having seen so many hideous comic distortions of Vance that those meme versions are not simply the only results on the first page of your own mental Google search, but stretch deep beyond the second and into the third. Somewhere on page four, where you might as well publish the nuclear codes or pictures of Taylor Swift giving cocaine to babies, is an unmodified snap of what JD Vance actually looks like. Or at leastwhat he looks like with eyeliner.Before you get there – and you don’t, really – your synaptic filing systems throw up every variety of Photoshopped Vancefake: swollen manboy, face wearing a Minion suit, a bearded egg … I’m hoping that sooner or later, an American news outlet will accidentally use a modified photo, because even the picture editor has forgotten what the vice-president looks like, and then we can have one of those massively self-regarding legacy media-blow-ups, where the entire staff has to resign after a remorseless investigation by the executive editor reveals Vance isn’t actually a big purple grape. “This is a stain on our newspaper’s history. A big purple stain.”Vance is more meme than man, now, and it is, of course, something of a consolation that he is so extremely online that he can’t help but have noticed this. The VP is like a one-man government troll-feeding programme – please don’t cut him, Elon! – which is probably why people have become so heroically committed to taking the piss. The probability of the vice-president seeing you insulting him is basically one.Just as previous holders of his office like Teddy Roosevelt and Richard Nixon once did, Vance spent a notable amount of this week both denying he suggested Britain and France were random countries that hadn’t fought a war in 40 years, and replying to random X posters called things like “Jeff Computers” to counter the suggestion that he wasn’t loved and feted onhis recent skiing holiday.View image in fullscreenProtest in Waitsfield, Vermont, during JD Vance’s skiing holiday, 1 March 2025.Photograph: Jeff Knight/APOver on this side of the Atlantic, it must be said that the latter vignette in particular serves as a helpful reminder of the cultural differences between our great nations – and indeed between our great anti-elitists. British politicians would rather admit they’d sexually harassed an intern than gone skiing. (You can, of course, do both – and many do.) If a British cabinet minister were to sally forth on to social media like Vance did, and honk that actually, he had agreattime on the ski slopes, it would probably be the end of him. Let’s face it, our rightwing politicians still make time twice a week to do a drive-by on “latte drinkers”, seemingly unaware that the only thing left in most high streets, and quite a lot of people’s lives, is a hot milky drink at a Costa. Yet in our country, would-be populists treat having the temerity to order a coffee like it’s Marie Antoinette skiing past a workhouse – which is a useful illustration of why we don’t have growth, and why our many political failures speak to near-empty rooms at conservative conferences in the US.Trump dreams of a Maga empire – but he’s more likely to leave us a nuclear hellscape | Alexander HurstRead moreAnyway: Vance. On or off skis – and I would prefer him to sod offski – the vice-president can be judged successful in his deliberately adopted mission to become mesmerisingly awful. On British army talkboards this week, I spent some very enjoyable time watching veterans of the US’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan offer their thoughts on JD, who I believe was some kind of military journalist for about 15 minutes. Though that wasn’t quite how they put it, naturally. Real soldiers can be hilariously creative with their insults, while Vance is drawn towards the artless, perhaps most neatly embodied in his decision to whine at Volodymyr Zelenskyy: “Did you even say thank you?”Then again, while I’m sure that the memes will keep us warm in the event of an unscheduled nuclear winter, it must be said that other forms of digital manipulation are passing notably without the comment they used to, even until very recently. So perhaps the moral slippage has not been entirely one-sided.I noticed this week that people who only a couple of years ago were hand-wringing about the horror AI deepfakes could wreak upon democracy were now cheerfully sharing synthetic scenes of Zelenskyy slapping Donald Trump in the Oval Office, or Trump crying like a baby, or some other eerie piece of fakery that felt qualitatively different from a still of a lollipop-wielding kiddie Vance. I think people used to think this stuff was bad and corrosive and potentially politically dangerous? Maybe they still do – or maybe only when the other side do it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But I think Labour should keep its vow and scrap this chamberFri 7 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 11.53 ESTShareWhen I took my seat in theHouse of Lordsalmost a year ago, I pledged to campaign for the abolition of my job. Our second chamber has become a gated community of more than 800 members, making it the second largest legislative chamber in the world, topped only by China’s National People’s Congress. The House of Lords casts a shadow over parliament, and its unelected peers have a huge influence on the laws that get passed.Last March, I joined the second chamber representingPlaid Cymru. Aged 28, I was the youngest member of the chamber, and the youngest ever life peer. Plaid Cymru doesn’t believe that an unelected chamber should form part of our democracy, but we do believe that we should have a seat at the table wherever decisions affecting Wales are being made. Since taking my seat in the Lords, I have been clear about my desire to change the system from within, while standing up for Welsh people and for young people across Britain.As much as I have enjoyed working with members across the political spectrum, over the past year I have gained a rare insight into how Westminster functions behind the scenes and, at times, how it fails to function altogether. One only need look at the recentLords debate investigationin this newspaper to see the conflicts of interest that persist within the second chamber, where some peers have used their positions to advance commercial interests.With a large new intake of MPs, there is increasing momentum for change from within Westminster. The recent election resulted in the highest ever number of parliamentary newbies in the House of Commons –335 new MPs, including 20 under the age of 30, the highest number of MPs from ethnic minority backgrounds, and the lowest proportion of MPs who attended fee-paying secondary schools. Many have claimed this is the most diverse House of Commons in history.Yet while Keir Starmervowed to abolish the Lordsbefore he was elected and replace it with a democratically elected second chamber, his plans have since been scaled back to merely scrapping the 92 all-male hereditary peers. The resulting bill is a minimal reform. It falls far short of what was outlined in the Labour party’s manifesto, and does nothing to stem the jobs-for-life handed out by prime ministers to their party donors and friends.The time is up for these outdated traditions and procedures. That’s why I have tabled several amendments to the hereditary peers bill, with the aim of strengthening it, pushing for the delivery of Labour’s manifesto commitments, and ultimately making the Lords into an elected chamber. People should be involved in the political decisions that affect their day-to-day lives, either directly, via citizens’ assemblies, or by electing representatives they trust to advocate on their behalf. Those decisions should not be taken and shaped by unelected peers, some of whom are there for no other reason than birth.Several new MPs have already expressed frustration with outdated procedures on their side of the Houses of Parliament – from the requirement to“bob” repeatedlyto catch the speaker’s attention, to the insistence that MPs must vote in person in London rather than from their constituency offices. After the general election, several new MPs founded a modernisation committee in the House of Commons to update parliament’s working practices. Something similar should be set up for the Lords, where the need for modernisation is even more urgent.The Guardian view on the House of Lords: ministers risk a hollow reform with a partisan approach | EditorialRead moreIn redesigning the UK’s second chamber, we don’t need to reinvent the wheel. We can simply adopt the best practices of our democratic friends. Most second chambers across the world are elected, either directly by the people or through an electoral college. Ultimately, Britain needs a democratic second chamber that ensures the people who make and shape our laws are accountable to the people who live under them.The UK is highly unusual and archaic in maintaining a system of parliamentary appointments based on nobility, patronage and the church. The second chamber remains an anomaly and a mystery to most people. The government has a unique opportunity to change and transform this. I understand why some want to preserve Westminster’s status quo – power protects power, and those in power rarely seek to relinquish it. But the right to govern shouldn’t be bestowed by birth, title or political favour. It must be earned at the ballot box.Carmen Smith, Baroness Smith of Llanfaes, has been a member of the House of Lords for Plaid Cymru since March 2024Explore more on these topicsLords reformOpinionHouse of LordsPlaid CymruLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The upside is they are doing something about itFri 7 Mar 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 10.45 ESTShareIt’s the love-hate relationship that defined a generation. We think we know all about teenagers and the phones to which they’re so umbilically tied: sleeping with them under the pillow, panicking at the prospect of ever being denied wifi, so glued to the screen that they’re oblivious to the world unfolding around them. Yet the first generation to have never really known a life without social media – the drug that primarily keeps them coming back to their phones for more – is now grown up enough to reflect on what it may have done to them, and the answers are almost enough to break your heart.Two-thirds of 16- to 24-year-olds think social media does more harm than good and three-quarters want tougher regulation to protect younger people from it, according to polling for theNew Britain Project, a thinktank founded by a former teacher, Anna McShane. Half think they spent too much time on it when they were younger, with regret highest among those who started using social media youngest. And most tellingly of all, four in five say they’d keep their own children away from it for as long as they could if they became parents. This isn’t how anyone talks about something they love, but how you look back on a relationship that was in retrospect making you miserable.Though the focus groups she conducted confirmed that parents were desperate for help weaning children off screens, what’s refreshing about McShane’s research is that it suggests the generations aren’t as locked in combat as they sometimes feel; that increasingly, we’re all on the same side. Gen Z, it turns out, don’t need more lectures from their (often equally addicted) elders about getting off that bloody phone. If anything, they may have something to teach us.This Friday, parliament will vote on the Labour MP (and former teacher) Josh MacAlister’s private member’s bill on safer phone use, expected to be backed by the government but only after beingnotably watered down. Though MacAlister originally favoured raising the legal limit for accessing social media from 13 to 16, the bill now only commits ministers to reporting back in a year’s time on the case for doing so, plus conducting further research and publishing fresh guidance on children’s screen time. With X’s CEO, Elon Musk, virtually embedded in the White House, some will suspect ministers of ducking a confrontation with American tech giants. But there are other reasons not to rush in, at least until the complex new Online Safety Act due to come into force this spring has settled down, and ministers have had a chance to learn from similar bans beingintroduced in AustraliaandNorway.Rather cheeringly, however, it seems in the meantime gen Z are taking things into their own hands. A generation of kids who grew up online, spent lockdown in their bedrooms, and all too often started their first jobs dialling remotely into Zoom meetings, now seems to be actively trying to teach itself to socialise the analogue way.Nightclubs and gig venuesfrom Manchester to Ibiza to Berlin have started asking punters to put stickers over their phone cameras, encouraging them not to film on the dancefloor but just tolose themselves in the momentlike their parents got to do. Meanwhile an explosion of gen Z running clubs, reading groups, in-person singles parties for people exhausted by dating apps, and “digital detox” events where phones are left outside the door, reflect a palpable and touching new hunger for old-fashioned face-to-face connection.The 25-year-old writer Adele Zeynep Walton foundedLogging Off Club, which organises real life social meet-ups for people trying to wean themselves off their phones, after a chance conversation during a 25th birthday weekend away with friends. All of them, it turned out, were worried about their screen time and were secretly trying to cut it down, but felt self-conscious talking about it. At Logging Off Club events, she says cheerfully, “we take people’s phones off them at the door and put them in a bucket”. It’s like ripping away a comfort blanket at first, but it makes people talk to each other rather than hiding behind a screen. At one event she organised jointly with City Daze, another social club that organises phone-free walks round London, attendees were even given cue cards to help them start conversations.What seems to be building up among younger women in particular isn’t just a backlash against the kind of toxic content, bullying or political disinformation rampant in their online lives, but a feeling that spending so much time on their phones has deprived them of something human and important. Walton is starting to think about where she might want to settle down in the next few years, only to realise that she feels curiously unrooted from any real-life community: though she’s been talking for years online to people she has never met, she doesn’t even know her physical neighbours’ names. Her generation has, she says, “been sold that lie of connection” by the big platforms but are finding the pseudo-communities offered there ultimately unsatisfying, leaving them wanting more. Her book about all of this,Logging Off, is published in June and though it’s hard to read as a parent without thinking guiltily that society has been asleep at the wheel here, there’s something oddly uplifting about watching gen Z start to try to rebuild the lives they clearly feel they’ve been missing.The US sociologist Robert D Putnam is best known for describing the downs in his classicBowling Alone, which argued that society became more fragmented, polarised and distrusting over the second half of the 20th century as Americans retreated from collective activities – from team sports to churchgoing – that once knitted them together. But in his more recent book,The Upswing, written with Shaylyn Romney Garrett, Putnam goes back another half a century to explore how that sociable state of bowling together originally came about. It was, he argues, also in part a reaction to a period of loneliness and isolation, but this time caused by people moving from close-knit rural and small town America to bigger towns and cities where there were jobs and opportunities, but where they had few ties. What followed was a mushrooming of social clubs, from rotary clubs and scout groups to unions, that brought them together; though they didn’t know it, in retrospect their members were building the beginning of an upswing. The moral of the story, for those daring to be hopeful? That once societies get far enough down the path of isolation, sometimes the only way left is up.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionYoung peopleChildrenSocial mediaMental healthOnline abuseHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

It is at root the same issue, that of local autonomy, that led to regional unrest in Ukraine and splintered leadership in Palestine. It underlies the devastating conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Allthese places are flush with guns, allies and bombast. What they lack are national constitutions that allow their citizens sufficient local control to live at peace with others in one nation. They lack the skills of political federation.The present Ukraine war followed the failure of peace accords reached in Minsk in 2014 and 2015; critically, they depended on the technical details of how self-determination was to be allowed in eastern Ukraine. A later failure was that of theIstanbul dealafter the Russian invasion in 2022. It appeared to be the result of President Zelenskyy’s reaction to Vladimir Putin’sBucha massacre. But the origins of failure go back to Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine’s reaction to years of corrupt and oppressive rule from Kyiv. Similar dissent exists among Russian minorities in the Baltic states. Everywhere, localism matters.A constitution capable of bringing stable peace through self-government to Palestine’sWest Bankand Gaza may seem almost inconceivable, but one day it has to emerge. Peace does always follow war. We assume that Qatari and Egyptian mediators are wrestling with this now, but it remains mystifying what leverage they can have over parties whose command structures are so wholly committed to armed conflict. No less urgent is for Syria to be helped towards a coalition similar to that which has kept neighbouring Lebanon at peace, however hesitantly. Syria needs an invasion of constitutional entrepreneurs.Devolved constitutions work. India held together after partition by permitting a ruthless regionalism. It took Spain decades of civil war to reach an accord with its Basque separatists, but that has held. Britain failed. It is four years since Ireland celebrated the centenary of its departure from the United Kingdom, after a bitter civil war following a denial of home rule. Even today,neither Northern Ireland nor Scotlandare stable members of the union. The reason is simple: London’s obsessive centralisation.The more technology concentrates power on central governments, the more regions and provinces – in democracies and autocracies alike – demand greater freedom. Deprive them of it and they rise in varying degrees of revolt. Governments subject to no constitutional constraint, as in Britain, simply find devolution unpalatable. Every British political party swears to honour localism while in opposition, and then crushes it when in power. Virtually the last area of local discretion in England, town and country planning, is now being overruled by Keir Starmer. He is abolishinghundreds of democratic district councilshe finds inconvenient to his bureaucracy.Europe’s wiser regimes use their constitutions to appease local dissent, such as Italy regarding Sicily, Spain in Catalonia, Denmark in Greenland. Switzerland has long decentralised to its cantons, almost to the limit of national sovereignty; even qualification to vote was once discretionary. Germany’s constitution was carefully crafted after the second world war to distribute power among theLänder,to limit the reach of the central state. When Tito’s Yugoslavia fell apart, the failure to establish a vigorous federal constitution led its provinces into bloody civil war and disintegration.Sound constitution-building is essential to a secure statehood. Arguably the most successful is that created by the United States – plural – of America in the 18th century. It is safeguarded with a central balance of powers and autonomy vested in the rights of states, a balance that may soon be tested to destruction. But the US has held together a union of disparate ethnic and national peoples in a way that has defeated subsequent efforts at union in both Europe and South America.Constitutions may be hard to write in peacetime, but they are even harder after countries have collapsed into war. When guns are blazing and bombs falling, talk of contested boundaries, devolved assemblies, discretionary taxes and local policing seems eerily irrelevant. Yet such accords there must be. Constitution-building may offer no headlines, but what it can do is stop hundreds of thousands of people dying.Trump’s plan for Gaza leaves Arab nations facing an impossible choice | Nesrine MalikRead moreThe masters of postwar diplomacy, such as George Kennan and Henry Kissinger, kept Europe free of war for half a century. The philosophy of containment meant the avoidance of head-to-head conflict with Russia. It also involved a measured response to Russia’s handling of its relations with its frontline neighbours, such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Containment held until finally Russia could no longer maintain authority over its family of subordinate states, their regimes exhausted by impotence. Most departed totally from Moscow’s empire.Both Gaza andUkrainewill need constitutions of masterful robustness. Yet while generals parade the majesty of their command, diplomatic peace-making seems in its infancy. Someone has to fashion political structures for these places that meet the long-term cravings of their citizens on the ground – cravings above all for freedom from interference from a higher authority. That is a freedom that modern governments, in peace or at war, still find hopelessly difficult to deliver.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s why it won’t workKhem RogalySince the 1980s Britain’s military spending has grown in real terms, yet more than half of military jobs have been lost. The sector is hi-tech and low labourKhem Rogaly is a senior research fellow at the thinktank Common WealthFri 7 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 12.41 ESTShareKeir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have announced their latest rescue remedy for Britain’s economy. Old promises – good jobs, thriving small businesses andregional equality– will now be delivered by an increased military budget, used to buy equipment from the private sector. More military spending is not a tonic, however, but a poison that will worsen our economic ills and make Britain less safe in the long run.Assurances of prosperity for small businesses and ex-industrial towns rest on a misleading depiction of military spending. Last financial year, 56% of Ministry of Defence spending with UK businesses went toLondon and the south of England. In the same year,nearly 40%of the £37.6bn military equipment budget went to just 10 multinational companies. “Slashing red tape” and granting small businesses more access to the military budget will not build a family-run missile factory on every street corner of ex-industrial Britain.BAE Systems, leading weapons dealer to government and happy recipient of 15% of the equipment budget, has just declaredrecord orders and rising profits. Military contractors are large multinationals that reward their asset manager shareholders from government contracts: since 2015, BAE has paid out £9.8bn to shareholders while receivingmore than a fifthof its global revenue each year from the British government.While in a few specific areas, communities are reliant on jobs at military contractors, this is the result of public spending decisions, not the benevolence or dynamism of private companies. Although the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard now relies on contracts to build nuclear submarines, in the early 1960s itsmost profitable workwas making engines for British Rail. Policy choices have left communities dependent on military contracts because of divestment from public services and civilian industry.Regardless, military spending is not a viable strategy for growth or the creation of good jobs nationally: Ministry of Defence spending on business directlysupports130,000 full-time jobs in the UK; if including supply chains, this rises to 209,000 or 0.83% of the workforce. Even with the military budget set to grow further over the next parliament, the industry it supports is too small to transform the nation’s economy.More important, the connection between military spending and job creation has weakened over time. Despite falling as a share of GDP, Britain’s military budget has grown in real terms since the early 1980s – the height of the cold war – yet at the same timemore than halfof jobs in the military industry have been lost. The military sector is increasingly a hi-tech employer that relies less on manufacturing and more on IT and engineering jobs in the south of England. Modelling in theUSandcontinental Europesuggests that investment in public services, environmental protections or renewable energy creates more jobs and more economic output than military contracts. This is intuitive: while new energy infrastructure provides long-term value by reducing bills, a faulty tank or aircraft carrier has little connection to the rest of the economy.Perhaps worst of all, the government is claiming that military spending is Britain’s economic salvation while wearing fiscal handcuffs of its own making. Military investments have already come at the cost of the foreign aid budget, and the chancellor has announced that a fund primarily for green industrial developmentcan be used on military spending. A commitment to higher defence spending in the next parliament has been swiftly followed by a reported intention to cut social security. These cuts will take from those who need support most and leave deep economic scars,reducing the money spent in the economy. The poorest in society are told that state coffers are empty while, for defence contractors, abundance is more than a political horizon.The government and the opposition are united in presenting “rearmament” as a difficult but necessary step – to keep Britain safe in a turbulent global order. This conceals the reality that Britain already has the world’s sixth largest military budget, which funds deployments that sprawl across the globe. There is little discussion of how bases in Oman and Bahrain keep us safe or of why paying £9bn to Mauritius to keep the US air force on the Chagos Islands is necessary for national security. Britain’s fantastical efforts to remain a global military power have left a trail of blood in Palestine, Yemen, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan in this century alone. This litany of devastating intervention and military collaboration has nothing to do with national defence.Perversely, faced by a US administration that is redrawing its relationship with Europe, there is an opening for Britain to reconsider its alliance with US global dominance. To focus on national defence and regional collaboration, the government should draw down British military resources in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific that are devoted towards upholding US power and a vain attempt to compete with China.Amid global instability, there is an opportunity to focus on genuine national and economic security – energy independence, public services and resilient industries – instead of sacrificing our societal health at the altar of military power.Khem Rogaly is a senior research fellow at the thinktank Common Wealth, where he leads a research programme on the military industryExplore more on these topicsDefence policyOpinionMinistry of DefenceBAE SystemsEconomic policyForeign policyUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

I can help with that, as can John Maynard KeynesFri 7 Mar 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 08.46 ESTShare“A new era is upon us.” Ursula von der Leyen was not holding back. This is a world turned upside down, changed beyond recognition. Leaders across Europe are echoing the alarm sent out by the European Commission president, and rippling across the continent, Canada and elsewhere: that we face a “clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has seen in our adult lifetime”. She has proposed a plan that would offer €800bn (£660bn) for immediate rearming, with a European sky shield to protect Ukraine.The hooligan Russian asset in the White House has changed everything so profoundly that it is hard to keep track. The US, whose coat-tails we clung to, whose culture we revelled in, whose cleverness dazzled and stupidity confounded, is now the enemy. The shock feels viscerally personal because American culture is deep in our veins at all ages, from Sesame Street to Marvel, from Philip Roth to Philip Glass, the Oscars to Silicon Valley, like it or not. In Iraq and Afghanistan, we obediently followed their blunders, and 642 British soldiers died, as Keir Starmeradroitly reminded JD Vancein parliament. Our glamorous friend has turned fiend. How do we cauterise that off us? Or reconfigure the map of the world in terms of friends and foes?Former UK ambassadors to Washington ruminated over this “seismic” shift, which has shaken every norm from their Foreign Office days. “This is not a blip in the relationship, something fundamental is going on,” one old knightwarned a Lords select committee, while another cautioned that the US giving up on Europe in favour of Russia was likely a “current reality”. Sir David Manning pinpointed Britain’sspecific anguish at this moment, the downside of the so-called special relationship: as Europe galvanises to rearm, unlike our continental neighbours, we depend on the US for our defence.With every new shock wave, Britain feels this trauma in its marrow. Yet there is hesitancy in government about addressing the nation with a call to arms, as Frenchpresident Emmanuel Macron has done, warning: “the innocence of these 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall is over.”Look at the remarkable response of Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, lifetime financial conservative and fiscal dogmatist, as he grasps the severity of the times: he will reverse all his previous fiscal policies and his nation’s usual dread over borrowing, breaking their “basic law” with a huge€500bn loosening of debt rulesto rearm. This amounts to “one of the most historic paradigm shifts in German postwar history”,according to Deutsche Bank. German borrowing costs shot up, but so have predictions of German growth from asluggish 0.8% to 2%, with investors sending industrial stocks soaring. But note this: in his fiscal sea change, rearming will not be accompanied by any cuts to German social spending.The question no one dares ask: what if Britain has to defend itself from the US? | George MonbiotRead moreHow about Britain? Our government has announced no change to fiscal policy. Living within our self-imposed straitjacket, our rearming will be paid forby cuts to aid, benefits and most departments, as Rachel Reeves this week sends her plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility to prove the books are balanced. Yet the promises the government has made are impossible to keep: no more borrowing, no more tax rises and no return to austerity. These are terrible choices – the aid cut already breaks a manifesto pledge – destroying trust whichever way Labour turns. But which is the least bad?A copy ofDuncan Grant’s portraitof John Maynard Keynes hangs by my desk, a reminder to reach for his 1940 prescription How to Pay for the War, a book that spelled out the necessary financial sacrifices of the time. Emergency action needed then was draconian, rapidly increasing production while drastically reducing consumption, introducing rationing and diverting everything to the war effort. In comparison, what’s needed in this new emergency is a pinprick, to raise the 3% of GDP for defence spending thatStarmer is aiming for. Take just this one measure: in a disgraceful (and failed) act of crude election bribery,Jeremy Hunt cut4p off employees’ national insurance. Restoring that would cover the cost of this extra defence spending alone, says Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies; so would 2p more on income tax for all.Labour’s Treasury team winces at the very thought of any further tax rises, after the walloping Reeves got for the £40bn tax rise inOctober’s budget. They are jumpy: remember Liz Truss’s mini-budget, maxi-catastrophe, they say. Look how even small tax changes such as the farmers’ inheritance tax can create a storm; some policies make absolute sense in economic and fairness terms, but crash politically. Besides, tax rises that cut people’s spending money risk stunting growth, they say – but then so do cuts to public spending. Borrow more? That adds to the mammoth£100bn a yearwe spend servicing existing debt, they say. But we are now on the hunt for the least-worst option – and Britain still pays less tax than similar countries.Starmer has risen to the needs of the hour. But he has yet to address his citizens on what rearming means, and what it requires of them. We like to think of ourselves as warlike, and at the ready. We are good at displays of national pride and national parades, with a four-day celebration planned for the80th anniversary of VE dayin May. But tax and financial sacrifice were essential parts of that victory. The alternative – miserable cuts to benefits for the weakest, and stripping yet more from threadbare stricken public services – is the worst of all the bad options. In our finest hour, Britain shed its traditional tax-phobia. If ever there was a moment to stiffen the sinews and summon up the taxes, it is now: for the defence of the realm.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionKeir StarmerDefence policyTrump administrationRussiaUkraineLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Can Democrats grab it?EditorialThe presidency is no longer just a ‘bully pulpit’. It’s become part of the disinformation machineFri 7 Mar 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 13.36 ESTShareDonald Trumpwon the White Housenot with money, though he spent plenty of it, but bydominating the conversation. He hasn’t stopped campaigning. He uses attention to bolster his political power, and uses his office to make sure that everyone keeps watching.He wasbarred from leading social media platformsafter the January 6 attack on the Capitol, but four years later, their owners attended his inauguration. Many of his key hires appear picked for their media presence as well as their ideological bent and sycophancy. Tuesday’s interminableaddress to Congresswas garnished with the kind ofwild claimsor outright lies that he knows take off on social media. For him, posting onlineultimatums to Hamasand a disturbingAI-generated “Trump Gaza” videois all part of foreign policy. One of the most chilling, and telling, moments of last week’s attack on Volodymyr Zelenskyy was Mr Trump’s remark: “This is going to be great television.”Strikingly, key membersof the Trump circle have consistently championed the self-styled misogynist Andrew Tate, one of the rightwing influencers who drove young men towards Mr Trump. Romanian authorities allowed Mr Tate and his brotherto fly to the USlast week, despite outstanding charges including rape, human trafficking and money laundering, all of which they deny. (The brothers are also wanted by UK authorities over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to 2012, and four British women are pursuing a civil case against them.) Though Romania denies any US pressure, and the president claimed to know nothing, the travel ban was lifted days after Mr Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell,raised the casewith Romania’s foreign minister.The Tate brothers are part of the far-right disinformation networks that not only promote vile and extreme views but also undermine reputable sources of information. Mr Trump embraces this, and far-right media activists are invited to “report” from the Oval Office while the Associated Press isshut outfor referring to the Gulf of Mexico. The White House press operation hasreinvented itselfas a social media machine, spewing out endless memes, attack lines and deliberate provocation to drown out rival voices. “They’re all offence, all the time,” said Steve Bannon approvingly.Like a social media algorithm made flesh, the president himself serves up anendless but unpredictable(and increasingly extreme) stream of material. It keeps admirers coming back for more and overwhelms critics, who don’t know where to focus. This strategy may offer diminishing returns, not least because it requires a constant ratcheting-up of content. Mr Trump can only do so much to bend reality: administration failures, U-turns and the costs ofpolicies such as tariffswill probably temper voters’ enthusiasm.But even without commanding political leadership or control of any branch of government, Democrats can’t justsit backand wait to find out. The political commentator and author Chris Hayesnotesthat they have been defined by risk aversion, preferring no attention to critical coverage. Finding ways to seize the initiative is essential. Mr Trump’s lies must be challenged. But fact‑checking his provocations, without compellingly promoting political alternatives, will not be enough. Procedural and legal responses are essential, but so is the ability to grab back the megaphone – or find another one.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The patchwork of overlapping structures has evolved through generations of gradual reform. It is poorly understood by voters. A majority routinelyabstain in council elections.The government is simplifying the system, ending the duplication of functions between county and district councils. That restructuring project will be combined with a renewed push for devolution inEngland. Here, too, existing arrangements are inconsistent. Some cities and wider metropolitan areas have been organised into combined authorities with directly elected mayors, each with bespoke powers. Transport and housing policy, for example, might sit under a different tier of government in a different part of the country, depending on whether a devolution deal was done.Labour’s policy, overseen by Angela Rayner’s communities and local government department, is for all of England to be covered by the mayor-led combined authority system. Six regions are to befast-tracked, with plans due soon. Local government reorganisation and the push for devolution are related projects that mostly complement each other. But there are tensions. Devolution deals must be ratified by local authorities, which meanscouncillors who don’t likeone part of the proposed changes might, depending on the sequence of reform, wield a veto over another part of the plan.Central government policy could become a hostage in the transition. Sir Keir Starmer has pledged tobuild hundreds of thousands of new homes, to which end the government also proposes planning reform. But housing policy, as currently implemented, relies on the lower tier of local government, which is due for dissolution in many areas.The choreography of overlapping reforms is not simple. Shuffling the structures risks becoming the primary focus, consuming money and administrative capacity that are already in short supply at local and central government level. A proliferation of jurisdictional turf wars and partisan squabbles to define new roles could become a distraction from the task of delivering better public services, which is – or should be – one of the reform’s benefits.A sound principle is driving the changes. British politics has been far too centralised for too long. A successful series of changes would create areas of jurisdiction that are big enough to be laboratories for policy innovation, benefiting from economies of scale, while being local enough that communities feel connected to their leaders, who can then be rewarded for success and held accountable for failure.The truly gamechanging move would be fiscal devolution, but the Treasury jealously guards control over tax-and-spend levers. Chancellors have always suspected, with justification, that the incumbent party at Westminster would take the blame if local politicians misused their financial autonomy. But caution starves councils of agency. The people best placed to understand problems in their area lack the means to develop solutions. Hoarding power centrally for fear of “postcode lotteries” never prevented regionaleconomic disparities.Sir Keir’s government has understood that something needs to change. The current reforms clearly fall short of the desired effect of empowering local democracy. Simplification is overdue. The danger is that scarce resources end up being tied up in a reorganisation of the machine, at the expense of the services that machine is supposed to deliver.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Implying that we are overdiagnosing certain conditions only reinforces the stigma associated with them, and will prevent people in need from being taken seriously and receiving appropriate support and treatment. The scepticism, however well-meaning, can be damaging for patient outcomes and public health in general. Treatments and support available for conditions such as ADHD and autism are already lacking and underresearched.The rise of diagnostic levels of most of these conditions comes from increased awareness, and also from the environmental changes in our society that place ever-increasing pressure on individuals to perform at a certain standard.Neurodiversityconditions have become a lot more debilitating for those experiencing them. Increased population density exposes individuals to more stimuli than their nervous system can handle. Technological progress, particularly the advent of smartphones, has led to an expectation of being always available and a pressure to react and respond in real time that did not exist 20 years ago.The solutions to the problematic rise of diagnoses, then, must also be societal. Individual adjustments, as seen in the case of Anna in the article, can only help to a degree, and for some it may not be enough to allow them to be fully functioning in society. There needs to be a recognition that some of the narratives shaping our society today are actively preventing a significant part of the population from being able to fully contribute. Placing the onus on the struggling individual is unhelpful.Diana AnisimovaLondonSuzanne O’Sullivan’s 2015 book,It’s All in Your Head,made a huge impact. We psychotherapists felt this doctor was singing our song – the power of the mind over the body. Her powerful case studies demonstrated the psychological underpinnings of medically unexplained diagnoses. Nine years later, O’Sullivan writes of the startling rise in the diagnosis of mental health disorders: “We are not getting sicker – we are attributing more to sickness.”I wonder if we need to think in broader terms about what is needed now for our sickness. If our bodies are screaming in distress, what is not being heard? Psychotherapy offers an environment in which people can and do heal and change. Through understanding and care, our most basic human needs are met. This transformational process is very different from diagnosis. It offers an exploration that tries to understand why we are the way we are, and not rush to conclusions.I can understand why taking the diagnostic route is tempting. But I have always believed that psychotherapy is, in the words of Stephen M Johnson, “the hard work miracle”. Hard work in the sense that facing pain is not for the faint-hearted: opening up our vulnerability, being honest about our inner conflicts and entrusting ourselves to someone else are acts of bravery. And a miracle in that, with patience and time, the good stuff starts to make an impact.When we feel understood and accepted, and start to apply this to ourselves with compassion, the painful parts of the self settle down in peace and coherence. We can relax and feel safe in the world. These are the qualities, so much in short supply, that could be a salve for our current sickness.Philippa SmethurstDuns Tew, OxfordshireThe extract from Suzanne O’Sullivan’s new book, The Age of Diagnosis: Sickness,Healthand Why Medicine Has Gone Too Far, that you published lays bare a patronising attitude that many healthcare professionals take towards neurodivergent people. She has spoken to scores of people diagnosed with autism or ADHD – all of whom have said their lives were better for it. Yet she wants to discourage diagnosis.Why? Because she worries about their future, noting that many left jobs, dropped out of education, or lost friends. It seemingly never occurs to her that these changes might be deliberate, even positive. As an autistic person, my diagnosis empowered me to leave a high‑stress career in London and start a fulfilling online business, where I can work alone, from home. It also helped me cut out unhealthy friendships and build a life that genuinely suits me. Others have done the same, not out of helplessness but choice. O’Sullivan and her colleagues should try listening to their patients. And when neurodivergent people say they’re happier, they should believe them.Name and address suppliedI feel Suzanne O’Sullivan overlooks the anxiety and distress people who are neurodivergent have in trying to function in a world that often makes little sense to them. This can lead to profound feelings of isolation, which in turn can lead to problematic behaviours for society. And for an individual struggling like this, even suicide. I feel this is being largely sidelined here.If there is no diagnosis, there is a missed opportunity for helpful therapy and a better understanding of their struggle, both for themselves and those around them. People need to feel seen and heard, and when this is absent there can be profound implications for us all. So “pathologising”, with its implication of overdiagnosing symptoms, would not be the goal but perhaps the way the health and education systems work – without a diagnosis, no help is available.From a neurodivergent person’s point of view, a great deal of relief may come from a recognition that they are facing real difficulties. I agree that to see mental health problems as a person’s response to a threat to themselves can be a useful and compassionate approach. But if their struggles are profound and enduring over a lifetime, it still needs to be recognised, and we have a duty to offer treatment where possible.Anne SanachanEdzell, AngusI was disappointed by this edited extract from Suzanne O’Sullivan’s book. As a disabled specialist psychotherapist working with neurodivergent and chronically ill clients, I feel that her representations need challenging. While I agree with the importance of hope and dangers of pathologising common experiences, she ignores the role inequality and social context play in health. She minimises the disabling impact that chronic conditions can have in the absence of mainstream understanding of their complexity; the medical gaslighting she scorns is all too common, and her simplification of the potential for improvement shows a striking ignorance of average experiences.These misrepresentations can, ironically, contribute to the lack of hope and disabling impacts she mentions. With a failing NHS and lack of specialist support, the validation of a diagnosis can be all a person has, if they can get one at all.Elizabeth TurpLiverpoolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Being a new parent (and particularly a mother) is no joke, but it is good to be able to laugh at yourself and the huge clash with society’s expectations.It’s easy to imagine that previous generations had helpful family around the corner and that life wasn’t so hectic or costly. But my experience and that of many of my generation – my children were born in the 80s and 90s – was difficult too. I had to finish work at a certain point in pregnancy – around seven months – and maternity pay was only for six weeks.Many mums – myself included – returned to work when the baby was three months old! We needed the money to pay the mortgage. I worked part-time for years to minimise childcare costs, and in those days you didn’t have to pay pension contributions if you worked less than 25 hours a week – so many women chose not to. This impacted my workplace pension.By the 90s, things were slightly better and I took six months off after my third child. But childcare costs were prohibitive, and we paid them so I could continue working as a nurse and not lose my registration. In those early years it did seem like it actually cost to work – but I figured that it was worth the trade-off as I remained in the workplace, and that helped me progress my career.I did not have family around, having moved away to train as a nurse, and we didn’t have easy access to resources, WhatsApp support or Mumsnet. I have much sympathy with new mothers. It is a truly testing time. But the past was no more rosy than the present. My own experience of becoming a mother gave me great respect for all mothers everywhere.Jacky PughSt Austell, CornwallHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Look no further for a prime example than last year’s opening Six Nations night in Marseille, when France launched their campaign against Ireland with all the speed and dynamism of an elderlyescargot.They were also reduced to 14 players after half an hour and the visitors strolled to acomfortable 38-17 win.But this time? Politely decline all shopping trips, walk the poodle early and make sure there’s enough Guinness in the fridge. Because some games are unmissable and this is a defining contest for both teams. Can Ireland, with successive titles already in the backpack, stay on track for an unprecedented three-peat? Or is now the time for Fabien Galthié’s France to embrace their supposed destiny?Ireland and France load benches with forwards to play Risk in search of rewardRead moreThink Ali v Frazier or Federer v Djokovic. With added edge and better pre-match anthem singing. There can be no middle ground, no taking the dreaded “learnings”. Instead the equation is beautifully stark: go hard or go home. Or, in France’s case, go harder for longer. As their forward-dominated seven-one bench split has underlined, they are not heading to Dublin to make delicate daisy chains or gaze admiringly at the River Liffey.It matters all the more because of what victory would mean for both sides. Mathematically Ireland would be all but sure of a record third consecutive outright title. If they lose, on the other hand, it will set up a seriously compelling final Super Saturday with France in the box seat via their superior points difference. But beyond all that are the reputational ramifications: in particular, should Ireland complete the treble, they will deserve to be remembered among the most illustrious of European champions.All of which makes for a full metal jacket of an occasion. When the mood takes this France side they can transform rugby into the most intoxicating of team sports. Yet when needed they can also bring thunder as well as lightning. Throw in a dry ball and a now-or-never vibe and a highly charged spectacle is pretty much guaranteed.Hence the reason why no one in Ireland is getting too far ahead of themselves. No matter that the team have lost only one of their past 24 Tests in Dublin sinceFrance beat them 15-13just over four years ago.

Ireland have not reached their current lofty perch through silly errors, chancing their arm unnecessarily or falling away in the second half. Their kicking game is another obvious strength. But is booting it straight down the throats of Damian Penaud and co really the answer? AsFrance demonstrated against Italy, there are few better at exploiting half a metre of space. The visitors also seem to be kicking less themselves and adhering more closely to the Toulouse model of close-quarter offloading and clever angled support lines. When they get it right the results can be scintillating.Questions, questions. Can Ireland really hope to suffocate the irresistible Antoine Dupont from start to finish? And when France do come route one, as they will definitely look to do, will the hosts be able to divert them down a cul‑de-sac? Ireland’s defence has been a consistent strength but France will have studied Henry Slade’s grubber kick through for Cadan Murley’s early try for England last month and sniffed possible opportunity.When it comes to pressure, though, no one will be more scrutinised than young Sam Prendergast, for whom this looms as the ultimate test of nerve and character. Prendergast has all the makings of a 100-cap international player – both his parents have had distinguished military careers – and his calm temperament and long raking kicking game reflect the hours he has spent with his predecessor Johnny Sexton. But this challenge, even so, will be a step up on anything the 22-year-old has previously experienced.Defensively, he can expect a stampeding herd of French beasts down his channel, even with Bundee Aki in the vicinity to help out. The loss of Mack Hansen robs Ireland of another roaming threat and conspicuously absent again is the great Tadhg Furlong, such a vital pillar for Ireland for so long. Nor is Garry Ringrose available in the wake of his red card against Wales. He would have missed the Italy game as well had the Irish Rugby Football Union not stretched everyone’s credulity by suggesting he would have togged out for Leinster on the fallow weekend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ireland are reliably cussed and will be further fuelled by the emotional desire to give Peter O’Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray a fitting send-off in the trio’s final home Test.

Bealham and Andrew Porter will be expected to hold the fort in the set pieces but a groaning French bench looks more ominous than anything the Irish have so far faced.Factor in Thomas Ramos, currently the world’s deadliest goal-kicker, and France will be hoping this is finally the day they can end a deflating run of big game disappointments. Both these teams bowed out in the quarter-finals of the last World Cup but France’s hangover seemed to last slightly longer. Now, having seen victory slip away in greasy conditions at Twickenham, they have a clear shot at redemption, always assuming they can keep 15 players on the pitch.The final margin is again likely to be within a score but no side in Test rugby is better able to conjure a gamechanging“Voilà!”from thin air. Hopefully this will also prove a contest that leaves everyone desperately wanting more. There are those who insist Test rugby is simply about the result – and yes, it is for players and coaches. But professional sport is also about bums on seats and expectant sitting rooms and “Did you see that?” Monday office postmortems. Two years ago this fixture, won 32-19 by Ireland, produceda breathtaking spectacle, from James Lowe’s acrobatic try in the corner to Dupont’s try-saving tackle on Hansen. This one has all the ingredients to be even better.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025France rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I really feel for him because these past few weeks will have been really mentally tough to deal with. It’s patently obvious that his preferred position is fly-half but he has been asked to do a job for the greater good of the team and has done so willingly. You can dress it up however you like but going from starting No 10, to playing out of position, to the bench is a demotion and that will be tough to take.Marcus would be forgiven for looking at the team that Steve Borthwickhas picked to face Italyand wondering why he was never given that backing. Fin Smith has performed superbly well in the No 10 jersey and after two games there, Borthwick has surrounded him with Northampton players with five in the backline. It’s a credit to Saints, their style of play, their players and coaches, and it gives Fin the perfect framework in which to to operate. I’m not sure, though, if Borthwick ever built a team around Marcus in the same way.Six Nations proves a beacon of light, hope and escapism amid global moral surrender | Emma JohnRead morePerhaps the biggest takeaway of the past few weeks is the value that George Furbank brings to this side. Since the World Cup and the international retirement of Owen Farrell, England have moved away from a 10-12 dual playmaker axis to 10-15. It’s on trend – New Zealand have done it for a while, France do it with Romain Ntamack and Thomas Ramos, South Africa with Handré Pollard and Willie le Roux or Damian Willemse. Marcus has been asked to play that role and has he played well? Yes. Has he played his best stuff? Probably not, but did Antoine Dupont play his best when he moved to fly-half? Or to look at it another way, did Ben Thomas look at his best for Wales when he moved to inside-centre where he is more comfortable?Has England’s attack looked clunky because of Marcus’s performances or because of the philosophy the team is imbued with? I’d say the latter.Against Scotland, England kicked 69% of their possession. Their pass-to-kick ratio was 1:2.7, which means that, roughly speaking, for every three passes their fourth action was to kick. It’s hard to get attacking fluency if that’s the case.It’s important to depersonalise it but I’m not sure Borthwick completely trusts Marcus’s style of play because it is in complete conflict with how the head coach sees the game. I’ve played with Steve, he was my captain, and Marcus’s instinctive game is not part of Steve’s DNA. It was not how he played, not how he coached domestically and not how he has coached at international level. He had to pick Marcus because of how consistently brilliant he has been for Harlequins but I suspect that when Steve watches Fin at No 10, his heart rate drops a little bit. He feels more comfortable.That can be really tough to cope with as an individual and it’s the really difficult thing about elite sport, it’s subjective. You can work hard, train the house down, be England’s best performer over the past 12 months, but if that one person who matters doesn’t see it, or there’s a conflict of philosophy, you’re just not going to play. And it’s totally out of your control. Those are the peaks and troughs that elite sports people go through.View image in fullscreenMarcus Smith and Fin Smith celebrate the win over France.Photograph: Dan Mullan/RFU/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesIt would be really easy for me to say that Marcus needs to keep working hard, keep his head down, keep training well, but in all walks of life, everyone needs to see that putting in hard work will pay off. But I would urge him to be himself, be the best version of himself, the version that led to his callup to the last British & Irish Lions tour. Ultimately, Steve has repeatedly said that he wants the players to be the best versions of themselves in an England jersey. Over the past 12 months, Marcus has done that and right now it is not deemed good enough.It hurts, it chips away at you. It’ll be wrapped up differently, sold to Marcus as a different role, coming on from the bench, that’s the emotional takeaway. One of the best skills you need as a rugby player is to compartmentalise your emotions. In the short term, the only thing that matters is how he plays when he comes on. He will get an incredible reception, the fans love Marcus. I’m looking forward to the applause he gets, hopefully England will be in a favourable position and they will be more positive with ball in hand, which will suit Marcus.It’s a tough sell to the casual fan – how are England going to improve in an attacking sense without the person many believe is their best attacking player? I was in the gym the other day and it was all anyone wanted to talk to me about.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One person even said Jonny Wilkinson should be at fly-half!It just shows how many varied opinions are out there and ultimately no one knows the side better than the head coach. He has to cut through all the noise.The proof will be in the pudding on Sunday. I understand the frustrations within the camp that after losing so many narrow matches, they finally get over the line a couple of times but are still criticised for their style of play.Ultimately that comes back to Borthwick promising an expansive gameplan in the buildup and England not producing that. He has done so again and now is the time to deliver.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Six NationsRugby unioncommentShareReuse this content"

He may have succeeded in grounding them but Arne Slot’s side still found a way to soar.The exhilarating, aggressive football of Jürgen Klopp has given way to quality control under his successor, butLiverpoolare no less effective for that shift. The league leaders, who can go 16 points clear with victory over Southampton on Saturday, have scored more goals after 28 games of this Premier League campaign (66) than at the same stage of their last title-winning season, under Klopp in 2019-20 (64). Plymouth, Tottenham (in a Carabao Cup semi-final Spurs ultimately lost 4-1 on aggregate) and Nottingham Forest are the only teams to prevent Slot’s team scoring in 44 matches this season.Liverpool fans to have 2022 Champions League final injury claims heard in UKRead moreLiverpool have scored two or more goals in their last 18 games at Anfield in all competitions. Another two at home to Southampton and it will be the longest such sequence in the English top flight since Sunderland scored two or more in 19 consecutive games in 1935. And some people call them lucky. Not that equalling a 90-year-old feat is Slot’s priority, as he called on Liverpool’s players and fans to treat the visit of the league’s bottom club as “the first of three finals in the next week”, before Tuesday’s Champions League second leg against PSG and Sunday’s Carabao Cup showpiece against Newcastle.“It’s always nice but it is not the record I came to England for,” said the Dutchman on the opportunity to equal Sunderland’s run. “We are not focused on those records, we focus on Southampton and then the Champions League and then the cup final.“But it’s a sign that we are balanced and a sign that we have a lot of quality with players who can score goals in our squad. It’s also a sign of consistency and that is what you need, not only scoring goals but also not conceding in a season where you are fighting for the things we are.”Mohamed Salah’s phenomenal output includes a goal or an assist in each of the last 11 league games at Anfield. He requires one goal to become the third-highest scorer in Liverpool’s history outright with 242 and two more league goals to go joint-fifth on the all-time Premier League goalscorer’s chart, alongside Sergio Agüero with 184.No one can touch the 32-year‑old’s contribution of 30 goals and 22 assists in all competitions this season but the load is being shared. Cody Gakpo and Luis Díaz are both in double figures, with 16 and 13 goals respectively, Diogo Jota has eight despite another injury-hit campaign and the midfielders Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister and Curtis Jones have a combined total of 15.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah was stopped by PSG but he could soon mark some important goal milestones.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesSlot envisages a day when Liverpool are even more prolific. The head coach explained: “Wolves was difficult, Southampton away was difficult, the League Cup there was difficult and against Paris Saint-Germain it was really, really difficult. Yes, we are a really good team but we are not a team that every week wins 4- or 5-0 and after half an hour it is already 3-0. We have seen a team doing that a few times in recent years and I think, longer ago, Liverpool also had that where, after half an hour, it was already 3-0. We are not that team yet.“It is somewhere we are trying to go to and therefore it is something we need to improve a lot. But what this team does have is fighting spirit and until now they have always found a way to win a game and not always in the same manner, not always dominating ball possession, sometimes also by defending really hard and being good in transition. We know we have to be on top of our game because even if we are on top of our game we mostly win by one-goal margins.”The latest example, in Paris on Wednesday, was forged onan astonishing goalkeeping displayby Alisson. It would be remiss to focus entirely on Liverpool’s striking prowess after that performance. With Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving from Valencia this summer for an initial £25m and the Brazilian showing why,in Slot’s eyes, he is the best goalkeeper in the world against PSG, the Georgia international has a major fight on his hands to claim the first-choice role he craves next season.“He is in just as important a phase of the season with Valencia as we are in so it wouldn’t be smart for me to talk about him,” said Slot of Mamardashvili. “But in general I can say that if you want to play for Liverpool, you have to accept there is competition. If you don’t want to face competition then Liverpool is not the best place to go to.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What are these exactly? And is everything just basically crisps now? This column is about the MCC being needlessly given tens of millions of pounds because the England and Wales Cricket Board sold a hat that isn’t really a hat,just the promise of a brightly coloured future-hat.This column is about cricket umpires being reduced progressively to a theatre of facial expressions, from the brave, wounded “you’re on screen, please reverse your decision”, to the screw-you triumphalism of the confirmatory finger to an empty set of stumps. Michael Caine once said that while doing a closeup you should always stare at a fixed point, always into one eye not both eyes of your scene partner.

This column is about the fact “spicy” is not actually a flavour no matter how exciting you make the font on the packet. Wait, wait, wait. There was actually something in there. Which one was it?It feels like there is something of the Donald Trump random distracting idea-generator about most public pronouncements now. We want the best milkshakes. We are going to ban one-legged people from infiltrating the milkshake factories, the one-legged people they’re out there doing this, and we’re going to stop it. Also, we’re going to invent our own central crypto currency. But let’s talk about mud. What is it? Why does it stick to your shoes?To be fair, this does seem like a logical communications strategy in an age of information-overload. Drown them in noise. Shout things. Then just do The Thing. And naturally this way of dealing with the public has already been adopted by many of our sports governing bodies, whose existence seems to revolve around doing the thing they want, while pretending to be totally on board with the pointless and doomed things you actually care about.There is still information to be found here. It is a question of listening hard, applying a noise filter and trying to work out which of the real things has just been said out loud. Fifa will kind of tell you what’s happening, but it will also be hidden inside a massive box made of ham, fireworks and deceit.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes taking over the England one-day captaincy is a good idea that feels like a bad idea.Photograph: Michael Bradley/Getty ImagesAnd closer to home the ECB has been doing this for a while, a process that has gone into overdrive during the current management-speak era, where presumably even the internal meeting minutes read like an AI-generated high-performance golf podcast. Stupid is cupid. Break it till you fake it. Bullshit walks, money talks and bullshit money walks loudest. Mmm … What’s Stokesy up to? Let me text him. OK. And that’s lunch.There was something of that fog of distraction inKey’s statements this weekabout the future direction of English cricket. The best part was Key pointing out that England’s players “speak a lot of rubbish” in press conferences, a process also known in reporter’s parlance asBen Duckett: full transcript. But the most interesting bit was also the one most outlets picked up on, that Stokes should be considered as an option for captaincy of the one-day international team.Here we have a statement that is perhaps a victim of its own medium: a good idea that feels like a bad idea in the middle all the bloke-chat and half ideas. But one that also has lots to commend it, for reasons that go beyond being able to set a creative, wicket-taking field for mediocre spin bowling in the middle overs.So yes, at first glance, a bad idea. Stokes is 14 years into his multi-format, triple-discipline, 267-game international career. He squeaks when he walks. His leg is basically falling off. As with all good things in English cricket, the instinct is he needs to be preserved. Plus there is the maddening notion that Key’s one successful idea, getting Stokesy in, must now be the one-size solution he applies to every single problem, like Trump trying to turn Gaza into a golf resort.View image in fullscreenJoe Root and Ben Stokes celebrate with the trophy after winning the World Cup in 2019 at Lord’s.Photograph: Gareth Copley-ICC/ICC/Getty ImagesBut it might actually work in practical terms. There is basically a two-and-a-half-year run to the next World Cup.Stokes has ditched the franchise churnand only does England red ball now, but there aren’t actually many Test series in the calendar, with long periods where he won’t be doing much. As my colleague Ali Martin has pointed out, this would be nine extra days of cricket before the Ashes, while the ODIs in New Zealand are basically a warmup for that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stokes doesn’t have to bowl. He retired while still a wonderful ODI batter, averaging 48 going back to the 2019 World Cup final. Best of all he’s a supreme and flexible captain, ideal for a format that now seems geared towards taking wickets. Stokes at a sunlit African World Cup, down on one knee hammering the ball like a man taking a croquet mallet to a discarded flat-pack wardrobe. This is a medium-term future vision for England cricket that I for one can seriously get on board with.More widely it is increasingly clear the good bits of Bazball have always really been Stokes-ball, that he is the functioning brain here, Brendon McCullum the vibe-man and pheromone blower.This comes at a time when even the admin tier of England cricket feels like bolt-on high-performance will-this-do stuff: red ankle trousers, no socks, vibing the crap out of this shit, hair, beard, jaw, shorts, calves, energy, holding a meeting in the lift on the way to the meeting and that’s actually the meeting bro. Mind blown.Whereas Stokes is not this. Stokes is substance, skill and heart. He will also be 36 by the time that next ODI World Cup is over. This is basically what we have left of him now. So why not sweat the asset just a little, at a time when every other part of English cricket seems to be about chucking the family furniture on the fire.Like Stokes himself, ODIs are a time-limited substance, a good format being junked in favour of an easier one to sell. Why not give them a proper send-off in the hands of Stokes, who will throw himself into it and draw every last drop.This is the other point here. There was a respectful farewell forJos Buttler as he left his own sinking shipafter England’s exit from Champions Trophy. Personally it left me a little lukewarm, a man resigning without too many regrets, freed up now to pretend to be enthusiastic in a coloured outfit for money.Whereas Stokes has something more epic about him, the sense that he might even be the last of something, the last England cricketer anyone will actually recognise in the street, the final cartoon-book England A-lister before the whole thing becomes more diffuse. We could wrap him up in protective cladding. But life moves pretty quickly and it is hard to think of many better prospects for the ODI in its farewell lap than as a Viking funeral for our own last action hero.Explore more on these topicsBen StokesEngland cricket teamCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

She was Britain’s banker. A cast-iron certainty. And then, with 100m to go, it all went horribly wobbly.At that point, theOlympic 1500m bronze medallistwas leading and looked to have everything under control. But just when everyone expected her to switch on the afterburners, her legs turned into spaghetti – the result, it later transpired, of an ear infection.First Agathe Guillemot of France muscled past her to win in 4min 07.23sec. Then the Portuguese athlete Salomé Afonso did the same. And then came a final indignity as her British teammate Revée Walcott-Nolan snatched bronze in a photo-finish after both athletes had run 4:08.45.‘I wish we’d taken the train’: athlete Innes FitzGerald welcomes Thunberg comparisonsRead more“In the last stage, my legs just completely locked,” said Hunter Bell. “I don’t know when that last happened.“I had an illness, I had an ear infection, I can’t really hear out my ear. Training has been a bit up and down. I thought I would still be fine for today. But I just didn’t have it. I’m obviously really gutted.”The result was particularly shocking given that when Hunter Bell had won bronze in Paris in 3:52, Guillemot had finished seven seconds back in ninth – while Afonso and Walcott-Nolan did not even make the final.However, the 31-year-old has promised to use her shock defeat as inspiration for the rest of 2025 – starting with the World Indoor Championships in China in two weeks – after the first major setback of her career since she returned to the sport after coming out of retirement three years ago. “I will have to go away and reset,” she said. “Last year when I came fourth at the world indoors that really fuelled me for the summer. So when I am done being sad about this, maybe I can take some positives out of it. But I am going to let myself be sad for tonight.”Walcott-Nolan was rightly delighted in her first major medal. “My legs were absolutely going away from me,” she said. “But in my head, I thought: ‘OK, Georgia is a lot stronger than I am, and is a lot quicker than I am. If I just hold it tight to her as I can, and do as good as I can, then I’ll be happy with that.’ And that kind of got me the medal.”There are more potential British medals over the weekend, with George Mills – the son of the former England footballer Danny – particularly bullish about his chances in the 3,000m.The 25-year-old has spent the winter pushing his body through 120-mile training weeks at his sparse altitude camp in Dullstroom, South Africa. Such is his devotion, he could probably teach Benedictine monks a thing or two about abstinence.Asked whether he had any guilty pleasures during the week, he shook his head. “I don’t know,” he said. “I’m a simple guy. I love to train, hang out with my friends and teammates if I’m able to. That’s a good life.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Mills: ‘I love to train.’Photograph: Alex Livesey/British Athletics/Getty ImagesNaturally, he is also in bed by 10pm. “Sleep is when you recover,” Mills said. “You need to try and optimise that. I try to nap most afternoons and obviously get a good night’s sleep. I have blue-light glasses, earplugs, eye masks – all those sorts of things.”The monastic regime does not end there. When he spoke to the British media he was eating boiled chicken and plain rice without any seasoning for lunch. “Flavour doesn’t make you fast,” he said.For Mills to win gold, he will have to beat the double Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who looked hugely impressive in winning 1500m gold in Apeldoorn on Friday. However, Mills is not completely ruling it out.“Obviously he’s a phenomenal athlete,” said Mills. “But everyone’s got a target on their backs and in this sport no one is invincible.”Mills was second to Ingebrigtsen at the European Championships last June. But that has only made him hungrier. “I got a taste of a medal in Rome last year,” he said. “Now I want to be competing for medals at every major championships.”Meanwhile, there was more disappointment for another fancied British athlete as Amber Anning, the favourite for the women’s 400m, was disqualified after winning her heat. The 24-year-old, who came fifth in the Olympics, looked to have progressed comfortably in 51.01. However she left in tears after TV footage showed she stepped on the line multiple times.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tournament officials were comfortable Clark’s ball landed back in its own pitch mark, which allows a free drop. Had the ball instead rolled into another divot, Clark could only have taken a drop under penalty. The 31-year-old, who was leading the tournament at the time, went on to make a par.Keegan Bradley surprised ‘kick their ass’ comment was broadcast on NetflixRead moreIn a statement, the PGA Tour’s rules committee said: “After reviewing ShotLink video of Wyndham Clark’s tee shot on the 3rd hole during the second round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the PGA tour rules committee determined that the ball returned to its own pitch mark, which entitled Clark to free relief.”Clark himself shrugged off the incident. “I didn’t know there was any confusion, obviously when I’m playing,” he said. “We never saw it bounce. Then we get up there and it’s in a plugged lie. My ball was covered with mud. So we took relief and didn’t think anything of it.”By close of play, Clark sat two adrift of Shane Lowry’s 36-hole total. Clark double bogeyed the 15th and dropped another shot at the 17th while en route to a 71. Lowry’s 67 included an excellent birdie at the treacherous 18th. Lowry’s eight under par heads the pack.Given the attributes required to succeed at Bay Hill, Lowry’s prominence should come as no surprise. The2019 Open championadmitted he had extra motivation to secure a late tee time in round three. Lowry’s Saturday start means he will have scope to watchIreland take on Francein the Six Nations. “It was either a late tee time or no tee time,” Lowry said.“My iron play is good and conservative when it needs to be. I think you need that around places like this. I just like the grind of ‘pars are good’. There’s a lot of weeks out here where you get where you shoot level par for nine holes and you feel like you’re beating your head against the wall.“Whereas, weeks like this, level par after nine you’re actually doing OK, you’re a little run away from having a lovely day.

Between hearings, he met journalists and activists to spread word of the health crisis his people face.“A people have been completely destroyed: people’s way of life destroyed; people’s only drinking water, which is the underground water aquifer, has been poisoned; people’s farmland has been completely poisoned; people’s streams that they use [for] their normal livelihood have been completely destroyed,” he said.When oil first flowed from the wells in Ogoniland in 1956, before Okpabi was born, it was a lush landscape of mangrove forests. Its sparkling watercourses were populated by fishes, crabs, oysters and other creatures. The land’s people were primarily fishers and farmers.Five and a half decades later, scientists from the UN Environment Programme visited the region to investigate the industry’s effects. They found extensive soil and groundwater contamination, mangrove roots choked with bitumen-like substances, surface water in creeks and streams covered in thick layers of oil. The fish had fled or died and farmers struggled to grow crops in fields soaked with oil.View image in fullscreenA sign at a creek in Ogale, in Ogoniland in the Niger delta, warns people not to use the water.Photograph: Leigh DayOf all the areas tested,Nisisioken Ogale, Okpabi’s domain, was “of most immediate concern”. People there were drinking from wells contaminated with benzene, a known carcinogen, at levels more than 900 times the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. Follow-up testing carried out in the same area last year found levels that were even higher – 2,600 times the WHO guideline.The effects of this contamination have been tragic, says Okpabi. “There is a lot of cancer: young girls of 20 to 30 years old, 40 years old, developing breast cancer and other forms of cancer; a lot of strange skin diseases that we don’t know the cause of; low life expectancy, people just drying up and dying. Even eye diseases. In some cases birth defects … Strange diseases everywhere in our lives.”The trial centres on claims by Oganiland’s Ogale and Bille communities that the enduring effects of hundreds of leaks and spills from Shell’s pipelines and infrastructure have breached their right to a clean and healthy environment.The three and a half weeks of hearings, which ended on Friday, were a “preliminary issues trial”, heard by Mrs Justice Juliet May, to determine the scope of the legal issues to be decided at the case’s full trial, set for late 2026. Although the case is being heard by a British judge in a UK court, it will apply Nigerian law, and so May heard from a range of senior Nigerian lawyers about what the law is and how it should be applied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A second key issue was whether Shell could be held responsible for damage to its pipelines due to oil theft, or for the waste produced as a result of illegal refining of spilled or stolen oil – endemic in the Niger delta.Shell argues it cannot be held responsible. The company insists its Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), works closely with the Nigerian government to prevent spills and to respond to them and clean them up when they do occur.View image in fullscreenA man stands on fishing canoes surrounded by polluted water in the Niger Delta.Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP“We strongly believe in the merits of our case.Oilis being stolen on an industrial scale in the Niger delta.

It has also influenced climate litigation around the world.However, there was resistance within Switzerland from the start, and by the summer the Swiss federal council hadrebuffed the ruling.While it acknowledged the importance of the underlying European convention on human rights, the Swiss government said the court’s interpretation was too broad in extending it to the climate crisis and in accepting a complaint from an organisation.It claimed it was already doing enough to cut national emissions, and submitted an “action report” in October rather than the required action plan. This maintained that the judgment did not require it to set specific carbon budgets and that there was no internationally recognised method for doing so.The committee of ministers, which is responsible for upholding the judgment, noted this week thatSwitzerlandhad closed some legislative gaps, including revising its CO2act and setting goals up to 2030.But it invited Switzerland to provide more information showing how its climate framework aligned with the court’s ruling, “through a carbon budget or otherwise, of national greenhouse gas emissions limitations”. The committee took note of methodologies put forward by a broad coalition of NGOs to calculate this.Georg Klingler, a project coordinator and climate campaigner at Greenpeace, which supported the Swiss women’s case, said this essentially meant setting budgets that reflected Switzerland’s “fair share” of emission reductions in line with the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting warming to under 1.5C. That could mean toughening up existing goals, he said.The Swiss government was also told to keep the committee of ministers informed about planned adaptation measures to protect vulnerable citizens during events such as heatwaves. And it must provide “concrete examples” of citizens’ involvement in developing climate policies. Switzerland has until September to provide this information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She called on the Swiss federal council and parliament “to take the dangers of global warming seriously and finally take decisive action against the climate crisis”.Sébastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, said European governments had “reaffirmed the rule of law”. “The decision … makes clear that the Swiss federal council must fulfil its legal obligation to protect its citizens’ human rights by ramping up its climate ambition.”Başak Çalı, a professor of international law at the Oxford Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, said: “It is a good day for respect for European court judgments and international law. This decision also shows just how important international institutions – such as the European court – are for helping to improve the lives of people everywhere.”In a statement, the Swiss federal government said the “competent authorities” would analyse the decision and determine what further information they would submit, adding: “The aim is to demonstrate that Switzerland is complying with the climate policy requirements of the ruling.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisSwitzerlandHuman rightsCouncil of EuropeGreenhouse gas emissionsGreen politicsEnvironmental activismnewsShareReuse this content"

Even when slow cooking a meal using one ring NO2 levels more than doubled.Once levels of NO2 had spiked researchers found that they remained elevated for a significant time – often several hours.The study suggests that people spending their evening in the same room where they have cooked could be exposed to sustained elevated levels of harmful pollutants well in excess of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.How cooking with gas releases harmful air pollution in the homeRead moreThe volunteer who used the induction hob experienced background levels of NO2, mainly from outdoor pollution.During the study, average NO2 levels over an hourly mean near the Which? office on Marylebone Road reached 33 micrograms per cubic metre, while average PM2.5 over a 24-hour mean was 14 micrograms per cubic metre.In contrast, three of the volunteers using a gas hob experienced PM2.5 peaks of more than 100 micrograms per cubic metre on several occasions, and one volunteer experienced a peak PM2.5 of nearly 650 micrograms per cubic metre. The WHO 24-hour mean guidance limit is 15 micrograms per cubic metre.Which? researchers calculated that one household averaged more than the WHO PM2.5 guidance limit for four days, while two other homes exceeded the limit for two days.The PM2.5 base levels recorded before cooking ranged from between less than one microgram per cubic metre to about 20 micrograms per cubic metre.In one scenario, the volunteers checked the air quality in an adjoining room, or in the living area if their house was open plan.Levels of both NO2 and PM2.5 still reached high peaks, and elevated levels continued for several hours after cooking, showing that pollution spreads rapidly through the home.PM2.5 levels returned to levels recorded before cooking within 45 minutes of doors or windows being opened in three out of five homes.A Which? survey of just over 2,000 UK adults about air pollution found little awareness of the dangers posed by cooking. Only a quarter of those with gas hobs said they were concerned about the possible impact of on their health.Astudy published last Octoberfound that NO2 exposure from gas cooking in the UK is linked to around 4,000 premature deaths annually, at a cost of £15.1bn per year.Dr Monica Mateo-Garcia, of theCentre for Future Homes at Birmingham City University, advised consumers to use extractor fans that vent outside, and to open windows and doors while cooking as this helped “a quick decay of the indoor pollutants”.Christian Pfrang,professor of atmospheric science at the University of Birmingham, also advised consumers to always use extractor fans when cooking, noting research has found many people do not.He warned that if indoor pollution was not removed quickly it would disperse throughout the home, for example, into bedrooms where people might spend more time.“They might spend 20 minutes cooking, but then might be exposed to elevated levels for eight or nine hours, which really causes health issues, especially if you’re vulnerable or elderly or a child,” he added.Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionPollutionShareReuse this content"

Last year, before Labour’s election victory, Starmercut its green investment planfrom £28bn a year to under £15bn, in a blow to Miliband.Sources close to the government said the Treasury was now running the rule over “everything” before the spring statement this month, which is expected to show that Reeves’s headroom against her fiscal rules has been wiped out.Another source warned of a rerun of the febrile months before the autumn budget, when swirling speculation hit business confidence and investment. “GB Energy has the potential to be a real confidence booster to business. Scaling it back would damage investor sentiment and, frankly, be electoral madness. It’s hugely popular on the doorstep, especially in Scotland,” they said.Last month, GB Energy admitted that itcould take 20 yearsto meet its pledge to employ 1,000 people, as the chair, Jürgen Maier, refused to put a date on when it would bring down energy bills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All three defendants were involved in the operation.The spymaster also directed gang members, including Ivanova, to steal mobile phone numbers of Ukrainian troops believed to be training at a US barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, using a military-grade snooping device not previously seen in criminal hands.Marsalek communicated directly with the ringleader, Orlin Roussev, 47, from Great Yarmouth, who in turn directed the surveillance activities from a former guesthouse in the Norfolk seaside town. The building was crammed with hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of electronic and surveillance equipment.Roussev has already pleaded guilty to espionage charges, as has his friend and deputy, Bizer Dzhambazov, 43. But the three more junior members had denied the charge of espionage, leading to an Old Bailey trial that lasted nearly three months.Police, however, said they were fortunate to have broken up the spy ring in February 2023, after an unknown period in which members were under surveillance by counter-terror police and MI5.The Met said it was unaware of the gang members’ intention to travel days later to Stuttgart to try to snoop on the phone numbers when police conducted a series of pre-dawn arrests.The head of the Met’s counter-terror division, Commander Dom Murphy, said “the core evidence was obtained from Roussev’s phone” and by identifying other key devices to retrieve 78,747 Telegram messages betweenRoussev and Marsalekoutlining six main plots and other smaller ones.Though Roussev was an IT specialist, he had not deleted the messages and they were not encrypted, painting a revealing picture of not just the spy ring’s activities, but the Kremlin’s interests aroundEurope. At one point Marsalek appeared to suggest Grozev was targeted because “apparently Putin seriously hates him”.Counter-terror officers also said that Kremlin spying and sabotage efforts were still in operation, although largely conducted through criminals or other poorly trained proxies directed from a distance. “This won’t be the only activity Russia is conducting in the UK,” Murphy said.The court heard that Dzhambazov wasin a relationshipwith Ivanova, his long-term partner, as well as Gaberova for a year and a half before their arrest. The third defendant, Ivanchev, was Gaberova’s ex-boyfriend.When police raided Gaberova’s flat, they found Dzhambazov in bed with her. Ivanova had been unaware of the relationship until after her arrest, and during the trial accused Dzhambazov of conducting “a parallel relationship” with Gaberova behind her back. Dzhambazov had also told the two women he had brain cancer, which was false.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It carries a maximum jail term of 14 years. Investigators traced at least €210,000 flowing from Roussev to other members of the gang.Of the three defendants, only Ivanchev was in court. The two women were present via video link from HMP Bronzefield. Ivanova and Gaberova, both seated, remained passive and subdued as the guilty verdicts were read out. Ivanchev, standing in the dock, nodded briefly as he heard the jury’s conclusion.Frank Ferguson, the counter-terror chief at the Crown Prosecution Service, said “this was a high-level espionage operation” with members working under Roussev’s leadership. “The police raid on Roussev’s home revealed a spy factory,” Ferguson said.Officers seized 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 258 hard drives, 33 audio recording devices, 55 surveillance cameras, 16 radios and 11 drones plus wifi eavesdroppers, electronic jammers and 75 fake passports and identity documents in 55 different names. The vast bulk were recovered in Great Yarmouth.Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing fake passports and identity documents at her flat in Harrow, where she lived with Dzhambazov.Mr Justice Hilliard KC, presiding, remanded the defendants into custody until sentencing between 7 May and 12 May. A sixth man, Ivan Stoyanov, 33, from Greenford in west London, was also implicated in some of the spying. He had pleaded guilty before the trial began, but this can be reported only now.Explore more on these topicsEspionageCrimeRussiaBulgariaEuropeLondonMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

We will continue to provide specialist support for them as our investigation continues.“We are still keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and anyone who has dashcam, private CCTV or doorbell footage around the time of the incident.”Fatal stabbings of teenagers are relatively rare in Scotland, and the police have not yet offered any theories or motives for the attack.Amen lived with his father in Glasgow, which has one of the UK’s largest refugee communities, and had recently been granted right to remain status by the Home Office. He was a pupil at St Thomas Aquinas Catholic secondary school in Jordanhill. Claire McInally, its headteacher, said the teenager’s death was a “shock to the school community”. He had shown “great promise”, she said.“Our thoughts and prayers are with Amen’s family and friends at this devastating time,” she said. “Amen was a friendly and much-loved young man who was really interested in music and the media. He was bright and showed great promise.“This has been a shock for our school community, and we are continuing to offer support to our young people, staff and those in the wider community who are affected.”Community organisations also paid tribute, the BBC reported. Kingsway Community Connections said: “Amen developed great relationships with our team, and we are all devastated with his sudden death.”JATV Goals, a youth mentoring project that supports refugees, asylum seekers and recent migrants to the area, often teaching boxing and film and video skills, also paid tribute to the teenager.“His life was tragically taken from us by the type of violence boxing does so well to combat,” the group said. “Our community is heartbroken as we come to terms with the loss of a young boy who had his full life ahead of him.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Do not target stuff at the poorest and most vulnerable. There are others ways of doing it,” the MP said. “There are lots of backbenchers concerned about this … it’s unhelpful in terms of how this has been trailed in the media and I feel that it’s too politically slanted as well. You can’t outflank the right.”Another Labour MP, Rachael Maskell, a former shadow cabinet minister, told the Guardian many colleagues were “feeling really nervous and concerned” and that mental health services and schools need to be better equipped to help young people before changing the social security system. “We need to get into why people are so challenged at the moment and to force people into work is not going to solve that problem,” she said.“We know people who depend on social security, with people struggling in our constituencies. It should be a Labour government alleviating poverty, not adding to it … the Labour government needing to hold its values about addressing poverty. Measures likeraising the living wageare really helpful but it is [Gordon] Brown economics we need at this time, which are complicated, technical and targeted. That’s not what we are seeing with these broad-brush approaches.”Maskell said many previous governments had tried unsuccessfully to cut the social security bill, so the fresh effort may be “more rhetoric than reality”.But she added: “What I’ve written to the minister with concerns about is people moved into a work-related activity group and being told they can work when they in fact can’t … I am concerned that’s where we will see the shift.”Another Labour MP said: “I think it is not sensible to punish the most vulnerable in society for a situation which is not their fault. We should be helping those with disabilities flourish and forcing employers to be more inclusive, not blaming disabled people for not being able to find employment.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsEconomic policyLabourRachel ReevesKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Even when snacking on the go is included, we are munching about 2% less than during the pandemic and even a bit less than before Covid reshaped our lives.Nathan Ward from Kantar said: “Working from home has made a massive difference. During the pandemic we did snack more as we were in the home and availability does drive consumption. As people have drifted back to work snacking has declined.”Ananda Roy, at the market research firm Circana, said: “We are seeing the world return to normal.” He says treats are far from off the menu but “the future of snacking is going to be different” with more fruit, nuts, yoghurts, protein bars and cheese, and fewer chocolatey treats and biscuits.Last year, we snacked on 350m fewer occasions at home compared with the previous year, according to Kantar. Consumers bought about 1.5% fewer sweets and chocolate bars over the year, according to Circana data, and about 6% fewer packs of crisps than in 2021. In contrast, snacking on fruit was up 4% last year, according to Kantar, while we bought 1.2% more nuts and16% more protein bars, drinks and powders, according to the Grocer’s top products research with the analyst NIQ.Protein snacks are experiencing a particular boost from healthy eating trends, with special drinks, nuts andeven boiled eggsnow more popular, as well as foods with more fibre, such as low-sugar smoothies.Waitrose said it had seen a demand for more “functional snacks”, such as crispy seaweed, as customers sought out healthier foods.Households are also seeking out less processed treats – such as carrot sticks, apple slices, olives and salads – amid concerns about the health implications of ultra-processed foods.“Increasingly, consumers are using fresh fruit and vegetables as part of their snack repertoire,” Roy said.The rise in the cost of cocoa, sugar and other indulgent commodities is partly behind the shift, with the amount of chocolate bought down by 11% since 2021, according to Circana. Crisp sales have also been hit by price rises prompted by poor potato harvests. The UK’s biggest brand, Walkers, for instance, sold 2.6m fewer kilograms of crisps last year as average prices increased 4.1%according to the Grocer.Jonny Forsyth, a senior director of food and drink research at Mintel, said: “The elevated cost of living has dampened sales of snacks.”Rules that forced supermarkets to display high fat and sugar foods in less prominent positions from October 2022 have also had an impact. The changes have not only made such snacks less handy to pick up but also prompted some big brands to change their recipes, making their snacks more healthy but sometimes less attractive to shoppers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those on the drugs also want foods that refresh the mouth and do not raise blood sugar levels, according to Roy.However, snacking is far from over. Analysts at the market research firm Mintel say young people are beginning to replace some meals with a snack, such as a yoghurt or protein drink. The value of sales is also growing as shoppers buy fewer – but pricier, better-quality – chocolates, for example.Ward at Kantar adds that the tough economic climate might revive demand, despite concerns about cost: “When times get tough, snacking is an affordable pleasure and we often see a bounce.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryFoodHealthWorking from homeCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

She remained under MI5 investigation until the day of her death.Rudd, who was autistic, had started showing signs of far-right radicalisation after being groomed by her mother’s boyfriend, Dax Mallaburn, a US neo-Nazi.She was arrested by counter-terrorism police after the FBI found that a second US white supremacist, named Chris Cook, had supplied her with instructions for making homemade bombs and weapons.A cache of WhatsApp messages revealed that Cook, then 28, had also encouraged Rudd to send him naked images of herself. He had described her as his “14-year-old girlfriend” to a friend, who responded that Rudd should be “taught properly”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She wore camouflage on Adolf Hitler’s birthday, the inquest heard. She was said by Witness A to have been a risk to herself and others.Counter-terrorism police had first begun investigating the teenager in September 2020 after her mother, Emily Carter, reported her concerns to Prevent, the anti-radicalisation programme.Rudd was arrested the following month and later charged at the age of 14 with downloading a bomb-making manual online and plotting a terrorist attack, becoming the youngest girl to be charged with terror offences in the UK.The charges were dropped when the Home Office concluded that Rudd had been a victim of trafficking who had been groomed and sexually exploited. She was found dead five months later.Witness A told the inquest that Rudd’s safety and history of self-harming was repeatedly discussed in meetings with counter-terrorism police but that she remained a risk. “We have to accept that minors can be threats,” he said.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Epstein replied “what character would you like next?”, to which Staley answered “Beauty and the Beast”.The court was shown notes taken by Higgins after a call with Bailey, in which the former is said to have declared “you have destroyed him,” in an apparent reference to Staley. “I don’t see any evidence of a lack of integrity,” the note adds.“I do remember a conversation along those lines, yes,” Bailey told the court.The conversations with Higgins were detailed in witness evidence, as Bailey took the stand at the upper tribunal.Bailey, who wore a dark suit and purple tie, was sat metres from Staley as he was cross-examined by Robert Smith KC, who is trying to overturn an FCA decision in 2023 to ban Staley from senior roles in the UK financial sector.That decision, which also cost Staley £18m in pay and bonuses at Barclays, came after an FCA investigation found he had misled the regulator after a Barclays letter from October 2019 said Epstein and Staley “did not have a close relationship”.Staley resigned in 2021 over the investigation’s preliminary findings, which were formally released in 2023.Staley’s lawyers are arguing that members of the bank’s board had been briefed on the extent of his ties with the late financier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three officers were due to face a misconduct meeting but the force postponed this.Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, two 19-year-old students, and Ian Coates, a 65-year-old caretaker, were killed by Calocane in June 2023.On Friday, the IOPC said it would reinvestigate whether Calocane’s previous history and an outstanding arrest warrant were seen by officers before the investigation was closed down.The watchdog said it had made its decision “after the force provided new evidence, which had not previously been available to the IOPC” and “representations by the bereaved families which led to further inquiries with Leicestershire police”.The IOPC’s director, Derrick Campbell, said: “Our sympathies remain with the families of Ian, Barnaby and Grace. We have received a number of representations from them, and we have responded as soon as we were in a position to provide the additional details requested. This is consistent with our policy to share evidence with interested parties so they can effectively participate in our investigations.“For a matter to be reopened by the IOPC it has to meet one or more criteria, including significant new information coming to light that requires further investigation.NHS staff may have illegally accessed records of Nottingham attack victimsRead more“That applies in this case, and after careful consideration of this new information we are carrying out further inquiries in respect of what officers actually saw on police systems about Calocane, and in particular an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Those who are closely impacted by our decision, including the bereaved families and the officers involved, have been notified and we will complete this work as quickly as possible.“Any decision on the disciplinary outcome of our investigation will only be made once the new evidence and the results of these inquiries have been analysed.“Our director general, Rachel Watson, has offered to meet with the families of Ian, Barnaby and Grace to discuss this development and any concerns they may have.”Last month the prime minister, Keir Starmer,told the familiesa judge-led public inquiry would take place in “a matter of weeks”. He said the inquiry would scrutinise a number of different agencies and a retired judge would soon be appointed to lead the process.Explore more on these topicsIndependent Office for Police ConductPoliceNottinghamEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

His sentence was reduced to four years.Daniel Shaw, Louise Lancaster, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu and Cressida Gethin originally received four-year jail terms for their involvement in the same protest. Shaw’s and Lancaster’s sentences were reduced to three years, while Whittaker De Abreu’s and Gethin’s sentences were reduced to 30 months.Gaie Delap, previously jailed for 20 months for her role in the protests on the M25, had her sentence reduced to 18 months.The other 10 protesters who were part of the mass appeal, including Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland, who were jailed for two years and 20 months respectively for throwing paint on Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting at the National Gallery, had their claims denied. Lawyers said they were considering an appeal to the supreme court.In a two-day hearing last month, the activists, who were jailed for taking part in various disruptive protests in 2022, argued that their trial judges had erred by failing to offer the usual leniency afforded to acts of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds.View image in fullscreenJust Stop Oil staged a series of protests around the M25 in 2022.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesIn a written judgment handed down after announcing the outcome, Lady Justice Carr, the lady chief justice, said the judge who originally jailed Hallam “was entirely justified in taking [a] serious view of [his] offending”.“However, we consider a sentence of five years’ imprisonment in Mr Hallam’s case to be manifestly excessive,” she added. Shaw’s and Lancaster’s sentences were reduced by the same amount to maintain the differential between them and Hallam.Whittaker de Abreu’s sentence was reduced in light of her good behaviour since her arrest for her part in the conspiracy, while in the case of Gethin, Carr said: “We accept her submission that [her] immaturity lowered her culpability.”The lawyer who represented many of the protesters, Raj Chada, the head of criminal defence at Hodge Jones & Allen, said: “The small reduction in the case of Roger Hallam recognises the extraordinarily excessive sentences that continue to be given out to protesters in England. It is, however, extremely disappointing that many of the other sentences were upheld.“No country in Europe gives such draconian sentences for peaceful protests, proving we are out of kilter with the rest of the civilised world. We are reviewing the judgment and considering an appeal to the supreme court.”In spite of the reductions, activists condemned the outcome, with more than 30 standing up in court, turning their backs on the judges and removing their jackets to reveal T-shirts saying “corruption in court”. In a statement, Just Stop Oil said the courts had been “captured, lock, stock and barrel by the powerful [and] the ultra wealthy”, adding: “These judges would be sending those who hid Anne Frank to the cattle trucks while hiding behind ‘the rule of law’.”View image in fullscreenJust Stop Oil activists protest outside the high court in London after the appeal verdicts.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesBut the environmental justice organisations Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace UK, which had supported the appellants’ case, described the partial victory as “an important win”, which “goes some way to improving the law for those sounding the alarm about the climate and nature crises”. But they called on the government to repeal the anti-protest legislation passed in recent years, under which some of the convictions were made.“Friends of the Earth is pleased that the court of appeal has reduced at least some of the climate activists’ sentences,” said Katie de Kauwe, a senior lawyer at Friends of the Earth.“We welcome the point of principle in today’s ruling that sentencing for peaceful protest needs to factor in both the defendant’s conscientious motivation, and protections afforded under the European convention on human rights. This is a positive development for the environmental movement as a whole, and for all peaceful movements holding the government to account.Areeba Hamid, a co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “This appeal has led to some important clarifications and a recognition that the trial judge was mistaken in denying the protesters the protection of certain legal rights and in discounting the conscientious nature of their motivations. But this ruling will not halt, let alone reverse, the UK’s slide towards authoritarianism that began under the last government but is being enthusiastically embraced by this one.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmental activismUK criminal justiceProtestJust Stop OilLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The cost of the second-class service is going up by 2p, or 2.4%, to 87p.In a statement Royal Mail blamed the need for price increases on rising costs. “We always consider price changes very carefully but the cost of delivering mail continues to increase,” said Nick Landon, its chief commercial officer. “A complex and extensive network of trucks, planes and 85,000 posties is needed to ensure we can deliver across the country for just 87p.”A decade ago Royal Mail was delivering 20bn letters a year but that has shrunk to 6.7bn and could drop to 4bn within four years. Over the same timeframe the number of addresses it serves has risen by 4m, meaning the cost of each delivery continues to rise, it said.Royal Mail wasfined more than £10min December by the postal regulator Ofcom for missing its delivery targets, as more than a quarter of first-class mail arrived late.The postal service has been pushing to reduce deliveries, and Ofcom has given provisional approval toallow Royal Mail to deliver second-class letters on alternate weekdaysand to stop Saturday deliveries. First-class letters would still be delivered six days a week under the plans. A final decision is expected in the summer.“Ofcom has recognised that reform is urgently needed to protect the one-price-goes-anywhere universal service which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters to about 32m UK addresses six days a week,” Landon said. “Reform will allow continued investment in the modernisation and transformation of the business to provide a more financially sustainable service.”The price rises come before big changes at the carrier. Its parent company, International Distribution Services, is being bought by the billionaire Czech energy tycoonDaniel Křetínský’s EP Groupin a£3.57bn deal.

Children were among those pepper sprayed unprovoked by police.In the wake of the incident,the French government, police and Uefa united to blame Liverpool supporters for the episode, claiming the chaos was caused by thousands seeking entry with fake tickets, reminiscent of the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster,when the deaths of 97 people were falsely blamed on fans of the club.The high court proceedings were brought in April 2023 by the law firm Leigh Day. Uefa then sought to block the cases being heard in Liverpool, using the common law Foreign Act of State doctrine, which is the principle that English courts will not inquire into the legality of acts by a foreign government.This application was heard in July 2024 and was rejected by the high court on Friday morning, which means personal injury claims will be able to be brought in the fans’ home city.One Hillsborough survivor said he feared for his life and was left with lasting flashbacks when held in a crowd by Paris police. Others suffered serious injury after being attacked and robbed by gangs of local men,which the victims alleged French police did little to stop.Many fans were so shaken by the experience they vowed not to return to France or to travel to a European away game in future.An independent review, commissioned by Uefa, found “the near miss experienced at the Champions League final was largely the result of poor planning, a lack of oversight of plans, poor interoperability between various stakeholders, and a lack of contingencies”.The report concluded that Uefa bore “primary responsibility”for the organisational and safety failures. Uefa disputes these conclusions.It says it hasalready settled some claimsby fans “without any admission of liability” and on confidential terms.In a statement after Friday’s hearing, Uefa said: “Today’s judgment says that it is too early in the proceedings to know whether Uefa’s position is correct or not. The judgment says that Uefa’s arguments will be revisited once more information is available.“This is the only remaining claim brought by Liverpool fans in relation to the 2022Champions Leaguefinal. The other two claims were resolved following discussions described by legal representatives of both sets of fans as ‘constructive’.”Clare Campbell, one of the personal injury solicitors representing some of the fans, said her clients were “delighted” the claims could proceed. “However, they have suffered significant delay due to the defendants’ attempt to prevent the claims being heard in the English courts – they now want their claims to be resolved as soon as possible in the hope that they can move on with their lives.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolUefaChampions LeagueHillsborough disasternewsShareReuse this content"

The first contract was awarded just one week after the Tory peer, Peter Gummer, whose peerage title is Lord Chadlington, approached Cameron. Chadlington was the chair and a shareholder in the parent company, Sumner Group Holdings (SGH), registered in Jersey.Emails and messages published by the inquiryin a written submission showed that Cameron gave Chadlington the phone number for another Tory peer, Andrew Feldman, a close friend of the former prime minister’s, who was advising the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on PPE procurement.On the same day Chadlington texted Feldman, writing: “Andrew. I work with company with PPE. D says you are helping. Shall I put you in touch? Peter.” Feldman replied positively, and gave Chadlington his new DHSC email address.Chadlington then sent an email introducing Feldman to David Sumner, the majority shareholder and chief executive of SGH, which was disclosed to the Guardian in response to a freedom of information request.“David,” Chadlington wrote, addressing Sumner, copying them both in. “This is my friend Andrew Feldman. He can help you with PPE we discussed this morning. Drop me off chain. Peter.”Sumner followed up by writing to Feldman offering to supply PPE, which Feldman forwarded to civil servants operating the “VIP lane”. Feldman told them it was: “An interesting offer from David Sumner, who was introduced to me by Lord Chadlington.”The emails published this week by theCovid inquiryshow that Sumner updated Chadlington, who replied with encouragement, telling Sumner on 21 April 2020: “Excellent. Looks like you have an inside track. Good luck.”On 26 April 2020, Chadlington wrote to Sumner: “I should … talk to DC [David Cameron] and to Feldman – they’ve been batting for us on this and I want to say thanks for support.”A week after Chadlington’s first approach to Cameron, the DHSC awarded SG Recruitment a contract for£23.9m, to supply coveralls. Then on 28 May 2020, the company was awarded a second contract,for £26.1m, to supply hand sanitiser.When the second contract was signed, Sumner sent a WhatsApp message to Chadlington, saying: “Hand sanitizer contract in and signed! $135m of revenue under contract from DHSC for the two contracts!” Chadlington replied saying: “Great news,” and indicated this would boost the company’s share price.The messages documenting Chadlington’s involvement were published ina written submission to the inquiryby the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, a group of 7,000 families whose relatives died of the coronavirus. The families’ barrister, Pete Weatherby KC, made severely critical remarks about the VIP lane.Chadlington’s involvement was investigated by the House of Lords commissioner for standards in 2022 and 2023, after reporting by the Guardian.Chadlington told the Lords commissioner in writing in August 2023: “I did not facilitate an introduction (I did not even name Mr Sumner or a company), and I did not seek to leverage my position as a member of the House of Lords. The extent of my involvement was to pass Lord Feldman’s email address to Mr Sumner.”In his evidence to the commissioner, and in letters from his lawyers in response to questions from the Guardian, Chadlington did not say that he had sent an email to Sumner, that directly copied in Feldman, to introduce them. That email has only become public now.The commissionercleared Chadlingtonboth times of breaking any rules that govern peers’ conduct.In their submission, the bereaved Covid families said: “Members of the public are … entitled to form their own views as to whether the correspondence disclosed to the inquiry in relation to this contract is consistent with the accounts provided by Lord Chadlington elsewhere.”In response to questions from the Guardian, Chadlington’s lawyers said: “Our client has been consistent in his communications to the House of Lords commissioner for standards and in this firm’s communications with you on his behalf. He provided Lord Feldman’s email address to Mr Sumner in his email of 19 April 2020. He did not endorse or in any way advocate on Mr Sumner’s behalf: he simply connected two people, and then removed himself from subsequent email exchanges.”The Covid inquiry has not yet published in full Chadlington’s communications referred to in the bereaved families’ submissions, or a witness statement he has made.A spokesperson for Lord Feldman confirmed that in April 2020 he had received Chadlington’s text and email, but said he did not recall any further communication. He denied “any suggestion that Lord Feldman was ‘batting for’ any particular supplier”. Cameron did not respond to an invitation to comment.The government has said thatit is in disputewith SG Recruitment over the non-fulfilment of one of the contracts. Despite the £50m PPE deals, in December 2023 the company, which had been renamed,was put into liquidation, owing unpaid taxes to HMRC. The parent company went into liquidation in October 2022. Chadlington had resigned as a director in April 2021.The UK Anti-Corruption Coalition said in its evidence to the inquiry this week that it had found no other country that gave priority for Covid contracts to politically connected companies.Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryHealth policyNHSDavid CameronHealthCoronavirusConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

It could serve as a beachhead for his other business ambitions in IndiaHannah Ellis-Petersenin DelhiFri 7 Mar 2025 05.16 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 05.48 ESTShareIt is easy to believe that Elon Musk’s reach knows no limits. But while theworld’s richest manmay control a space satellite empire, own one of the largest social media platforms, produce the world’s bestselling electric car, and have been given carte blanche by Donald Trump to gut the US government, there is one market that Musk has yet to properly crack: India.Now, with his newfound influence over the Trump administration and global geopolitics, it appears likely that Musk’s entrance into the Indian market, both with hisTeslaelectric cars and his Starlink satellite internet, may come smoother and faster than expected.When the Indian prime minister,Narendra Modi, travelled to Washington to meet Trump earlier this month, he also sat down privately with Musk, where according to the Indian government, the pair “discussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and US entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development”.Trump put it more bluntly: “I assume he [Musk] wants to do business inIndia.”Up till now, India’s 110% tariffs on imported electric vehicles have prevented Tesla from entering the fast-growing Indian market. However, Musk vowed last year that Tesla would be in India “as soon as humanly possible” – and after his recent encounter with Modi, it seems he is keen to make that a reality.Tesla has already begun advertising for jobs in Mumbai and Delhi, and has signed a lease to open its first showroom in Mumbai. Tesla could also take advantage of a new Indian government scheme that lowers import tariffs on electric vehicles to just 15% if they commit to investing $500m within three years in a factory that will manufacture the cars. However, the tax break applies only to the first 8,000 vehicles, a limit Tesla is likely to push back on.A Tesla factory would be a boon for India, a country that is desperate for foreign investment and job creation, particularly in manufacturing. Nonetheless, Musk has a chequered record for his commitments to investing in India. Last year, he left the Modi government reeling after he made high-profile plans to travel to India, and had dangled the possibility of a $3bn investment to build a Tesla factory in the country, only to cancel the trip at the last minute. Instead, he travelled to rival China – another huge market that Musk has been equally keen to capitalise on – to cut a major deal.View image in fullscreenElon Musk at the opening of the Tesla factory in Berlin, Germany, in 2022.Photograph: Patrick Pleul/APTesla also faces stiff competition from Indian manufacturers, who are already making and selling popular electric SUVs for about a quarter of the £35,000 starting price that a Tesla costs, which would be far above the budget of most Indian families. (Sales of Tesla cars are also plummeting globally, with a45% decline in Europein January.)Trump, too, has appeared less enthusiastic about Musk’s ambitions to start making Teslas in India. “Now, if he built the factory in India, that’s OK, but that’s unfair to us. It’s very unfair,” Trump told Fox News.Another possibly more lucrative finger in India’s pie for Musk could be Starlink, the satellite internet technology operated by hisSpaceXcompany. Globally, Musk already has a dominant lead on satellite internet, with more than half of all satellites in the skies.Since 2021, he has been fixated on getting Starlink into India. While the current appetite for satellite internet in India is tiny, it is expected to grow to a $1.9bn (£1.5bn) market by 2030 according to Deloitte and is seen as a crucial entry point into India’s flourishing telecomms industry.Speaking to reporters earlier this year, after Trump’s inauguration, at which Musk was highly prominent, India’s communications minister confirmed that Starlink was in the process of seeking necessary security permissions to operate in India.Jyotiraditya Scindia said: “When you check all the boxes, you get the licence. If they [Starlink] do that, we will be very happy.”Yet in India, telecoms, including satellite internet, are among the most strictly regulated and controlled industries in India, placing vast obstacles in the way of foreign companies such as Musk’s being granted security permissions to operate.Smuggled Starlink devices allegedly used to defy India’s internet shutdownsRead moreIn particular, Musk’s close connections and business interests in China and the use of Starlink in the Ukraine war were seen as possibly insurmountable cybersecurity issues, as well as the ability of SpaceX to be able to control access to Starlink’s satellite internet from outside the country. The Indian governmentunder Modi has routinely ordered internet providers to block critical online content andused internet blackoutsas a means of information control.These fears could be heightened after sources in the Indian state of Manipur, which borders Myanmar,told the Guardian earlier this year that Starlink was already being usedby militant groups in the state to circumvent regular internet shutdowns being imposed after outbreaks of ethnic violence.A recent Indian thinktank report warned that Starlink was a “wolf in sheep’s clothing”, citing its use by US intelligence agencies and military, and warned of its potential to be used to undermine Indian security.Yet, after the election of Trump, some believe that the Indian government may be more willing to side-step those concerns. “I think before the US election results came through, India would have had their doubts about giving Musk’s Starlink security clearance,” said Nikhil Pahwa, the founder of MediaNama, an Indian tech news platform.“One of the things that India relies on is control over internet access and control over its operators. But now that Musk is a part of the US government, his leverage in India has certainly increased and his chances of Starlink clearing security approvals have probably improved dramatically – or at least will happen much faster.”View image in fullscreenStarlink could provide satellite internet to rural areas but some have raised fears it could be used to undermine Indian security.Photograph: Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto/ShutterstockPahwa said the decision on Starlink by the Indian government was now “as much of a political decision as a security decision”.What’s been called “Starlink diplomacy” – opening up the country to Musk’s satellites in an apparent attempt to gratify the Trump administration – has already been evident in neighbouring Bangladesh, where this week the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, suddenly extended an invitation for Musk to launch Starlink in the country within 90 days.Even prior to the re-election of Trump, the Indian government had already made manoeuvres favourable to Starlink’s ambitions. In October, the government announced that satellite spectrum for broadband would be allocated administratively rather than through auction, something that Musk had lobbied hard for. “We will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink,” said Musk on X in response.The decision means that Starlink has a far better opportunity to compete against Indian telecoms companies in the battle for control over the country’s satellite internet market. It was met with anger by some of the country’s biggest operators, such as Jio, who also have vast ambitions in the satellite internet space, and have since been lobbying the government to reverse its decision on the auction.One of the main benefits of satellite internet is that it can offer internet access even in the most remote areas. However, in India, most people living in rural areas are unlikely to be able to afford it, unless at heavily subsidised prices.Prasanto K Roy, a technology analyst, said it could set off a pricing war with India’s biggest telecom operators if Starlink repeated what it has done in Africa with heavily reduced pricing, where Starlink costs about $10 compared with $120 in the US. Jio, whose success in mobile internet came from undercutting every competitor, making India’s mobile internet some of the cheapest in the world, is likely to follow suit.“Starlink won’t find it as easy in India as it has in other markets, there is very strong competition here so it will be hard for it to gain a monopoly, even with low prices,” said Roy.He added: “Those using Starlink are obviously going to be a very tiny niche at the top of the socioeconomic pyramid. But once he’s got a hold, it is something Musk could really leverage in India.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaElon MuskNarendra ModiSpaceXTelecommunications industryTeslaTrade and developmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Initially at least, it was generating some power and sending information to Earth as engineers worked to make sense of data showing an “incorrect attitude”.On Friday, however, IM declared Athena dead.“With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge,” it saidin a statementconfirming that the 15ft (4.6 meter) spacecraft was on its side.“The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.”The failure of Athena, which was packed with scientific probes and experiments that Nasa was relying on as it prepares to send astronauts back to the moon for the first time since 1972, was almost identical to IM’s first moon landing in February 2024.The Odysseus spacecraft became the first private mission to reach the moon, butskidded across the surface, broke a leg and toppled over. Athena had the same tall, thin design that some experts had feared could lead to a repeat of the accident.Lost with the Athena lander were hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment, including Nasa’sTrident regolith drill, which was to have excavated soil in a search for water and other life-supporting constituents.The lander also carried three robotic mobile probes, one of which, the mobile autonomous prospecting platform (Mapp), built by the Colorado company Lunar Outpost, was the first commercially built rover to reach the moon.Athena’s scheduled 10-to-14-day mission, known as IM-2, was one of 10 contracted by Nasa’s $2.6bn commercial lunar payload services (CLPS) program to encourage private industry to fly experiments and other equipment to the moon in advance of the arrival of the crewed Artemis 3 mission, currently scheduled for mid-2027.Another was the successful landing on Sunday of Firefly Aerospace’sBlue Ghost Mission 1, which touched down near Mons Latreille, in Mare Crisium on the moon’s north-eastern near side.Painting Athena’s failure in a more positive light, the IM statement said its arrival marked “the most southernmost lunar landing and surface operations ever achieved”.“This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,” it said.“This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.”Explore more on these topicsSpaceThe moonnewsShareReuse this content"

Tenorio did not have legal custody of Reyes, who was in the care of her father at the time of the kidnapping, police said.New Haven police and theFBIobtained a felony arrest warrant for Tenorio, who was suspected to have fled with her daughter toMexico, police said. Andrea’s father traveled to Mexico several times but did not make contact with either of them.Atlanta child missing for seven years found safe in ColoradoRead moreThe missing persons case went cold until 2023, when a police detective began to re-investigate Andrea’s abduction.“Using a combination of interviews, search warrants and social media,” detective Kealyn Nivakoff determined that Reyes was residing in the Mexican city of Puebla – with a population of more than 1 million people – after her abduction by Tenorio, police said.Advanced DNA testing confirmed the relationship between Reyes and her father, who were finally able to reconnect after more than two decades.“Over the years, Andrea’s father searched tirelessly, but never heard from his daughter or her mother,” the DNA testing company Othram, which was involved in the case, said in anews release.The identification of Reyes was part of an initiative to resolve more than 500 cases involving minors and contained in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, the company said.“This case reflects the hard work of our officers and detectives,” the New Haven police chief, Karl Jacobson, said. “While cases may have investigative leads exhausted at the time, no cold case is ever truly closed.“We remain committed to resolving every cold case, and this is a perfect example of that effort.”Reyes, who is now 27 years old, is a resident ofMexico, Othram said. An arrest warrant for Tenorio remains active and valid within the United States, according to police, adding that they believe the kidnapping suspect is still in Mexico.Explore more on these topicsConnecticutUS crimeMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In his first term in office, Trump’s first foreign visit was to Saudi Arabia, a country with ambitions to be a major diplomatic player despite its horrific human rights record, includingthe kidnap and murderof thejournalist Jamal Khashoggiin 2018.For his part, Trump sees a normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel as the key prize in his attempts to forge a region-wide peace deal after the signing ofthe Abraham accords– bilateral normalisation agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – which he pursued during his first term but which have done little to improve security in the Middle East.If the ties between Trump and his circle and Saudi Arabia have long been close in terms of diplomacy and business, more concerning are perceptions of Prince Mohammed’s proximity to Moscow andVladimir Putin.In recent years, the prince – who is reportedly fascinated by Putin and his grip on power in Russia – has moved closer to the Russian president’s orbit. According to some analysts, he was given a key role in two prisoner exchanges between Russia and the US, including one involvingthe journalist Evan Gershkovichlast year.That warm relationship began in 2015 when Prince Mohammed visited the Russian president in St Petersburg, and Putin then visited Saudi Arabia in 2023.The relationship between Moscow and Riyadh has grown ever more important, as Jens Heibach and Luíza Cerioli pointed out inan essayfor the Contemporary Security Policy journal last year that explained Saudi Arabia’s long-term reluctance to criticise Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia, they wrote, was Riyadh’s “pivotal partner” within the wider Opec+ and “an important pillar of its foreign-policy diversification strategy”.They added: “On one hand, Saudi Arabia voted in favour of adopting key resolutions of the United Nations general assembly on [the war in Ukraine], including those condemning Russia’s illegal use of force against, and its illegal referendums and annexations in,Ukraine. On the other hand, the kingdom avoided seriously encroaching on Russia’s interests by refusing to isolate it diplomatically.”Significantly, as Heibach and Cerioli noted, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022: “Saudi Arabia continued to cooperate with Russia within Opec+ and, on October 5, 2022, led the group’s decision to cut oil production by 2m barrels per day, increasing global oil prices and, implicitly, Russian revenues.“In doing so, Saudi Arabia rebuffed [the Biden administration’s] pleas to use its central position within Opec + to lower oil prices. This decision strained Saudi relations with the United States, which was also dissatisfied with Riyadh’s eventual official stance on the Ukraine crisis.”That closeness has continued. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia hosted Russian and US delegations – though with Kyiv significantly absent – to discuss a Ukraine peace deal, a major reversal of the Biden administration’s efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically.Set against that, however, is the fact that Saudi Arabia also hosted a two-day peace summit on Ukraine in 2023 with representatives from more than 40 countries, although some sceptics noted that was as much about laundering Saudi Arabia’s international reputation.And if Ukraine feels comfortable holding talks in Jeddah it is because of the personal connections of the country’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, who has his own lines to Saudi Arabia through his former business connections as an investment banker.Orysia Lutsevych, the deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia programme at the Chatham House thinktank in London, said those and other links between Saudi Arabia and Ukraine meant there was a degree of trust.“I think it’s a bit of a myth about neutral places for negotiations. Practically, you need to find an actor or a mediator that has a stake or a connection to both parties to have trust,” she said.“Ukrainians have always thought that the Middle East could be [a] counterweight and invested in relations with the global south, arguing that it is a global war because it has had global consequences.”Lutsevych added that Saudi Arabia owned one of the largest agricultural companies in Ukraine, suggesting it may have a “pragmatic interest”.“One of the Saudis’ motivations [in hosting the talks] is to lend a hand to Trump,” she said. “But the bigger risk for Zelenskyy and Ukraine remains Trump himself – the risk of America siding with the Russian agenda. The location doesn’t change that.”Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaUkraineMohammed bin SalmanVladimir PutinRussiaUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

We do not need to be in a hurry and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.”US job market grows amid threats of mass federal layoffs and Trump tariffsRead morePowell spoke at a volatile time, with stock markets and bond yields both declining in the wake of Donald Trump’swhiplash announcementsof steep import tariffs on major trading partners Mexico and Canada, followed by delays in implementing them. Trump has also doubled tariffs on imports from China.Though Powell said the economy “continues to be in a good place”, he added: “It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.”Still, key indicators remain solid, Powell added, with ongoing, if uneven, progress on inflation and continued job gains.With the US government on Friday reporting job growth of151,000 in February, Powell noted the economy has been adding a “solid” 191,000 jobs a month since September.Some measures of short-term inflation expectations have moved higher, Powell said, but “most measures of longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2% inflation goal”.Whether inflation slows faster than expected or the economy does start to weaken, “our current policy stance is well positioned” to respond, he said.The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the current 4.25%-4.50% range at its 18 and 19 March policy meeting. Policymakers will also issue new economic projections that will give insight into how the first two months of the Trump administration have influenced the outlook for inflation, employment, growth and the path of interest rates.Investors have begun taking the possibility of an economic slowdown more seriously, and now expect the Fed to approve three quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of this year.Reuters contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyJerome PowellUS interest ratesInflationUS unemployment and employment statisticsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

In this solo(ish) triple bill, Royal Ballet principalNatalia Osipovasteps into the shoes of two great female icons of modern dance, Martha Graham and Isadora Duncan, perhaps absorbing some of their pioneering spirit along the way.In Graham’s Errand Into the Maze, Osipova is quelling demons – explicitly Marcelino Sambé’s Minotaur, but inner ones too – with the power of her mighty ankle-to-ear kicks. It is a dance of strength and sharp accents, geometry and gravity, and Osipova’s character simmers with power as well as trepidation. Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan is a homage by Frederick Ashton, presented here in a new film by Grigory Dobrygin, spiritedly shot and beautifully lit. A handheld camera chases Osipova under a flowing chiffon scarf, capturing her giddiness and wild freedom while closeup detail sees the vulnerability at heart. The voluptuousness of the movement is womanly but there’s a childlike quality too, in its abandon and in the certainty of one’s own presence at the centre of the world. It’s a film that does the ballet justice.View image in fullscreenQuelling demons … Osipova with Marcelino Sambé in Martha Graham’s Errand Into the Maze.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianNatalia’s night: Royal Ballet puts the spotlight on Osipova – in picturesRead moreSo that’s the first half of Osipova’s offering. The second half diverges eccentrically from the historical into something of right now. Jo Strømgren is a Norwegian choreographer, playwright and director whose The Exhibition is a piece of comic dance theatre. Two people arrive in a gallery: a well-groomed Osipova and the scruffier Christopher Akrill. She speaks Russian, he English. There’s mischief and misunderstanding and the two are drawn into an odd relationship which is hampered and enhanced by their inability to understand each other.You never know where the piece is going, but it engagingly dances around themes of connection, prejudice, art and beauty, and what the body can and cannot say. Even if you can’t understand Osipova’s words there is a naturalism and cheeky character to her animated chatter. We know she’s a good dance-actor, but speech is something different. It’s a surprising swerve for Osipova, a statement about who she is, or might want to be as a performer. It’s a triple bill that honours past legends while telling us that Osipova is determined to be her own artist.At theLinbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, until 10 MarchExplore more on these topicsDanceNatalia OsipovaRoyal BalletRoyal Opera HouseBalletreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some said they had been forced to sell their houses or spend their life savings. Senior industry figures estimated thousands were affected.A producer with more than 20 years’ experience was working in a pub. Another with seven years’ experience was doing temporary labour work. Other seasoned professionals had taken roles including working at supermarket checkouts, as classroom assistants and tour guides. Another said he was “having to sell my home and retrain due to the lack of work”.One producer formerly on a six-figure salary who has been living off savings said: “You could fill a stadium with everyone that’s been affected. I see articles about factory closures when 100 people lose their jobs, and it makes national news. It’s 40 times worse for the film and TV industry right now and nobody seems to notice.”Almost a fifth of industry freelancers said they were out of work and had worked for fewer than three months out of the last 12, according to a recent survey by the Film and TV Charity. Online groups containing thousands of people have been set up to help thoseneeding to switch careers.A series of factors have created what insiders describe as a genuine industry crisis, including a post-Covid production slowdown. The industry is also at the sharp end of huge changes in viewing habits, with rising numbers of people watching far cheaper online content via YouTube, reducing advertising revenues.There have been record declines in the reach of broadcast TV,according to the regulator Ofcom, and individual show viewing figures have been hit. More than 4.7 million people watched ITV2’s Love Island on TV sets in 2019, according to the ratings body Barb, while last year’s premiere peaked at 2.2 million viewers. The figures do not include those viewing on other platforms.While streamers such as Amazon and Netflix make expensive shows, their resources are aimed largely at big US dramas and they have pulled back from working with British broadcasters. Shows such as Bridgerton, much of which is shot in the UK, are not made at the same rate as on terrestrial TV. Spending on co-productions fell to £19.6m last year, down nearly 60% on the £48.3m in 2022, according to the British Film Institute.Cheaper, unscripted programming, such as reality shows, quizshows and panel shows that once populated TV listings, appear to be worst affected. Insiders say broadcasters have turned away from this “squeezed middle” of programmes in favour of expensive dramas. Some blame a lack of risk-taking by programme commissioners.Ali Carron, a producer in scripted drama and comedy who has worked on shows including Only Fools and Horses, and Juice, said it had “never been like this”. Having championed working-class access into the television world, she feared the current issues would make it impossible to retain such talent.“For the first time ever, I’ve had almost no work for about 15 months,” she said. “I’ve used all my savings now. People are broke. Some people have been unemployed for two years. It’s thousands and thousands of talented, experienced people.”Steven D Wright, a former Channel 4 commissioner and producer, said there was an “existential crisis” in which viewers were beginning to notice fewer new ideas. “It really is not getting better, it is dying,” he said. “Most of the industry is now unemployed. There’s no support network. And if you’ve got kids and the mortgage, you have to take a job as a shelf-stacker.”While some in the industry have said commissioning has improved slightly since last year, most are expecting 2025 to remain tough. Amelia Brown, the head of Fremantle UK, one of the bigger independent production companies, told an industry event recently: “The old business model doesn’t really exist any more … There’s a lot of adjustment that has to come from even the bigger players. I would say 2025 is still going to be another year of adjustment.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryTelevisionWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

But Minnitt is the first to distil it into a single comedy character, and to make it far funnier than we have any right to expect – not by doubling down on period pastiche, but by making her alter ego both none-more-Regency and thrillingly 21st century too.The character debuted in 2022 and Minnitt, 28, has been threatening to retire her for a while. But demand never quite goes away and a UK tour now beckons for a character her creator didn’t initially envisage as a comedy act at all. Lady Clementine’s genesis took place under lockdown. “Everyone had lost their minds a bit,” says Minnitt, a graduate of Durham University, where she performed with the Durham Revue. “And I had lost a bit of confidence in myself. I was working in a bar, then in a summer camp, then for a charity. Then I lost my job and was on furlough. I didn’t know what I was doing with my life. I was lost and directionless. Then I went through a breakup – classic!” She rolls her eyes. “So I was like, ‘I need to put this energy into something.’ And it was this.”It manages to be achingly of-the-moment too, with as many references to Reddit as riding cropsInitially, it was just an impulse, half an idea with no outlet. “I’ve always loved history,” she says, “and at the time there was this idea of‘girlboss’history. Anne Boleyn was a girlboss, all of that. But I liked the idea of a historical figure that was vaguely uninspiring and caught within the traps of her own era’s patriarchy.”Minnitt was struck by the fascination with all things Austen, more so perhaps because she’s a part-outsider to Englishness. The daughter of teachers, she spent much of her childhood in Belgium before moving to Wiltshire. “We live in an age where people are obsessed with not living in the present. They’re either looking for an escape to the future, or fantasy, or the past. And we’re romanticising things. I find that fascinating. So it was a perfect storm of these strands, and of people feeling dissatisfied with their love lives. All of that came together in this quite weird patchwork show.”View image in fullscreen‘Joyous in an extremely female way’ … Minnitt.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIt’s a patchwork that needs to be encountered to be fully understood. “It very much started as a parody/spoof,” says Minnitt, who was inspired by an “insane” handbook she found in a charity shop advising Edwardian women on how to find a spouse. But it didn’t stay that one-dimensional: “I didn’t want to be making knowing winks to genres all the time.”The show, which follows Clementine manically hunting down a husband before that most terminal of deadlines, her 27th birthday, makes hay with corseted costume-drama stereotype: the decorousness, the snobbery, the deeply repressed subtext. But it also artfully fudges the particular period Minnitt is dramatising, as Clementine’s Austen-alike backdrop blurs with every other period in which a woman’s liberty was put out to market, her self-worth pegged to her age, attractiveness and whatever assurances she may have from this or that tailcoated beau.Hmm, you think, that doesn’t soundsodifferent from 2025. Reader, you’d better believe Minnitt is wise to that too. Her coup with Clementine – a sleeper hit at the Edinburgh fringe two summers back – was to cross-fertilise a period parody French and Saunders might have attempted with the achingly of-the-moment standup pioneered byKate Berlant,Catherine Cohenand a generation of comics capturing always-online life and its endless neurotic identity curation. So this great time-bending whirlwind of a show contains as many references to Reddit and Instagram as to riding crops and perfumed billets-doux.The result feels like a fantasia on feminism and female identity through the ages. It was greeted, when I saw it at Soho theatre, by great gales of laughter, of the type generated only when a show touches more than just a funny bone, but a deep nerve too. “It can get feral,” says its creator. “It can feel like I’ve whipped the mob up and I can’t control it!”View image in fullscreenNext stop Les Mis … Minnitt as her alter ego.Photograph: Sonja HorsmanBut if the response can be unwieldy, it’s thrilling too. “It feels joyous, in an extremely female way. I’ve spoken to audience members who are like, ‘It’s girly, it’s childlike, it’s about being a woman but it’s not sexualised. It’s about being silly.’ I got a message from someone that said, ‘If someone asked me why I like being a girl, I’d tell them to go see this show.’ I loved that. That’s why I’m doing this.”The show’s continuing success seems so deserved, and assured, that it’s startling to hear Minnitt describe the difficulties she had making it happen – and asserting herself in comedy. A few years and one hit show into her career, she still feels like an outsider, not always welcomed by the industry. “I think people don’t like stuff that feels like chick lit. That’s why some of the industry reception has been a little bit cold. It can be a difficult sell to a male audience.”At any rate, she says: “I still feel impostor syndrome. I’m struggling to find my feet and where to put my energy. If you have a successful show, you’re expected to know how to do everything, which is quite difficult. But I’m coming to terms with that.”Part of coming to terms with it is taking Clementine on the road. This (memo to anyone who thinks Edinburgh fringe success means Fleabag glory) is not a glamorous process. “For the next two months,” says Minnitt, “I’m going to work three jobs so I can afford to dohalfthe dates I wanted to do. And my mum’s doing the driving for me. I’ve had to get her involved to cut down costs.”View image in fullscreen‘Mostly, I just want to make stuff that’s silly’... Minnitt.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianShe is also marking out next steps – for the Clementine character, and for her own career. Minnitt writes for CBBC, recently appeared in cult comicJordan Brookes’s faux-musical Fontanelle, and has a guest role inthe new Alan Partridge series, How Are You? (in which “the satirical broadcaster checks in on the mental health of the nation”). AlongsideJohn Shuttleworth, say, andCount Arthur Strong, Partridge’s is a face on the (typically male) Mount Rushmore of character comedy: an exemplar (or maybe a warning) of what a career that’s dedicated to the lifelong performance of a comical alter ego might look like. Is that a path Minnitt can see herself taking?“When I look at people who are more experienced, I do think I should apply the same rigour to my character,” she says. “What does she do? What doesn’t she do? It’s so fun to have all those rules for your world. I don’t know why everyone doesn’t do character comedy: it’s so much more fun than standup.”Rosalie Minnitt: Clementine review – a frilly-bonneted comedy for todayRead moreAs we speak in London on the eve of her tour, she is already planning a new show for Clementine. “I’d like to put her in a revolution show, a Les Mis parody. That would be so fun.” And not too hard, you’d think, for a performer already used to whipping up her crowds into a riotous mob. “I want her to go to the city, too, and for that to have a Dickensian energy. But mostly, I just want to make stuff that’s funny and silly. That has always been my guiding principle.”In the meantime, as the ground shifts ever more turbulently under feminism, Minnitt is just excited to be getting her delusional, delightful and neurotic alter ego back on stage. “It feels so hard to be a woman in this year and this age – it’s more complicated than it used to be. There’s a lot of pressure that we don’t quite know how to name yet. But Clementine is a great vessel for exploring that. The show will always change, because the world is changing. It’s a great mirror to what is going on now.”Rosalie Minnitt: Clementine is atShakespeare North Playhouse, Prescot, on 8 March,then touringExplore more on these topicsComedyFeminismWomeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Why this is, and whether it lessens the stigma of such work, is an open questionFri 7 Mar 2025 10.57 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 12.57 ESTShareAnora emerged triumphant from last week’s Academy Awards presentation, winning five Oscars including best actress forMikey Madisonfor her performance as Ani, a sex worker who elopes with the feckless son of a Russian oligarch, only to find herself at odds with his powerful family and their henchmen. As in his previous films, writer-director Sean Baker shows generosity and affection for the marginalised characters, and especially for its heroine. Even when she gets roughed up, it’s played for laughs and you’re confident she won’t meet one of the sad fates of screen sex workers of yore, such as Louise Brooks as Lulu, stabbed to death in Pandora’s Box, or Vivien Leigh as Myra, who throws herself under a lorry in Waterloo Road.Madison said in her acceptance speech, “I also just want to again recognise and honour the sex worker community. I will continue to support and be an ally.” However, members of the East London Strippers Collectiveweren’t impressedby Anora. “We didn’t see any of, like, who she really is as a person,” said Maddie, who went on to admit it was a step in the right direction. “But if they had gone just a little bit further and said: ‘We need full decriminalisation now,’ that could have actually had a much bigger impact.”But if you want to see more about sex workers’ lives on screen you have only to check out the history of the Academy Awards, first given out in 1929. The original best actress award went to Janet Gaynor for her performance as the “street angel” in Street Angel, with Gloria Swanson nominated the same year for playing a “fallen woman” in Sadie Thompson. In the 97 years of the Oscars’ existence, best actress or best supporting actress awards have gone to actors playing sex workers 16 times, from Elizabeth Taylor in BUtterfield 8 to Jane Fonda in Klute, to last year’s winner Emma Stone, who has a jolly old time working in a Parisian brothel inPoor Things. And that’s not even counting the nominations for, say, Greta Garbo in Camille, Shirley MacLaine in Irma la Douce or Julie Christie in McCabe & Mrs Miller.Sixteen best actress or best supporting actress Oscars have gone to actors playing sex workersI haven’t totted up how many times women have been nominated for performances as, for example, architects or witches, but looking at the statistics, it’s clear that Hollywood has for decades acknowledged sex work as a viable career. Or just as viable as being a hitman, another of those “exotic” jobs its film-makers keep returning to. There are some films about sex workers’ lives that could be described as social-realist – Lukas Moodysson’s heartbreakingLilya 4-Everfrom 2002 springs to mind, as does Chantal Akerman’s 1975 filmJeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080, Bruxelles, which topped Sight and Sound magazine’s 2022 critics’ poll of the greatest films ever made.View image in fullscreenOld professional … Louise Brooks as Lulu in Pandora’s Box.Photograph: Ronald GrantBut such unflinching depictions are a long way from mainstream Hollywood, which prefers its sex workers portrayed as fairytale princesses who have fallen on hard times, exemplified by Pretty Woman, for which Julia Roberts, of course, was Oscar-nominated. It’s an aspirational blueprint: sell yourself on Hollywood Boulevard and you too can snag a millionaire. Having excised the dark elements and downbeat ending of its original script, Pretty Woman has been described as a modern-day Cinderella story.Anora, in turn, has been called the anti-Pretty Woman – though it still manages to be shiny and upbeat, with Ani showing the sort of smiling-through-tears resilience exhibited by Elisabeth Shue in Leaving Las Vegas.Why is the Academy so fond of sex worker performances anyway? Is it that they are considered courageous in a world that still looks down its nose at the oldest profession while pretending not to? Or are some male film-makers so unfamiliar with women from other walks of life that their most deeply considered female characters, when they bother to include any, tend to be on the game? Sex workers, mostly female but sometimes male as well, were a recurring feature of the New Hollywood in the 1970s, when the Hays Code had given way to so-called sexual liberation, and every movie brat except Steven Spielberg inserted at least one prostitute into their films.‘We didn’t see who she is’: Anora missed chance to spark real change, say sex workersRead more“It’s male projections of the kind of women they think they’d like. And for actresses it’s a juicy role, a stretch, a chance to be bad and desirable and rebellious,” film critic Molly Haskellsaid in the New York Times in 1996, the year of nominations for Shue in Leaving Las Vegas, Sharon Stone playing a former sex worker in Casino, and Mira Sorvino, who won best supporting actress for her performance as a dim-witted sex worker in Woody Allen’s Mighty Aphrodite. The rollcall of actors who have seized that chance is extensive, from Jodie Foster (Taxi Driver) and Kim Basinger (LA Confidential) to Charlize Theron (Monster), Anne Hathaway (Les Misérables) and Naomie Harris (Moonlight).Sam, another member of the East London Stripper’s Collective, says that, with more people entering sex work these days for economic reasons, “we are already in a culture where I think we are quite destigmatised.” Indeed, as the economy becomes ever more precarious, perhaps sex work will soon be seen as a career more viable than, say, journalism. Kudos to the Academy Awards for showing us the way.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnoraSex workOscarsAwards and prizesMikey MadisoncommentShareReuse this content"

Composed of an all-Native cast, it ruminated on power, storytelling, dispossession, erasure and historical memory. The novel’s off-the-wall structure placed its central event – a mass shooting at an Oakland powwow – at the book’s end, leaving its aftermath largely unattended.Now comes an emotionally incandescent and structurally riveting second novel, Wandering Stars. A companion to There There, it brings news about Orvil Red Feather, who was hit by a bullet while dancing at the event. It tells, too, the story of Orvil’s younger brothers Loother and Lony; their great-aunt Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield, in whose care they have been since losing their drug-addicted mother to suicide; and Jacquie Red Feather, Opal’s half-sister and the boys’ estranged “real grandma”, a recovering alcoholic.Wandering Stars asks: what becomes of a person and a family when the things they inherit from their forebears are overwhelmingly the bad stuff – wounds and torments, ill luck, curses and injurious predilections? What kind of life is possible after genocide and colonisation? Toni Morrison once said: “A writer’s life and work are not a gift to mankind; they are its necessity.” Hyperbole be damned: Orange’s work feels, to me, as vital as air.Yagnishsing Dawoor£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseCrime fictionNot-to-be-missed treatDown Cemetery RoadMick HerronDown Cemetery RoadMick HerronNot-to-be-missed treatIf you’re one of the many who love Mick Herron’s Jackson Lamb novels, but missed his previous series, starring the Oxford-based private investigator Zoë Boehm, never fear: the first in the sequence and Herron’s debut, Down Cemetery Road, is about to be adapted by Apple TV (starring Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson). Handily, it’s being reissued by its publisher and is a not-to-be-missed treat.This novel is less about Zoë than her partner, Joe, who is called on by an Oxford housewife, Sarah, to investigate when a house on her street explodes, killing two adults. Sarah becomes obsessed with what has happened to their young daughter, as no one else seems interested, and asks Joe to help. “I won’t lie. Philip Marlowe, I’m not. But who is? Most of what I’m hired to do, I manage,” he tells her. As they dig deeper, they discover all sorts of nefarious government goings-on (this is Mick Herron, after all), and we see a side of Sarah she’d previously kept hidden. “Inside, Sarah was storms and hurricanes. Twisters. Summer madness.” Herron’s incisive portraits, of everyone from Sarah’s awful husband, Mark, to her hippy friend, Wigwam, are as pitch perfect as ever, and even if you’ve read this series before, it’s worth reminding yourself of its excellence.Alison Flood£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseAutobiographyVoice of the leftA Woman Like MeDiane AbbottA Woman Like MeDiane AbbottVoice of the leftThere is a sense of poetic justice in seeing Diane Abbott back in parliament after the 2024 election. She is now Mother of the House – the title given to the longest serving female MP – and all those who plotted to block her from standing must watch as she receives the respect she deserves. After enduring so much racism, and at a time of few political wins for the left, we have to ask: how did Abbott end up having the last laugh?Her autobiography offers some clues. Born to working-class Jamaican parents in 1953, she was clearly always both strong-willed and intellectually gifted. Which is not to say she didn’t have to work hard: early signs of her determination include insisting to her teachers that she apply to Cambridge, swotting up on Latin for the entrance exam, and beating considerable odds by winning a place from her state school. After graduation she entered the Home Office as part of the civil service fast stream, and made history in 1987 as the first Black woman MP.But this book is far more than just a list of her achievements. Inside its pages are 70 years of Black British history, and four decades of political ups and downs, encompassing Thatcher, Kinnock, Blair, Brown, Corbyn, and Starmer. Among other things she recounts how the left took charge of the Greater London Council under Ken Livingstone, the New Cross house fire in 1981 and the organising across the Black community that followed, as well as resistance to the Iraq war. History, they say, is written by the victors. But as this book and Abbott’s career show – history, as written by the underdogs, can be powerfully inspiring.Faiza Shaheen£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA history of violenceA Very Private SchoolCharles SpencerA Very Private SchoolCharles SpencerA history of violenceMaidwell Hall school, Northamptonshire, 1972. The chief abuser is the headmaster, Jack Porch, who keeps two canes in his study, the Flick and the Switch, and patrols the school dorms at night in hope of catching pupils talking – in which case, he’ll pull any culprits over his knee and whack them with a slipper. Next comes Mr Maude, who forces boys to swim even if they can’t, with one victim – hauled from the bottom of the pool - needing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and who beats Charles Spencer with a cricket boot, its metal spikes puncturing his skin. And then there’s the hulking teacher whose signet ring draws blood when he thumps Spencer round the head, the trickles drying invisibly in the boy’s thick red hair.Such was life in the private boarding school to which Spencer was admitted at the age of eight and which was so traumatising that it has taken him till now, after years of therapy, to record the damage. The tone is fervid. He has talked to many other Maidwell ex-pupils who still bear the scars of their years in an upper-class prison camp staffed by bullying paedophiles.Charles Spencer was one of the Queen’s godchildren and there may be readers who assume that the world he describes (servants, country houses, deep pockets) must have cushioned the impact of his traumas. If so, they’re wrong. Abuse is abuse wherever it happens. And if you didn’t already think it obscene for children as young as eight to be banished from home for two-thirds of the year, you will after finishing this account.Blake Morrison£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirDelightfully frank and movingMy Battle of HastingsXiaolu GuoMy Battle of HastingsXiaolu GuoDelightfully frank and movingThis is the third memoir by Xiaolu Guo, who grew up beside the East China Sea where her grandfather was a fisherman. When she inherited some money from the sale of her parents’ house in China after they both died of cancer, Guo begins looking for a place to live and work on the South Coast of England. Having lived in London, she missed “the salty wind, the contour of shorelines, and the ceaseless changing waves in the viewfinder of my eyes”.Guo eventually settled on “rain-stained dilapidated” Hastings, which she describes as “a cursed place but, at the same time, sexy, mysterious and somehow quintessentially English”. Her modest requirements are a “sea view and a tub” in which “to soak my body in the endless cold English evenings”. She moves into the tiny top-floor flat in December 2021.Divided into the four seasons, the book is an account Guo’s first year in a run-down part of the seaside town. Discovering a copy of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in a second-hand bookshop, she also buries herself in the ancient history of the area. Aware that the locals seem uninterested in their city’s remote past, she wonders why she, “a Chinese immigrant to Europe, a woman with neither power not any Western ancestry”, should care about the fate of King Harold or the invasion of the Normans in 1066. After visiting a re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings (“a strange and wonderful idea”), she concludes that a country that is able to view a great defeat from its past as an entertainment for families, reveals a detachment from its history that would be unimaginable in China: “I must admit that this is one of the good qualities the British have.”As well as exploring Anglo-Saxon history, Guo describes the challenges of her new life, such as renovating the cold and damp flat, as well as the pleasures, including walks in the countryside to gather wild garlic for cooking and visits from her partner and 9-year-old child, Moon, who collects shells on the beach. Her chronicle of life in Hastings with its “loudly crying seagulls” becomes a wonderfully evocative meditation on migration, history, war (two months after she moves in, Putin invades Ukraine, which she compares to the Norman Conquest), and politics (after the third prime minister in a year, she concludes “the country which I have adopted as my home cannot be saved”). \nGuo’s delightfully frank and often moving memoir is also a poignant exploration of identity and belonging. At one point she memorably compares herself to a jasmine seed blown in the wind: “we drift and then we land somewhere, we try to grow in its soil…We either germinate or turn into dust.”PD Smith£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseSocietyThe human impacts of AICode DependentMadhumita MurgiaCode DependentMadhumita MurgiaThe human impacts of AIWhat’s in the box? That’s the question almost everyone that Madhumita Murgia speaks to seems to be asking. If the “black box” of the algorithm is going to make critical decisions about our health, education or human rights, it would be nice to know exactly what it contains. So long as it remains a mystery, what can you do if you find your child added to a list of potential future criminals based on flawed, even racist, data, as happened to hundreds of families in the Netherlands in the late 2010s?It’s these Kafkaesque absurdities, and how they play out on a human level, that interest Murgia, the Financial Times’s first artificial intelligence editor. Code, she reminds us several times in this troubling book, is not neutral.This book, shortlisted for the Women's Prize for nonfiction 2024, isn’t a story about ChatGPT and the other large language models and their looming impact on everything from Hollywood to homework, though there is a bit of that. Instead, it’s an account of how the everyday algorithms we have already learned to live beside are changing us.There is a little optimism. Murgia – a former Wired writer – is alive to the potential of AI to improve health outcomes. And we meet people such as Hiba, whose family, refugees from Falluja, in Iraq, used their work as data labourers to fund a new life in Bulgaria. There are also cheering stories of how frustration at being exploited has led to gig economy workers quietly organising – even in China – to regain some of the autonomy they have sacrificed at “the altar of the algorithm”.But the bass note here is pessimistic. We are way past the techno-boosterism of the early 00s, and, for every government official wondering how AI can help them streamline health and welfare services, there are thousands of people asking whether it will allow them to continue making a living. Worse than that, as in the Chinese government’s facial recognition systems and pre-emptive detention lists in Xinjiang, it’s the story of a dystopia we are already living in.Will Dean£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionTales of the countryMona of the ManorArmistead MaupinMona of the ManorArmistead MaupinTales of the countryA decade ago, Armistead Maupin boldly declared that it was over. The Days of Anna Madrigal, the ninth in his illustrious queer novel cycle Tales of the City, was, he claimed, the last outing for the residents of 28 Barbary Lane. But ever since the first of the Tales was published in 1978, the lure of the “logical family” has proved irresistible. Maupin is back with a tenth instalment. How tuneful is this unexpected encore?This iteration of the Tales is set in the early 1990s, and helmed by Anna Madrigal’s daughter Mona Roughton (previously Mona Ramsey). She has inherited Easley House in the Cotswolds – based on the real Stanway House in Gloucestershire – after the death of her gay husband Lord Teddy Roughton. Domineering Mona is a riff on the eccentric lord of the manor figure: a weed-smoking, fiery-haired diva who, by her own admission, “tends to bring a water cannon to a gunfight”. While Mona and her mother share the same kindness, self-possession and generosity of spirit, Mona is a much larger than life incarnation of these traits.For all its colourful ribaldry and appealing warmth, some aspects of the narrative are less successful. I found the fleeting treatment of significant plot moments odd, and the tendency for set pieces to be heavily prefaced is puzzling. The ending, too, falls curiously flat, with the long-trailed high drama of the midsummer party fizzling out within a few pages.But perhaps that’s taking this knowingly unserious novel too seriously? Good-natured and entertaining enough, intent as it is on highlighting the importance of pleasure, Mona of the Manor is really an extra little gift for Maupin’s fans – and it will delight them.Michael Donkor£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionBravura portrait of a football tragedyMunichsDavid PeaceMunichsDavid PeaceBravura portrait of a football tragedyWhy the plural? There’s only one Munich in David Peace’s new novel, and we see very little of it: the slushy runway where British European Airways flight 609 crashes on February 6, 1958; the hotel room where two survivors spend their first bewildered night; the hospital where their fellow passengers recover – or don’t. This is surely the story of one accident, one time, one team: the air crash that killed 23 out of 44 passengers, including eight of Manchester United’s players, three of its staff, and eight journalists.But Peace’s reasoning becomes clear over the several hundred pages of this relentless, electrifying, harrowing novel. The Munich Air Disaster, so integral a part of how the football club developed, and which had such a profound impact on the city, the north of England, the sporting community and the country as a whole, might easily not have happened had takeoff been aborted. And what would the world look like then?Like much of Peace’s work, Munichs is an obsessional study in hauntology; not merely the idea that the past lives with us, but that multiple futures do, too. In extremis, time may seem to stop, but in reality, it judders on regardless, bringing with it, in this case, a grotesque juxtaposition of funerals and fixtures.Peace has explained that Munichs was written after the death of his father, who had suggested he pay attention to the events of February 1958. Born in 1967, Peace experienced these events and their wider context only as memory and retelling, to which he has now, valuably and valiantly, added his own.Alex Clark£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA wild weekend in New LagosLittle RotAkwaeke EmeziLittle RotAkwaeke EmeziA wild weekend in New LagosAkwaeke Emezi’s singularly menacing new novel opens with an ending – that of Aima and Kalu’s relationship. Now, it is “all small talk, nothing she could hold with both hands, meaningless chatter that avoided the truth of what they had both become”. Little Rot, like all Emezi’s books – from their debut novel Freshwater to their memoir Dear Senthuran – measures the difficult push and pull between the self and the world.Kalu drops Aima at the airport on a Friday evening. Their four-year relationship is over and they choose to go their separate ways: Aima to a high-society nightclub with her best friend, and Kalu to his childhood friend Ahmed’s exclusive sex party. Two Nigerian sex workers visiting from Kuala Lumpur and a celebrity pastor known as Daddy O enter the storyline, upending everything. What unspools is a dizzying, harrowing and entertaining journey as the characters’ fates collide. Mistakes are made, morals are questioned. Did their relationship ever have a solid foundation or was it resting on shaky ground? The stakes are high and the consequences are serious. In this world, everything comes at a price, and there’s a price to pay for every choice.Little Rot is about hypocrisy, toxic masculinity and sexual cruelty. It is a novel oozing with dirty secrets and ugly reveals. The deliberately outrageous tone is not for the faint-hearted: enter at your own peril. Emezi is here to shred the facade of society, to unsettle and subvert rules and beliefs.Sana Goyal£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionLife in exileThe MorningsideTéa ObrehtThe MorningsideTéa ObrehtLife in exileOn Island City, which may be, or may once have been, Manhattan, in a once-luxurious apartment block called The Morningside, an 11-year-old girl watches and learns about the community she lives in while yearning to discover more about the community she comes from.Silvia and her family – her mother and her aunt, Ena, the superintendent of the block – are refugees from an unnamed country whose traditions and myths they carry with them in revealingly different ways. Ena treasures the past and revisits it, preserving artefacts and telling folk tales from the old country, while Silvia’s mother, who has her own reasons to want to leave everything behind, is against reminiscing and discourages her daughter’s questions about her father, her family and life in the old country.As Obreht draws them, aunt and mother represent the two ways of navigating exile, holding on and letting go: “If the past had previously felt like a forbidden room briefly glimpsed as my mother was shutting its door, here was Ena, holding the door wide.” But because Obreht’s characters are so vibrant and individualised, they are never ciphers for particular ways of being. In this novel, letting go and holding on have more in common than we – and the characters – think.Obreht is a novelist of great skill and warmth, for whom the ancient forms of storytelling – folk tales, myths and legends – retain all their capacity to explain and mystify, soothe and terrify.Patrick McGuinness£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseScienceHow animals communicateThe Voices of NatureNicolas MathevonThe Voices of NatureNicolas MathevonHow animals communicateIn this remarkable study, Nicolas Mathevon – a professor of neurosciences and animal behavior at the University of Saint-Etienne – explores the voices of the natural world, from crocodile calls and bird song, to the “tchik-tchik-tchik” of cicadas. His specialism is bioacoustics, which attempts to understand how animals make and hear sounds, as well as what information these sounds contain and what this is used for. It’s challenging for the general reader to understand the subject, as our vocabulary for describing the biophonic world is less rich than it is for the visual world. But Mathevon succeeds brilliantly in bringing his subject vividly alive, using a mix of evocative writing and lucid scientific explanation. His website also provides helpful recordings of the animal sounds and the book itself is charmingly illustrated by his father.Each chapter explores a different soundscape and the animals that contribute to it, revealing how their voices have evolved to help them survive in that environment as part of “the great concert of life”. From Mediterranean scrubland and rainforests, to the extremes of the Arctic (“the most hostile environment I’ve ever been in”), animals use the sound-transmitting properties of air or water to communicate, in order “to find a partner, to defend a territory, to signal the presence of a predator or food source, to collaborate in hunting, and to recognize and interact with members of the group”.He shows that their communications are comparable to our own, though our articulated language reveals an extraordinary complexity, reflecting the unprecedented range of our social interactions. Nevertheless, he argues that animal communications can indeed be described as a language, albeit not a single one: there are, he says, as many languages as there are animals using sounds to exchange information.Mathevon’s book reveals the often-ground-breaking experiments he and his fellow bioacousticians have conducted to decipher the meanings of the signals in animal sounds and how this relates to their behaviour. One of these experiments involved working in a Brazilian swamp to study the communications between jacaré caiman mothers and their young, research which involved catching a newborn caiman. However, Mathevon is seemingly unfazed by the risks he took for this experiment, noting drily: “we made it out in one piece and got good recordings”. His survey of this intriguing field offers a fascinating insight into the dedication and ceaseless curiosity of the scientific mind, and Mathevon’s enthusiasm for the “worlds of sound” that surround us is certainly contagious.PD Smith£18 (RRP £20) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

Trapped in the sizeable quarantine zone surrounding the accident site, you must stay alive long enough to figure out how to escape – a task made rather more challenging by the presence of aggressive cultists, irradiated monsters and highly territorial terror bees. ImagineStalker, but set in northern England, and you’re edging towards what Oxford-based developer Rebellion has in store.Fallout may seem like another obvious inspiration for this irradiated game world, but after playing a two-hour demo, it’s clear the game draws more from classic British sci-fi. Here you are, stuck in the picturesque Lake District, with its lush woodlands, gurgling rivers and dry-stone walls. But all around you are the burned-out remains of 1960s cars and tanks, abandoned farm buildings and odd sounds and symbols that suggest something extremely sinister is happening. The development team have mentioned Dr Who, The Wicker Man the novels of John Wyndham as key inspirations, and you can see it in the grubby dislocated scene all around you. Approach a phone box and pick up the ringing handset, and you may hear a disembodied voice warning you about an apparently friendly character you met up the road. Stray into a cave and a ghost-like monster comes at you, infecting you with a paranoid mind virus. This is very much the stuff ofQuatermassand Jon Pertwee-era Who.View image in fullscreenSomething sinister is happening … Atomfall.Photograph: Rebellion DevelopmentsIt’s not long before I bump into a gang of druids stalking the undergrowth and I’m suddenly thrust into combat. But in the spirit of Stalker, and other survival games such as Escape From Tarkov, I have to rely on improvised melee weapons such as cricket bats and scythes, or on rusty guns that may or may not fire the meagre handfuls of ammo I’ve managed to accrue. The developers have said they want this game to be about grimly hanging on to life; you’re not a super-soldier. Everywhere there are little trinkets to scavenge, from apples to machine parts.When characters aren’t trying to clobber you with bats, they may offer you information or trading opportunities. It seems you’re free to wander through overgrown farms and ruined industrial buildings looking for clues about what the hell even happened here. Just watch out for the glowing greeny-blue bees nests hanging from trees – those guys arereallyterritorial. And poisonous.View image in fullscreenLooking for clues about what the hell even happened here … Atomfall.Photograph: Rebellion DevelopmentsEven in my short demo, there’s a nice sinister sense of tension in the air. Relying on faulty handguns and explosive devices that you’ve stuck together, Blue Peter-style, with double-sided sticky tape and things you’ve found in an abandoned military checkpoint adds a sense of desperation and disaster.I did find some of the menus and weapon selection tricky, and for a game that relies heavily on stealth, it’s very easy to accidentally mess up because you’ve not loaded your shotgun in advance. But then this is the stuff of the survival game: often it’s better to hang around in the long grass than engage with the enemy (although sometimes it’s not exactly clear where you’re in cover and where you’re not, so I was giving my location away alot).Atomfall looks like an interesting amalgam of Stalker, , Resistance: Fall of Man and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, with some role-playing elements lobbed in. Skill points improve your stealth, health and combat efficiency as you progress, and there are plenty of little notes and clues scattered about the wilderness to find. I think a lot is going to depend on just what the mystery at the heart of the game turns out be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was more drunken argy-bargy than fisticuffs, but enough to count as floor entertainment. Sadly, no spats occurred on my recent visit toSatori, an enlightening Japanese restaurant in the same postcode, though that’s probably because it’s so dark in there – black walls, black floors, black tables – that its customers wisely choose to remain safely seated.But this is not aDans Le Noir-style themed restaurantwhere you eat in a blackout; no, it has instead merely been designed by someone who clearly really loves shiny, black surfaces with blood-red trimmings and busts of dragons. It’s giving, as the kids say, 1980s MFI showroom doing international playboy lair. Or the time Adrian Molepainted over his Noddy wallpaper with black paint, but the gold hat bells kept gleaming through.View image in fullscreenSatori’s sushi platter: ‘Pretty indistinguishable from the freshly rolled options at Waitrose.’Satori is inspired, the website says, by the Japanese concept ofsatori, a moment of “awakening”, and offers a dining experience “that transcends the ordinary and becomes a journey of discovery, flavour, and connection”. That’s a slightly pompous claim for somewhere that serves tuna and avocado maki, chicken wings, miso cod fillet and duck breast with honey and soy, but then pomposity chimed loudly in the air as we were led brusquely to our shiny table.We had ordered drinks from the small bar by the front door, a shiso fine made with Afsana Lion non-alcoholic spirit, red shiso and rhubarb and hibiscus tonic, plus a kendo made with Afsana Warrior, toasted rice tea, coconut water and sesame. Both sounded delicious, but they remained a dream because they never showed up. Did I maybe get off on the wrong foot with the front of house? Admittedly, there was a certain fractiousness from the moment I began ordering. “We’ll start with some sushi,” I said confidently.“The sushi platter?” our server replied, guiding us to the £30 option.“Well, how many pieces are on it?” I asked.“Twelve,” he said, tapping his pad. “And what then for starters?”“Do we need starters?” I asked, having already seen several platters of rather cumbersome-looking maki and nigiri pass by.“Yes, you’ll need starters,” he said, curling a lip.“Tea-smoked miso aubergine?” I said, hoping to placate him. “Karaage?”“And?” he said.“Can we order mains now?” I said, ignoring his rolling eyes. My request for the black cod at £35 and the £30 lamb cutlets seemed to persuade him that we weren’t just cluttering a table.View image in fullscreenSatori’s black cod: ‘A chunk of rather nice fish.’A weird, dry, wilted cracker with spring onion and goat’s curd appeared as an amuse-bouche. Then a plate – black slate, naturally – topped with salmon and tuna nigiri dressed with rather thickly sliced okra and some caviar, and a slightly stodgy dragon prawn tempura maki topped with pea shoots. This wasn’t sushi worth making a special trip for, and pretty indistinguishable from the freshly rolled options at Waitrose.View image in fullscreenSatori’s tea-smoked aubergine: ‘Sweet, mushy and pleasant enough.’Next up came two thick slices of that tea-soaked aubergine, which was sweet, mushy and pleasant enough. Four small, thumbnail-sized pieces of karaage followed, which we’d been told had a layer of bonito under the drab, dry batter. Chopsticks were whisked away for our mains, which is when Satori ceased to push the boundaries of Japanese cuisine, ahem, and landed firmly in a 1990s UK pastiche of “sophisticated Japanese”, with a chunk of rather nice fish in a buttery miso sauce on a couple of pak choi leaves, and three deliciously plump, pink pepper-seasoned lamb chops with a few smears of yoghurt and some spindly heritage carrots, which owed more to Bengal than to Tokyo.View image in fullscreenSatori’s baked Mount Fuji: ‘Ordered mainly out of sheer curiosity.’This was the sort of dinner where you order dessert mainly out of sheer curiosity. “The baked Mount Fuji!” I declared triumphantly. Within a matter of minutes, and certainly not within time actually to bake anything, a chunk of matcha ice-cream ensconced in sticky meringue was on our table, a shot of whisky was hurled over the top and the whole thing was then set ablaze. At this point, semi-hysteria set in, although that might have been the whisky fumes. After the flames abated, the plate – black, of course – was a mound of singed, still moist meringue mix sitting on some melted ice-cream and a puddle of whisky. You really can’t put a price on that kind of excitement, although in this case it came to £12.Dinner was £168.77 including the warm service, but without the cocktails that, to date, are still being made in a very black room in Moseley.

His eponymous exercise method is a global phenomenon. In 2024, it was the fitness subscription service ClassPass’smost booked exercise for a second consecutive year.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Classical pilates involves low-impact, controlled exercises that strengthen and balance the body, from the core outwards, and improve flexibility. It’s done on a mat – often with small props – or on apparatus that adds resistance.Machines include the cadillac, Wunda Chair and the reformer; with a bed-like frame and sliding “carriage” with attached springs, reformers are used for fast-paced group classes to music. Teachers with a classical focus may sniff at these hybrid versions, stressing the increased risk of injury, but they’re a good workout.Whatever your pilates poison, comfortable clothing is essential. Our experts agree your usual gym gear will do – leggings, joggers, shorts, T-shirts or vests, and for women, a supportive sports bra. It’s important to avoid anything too baggy that could get caught in any apparatus – or too tight for comfort. “Make sure you can move easily and clothing is non-restrictive,” says Grace Lillywhite, who runs theCentred Mumsstudio in Hertfordshire. “A good teacher should be able to read your body well even if you aren’t in super-tight clothing.”And while no equipment is absolutely necessary, a few small, inexpensive pieces can add variety to your home practice.Essential pilates equipmentView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gorkem Yorulmaz/Getty ImagesSquat-proof leggingsKaren Grinter, founder ofNorthants Pilates, says to look for leggings that are opaque enough to protect your modesty. To check, “stand with your mirror behind you, legs wide apart, then bend over and look at your bum through your legs. If they’re too thin, you’ll see your knickers – and so will everyone else.” Along with several of our other experts, Grinter rates Sweaty Betty’s Power range for comfort, durability and versatility.Another favourite, at a slightly lower price, is the Northampton-based sportswear company TLC Sport: “I have leggings from them that I’ve had for more than 10 years. They stay put and don’t ride up,” says Grinter.View image in fullscreenSweaty Betty Power 7/8 gym leggings£88 at Sweaty Betty£88 at M&SSize range:UK 6-20You’ll like these if:you like a supportive style, with loads of pattern options.View image in fullscreenTLC Sport extra strong compression leggings£50 at TLC Sport£50 at DecathlonSize range:UK 6-24You’ll like these if:you want to support a British-run, female-owned business.View image in fullscreenGoodmove Go Move high-waisted 7/8 gym leggings£27.50 at M&S£27.50 at The Sports EditSize range:UK 6-24You’ll like these if:you’re after inclusive sizes at high-street prices.Not-too-baggy joggersSome people find joggers more comfortable. “As someone with a specialist interest in pelvic-floor health, I encourage people not to wear things too tight around the waist, says Lillywhite of Centred Mums. “It can increase the pressure going into the pelvic floor.” Her go-tos are Scamp & Dude’s versions, which stand out from the sea of neutral options for their jazzy patterns and fluorescent piping. These do tend to sell out, so stock up when you see them. For men’s joggers, London-based pilates instructor Yusef Sonne likes Gymshark and Asics, which produce keenly priced pairs that last.View image in fullscreenScamp & Dude slouch joggers£55 at Scamp & DudeSize range:UK 6-22You’ll like these if:you find leggings a little tight.View image in fullscreenGymshark sport joggers£36 at GymsharkSize range:XS-3XLYou’ll like these if:you’re not a shorts guy.‘Ten minutes a day will make you significantly fitter’: personal trainers on the best home exercise kitRead moreSupportive shorts“Men’s shorts need to be long enough to cover everything,” says Grinter. “Lycra running shorts underneath are a good idea.” Sonne favours Asics’ shorts: “I wear the 7in version for pilates, as I find the 5in length a little short.” Given Asics is a running brand, these are a versatile investment if you also like to pound the pavements.View image in fullscreenAsics Core 7in men’s short£22 at Asics£25.90 at Running PointSize range:XS-2XLYou’ll like these if:you’re after a versatile pair of not-too-short shorts.View image in fullscreenUnder Armour men’s Heatgear compression shorts£25.99 at Sports Direct£32 at Under ArmourSize range:XS-4XLYou’ll like these if:you don’t want to accidentally flash your instructor.View image in fullscreenLululemon Align women’s shortsFrom £24 at Lululemon£48 at Net-a-PorterIndia Hewitt, studio manager atReset pilates, yoga and barre studio in Manchester, is a big fan of Lululemon’s Align shorts. “They’re super-soft and don’t slip down, but aren’t tight and restricting.

However, it comes down to personal preference;Esther Fox, who teaches clinical pilates online, prefers a vest, opting for longer styles “so if you bend forward, your tummy stays covered up”.On the other hand, Emmeline Kemp, fromGreen Room Health in Essex, opts for a tee: “T-shirt styles are the ones for me, as I prefer coverage across the front of the shoulder.” Meanwhile, Zlata Rodionova, who has been doing group reformer classes for two years, has fallen for a tank top from Manchester-based activewear brand Adanola. “I’m a D-cup and I was worried it wouldn’t be supportive enough.

Lillywhite wears British brand No Bounce Sport’s bras for her sessions. “The way they fit allows your ribcage to move better, which means your breathing isn’t restricted and it’s more beneficial for your pelvic floor.”View image in fullscreenSweaty Betty Spirit Restored yoga bra£35 at Sweaty Betty£35 at M&SSize range:30A-36FYou’ll like this if:you want a comfy bra top that’s fuss-free.View image in fullscreenLululemon Like A Cloud longline bra D/DD cup£58 at LululemonSize range:6-18D/DDYou’ll like this if:you have a bigger bust and want a soft bra.View image in fullscreenNo Bounce sports bra£60 at No Bounce SportSize range:28-42A-GGYou’ll like this if:you need more support.Pregnancy-friendly gearPilates’ low-impact exercises can be easily adapted for pregnancy and there are lots of specialist perinatal classes around. For specific pregnancy and postnatal leggings, Lillywhite says her clients have recommended Natal Active’s range. They can be worn over- or under-bump in pregnancy and high-waisted postpartum, with seams that are positioned to not irritate C-section scars.Lydia Willgress-Dunn did pilates throughout her pregnancy last year, and she rates Lululemon’s high-waisted Align range (which she also wore before becoming pregnant): “The leggings are really comfortable and stretch well over a bump.”View image in fullscreenNatal Active Luxe maternity and postnatal leggings£49.50 at Bravissimo£55 at Natal ActiveSize range:UK 6-20You’ll like these if:your usual leggings aren’t working in pregnancy.View image in fullscreenLululemon Align leggingsFrom £69 at Lululemon£88 at SelfridgesSize range:UK 4-24You’ll like these if:you don’t want to fork out for maternity leggings.A proper pilates matMost studios will provide you with a mat, but if you’re doing regular online classes or want to do more home practice, it could be worth investing. Pilates mats are thicker than yoga ones, to give more support for joints and the spine. Weeks advises looking for mats that are 10-15mm thick and rates Align-Pilates’s iteration: “I have the same ones I bought in 2018 and they still look like new.”View image in fullscreenAlign-Pilates studiomat£62.99 at Best Gym Equipment£62.99 at The Mad GroupYou’ll like this if:you’re doing a lot of pilates from home and are in it for the long haul.Spiky ball“Spiky balls are a great way to release muscle tension before working on strength,” says Lillywhite. Use body weight to roll them under the arches of the feet, calves, quads and glutes – anywhere you feel tightness really. The pain is worth the gain.View image in fullscreenPhysique spiky massage ballFrom £3.24 at PhysiqueYou’ll like this if:you’re always complaining about your quads feeling tight.Resistance bandsFor their versatility and easy storage, resistance bands are hard to beat, says Kemp of Green Room Health, who incorporates them into sessions for exercises that help strengthen and mobilise legs and hips. “Go for a medium resistance band as it’s a great all-rounder. Add a strong band if you want variety,” she says.Bands can intensify movements, adding tension much like the pulleys and springs on a reformer, so muscles have to work harder. They can also be used to support and help with alignment, which is particularly useful for beginners or someone recovering from injury – for example, if knees fall inward during a pelvic tilt, you can help your form by tying a band just above the knees and keeping it taut.View image in fullscreenAlign-Pilatesresistance band£9.49 at Align-Pilates£9.49 at The Mad GroupYou’ll like this if:you want a longer do-it-all band that will work for the widest variety of moves, including standing exercises (if you’re tall, you might struggle with a shorter band).View image in fullscreenTheraband resistance bands set£10.52 at Amazon£11.95 at eBayYou’ll like this if:you plan to mix up your routine with different strength bands.Pilates ballKemp also recommends having a soft pilates ball, which can be used to make exercises more challenging, to help with alignment, muscle activation and stability.

It’s worth noting, perhaps, that this shiny new title comes from the annual Knight Frank Wealth Report, and is based on how many restaurants serve fine wines from the world’s top 250 wine and champagne houses. If this is what matters to you when looking at a wine list, this would put London’s wine offering ahead of New York, and even Paris.The Guardian’s wine expert Hannah Crosbie lists a few old and new wine bars that you can walk into and order a bottle anytime. You don’t have to be rich to drink here (but I’m sure it helps).Noble Rot Mayfair: the new reliableView image in fullscreenNoble Rot Mayfair.Photograph: Juan Trujillo AndradesHere’s a fun game if you’re on a first date with someone who likes wine: ask them to rank the three Noble Rot restaurants. For me,Noble Rot Mayfairsits firmly at the top. Their 50-page wine list rests sweetly on the border that lies between the traditional and natural. In essence, wines that honour the environment, but lean on faithful expressions of the land they hail from. And, if you’re a fan of mature, rarer wines, they work with The Wine Society for a special reserve list– one amassed from a reserve built up over their 150 years operating at a member-owned retailer.The 10 Cases: the old reliableLoved by wine industry professionals for many reasons. Here are just a few: It’s in the fabulously central Covent Garden. Their Franco-European food is seriously good. In summer, the pavement at its front is packed with rattan chairs. And, as its name suggests, they will only order 10 cases of any wine, meaning their list constantly changes – making it a good one to follow if you want to keep a finger on the pulse of London’s evolving tastes.Goodbye Horses: the east London wine barView image in fullscreenGoodbye Horses,Photograph: PR Image/Goodbye Horses/Sam HarrisThe natural wine bar has become pretty synonymous with east London life. Every month, I see a new one opening and I think the bubble will burst. Every month I’m proved wrong. Goodbye Horses opened only in August, but has already cemented itself as both a destination wine bar and a favourite among De Beauvoir locals. It believes a wine list should be “as close to zero-zero as possible” – nothing added, nothing taken away. The interiors are impeccably designed, with a custom-made oak bar, delightful music and beguiling painted curtains.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

It’s now been a decade since the Victorian pub was refurbished by chef-director Mike Davies. Obviously, people come here for the food – you can find day boat fish, delica squash and their adored scotch bonnet pork fat on toast on the current menu – but you can also nip in for a quick drink. Their classic but playful wine list fits neatly on to a piece of A4 paper. A great example of how great wine is even being enjoyed in a pub setting.

Their wine offering is curated by Mountain’s wine manager, Holly Willcocks. Because wine importers love her, Half Cut punches way above its allocation for a wee restaurant on York Way. Ask for the special allocated stuff that’s off-list for hand sale. The food is jubilant, and their skewer sessions (a skewer, flatbread, salad and glass of wine for £18) runs every Tuesday and Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsWineLondonFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what does the science say?Adrienne MateiFri 7 Mar 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 12.18 ESTShareThe popular new Netflix showApple Cider Vinegarisn’t about the titular vinegar – it’s about the influencer Belle Gibson claiming she cured brain cancer by adopting a whole food diet.Yet apple cider vinegar is a fitting symbol for society’s obsession with miracle health cures.For millennia, healers, herbalists and wellness enthusiasts of all stripes have sworn by apple cider vinegar’s supposed benefits. Search “apple cider vinegar + [insert ailment]” and you’ll find someone claiming it helps with everything from sunburn to kidney stones to evenneurodegenerative disease. Infused with garlic, onions and hot peppers, it becomes fire cider, a folk remedy said to boost immunity and take the edge off colds. A few tablespoons mixed into water? A digestive aid. Dabbed on to bruises? A home remedy.How often do I need to shampoo and how do I pick one that suits my hair?Read moreMany of the health claims people make about apple cider vinegar are based on anecdote and tradition. But some of its applications draw on clinical research and are considered worthwhile by doctors and dietitians. So what does the science really say about apple cider vinegar’s health effects and practical uses?Is apple cider vinegar safe?Apple cider vinegar is neither magic nor snake oil. Rather, it’s a healthy pantry staple most people can incorporate into their diets safely.Unpasteurized apple cider vinegar with “the mother”, a brownish murk of friendly microbes, is rich in polyphenols, a kind of antioxidant, and probiotics, which contribute to beneficial gut bacteria.The typical servingrecommendationis a tablespoon of vinegar diluted in 8oz of water. Effects will depend on the individual. For those with acid reflux, ulcers or gastritis, vinegar’s high levels of acetic acid may feel too harsh. As with any supplement, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor before incorporating apple cider vinegar into your routine, particularly for those on diabetes medications or drugs that affect potassium levels, or those with kidney disease, as their kidneys may struggle to process high doses of acid. It’s also worth noting that acid can be hard on tooth enamel.Apple cider vinegar isanti-microbialagainst pathogens, which means it can do double-duty as a salad dressing ingredient and a sanitizer for any sneakyEcolihanging out on your lettuce. Adding it to a bowl of water when washing produce can help kill off microbes, and keep your veg fresh for longer in the fridge.More research is needed before we know whether vinegar can be officially recommended for fighting pathogens inside the body, but theresearchso far paints a compelling picture of an accessible way to inhibit bacterial growth in vitro.Can apple cider vinegar help with blood glucose levels and diabetes?Much of the research about drinking apple cider vinegar to control blood sugar has comprised only small, short, interventional trials.One 2023 study, with a cohort of 80 adults with type 2 diabetes, found that those who consumed two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar a day had significantly greater reductions in their blood sugar levels, as well as larger improvements in their cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and greater weight loss than the control. A 2021meta-analysisfound fairly consistent reductions in blood sugar spikes and triglycerides in patients with type 2 diabetes.I tried an anti-inflammatory diet for a week. This is what I learnedRead moreSeveralstudieshave found apple cider vinegar may support metabolic health by slowing digestion, leading to a steadier release of glucose into the bloodstream – potentially useful when consuming meals high in simple carbohydrates. Additionalresearchsupports that apple cider vinegar may also enhance the body’s ability to process fat and glucose more efficiently.However, Dr Dan Bessesen, a professor of endocrinology, metabolism and diabetes at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, takes these studies with a grain of salt.“When you’re looking at something like glucose or cholesterol or weight, these are chronic conditions where you would want to see some meaningful long-term benefits,” such as the prevention of heart problems or type 2 diabetes. “But there really are no long-term studies,” he says.Perhaps apple cider vinegar “was the GLP-1 agonist of 1,000 years ago”, says Bessesen, but compared to the glucose-lowering drugs available today, its effects are significantly less potent and reliable, he says: a complementary tonic perhaps, but not a replacement for diabetes medication.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionCan apple cider vinegar help with weight loss and digestive issues?Among the wellness set, the idea is popular that apple cider vinegar can help otherwise healthy individuals lose weight, improve digestion and combat bloat.Sammy Peterson, an Arizona-based registered dietitian, says that because apple cider vinegar may slow digestion and supports a healthy gut microbiome, it makes sense that drinking it may help with bloat or stomach upset, though the evidence for it is mostly anecdotal.When it comes to weight loss, studies are small, and in some cases complicated by factors such as participants also following lower-calorie diets or not reporting their diets while taking apple cider vinegar. “Research suggests that apple cider vinegar may help support what’s called satiety, or being more full from our meals, which is our ultimate goal when we’re looking at something like weight loss,” notes Peterson.One 2005studyfound that participants who drank apple cider vinegar before a meal consumed up to 275 fewer calories throughout the rest of the day. But it’s not clear why – the vinegar could have made them feel less hungry or it could have made them feel nauseous.link to other well actually storiesReally, if you want to lose weight, Peterson says, balanced nutrition, daily movement, stress reduction and adequate sleep are much more important than any supplement. And as far as adding it to your diet to lose weight, Bessesen thinks the “evidence for apple cider vinegar is pretty weak”.Is topical apple cider vinegar good for hair and scalp care?Studies on apple cider vinegar and eczema and atopic dermatitis do not demonstrate that vinegar changes the skin’s microbiome. But Dr Jeff Donovan, a British Columbia-based board-certified dermatologist specializing in conditions affecting the hair and scalp, has seen promising outcomes with patients using apple cider vinegar to treat certain scalp conditions.“I am a real proponent of apple cider vinegar,” he says.For the last decade he has been recommending topical apple cider vinegar application to patients with dandruff, or scaling and itching symptoms associated with seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis. “It acts as a wonderful clarifying agent to lift scale,” says Donovan, who recommends diluting the vinegar with four parts water, applying it to the scalp with a spray bottle, and waiting 10 minutes or so before washing it out. Diluting the vinegar reduces the chance of sustaining a chemical burn, and the mixture can also be safely used as an occasional clarifying hair rinse. It might, however, dry out tissue if used too frequently.Apple cider vinegar demonstrates activity against bacteria, fungi and yeast “in a test tube”, says Donovan. But “the limited studies that have been done have suggested it doesn’t actually do that in human beings”, he says. We don’t know exactly how apple cider vinegar is benefitting people with scalp conditions – only that it’s cheap and safe. Donovan says some patients who have used it as directed have had significant improvement in scaly skin and itching, and did not have to then use strong medications like corticosteroids. “The only complaint I’ve ever had from a patient is that it didn’t do anything for them,” says Donovan.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingFoodHealthDiets and dietingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was struck by the minimalism of “stripped back, not fussy” clothes, she told Vogue before the show. “It is quite clean, quite pure, obviously postwar,” she said.The headliner of Burton’s Givenchy debut, aParis fashion weekhot ticket, was an hourglass-shaped jacket with an exaggerated waist and curvaceous hips (pictured top right). “I wanted to strip it back to silhouette, which is the backbone of this house,” she said after the show. A new logo, Givenchy Paris 1952, was emblazoned across a mesh catsuit or on the strap of a Mary Jane flat shoe, and there was a hat tip to that decade in the form of cone-shaped bras. Burton said the look was “quite Hitchcock”, a reference that neatly skewers both the 1950s genesis of Givenchy and the fashion-noir of the house of McQueen, which still shapes Burton’s thinking.Givenchy stands for black dresses, clean lines, flat shoes, giving it arguably the most modern aesthetic of all the famous French fashion houses. But while Dior and Chanel have turned fashion into blockbuster entertainment and successfully seduced a young fanbase, Givenchy is still defined by Hepburn nibbling a croissant in sunglasses and pearls in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a full 62 years ago. A revolving door of six designers in the three decades since Hubert de Givenchy retired have failed to put a pin on Givenchy’s place in contemporary culture. That is now Burton’s job.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Indigital.TV/GivenchyThis was a major fashion moment, as the first show by a new female creative director, in an industry which has recently seen women overlooked for top jobs. But Burton, who took her bow in her trademark jeans and jumper, does not do jazz hands. Her ideas were fresh – that compellingly curvy jacket might come to replace the menswear-style blazer which has been ubiquitous on streets and shop floors in recent years – but the presentation was understated.There was no traffic-stopping front row. A few twists of lemon yellow, as teased by Timothée Chalamet, who was dressed by Burton in yellow for Sunday’s Oscars, were the exception among muted colours. Party dresses were as short as tutus, but still looked understated, with simple styling and clean lines. A beloved figure both for her talent and for the sensitivity with which she handled being handed the keys to the house of McQueen in the jagged aftermath of her boss and mentor’s shocking death, Burton has earned the right to do things her way. The dominant emotion at the show was thankfulness that after a year out of the limelight she has returned to fashion’s frontline.Hubert de Givenchy, who once said of his client and close friend Hepburn that “she was not like other movie stars, because she loved simplicity” would have approved of the chic minimalism. It is telling of the restrained coding of the house that one of Hubert de Givenchy’s most famous looks was a funeral coat and black chiffon veil, which the designer stayed up all night to make for Wallis Simpson when the Duke of Windsor died in 1972.View image in fullscreenWallis Simpson (C) with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at the Duke of Windsor's funeral in 1972.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsGivenchyParis fashion weekSarah BurtonFranceEuropeFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

It was November last year – Bear’s 12th birthday, and his first proper walk after weeks of taking it easy while he recovered from serious surgery. The South Downs stretched before us. The sun had set and the temperature was dropping.Bear is a retired police dog – a huge, 48kg German shepherd. He entered the force as a puppy, then spent six years in active service, working alongside firearms units as well as tracking suspects and missing people.He retired in March 2020. There’s no set timetable for when police dogs stop working, but they will often let you know they’ve had enough. It’s intense work: very physical, often at night, in dangerous environments. His handler couldn’t keep him, so Bear came to live with me and my husband – both retired police officers ourselves – for a well-earned rest.In his career, Bear faced physical challenges, which caught up with him after retirement. In August 2023, he suddenly lost the use of his back legs. Scans revealed four herniated discs in his spine, which required surgery. It was touch and go, but his resilience amazed us.He underwent weeks of physiotherapy and still moves with a slight wobble. Bear’s surgeries were expensive, but luckily,a great charitythat supports retired police dogs stepped in to help.Then, in late 2023, Bear developed testicular tumours. We braced for the worst, but they were benign. It still meant more major precautionary surgery, so by November 2024, he still hadn’t been farther than the garden for weeks. But, for a birthday treat, we decided we’d take him for a walk.We took him without our other dog, so that Bear could go at his own pace. It’s quite exposed along the Sussex Way, a path with dense areas of woodland and undergrowth. We reached the top and admired the view, but it was getting dark and cold.As we came back down the track, we debated whether we should go straight back to the car, or give it another 10 minutes. Bear was enjoying himself, so we carried on.Experience: My dog went missing for nine years – then we were reunitedRead moreIt was along that path that Bear suddenly stopped dead in front of us. He stepped backwards, completely focused on a spot in front of him, then dragged me towards the undergrowth. Cautiously, I entered a patch of dense brambles, wondering what I was about to find. There were no noises or indication that anything was amiss. I wondered if Bear had made a mistake.Then I saw an older man on the ground. He couldn’t get up and seemed to be in distress. He had a few scratches on him and was confused and cold, but he could talk and made it clear he was very happy to see us. He told us he’d gone for a walk and got lost, then tripped over and couldn’t get up.I called the police and coordinated a meeting point. It was a struggle to get him up – I wasn’t sure if he was badly hurt. We supported him as we walked to the nearest car park, Bear leading the way. It was dark and cold – just 2C. If Bear hadn’t found him, it’s unlikely he would have survived the night.It transpired that the man had been missing for hours. He lived locally and his family had reported it when he hadn’t come home. Officers had deployed drones and a helicopter, and conducted foot searches, but the terrain was difficult, so he hadn’t been found. Without Bear’s instincts, we would have walked straight past him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Before climbing into the car, the man turned back to thank us one more time. Bear, however, was unfazed. Once he’d done his bit, he lay down for a belly rub.That night, Bear enjoyed a birthday steak, although he had to share it with our other dog, Koda.Today, Bear’s retirement is about living his best life. He loves walks, lounging in bed and snuggling up to watch breakfast TV.I wonder what he might say if he could talk. I’m sure he’d brush off his birthday heroics, saying, “I was just doing my job.” He didn’t choose to be a police dog, but he gave his all to the role.As told to Sophie HaydockDo you have an experience to share?

During the round-table summit, which had more than a dozen attendees, the president thanked each of his guests.“High-IQ individuals around this table, high-IQ,” Trump said. “We feel like pioneers.”Trump hosted players including crypto entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; Michael Saylor, co-founder and the executive chair of MicroStrategy; and Zach Witkoff, one of the founders of the president’s own crypto business, World Liberty Financial.Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood Markets, also attended.Trumpsigned an executive orderon Thursday creating a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency for the United States. During the summit, he said this reserve will be like a “digital Fort Knox for digital gold to be stored”.David Sacks, a tech investor whom Trump has named his “crypto czar”, thanked the president for his leadership in the digital asset industry and remarked: “Your administration is moving at tech speed.“This was an industry that was subjected to persecution,” Sacks said. “And no one understands that better than you do.”After the initial introductions, the attenders began their off-camera summit. The event is expected to focus on Trump’s plans to build the strategic reserve, which the president said will containbitcoinand four other coins.

The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, Sacks earlier said in a post on social media platform X.“This [strategic reserve] is going to be the biggest point of contention for many of us,” said JP Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Exodus, a bitcoin wallet developer. Although he owns the four other coins that Trump has suggested including in the reserve, he does not think they have a place in a strategic reserve.Crypto giant Tether CEO on cooperating with Trump administration: ‘We’ve never been shady’Read more“Crypto has made big strides, but it’s still a relatively nascent industry,” Richardson said. The other coins are smaller and function in a very different way, one he said may create more risk. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, posted on X on Sunday that a bitcoin-only reserve was “probably … the best option”. Both Richardson and Armstrong attended the summit.In a post on X, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, who also attended the summit, hailed Trump’s recognition that “we live in a multichain world” stretching beyond bitcoin. XRP, the coin tied to Ripple, is one of the four other cryptocurrencies Trump has suggested may be added to a crypto reserve.

Millions of people may wake to a giant mess, if they get any sleep at all.So how do you stay safe while you begin the cleanup and recovery? It can be helpful to have a plan of action ready, before the time comes.Why did Tropical Cyclone Alfred slow down on its destructive path towards Australia’s east coast?Read moreFirst, be prepared to stay inside for a day or so, even after the wild weather has passed. You may have to manage without essential services for a while. And there are several important steps to take before venturing outside.I have 20 years’ experience in disaster studies, including how communities can recover. Here’s what you need to know about surviving the morning after Tropical Cyclone Alfred.Before you leave your safe roomSay you’ve chosen to “shelter in place”, in the safest room in the house. That’s the smallest room with the fewest windows – usually a bathroom, in a hall or a room under the stairs.Do not leave this room until you have been told it’s safe to do so by authorities. Even after the storm has passed, the wind gusts can be very unpredictable. Depending on your location, flood water may still be a threat.If you still have access to the internet, check the digital disaster dashboard online. In Queensland, every council has their own disaster dashboard.New South Waleshas the Hazards Near Me app.Tune into your local ABC radio station for official emergency updates, warnings and advice. Make sure you have spare batteries and even a backup AM-FM radio. Try to minimise use of your mobile phone to conserve battery power and network capacity. SMS/text messages are more likely to get through than phone calls.LiveTimelapse: Satellite shows Tropical Cyclone Alfred crossing Australia's coast – videoWhile you wait for normal services to resumeAfter the cyclone there may be no power, internet, mobile telephone reception or water supply to your home. This may persist for some time.Ahead of the cyclone, try to store enough drinking water to provide 3 litres per person for several days (don’t forget water for your pets). Store water in bottles in the freezer – it keeps it cool if the power goes out and can be drinking water when it melts. You also need extra water for hygiene, cleaning up and toileting. Fill your bathtub or top-loading washing machine with water before the storm approaches.During a flood, sewage may come up through the toilet and the drains of dwellings on the ground level. Before the cyclone, cover your drains with plastic sheeting with a sandbag on top for weight. Place a plastic bag full of sand inside the toilet to form a plug and close the seat. Consider a bucket as a short-term option for toileting.Wait for flood waters to recede before unsealing the toilet. When the storm has passed, check local council advice on whether the sewerage system is functioning before attempting to flush the toilet again.If the power has been out, your fridge can remain cool; however, food inside may no longer be safe to eat. If items in your freezer have started to defrost, either cook immediately or dispose of them. Some medicines requiring refrigeration will also have to be thrown out.Don’t use electric appliances if they are wet and check for any potential gas leaks from gas appliances before use.Contact your insurance provider immediatelyIf you are likely to make an insurance claim, contact your insurer straight away for advice.The insurance company will probably ask for your policy number. Try to have it (and other important documents) on hand – perhaps in a waterproof wallet, or as photos on your phone.Fallen trees, howling wind and drunken parrots: bracing for Alfred, I remember another Queensland cycloneRead moreDon’t go straight into cleanup and recovery mode until you have checked their requirements. Ripping up wet carpets and throwing out your belongings may not be consistent with your insurance policy. Disposing of proof of damage may cause your claim to be rejected.Approaches vary between insurance companies. They may require photographs or a written inventory of damaged items. For instance, flood water will often leave a high-water mark on the walls. Take a photo with a ruler or bottle for reference. The more you can document, the less the insurance company can dispute.Before you head outsideDon’t leave your house until officials say it is safe to do so.If you have it, put on protective clothing and equipment, including fully covered shoes, gloves, glasses and an N95 mask. Wear a hat, long pants and long sleeves.Keep your children and pets secure inside for as long as you can, until you know the area is safe and clear.Switch off your electricity, gas and solar system prior to severe weather. Before switching everything back on, check your house and appliances for any obvious damage. Then check with your utility service provider that all is in order.Even if your house is without power, downed power lines may be live. Do not touch them, even if only wanting to move them. Call 000 if it is life threatening, or contact your local energy provider.Check for obvious structural damage to the house such as broken windows, water leaks or damaged roofs (such as missing tiles or screws). Beware of fallen or windswept debris and broken glass.Look out for wildlife and pests, including venomous snakes and spiders. Don’t poke anything to check if it’s alive.1:57Authorities say Tropical Cyclone Alfred's delayed crossing does not mean reduced impact – videoBefore you start cleaning upWear protective gear when dealing with water-damaged goods and mud. Don’t touch your face at all and if you can, wear a protective N95 mask.The mud and dirty water may be contaminated, so be sure to disinfect and wash your hands thoroughly.If you have cuts and scrapes, disinfect and cover them immediately, because there’s a high chance of infection.Following floods in northern Queensland this year,16 people died after being infected with melioidosis, a bacterium found in mud. The bug is more prevalent after heavy rainfall. If you feel unwell, seeking medical advice.Mould is another big issue after heavy rain and flooding. Open your windows to ventilate.Before you venture further afieldResist the urge to go sightseeing. Check on your neighbours and vulnerable community members instead.Talk to friends, family, neighbours and contacts about how you’re feeling. Be honest. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious and upset after a disaster event.If you need extra assistance, seek help. Community recovery hubs will be set up and they will have a list of telephone numbers for support. Use the services available.Check your local disaster dashboard or app for up-to-date information on road closures, evacuation centres and other emergency details.Yetta Gurtner is an adjunct senior lecturer at the Centre for Disaster Studies, James Cook University, This article was originally published onthe ConversationRead more of Guardian Australia’sTropical Cyclone Alfredcoverage:What we know so far about Cyclone AlfredWhy is it a big deal that Alfred could make landfall near Brisbane?How to prepare for a cycloneExplore more on these topicsTropical Cyclone AlfredQueenslandExtreme weatherFloodingNew South WalesexplainersShareReuse this content"

DeSantis also said he wanted to, potentially, get up to900 more associated positions “off the books”by scrapping 70 “redundant” entities such as advisory bodies.Democrats were quick to point out that Florida already has a voter-approvedgovernment efficiency taskforce, which was set up in 2006 with an almost identical mandate. DeSantis’s new efficiency team, they asserted, was itself an example of unnecessary spending, and a performative exercise of jumping on the Doge bandwagon to align himself with Donald Trump’s slash-and-burn approach to various taxpayer-funded federal agencies.“Republicans have been in total control of Florida’s government for nearly 30 years, and he wants to talk about government waste?” Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic party, saidin a statement.“Ron has consistently passed the largest state budgets in Florida’s history,illegally spent millions of taxpayer dollarsto run political campaigns, and justallocated $250mto fund his political stunt on immigration. Don’t lecture us on wasting taxpayer dollars.”Another level of perceived resistance came on Tuesday from an unexpected source: the leaders of both of Florida’s Republican-dominated legislative chambers.“Let’s focus on what matters. Let’s pass actual reforms rather than symbolic gestures,” Daniel Perez, the Florida house speaker, told members following DeSantis’s address.“Let’s repeal government programs instead of reshuffling them. Let’s swing for the fences and not just try to get on base.”Perez has previously noted that DeSantis, a self-styled fiscal conservative, benefited from a70% budget increasefor the executive office of the governor over his six years in office.He and the senate president, Ben Albritton,clashed with DeSantis in Januaryover the governor’s demand for a special legislative session to advance his immigration agenda. The parties came together to eventually pass a mutually acceptable hardline bill, but observers say tensions remain.Inremarks to the senate, Albritton, a member of the existing efficiency taskforce, said he was proud that Florida already “has a great framework for accountability”, and that he and other lawmakers had made a substantive number of recommendations “to improve flexibility [and] simplify processes”.“The fact is we are a state and nation of laws that should be created by elected officials accountable to the people who elected them, not appointed professional staff,” he said.Some observers noted that, after forcefully pushing both his Doge measure, and the related but unprecedentedpitch to replace Florida’s $40bn-a-year property tax structurewith an as yet unspecified alternative, DeSantis was relatively quiet about them during his Tallahassee address on Tuesday.He said “taxpayers need relief” from high property taxes, which he said made owners in effect tenants of the government, and that lawmakers were working on a proposal for “constitutional protections for Florida property owners” to place before voters in the 2026 election.“DeSantis’s latest scheme to eliminate property taxes threatens the very services that keep our communities safe and functioning. These taxes fund schools, fire departments, police, trash pickup, and safety on our roads and in our water, among other essential services,” said Jared Nordlund, Florida director of the civil rights and advocacy group UnidosUS.“Eliminating them will drive local governments into financial ruin, allowing the state to seize more control, a blatant attack on home rule and local democracy.“By the way, where was the update on his much-hyped Doge initiative? Just weeks ago, DeSantis promised a major push on this program, yet there was not a single mention. Was it just another empty headline grab? Floridians deserve answers, not political theater.”DeSantis’s office did not respond to a request for comment.On Thursday, theFloridian reportedthat Republican state representative Ryan Chamberlin was working on legislation to eliminate property taxes.The non-partisan Tax Foundation, meanwhile, questioned the advantage to Florida, which has no state income tax, of abolishing the traditional system by which state and local governments raise money.“The property tax is a relatively economically efficient tax. It corresponds better than most taxes to the benefits that people receive by paying it,” said Jared Walczak, the group’s vice-president of state projects.“The value of your home is not a perfect proxy for the value of local services you receive, but it is a far better approximation than you would get with, say, an income tax where sometimes you’re getting an inverse relationship between payment and benefits.“Most economists say property tax is a fairly good tax and therefore efforts to eliminate it are misguided. If Florida really had the revenue to eliminate the property tax, there are so many better things the state could do. If they don’t have that capacity, they would have to raise another tax or potentially dramatically reduce spending, and that could just be a very bad trade off.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsFloridaRon DeSantisnewsShareReuse this content"

But then the storms cameA decade after Chinese investment, La Mosquitia’s processing plant is sitting idle and jobs have been lost as the climate crisis takes its tollSupported byAbout this contentFritz Pinnowin La Mosquitia, HondurasFri 7 Mar 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 08.02 ESTShareIn 2014, Chinese investors visited La Mosquitia, a remote region in easternHonduras. Amazed by the abundant jellyfish, they eagerly installed a processing plant to export the product to China, where they are served as a delicacy.Encouraged by the new investments, local communities adopted jellyfish fishing, which quickly became a critical source of income. The trade provided economic benefits in an area with few jobs, increasing local incomes and building community resilience, despite concerns that large-scale jellyfish fishing can disturb marine ecosystems by disrupting food chains.Most local fishers saw it as a safer alternative todangerous lobster fishing practices, which can cause decompression sickness, leaving many paralysed and disabled. “When the jellyfish industry arrived we had high hopes, as it was supposed to be a community project,” says José Luis Centeno, president of the Territorial Council of Rayaka, in La Mosquitia.View image in fullscreenA fisher prepares to head out jellyfish fishing in La Mosquitia, Honduras, 15 February.Photograph: Fritz Pinnow/The GuardianTen years later, those hopes have been dashed after the jellyfish boom that prompted the investment was followed by years of low yields. Only two years – 2016 and 2021 – were considered successful.“When we started in 2014, we had about 300 employees and the jellyfish business was booming. Now, the processing plant stands still for around nine months every year,” says Terencio Escobar, 55, a community leader. “If the jellyfish are exposed to too much rainfall, for example, they quickly turn pink and form fungi, which makes them inedible.”The remoteness of the region has also left communities defenceless against drug traffickers, who use the labyrinth of rivers and jungle to hide their operationsThe jellyfish’s vulnerability to changes in climate makes harvesting possible only during the predominantly sunny seasons, which last about three months in Honduras. Extreme weather events frequently reduce or interrupt these windows of opportunity. During rough and rainy conditions, the harvest cannot be processed even if fishers catch a decent amount.The most recent example was in 2024, whentropical storm Saraflooded the northern coast with heavy rains, damaging the community’s infrastructure and shutting down the jellyfish industry for two months. Fishers – who are paid by each bucket turned into the processing plant – mainly carry the risks of these shifting fishing conditions.View image in fullscreenTerencio Escobar displays jellyfish that have gone rotten due to too much rainfall, destroying the day’s catch.Photograph: Fritz Pinnow/The GuardianThe price for a bucket is often arbitrary and “for every 100 buckets, they [managers of the processing plant] deduct 5% of the pay for good measure,” a fisher says under condition of anonymity. For each bucket containing approximately 19kg of jellyfish, a fisher could receive between 14 and 22 lempiras (43p and 68p), depending on demand or the plant managers’ willingness to pay.In perfect conditions, a fisher could catch about 100 buckets of jellyfish, equating to as much as 2,200 lempiras. However, on a bad day, this could be as little 20 buckets or none at all.According to fishers’ representatives, yield-based payments carry a high financial risk. Most fishers must rent a boat and motor, hire help and buy gasoline, which is expensive in the region. With the boat rental alone costing 400 to 500 lempiras, a day’s fishing can cost about 900 lempiras, once other costs have been added. If prices are low, the fishers must catch 65 buckets a day just to break even.The prices paid to Honduran producers contrast with those of a profitable sector worldwide. Considered aculinary delicacyin some countries, the retail value of salted and packaged jellyfishis about £35 a kilo. According to local sources, the production costs of those exported from La Mosquitia are no higher than £5 a kilo.Since 2014, the drop in income and number of jobscaused by the fall in jellyfish productionhas made life increasingly hard for Indigenous communities, the majority of whom are Miskitos, in a region where the state has little presence and provides few resources.The remoteness of the region has left communities defenceless against drug traffickers, who use the labyrinth of rivers and hard-to-travel sections of jungle to hide their operations. Violence, kidnappings and disappearances are common, with Indigenous people often caught in the crossfire during the government’s counter-operations. According to Centeno, local communities are not involved in drug trafficking, but the government’s armed forcesclaim many residents collaborate and benefit from the trade, due to the lack of other job opportunities.View image in fullscreenA warehouse where jellyfish are processed after their ‘heads’ have been separated stands empty.Photograph: Fritz Pinnow/The GuardianBesides the violence, the region is also one of the most expensive in Honduras, due to its dependence on small shipments of goods that can take several days to reach La Mosquitia. Even essential products are often unaffordable for fishers and their families.“Often, we would go out to fish and the weather would surprise us with rain or large waves in the afternoon,” says a fisher who didn’t want to be named. “Then you sit there with maybe five buckets and a huge debt you must pay off. It has happened to everyone here.”In the male-dominated industry, the women who work in the processing plant separating the “head” from the rest of the jellyfish, also suffer from the unpredictable trade. Paid just five lempiras a bucket, they earn less than halfthe minimum wage in Honduras.View image in fullscreenSintia Monico Lopez (left) with Hermaina Meltan Lopez, who both work at the jellyfish processing plant in La Mosquitia.Photograph: Fritz Pinnow/The Guardian“Sometimes we would sit in the processing hall and wait for fishers to bring jellyfish, but they would not catch anything all day. Those days we are not paid at all,” says Sintia Monico Lopez, who works in the processing plant.Centeno grieves the loss of an industry that had held such promise for La Mosquitia. “The jellyfish industry here has let us down,” he says. “The community is bearing the industry’s risks, not the benefits.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanMarine lifeFishingHondurasAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In her new book Minority Rule, she contends that embracing identity politics and culture wars has not always served the working class well. “By making a virtue of marginalisation, breaking ourselves down into ever smaller and mutually hostile groupings, we make it impossible to build a mass movement capable of taking on extreme concentrations of wealth and power,” she writes. Policing language and embracing concepts such as “lived experience” and “white privilege” has discouraged solidarity and alienated would-be allies.If she was looking to avoid conflict, this is a curious way to go about it. Such sentiments could be seen as throwing her allies under the bus and giving her opponents plenty of ammunition, hence the recent Daily Telegraph headlineThe Queen of woke just exposed the hypocrisy of the virtue-signalling left. The implication is that Sarkar adopted identity politics when it suited her in the past, but is now reversing her position.Sarkar doesn’t see it like that. “There are obviously things that I’ve shifted on,” she says when we meet. “I definitely had that phase in my early 20s of being, like, [she points around the room] ‘White privilege, white privilege, white privilege.’ You could point at a floor lamp and be like, ‘Neo-colonial ideology.’ In part that’s to do with being an arts and humanities graduate, where you are trained to look at everything as language and narrative and discourse … but this idea that I was somebody who was advancing a narrative around hypersensitivity and saying it’s a good thing, I don’t think really fits the facts.”View image in fullscreen‘I read the comments. And I know I shouldn’t’ … Ash Sarkar.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianWhat she is arguing for is less a 180-degree pivot than a return to first principles. “I see it as a way to reflect on the last 15-odd years and say: ‘What happens if I try to look at this through a rigorously materialist lens?’ So that doesn’t mean throwing away anti-racism or pretending that everybody has the same experience of society but looking at the economic forces in society, the way in which politics is mediated through institutions of legacy media, social media, and saying: ‘Where does that get me?’”Understandably, the “woke is dead” aspect of Sarkar’s book has been seized upon by her detractors; less so the part where she lays out how the right has weaponised identity politics, and done a few 180-degree turns of its own when it suits it. For example, she chronicles how in the early 2000s, the rightwing media were only too happy to brand swathes of the country as “chavs” and “benefit scroungers” – or as one broadsheet columnist called them, “lard-gutted slappers” and “dismal ineducables” – as epitomised by Little Britain’s Vicky Pollard caricature (a dim-witted teenager in a pink shell suit with multiple babies of varying ethnicities). But some time around 2015, this exact same demographic somehow morphed into “the white working class” – decent folk who had been left behind by forces beyond their control, including preferential treatment for other marginalised groups: immigrants, black and brown people.Sarkar is by no means the first person to recognise that identity politics can end up building barriers rather than bridges between groups who really ought to be on the same side. Or that whenever the working class gets together and gains some power, it is met with opposition – Thatcherism versus the unions, for example, or the shift from heavy industry (which brought diverse employees together) to more atomising, isolating gig-economy jobs like Uber drivers and Amazon warehouse workers. “I don’t think that it’s a case of, ‘we all spontaneously became shit leftists’,” she says. “I think that there’s been 45 years of economic forces preying on us to turn us into different kinds of people.”Sarkar, 32, has not been a mere spectator to this recent history; she has been an active part of it – albeit, in her telling, an almost accidental one. She never wanted to be a journalist, let alone on TV, she says. Born and raised in north London, daughter to a single mother, she studied English literature at University College London and imagined going on to do a PhD, but in 2011 her friends James Butler and Aaron Bastani founded the independent leftwing organisationNovara Media, initially as a community radio show. “I had all these suggestions for them of things they should cover, and I think I could be quite annoying when I was telling them: ‘You should look at this thing; what about this that’s happening in Baltimore?’” So Bastani put her on the show.They were the “downwardly mobile, socially liberal” generation who were “radicalised” by tuition fees, trade unionists and the old Labour left, she says. And whenJeremy Corbynbecame Labour leader in 2015, buoyed by the swelling ranks of the Labour-left Momentum movement, there was a sudden demand from the media for voices like theirs. “There weren’t very many labour MPs who wanted to go out to bat for him because they fucking hated the guy.”View image in fullscreenSarkar’s new book, Minority Rule.Photograph: PRShe seemed to take to television like a fish to water – as illustrated by her viral moment in 2018 where she closed down an argument with Piers Morgan with the immortal line, “I’m literally a communist.” (In a nutshell, Morgan was accusing her of being “pro-Obama” on account of her criticism of Trump; Sarkar was pointing out she had criticised Obama, too). She’s been a fixture of discussion shows ever since, where she’s often applauded for saying what the other pundits and politicians won’t, with clarity and intelligence but also wit. “The reason why that’s possible is because I don’t like these people,” she says. “I don’t want to be friends with them. I don’t want to go to Ed [Balls] and Yvette [Cooper]’s for dinner.”The high point of that period was the 2017 general election, post-Brexit referendum, in which Corbyn exceeded expectations, gaining 30 seats, and Theresa May’s Conservatives lost their outright majority. “I was 25,” Sarkar writes, “and certain that the left was on the brink of making history.” Two years later, though, Boris Johnson swept to a landslide victory in the 2019 election, and Corbyn himself was history.She describes the difference between those two elections as “night and day”. The summer of 2017 was glorious, she recalls. It was the year crowds were chanting “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!” at Glastonbury. “There was optimism, there was joy, and there was a sense of a big ‘us’ that was being brought together,” she says. “And I think that, because it was so dizzying, it was difficult to see your own weaknesses: who’s not being brought along? Who don’t you have? … I think that so many of us were blind to what was going to come next, which was a populist reinvention of the right.”We don’t need to relitigate that Brexit-warped period of political history in detail, but as one of Corbyn’s key allies and campaigners, she has had to accept that the summer of 2017 was as good as it was going to get for the Momentum left, and despite having “won the argument”, Corbyn was unable to build enough of a coalition to gain power. What went wrong?View image in fullscreen‘You can’t make a leader anyone other than who they are’ … Keir Starmer and Jeremy Corbyn in 2019.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images“You can’t make a leader anyone other than who they are,” says Sarkar. “And Corbyn’s instincts are to try and build some kind of consensus, compromise. He hates conflict. And you look at successful populists, whether they’re on the right or the left, it could be [Brazil’s leftwing president] Lula, it could be Nigel Farage … one of the things that all these people have in common is that they seek out conflict.” There is still room for a grassroots, anti-politics movement of the left, she says, but “successful populists are like sharks,” she says. “Blood in the water; they swim towards it, not away from it. And I think that if you’re looking at any form of left populism, you need a leader like that – a mad bastard.”Something tells meKeir Starmerdoesn’t fit that bill for Sarkar. She sees him as “a symptom of broken institutions. He’s the result of the rightwing of the Labour party knowing that they couldn’t have control of the party unless it was by deception.” She voted Green in the 2024 election, and has little positive to say about Starmer’s reign so far. “I can’t hold much personal animus for him, because he’s just a balloon in the shape of a man; it’s other people’s ambitions that have filled him up.”Let’s see: someone who’s quick-witted, media-literate and, despite protestations to the contrary, gravitates towards conflict. Is Sarkar putting herself forward for political life?“God, no,” she says, nearly choking on her coffee. Her arguments against it are not particularly convincing: that journalists don’t make good strategists; that the answer to the problem of the left cannot be a graduate from London. But she doesn’t completely rule it out. “Maybe it’s like having kids, and at some point hormones kick in and you really want it. But right now, I don’t, really.”Sarkar really doesn’t seek out conflict, she insists. “I hate arguments in real life. If me and my partner [she is married but prefers to keep her private life private] are annoyed with each other, I do avoidance jiu-jitsu” and: “If somebody sent me the wrong dish in a restaurant, I would eat it.” Work is something different, though. “This job, or the way I am for the job, it’s a reflection of things that I really feel and I really believe, but it’s not a reflection of how I think about conflict at all.”And yet, she can’t resist a good … exchange of ideas, let’s say. Despite identifying social media and broadcast media as part of the problem in her book, Sarkar is still prominent on both – especially now she’s got a book to promote. She has been anactive presenceon X/Twitter, where she has over 400,000 followers, for over a decade and she is still on there, often engaging one-to-one on issues such as immigration, race, Israel and Palestine, trans rights, you name it.View image in fullscreen‘There are obviously things that I’ve shifted on’ … Sarkar.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“My husband’s always telling me, ‘Put the crack pipe down,’ but I can’t,” she admits. “I have a pathological need to be right, and it’s so easy to derail me by making me feel like I’ve got an argument to win.”She says she loves the concise format of X, likening it to joke-writing or the quippy pop culture she grew up on, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or grime MCs battling it out. But as an opinionated, leftwing, Asian, Muslim woman, she receives more hateful comments than just about anyone – not just garden-variety trolling and insults but the ugliest forms of racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, and threats of violence.Does she read the comments? “Yeah, I do. And I know I shouldn’t.”Does it not get to her? “Oh yeah. How do I put this … ?” She pauses, for pretty much the only time in the hour we’ve been talking. “The stuff which is really racist or sexually intrusive, it feels like people are crawling all over your body. You play a role in other people’s psyches, and you’ve got no control over that, over that version of you that’s in their head.”She knows the sensible thing to do is log off. “But where will I get my dopamine from then?” she says. She’s only half joking.Ash Sarkar: ‘I never learned much of value from TV’Read moreWhether or not Sarkar’s book marks a change of direction in her beliefs, it feels like the summation of a tumultuous political era, one that has given rise to her own career. It almost feels as if she’s about to embark on a new phase. So what’s next?“I have no idea,” she says. She talks of other book projects, and even training as a chef. “My proudest boast is, I gave Nigella Lawson a recipe, and it was in her last cookbook.” But, as always, there’s no strategic master plan. She’s being led by her intuition, she says. “I’ll know what’s next when I see it.”Minority Rule: Adventures in the Culture War by Ash Sarkar is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

From hospitals to transport, stadiums to crematoriums, here are some of the adjustments being made.Sports stadiumsAt the 2014 football World Cup in Brazil, organisers said 1,675 seats had been reserved for obese people or people with disabilities – the first time tickets for obese people were offered at a Fifa event.To qualify for a ticket, people were required to submit a medical certificate saying they had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more.Providing seats for larger football fans is now standard practice at major matches, with Fifa’sstadium guidelinesstating that “easy access extra-width seating” for obese adults or those with limited mobility should be available. These should be as wide as two standard general admission seats and be able to support a weight of 250kg (39st 5lb).Hospitals and ambulancesView image in fullscreenBariatric ambulances are designed and equipped to deal with patients over 158kg.Photograph: ollo/Getty ImagesOver the past decade, ambulance services have invested significant sums in bariatric ambulances, designed and equipped to deal with patients over 158kg (25st), in response to a rise in obesity-related hospital visits.These usually have double-width trolley stretchers, heavy-duty wheelchairs and reinforced tail-lifts. Other vehicles have been fitted with lifts, hoists and larger stretchers to help transport bigger patients.The Timesreportedthat the NHS spent £10m on bariatric equipment in 2021-22, up from £5m in 2018-19. This was for specific beds and mortuary fridges for obese people, as well as larger wheelchairs and crutches with higher weight limits.In 2022-23 there were a record 1.2m obesity-relatedNHShospital admissions, almost double the number of five years previously.AirlinesView image in fullscreenPlane travel has become increasingly difficult for obese passengers.Photograph: Radist/Getty Images/iStockphotoAirlines are increasingly trying to squeeze more passengers on to flights as they respond to rising demand, and aeroplane seats are getting smaller as a result. Some airlines have rebranded their seats as “slimline” – in Air Canada’s introduction of slimline seats, widths dropped from 47cm (18.5ins) to 43cm.As a result, plane travel has become increasingly difficult for obese passengers, with many airlines suggesting larger passengers book two seats instead of one, often at full price, and offering seatbelt extensions.Although not specifically targeted at larger passengers, Ryanair allows flyers to book two flight tickets, one under the name “extra comfort seat”, giving them the width of two seats and more personal space.Air France offers a 25% discount on extra seats for larger-bodied passengers if “the width of the seat is not sufficient”. Under Canadian airline rules, obese passengers travelling domestically can request an extra seat free of charge if they provide their BMI, height, weight and seated width measurements.Crematoriums and undertakersView image in fullscreenThere is growing demand for oversized funeral caskets.Photograph: Kzenon/AlamyAccording to theNational Association of Funeral Directors(NAFD) in the UK, the average coffin width has increased from around 51-56cm (20-22ins) to 56-61cm over the past decade.The organisation said funeral directors had invested in new equipment, such as rise-and-fall decks in funeral vehicles, bariatric stretchers, larger-size mortuary refrigerators and dedicated lifting equipment.Staff are often required to act as pallbearers for larger individuals, although heavier coffins are normally transported via specially designed trolleys to avoid injury.There is growing demand for oversized caskets and in some cases undertakers have imported reinforced caskets from the US measuring up to 132cm wide,the Times reported.Some of these are too wide to fit in a standard burial plot and sometimes when an obese person had been due to be buried in the same plot as a loved one they have had to be placed elsewhere if there were already plots on either side.Some councils have introduced an extra charge for people needing wider coffins and burial plots, which the NAFD has said is an “unfair, discriminatory burden”.Adaptations have also been made in crematoriums.Sandwell councilupgraded to extra-wide 110cm furnaces, partly to cater for larger coffin sizes.TheatresMany theatres now provide information on the exact width and dimensions of seats to help larger adults decide whether the venue will be accessible for them.For instance, Chorley theatre in Lancashire has “fat accessibility information” listed on itswebsite, which states that each seat is 50cm wide, 47cm deep and has 30cm of legroom, and all seats have small, immovable armrests.This is something that has been promoted by theFat Friendly Seatcampaign, which urges UK theatres to actively address the needs of larger people and advocates for wider seats.ClothingMany high street retailers now offer plus-size clothing ranges specifically designed for larger bodies, as body positivity and size inclusivity have become more widely adopted by the fashion industry.Other clothing retailers have extended the sizing range of their main clothing lines. Primark offers up to a women’s size 22 in some of its basic range clothing items. (In the UK, plus-size clothing is usually considered to be size 16 and upwards.)The global plus-size women’s clothing market has been growing steadily in recent years and was valued at $114.1bn in 2023.Plus-size models are increasingly seen on catwalks, and in 2019 Nike introduced plus-size mannequins into its stores.Explore more on these topicsObesityHospitalsEmergency servicesNHSAirline industryTheatreFashion industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But amid the devastation, some things seem to be surviving that really should be taken down. Among the most notable of these is an arcane set of international agreements by which private investors can sue governments, known as ISDS: investor-state dispute settlement. These disputes are litigated not in public courts with impartial judges but in private arbitration – behind closed doors, and rife with conflicts of interest.Early on, when they were snuck into many trade agreements, no one paid much attention. For instance, these provisions in Nafta, the so-called free trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada, never got a discussion within the cabinet while I served in the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton when Nafta got adopted.Quick GuideWhat is ISDS and how does it work?ShowWhat is it?Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) was created to help companies protect investments abroad. It allows companies to sue countries for lost profits caused by government action including corruption, seizure of assets or the introduction of health and environmental policies.The system wascreated in the 1960sby the World Bank. It was intended to give companies confidence to invest in poorer countries with weak political systems where they might not get a fair hearing in domestic courts.How does it work?The foreign company must put forward a case showing that the state has damaged its profits. Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals include ISDS clauses. Cases are heard by a private arbitration tribunal, and typically decided by a panel of three arbitrators – one chosen by the company, one chosen by the state and the third selected jointly.How much are the cases worth?Awards regularly amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, and some are in the billions. In 2024 the average amount awarded was$385m(£304m).  The average sum awardedis increasingand these payouts can make up a sizeable chunk of poorer countries' annual budgets.Who is involved?The fossil fuel and mining industries are the most litigious in the ISDS system, accounting formore than 30%of known cases.Most claims are brought by companies based in rich countries against the governments of developing countries. Companies registered in developed countries file81% of ISDS lawsuits, according to UN data, while developing countries have faced 62% of cases.How common is it?ISDS began as an obscure legal mechanism, averaging aboutone case a yearfor its first decade. Now, dozens are brought every year, with Guardian analysis finding more than 900 since 2013.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The provisions were sold as protecting property rights from expropriation – but that was nonsense: few expropriations occur today, and the World Bank and governments around the world provide insurance against expropriation. They were sold, too, as encouraging investment – but in the decades since they began to be a feature of international agreements, there is little evidence that they make much or any difference, which is why today some countries that have signed such agreements have given notice that they are terminating them.Investigative reporting by the Guardian has given us a glimpse into exactly how large and consequential these suits have becomeWhat the agreements do is provide companies with opportunity to sue for compensation when there is a change in regulation which they claim might impair their future profits. That compensation is not based only on what they lost – say their investment, that is no longer so profitable – but on what they might have received in profits: an entirely nebulous amount. In my view it has become a form of legal terrorism, that rich companies use to discourage countries from addressing the needs of their citizens and protecting the global environment.Uruguay was sued when it proposed requiring cigarette companies to disclose that cigarettes are dangerous to one’s health – a disclosure that most advanced countries require. The labelling would, admittedly, discourage smoking – that was the point – and that in turn would hurt these companies’ profits. Fossil fuel companies around the world have sued as governments have undertaken actions to curtail emissions. As one of the lawyers specialising in these disputes said of the provisions: “It wouldn’t matter if a substance was liquid plutonium destined for a child’s breakfast cereal. If the government bans a product and a … company loses profits, the company can claim damages.”Claim damages – and win them – they have. Because of the secrecy in which much of these actions are cloaked, it has been hard to assess the magnitude. Investigative reporting by the Guardian has given us a glimpse into exactly how large and consequential these suits have become, showing more than $120bn (£94bn) of public money has been awarded to private investors since 1975, $84bn to the fossil fuel industry alone.The world faces a debt and development crisis, and many countries have burdens of debt so high that they are encroaching into expenditures on health, education, climate, and development itself. These payouts are adding massively to this debt burden – and risk doing so even more. Globally, they are an impediment to climate action: countries are afraid if they pass a carbon tax or a carbon regulation they will be sued. Even if they eventually win, they will be tied up in courts for years. The deep pockets of the suing corporations have been enriched further by a new industry: investors in these litigations, who see these suits as just another gamble from which they might win. The fiscal heft of the suers often outweighs that of a poor developing country. The trading and financing of these suits by hedge funds may have fundamentally changed their nature: from a judicial way of compensating someone for a particular class of harm, to just another gambling instrument.These are not the only inequities: US courts have consistently ruled that one does not have to pay compensation for a change in a regulation that adversely affects the profits of a company – good regulations are part of the fundamental rights and obligations of the government. But with these agreements, foreign companies can sue the US government: they are givenmorerights than American companies!It’s time to end this travesty on justice. We need an overarching international agreement ending ISDS. In the meanwhile, individual countries should give notice that they are exiting such agreements and leaving ICSID, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.Ending this system is imperative: if we don’t, we’ll face a whole new set of barriers to preventing climate change; and developing countries and emerging markets will face ever-growing debt burdens– from increasing payouts to companies that ruin the health of citizens and the sustainability of the planet.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsInvestor-state dispute settlementThe age of extinctionEconomicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

And discovered that a change in the US administration, and USAid funding cuts, means there is a growing fear of prison breaksA few weeks ago,Michael Safitravelled to north-east Syria, an area controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Here, suspected foreign fighters forIslamic State– including those from Britain – have for years been imprisoned without charge and with no idea of when they would be released.Few prisoners in the camp say they are IS members. Michael and fellow journalist,Will Christou,spoke to a former British surgeon from Leicester who told a surprising story of being ‘tricked’ into crossing intoSyriafrom Turkey. They also met an Australian prisoner, who admitted to being an IS member, and whose family for years did not know his whereabouts.The Kurdish forces running the prison want foreign governments to take their fighters back. Many have refused – they prefer to forget about these IS legacies. They would also like to forget about the women and children from former IS-controlled territory who are being held in camps in this area, and who come from countries around the world.Nearby, meanwhile, IS fighters still lurk – and still carry out attacks, journalistBaderkhan Ahmadtells Michael. Two years ago, they attacked the Panorama detention centre and hundreds died in the two-week battle; 400 prisoners are still unaccounted for.Now, global political events are making the prison and camp organisers worry they are even more vulnerable. They fear the Trump administration will pull US troops out of Syria, while USAid cuts have meant there were days when no food or water arrived at the camps housing women and children. Although the funding has been extended, it is not clear for how long.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsIslamic StateToday in FocusSyriaUS foreign policyKurds"

Between hearings, he met journalists and activists to spread word of the health crisis his people face.“A people have been completely destroyed: people’s way of life destroyed; people’s only drinking water, which is the underground water aquifer, has been poisoned; people’s farmland has been completely poisoned; people’s streams that they use [for] their normal livelihood have been completely destroyed,” he said.When oil first flowed from the wells in Ogoniland in 1956, before Okpabi was born, it was a lush landscape of mangrove forests. Its sparkling watercourses were populated by fishes, crabs, oysters and other creatures. The land’s people were primarily fishers and farmers.Five and a half decades later, scientists from the UN Environment Programme visited the region to investigate the industry’s effects. They found extensive soil and groundwater contamination, mangrove roots choked with bitumen-like substances, surface water in creeks and streams covered in thick layers of oil. The fish had fled or died and farmers struggled to grow crops in fields soaked with oil.View image in fullscreenA sign at a creek in Ogale, in Ogoniland in the Niger delta, warns people not to use the water.Photograph: Leigh DayOf all the areas tested,Nisisioken Ogale, Okpabi’s domain, was “of most immediate concern”. People there were drinking from wells contaminated with benzene, a known carcinogen, at levels more than 900 times the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. Follow-up testing carried out in the same area last year found levels that were even higher – 2,600 times the WHO guideline.The effects of this contamination have been tragic, says Okpabi. “There is a lot of cancer: young girls of 20 to 30 years old, 40 years old, developing breast cancer and other forms of cancer; a lot of strange skin diseases that we don’t know the cause of; low life expectancy, people just drying up and dying. Even eye diseases. In some cases birth defects … Strange diseases everywhere in our lives.”The trial centres on claims by Oganiland’s Ogale and Bille communities that the enduring effects of hundreds of leaks and spills from Shell’s pipelines and infrastructure have breached their right to a clean and healthy environment.The three and a half weeks of hearings, which ended on Friday, were a “preliminary issues trial”, heard by Mrs Justice Juliet May, to determine the scope of the legal issues to be decided at the case’s full trial, set for late 2026. Although the case is being heard by a British judge in a UK court, it will apply Nigerian law, and so May heard from a range of senior Nigerian lawyers about what the law is and how it should be applied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A second key issue was whether Shell could be held responsible for damage to its pipelines due to oil theft, or for the waste produced as a result of illegal refining of spilled or stolen oil – endemic in the Niger delta.Shell argues it cannot be held responsible. The company insists its Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), works closely with the Nigerian government to prevent spills and to respond to them and clean them up when they do occur.View image in fullscreenA man stands on fishing canoes surrounded by polluted water in the Niger Delta.Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP“We strongly believe in the merits of our case.Oilis being stolen on an industrial scale in the Niger delta.

Accounts from people held at the detention centre describe being repeatedly tortured by their captors.Nearby was a large burial site with at least 550 unmarked graves, many of them freshly dug and a number apparently containing multiple bodies.Map and satellite image showing where graves were foundThe site is the biggest makeshift burial ground found in Sudan during its civil war and, if confirmed, would make this one of the worst war crimes of Sudan’s brutal conflict.People rescued from the detention centre at the base’s southern perimeter, about 40 miles (70km) north of the capital,Khartoum, said that many had died inside and were believed to be buried nearby.Examination of survivors by doctors found myriad signs of torture and concluded they were being starved.The RSF took over the base, close to the village of Garri, as a command and training centre afterfighting beganwith the Sudanese military almost two years ago. Satellite images and military sources confirm that no graves were present at the location before the war started on 15 April 2023.View image in fullscreenHundreds of makeshift graves discovered at a mass burial site on a former RSF base. Breeze blocks have been used as crude headstones.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The GuardianThe conflict has caused one of theworld’s worst famines in decades, killed tens of thousands of people and forced more than 14 million people to leave their homes.Human Rights Watch(HRW), which has investigated abuses throughout Sudan during the war, said the detention centre site could constitute “one of the largestatrocity crime scenesdiscovered in Sudan since the war started”, and called for UN war crime investigators to be given access.Dr Hosham al-Shekh, who examined 135 men who were found there after the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) recaptured the site in late January, said clinical evidence of torture and chronic malnutrition was widespread.Shekh told the Guardian that the men – all of whom were civilians – were so traumatised when they were discovered that many could not speak.“When we got there, they couldn’t even walk out. We had to carry them out. They had marks of being severely beaten, tortured,” he said. “Some of them were badly injured from the torture.View image in fullscreenThe entrance to what’s believed to be a torture chamber in the detention centre, with manacles attached to the bars.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The Guardian“Some of them had been shot in the leg with a bullet. They were beaten with sticks which left marks: clean straight scars from being beaten. All of them were tortured.”One man was beaten so frequently by RSF guards that he adopted a prolonged foetal position to protect himself.“They beat me in the morning and at night, they discriminated against me. I got so used to sitting with my knees tucked up that now I cannot straighten my legs to walk,” he said in a statement to Sudanese military medical staff.The findings raise questions over the credibility of the RSF, coming days after itsigned a political charter in Kenya to establish a parallel Sudanese governmentin areas it controls.Satellite images of the base confirm that the graves appeared only after the war began and after the RSF occupied the site. An image taken weeks after thewar beganshows no trace of burial mounds beside a single-track road on the base.Another image of the same location, captured a year later on 25 May 2024, reveals a significant number of mounds stretching over a distance of about 200 metres.Satellite view of the desert area in 2023 and 2024.

Photograph: Planet LabsCapt Jalal Abaker, of the Sudanese military, said he had served on the Garri base up to the outbreak of war in 2023 and said there was no burial site then. “I was there until Ramadan that year [22 March to 20 April 2023],” he said. “There was no cemetery.”Sgt Mohammed Amin, who is now stationed at Garri, said: “All the bodies buried there died on the base.”Shekh added that survivors talked of other captives dying. “A lot of them told me that a lot had passed away inside. Many, they said, died because of the torture.”A senior Sudanese army officer, Col Bashir Tamil, said detainees were found with their hands and feet tied together. “They were in a very bad condition with marks on their bodies and injuries,” he added.View image in fullscreenThe ceiling of the detention centre was disfigured by bullet holes.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The GuardianJean-Baptiste Gallopin, atHRW’s crisis, conflict and arms division, said it was “vital” that the authorities in control of the base treated it as a potential war crime site and made “immediate efforts to secure, collect and safeguard evidence that may be critical for accountability efforts”.The site, so far, appears to be fully preserved with no public access with the Sudanese military protecting the location to safeguard evidence. International mass grave experts hope independent analysts will be allowed access to the site.Many of the conflict’s most notorious atrocities have occurred in the western region of Darfur, with the RSF and allied Arab militias accused ofethnic cleansing.

Until recently, the group occupied so much territory in the region that it may have believed the site was secure from attack.The RSF has been contacted for comment. When accused of abuses in the past, the group hasrespondedby forwarding a code of conduct banning mistreatment of detainees and saying it had a committee to investigate abuses and prosecute those responsible.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSudanWar crimesAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaConflict and armsHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the Doge team returned on Thursday, accompanied by agents with the US Marshals Service and Peter Marocco, a state department official charged with dismantling US Agency for International Development (USAid), according to a government official familiar with the situation. This time, they were able to gain access to the building, the official said, and no staff was present.Later on Thursday afternoon, the agency’s president, Ward Brehm, filed a lawsuit accusing Doge, Marocco and the White House of “ignor[ing] statutory requirements” and “pretend[ing] that leadership of the agency does not exist” in an attempt to “kill” the USADF. According to the complaint, Brehm says the Doge team attempted to access the agency using “false pretenses” and “bullying tactics”.“If Doge achieves its goal of shutting down the USADF, we will feel the ripple effects across the African continent and in the United States,” Brehm said in a statement on Thursday.Scores of legal challenges have been lodged against the sweeping project to upend the government bureaucracy, producing a spate of court rulings declaring the halting of aid illegal and ordering the reinstatement of fired federal workers.In Wednesday’s episode, workers instructed a security guard at USADF’s headquarters to deny the Doge team access when they arrived with Marocco. Trump is trying to install him in a similar role at USADF.Staff cited a letter sent by Brehm, who was not present at the time, to a Doge subordinate the previous day making clear that his team would not be allowed to access the agency’s offices in his absence.“In my absence, I have specifically instructed the staff of USADF to adhere to our rules and procedure of not allowing any meetings of this type without my presence,” he wrote, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by the Guardian.Brehm also declined to cooperate with Marocco unless he was officially appointed to the agency’s board.“I will look forward to working with Mr Marocco after such time that he is nominated for a seat on the board and his nomination is confirmed by the Senate,” Brehm wrote.“Until these legal requirements are met, Mr Marocco does not hold any position or office with USADF, and he may not speak or act on the foundation’s behalf.”About 30 workers were in the building when Marocco arrived with a Doge team – described as young men wearing backpacks – intent on carrying out firings based on an executive order issued by Trump on 19 February, theWashington Post reported.The standoff, led by one of the smallest government agencies, with only about 50 employees, has been cheered by government officials as a mighty act of resistance against Trump and Musk’s war on the federal bureaucracy.“This is the little agency that could,” the official said.Trump’sorderdeclared USADF and three other agencies – the Presidio Trust, the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) and the United States Institute of Peace – as “unnecessary” and subject to elimination.Wednesday’s standoff followeda similar exchangeat the IAF’s headquarters earlier this week.The workers’ defiant stand comes after Democrats publicly condemned the attempted dismantling of the agency as illegal.“Any attempt to unilaterally dismantle the USADF through executive action violates the law and exceeds the constitutional limits of executive authority,” Democratic members of the House of Representatives’ foreign affairs committee wrote in a24 February letterto Trump.Democrats havearguedthat Doge lacks the authority to eliminate an independent entity created by Congress, and that attempts to install Marocco as the acting chair of USADF and IAF are unlawful.The official familiar with the situation said that unlike other federal agencies such asUSAid, USADF is a “congressionally chartered corporation” operated by a board of directors whose members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.“It’s expressed in the statute that you can’t dissolve ADF except by an act of Congress,” the official said. “The president [of ADF] doesn’t take orders from anyone except for the board. The president [of ADF] isn’t even authorized to take orders from the president of the United States.”The agency, created by Congress in 1980 to support small businesses and grassroots organisations serving marginalised communities in Africa, has long enjoyed broad bipartisan support. Between 2019 and 2023, it handed out grants worth about $141m to 1,050 community enterprises serving 6.2 million people.This article was amended on 7 March 2025 to clarify Peter Marocco’s role as a state department official and remove the inaccurate claim that USAid was shuttered.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationAfricaElon MuskDonald TrumpUS politicsUSAidnewsShareReuse this content"

Andrea’s father traveled to Mexico several times but did not make contact with either of them.Atlanta child missing for seven years found safe in ColoradoRead moreThe missing persons case went cold until 2023, when a police detective began to re-investigate Andrea’s abduction.“Using a combination of interviews, search warrants and social media,” detective Kealyn Nivakoff determined that Reyes was residing in the Mexican city of Puebla – with a population of more than 1 million people – after her abduction by Tenorio, police said.Advanced DNA testing confirmed the relationship between Reyes and her father, who were finally able to reconnect after more than two decades.“Over the years, Andrea’s father searched tirelessly, but never heard from his daughter or her mother,” the DNA testing company Othram, which was involved in the case, said in anews release.The identification of Reyes was part of an initiative to resolve more than 500 cases involving minors and contained in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, the company said.“This case reflects the hard work of our officers and detectives,” the New Haven police chief, Karl Jacobson, said. “While cases may have investigative leads exhausted at the time, no cold case is ever truly closed.“We remain committed to resolving every cold case, and this is a perfect example of that effort.”Reyes, who is now 27 years old, is a resident ofMexico, Othram said. An arrest warrant for Tenorio remains active and valid within the United States, according to police, adding that they believe the kidnapping suspect is still in Mexico.Explore more on these topicsConnecticutUS crimeMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We ask that they bring the dogs … that are certified to find human remains and bones,” Índira Navarro, a representative of the collective,told AFP.The crematorium was found on a ranch that was secured by authorities several months ago, in an operation that led to the arrest of 10 armed people, the release of two that had been kidnapped, and the discovery of a body.The ranch, which included a rudimentary kind of obstacle course, is thought to have been used as a recruitment and training centre for new members of theJalisco New Generation cartel.‘An atmosphere of terror’: the bloody rise of Mexico’s top cartelRead moreThe Jalisco cartel,recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration, is one of Mexico’s most powerful organised crime groups and is involved in the trafficking of drugs and people across the country and internationally.Authoritiessaidthey had been unable to explore the extensive ranch fully when they first found it, and that the ovens and bones found this week had been “hidden under a layer of earth and a brick slab, which prevented their detection in the initial inspection”.When members of the collective arrived at the ranch this week, they found a shed with clothing, handbags, backpacks, suitcases and shoes scattered across the ground. Within a few hours they found the first of three underground ovens.Authorities are yet to determine how many people the remains found on the ranch may belong to.According to the National Search Commission, Jalisco has almost 15,000 missing people, making it the state with the most disappeared people inMexico.Across Mexico, more than 100,000 people are registered as disappeared.But that figure could be an undercount, given that many fear to report cases to the authorities.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The collusion offence carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, while Lai also faces a charge related to “seditious publications”.“It is desperate now,” Sebastien Lai told journalists at a briefing in London organised by the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) rights group. “I really don’t know how long my father has.”UN rights experts have called for Lai’s release, as have western governments including Britain.A UK government spokesperson said: “British national Jimmy Lai’s case is a priority. We continue to call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately release Jimmy Lai.”Last year Starmer raised Lai’s case with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and has said securing his freedom was a priority for the government.UK-based lawyers for Hong Kong activist Jimmy Lai targeted by Chinese stateRead moreBut in London, Lai’s legal team said more urgency was needed. One of his lawyers, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, said delays in proceedings coupled with Lai’s age, health and conditions of detention could lead to “a British national dying in prison for being a journalist and for standing up for democratic values.“That’s why there’s such an urgency today to actually getting on with sitting down to talk to the government,” she told journalists.RSF’s UK director, Fiona O’Brien, said Lai’s plight had reached a “pivotal moment”. It was, she said, “a case about the values of press freedom for which he has fought his whole life”.But Sun Qingye, the deputy chief of Beijing’s national security apparatus in Hong Kong, on Friday dismissed the idea of freeing Jimmy Lai. It was wrong to put pressure on judges, he added.“This matter must be dealt with according to law,” Sun told reporters on the sidelines of Beijing’s annual political gathering. “Why grant a pardon? What would be the reason?”In Hong Kong, Lai’s lawyers concluded their defence on Friday, a day after he wrapped up his testimony. The case was adjourned to 28 July for closing arguments.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

This week, Washingtonincreased tariffson a range of Chinese goods to 20%. Wang condemned the levies as “arbitrary”.Customs data published on Friday showed that the value of China’s exports in January and February grew 2.3% year-on-year, well below expectations, underlining the pressure that China’s exporters will be under this year if China is to hit its GDP growth target of 5%.China’s foreign ministry this week madeaggressive commentsabout the US, warning that in a “tariff war, trade war or any other war, China will fight to the end”. In contrast, Wang’s comments on Friday were more muted, but the frustration at Washington’s stance towards Beijing was clear. “A big country should honour its international obligations,” Wang said, adding that countries “should not bully” each other. If countries pursue their own interests without regard for the international order, “the law of the jungle would reign the world again” and small countries would suffer, Wang said.The veteran diplomat pointed to the success of the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek as evidence that US sanctions would not work. “Where there is blockade, there is breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation,” he said.DeepSeek caused shock waves in January when it released an AI model that emulated the sophistication of leading US competitors, whileclaiming to have only used Nvidia’s H800 chips, which were developed specifically for the Chinese market because the more cutting-edge H100 chips were banned from being exported to China by US restrictions.“A high fence and small yard cannot suppress innovation,” Wang said, referring to the White House’s flagship industrial strategy policy for China during the Biden administration, which aimed to cut China off from the most advanced US technology.Wang also presented China as being at odds with the US in other key foreign policy areas. Asked about Trump’s plans to redevelop Gaza, which have been widely criticised as endorsing ethnic cleansing, Wang said: “Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people.” Wang said China supported theplan to rebuild Gazathat was presented by Arab leaders at a summit in Cairo this week.On resolving the Ukraine war, Wang said China was “ready to work with the international community” to find a peace deal. But he insisted that China’s close relationship with Russia was firm, and would not be “swayed by any turn of events”. Wang said the war in Ukraine “could have been avoided” and that “no country should build its security on the insecurity of another”. Beijing has long voiced sympathy with Moscow’s concern about Nato enlargement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Europe is an important trading partner for China and there are worries in Beijing that the relationship has suffered because of the war in Ukraine.With countries around the world reeling from the dramatic first weeks of Trump’s presidency, Wang said China was a country of stability. “We are living in a changing and turbulent world,” he said, adding that China could bring “certainty to this uncertain world”.Explore more on these topicsChinaTrade and developmentAsia PacificDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

His lawyer, Seok Dong-hyun, said the president would remain in detention while prosecutors decided whether to appeal against the ruling within their seven-day window. Thejustice ministry saidit was awaiting the prosecution’s decision on whether to issue release orders.How South Korea’s president sealed his own downfallRead moreYoonhas been heldin Seoul detention centre since 15 January, when investigators dramatically executed an arrest warrant after an initial failed attempt when presidential security forces blocked police fromentering his residence.Yoon’s legal team welcomed the court’s decision as confirming “that the rule of law is still alive in this country” and demanded that “prosecutors should immediately order the president’s release”. His team argued that keeping him detained during the appeal period would be unconstitutional.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the impeached South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, gathered on Friday outside the Seoul detention centre where he was being held.Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Friday, the court ruled that prosecutors had indicted Yoon after his legal detention period had expired, calculating that the 10-day detention limit had passed when counting actual hours rather than full days.The court also cited procedural errors, including how the corruption investigation office and prosecutors improperly divided the detention period between them without legal basis and failed to follow proper transfer procedures.The criminal case against Yoon will continue regardless of his release from detention.The ruling Democratic party expressed dissatisfaction with the court’s decision, urging prosecutors to “immediately appeal” against the ruling.Park Chan-dae, the party’s floor leader,said the party felt “regret”about the decision and added: “The fact that Yoon Suk Yeol gravely violated the law and constitution remains unchanged.”Yoon was arrested after declaring martial law on 3 December and deploying troops to the national assembly, claiming he needed to counter “anti-state forces” and investigate alleged election fraud. The military deployment lasted only hours before parliament voted to overturn the declaration.He has been accused of leading an insurrection, one of only two crimes for which sitting presidents do not enjoy immunity from prosecution under South Korean law.Separately from the criminal proceedings, the constitutional court is expected torule as soon as next weekon whether to uphold Yoon’s December impeachment by the country’s national assembly.If upheld, this would remove him from office permanently and trigger a snap election within 60 days. If rejected, Yoon could potentially return to his presidential duties despite still facing criminal charges.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaYoon Suk YeolAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Six-toed nightmares if online trends hold | The shadow campaignRead moreThe first read: “[Zoe Daniel/Allegra Spender] is a teal MP who receives significant funding from Simon Holmes à Court, a billionaire investor. Some people are concerned that it makes her and other teals less independent. Do you agree or disagree?”Daniel received $710,000 from the Holmes à Court-led Climate 200 fundraising vehicle to fight the 2022 election, and has been handed a further$400,000ahead of this year’s poll.However, Australian Electoral Commission figures and disclosures to her personal website show she has not received donations directly from Holmes à Court, who is the son of a billionaire but not one himself.The same goes for Spender.She received more than $600,000 from Climate 200 before the 2022 election, and $250,310 since, according to figures from the AEC and herpersonal website.The teal independents and Holmes à Court himself have repeatedly said the clean energy advocate does not influence the Climate 200-backed MPs.The second question asks: “[Daniel/Spender] has said she was open to looking at an increase to the GST as part of her ideas for tax reform. Do you support an increase to the GST? Yes or No?”Daniel in 2023 said there was a“solid argument”to increase the tax on consumption provided low-income households were compensated, while Spender has said GST should be “on the table” in a wide-ranging review of the tax system.Daniel described the survey as “dirty tactics” which were designed to sow discord in voters’ minds.“I think it’s unethical, and I think it’s an affront to democracy, and I think it’s insulting to voters,” she said.Daniel said she believed the Liberal party was behind the “push poll”, but could not produce evidence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And they don’t have the cards,” Trump said. “In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing withRussia.”Asked whether the Russian leader was taking advantage of the pause in US intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine, Trump replied: “I actually think he is doing what anybody else would do.”American severance may be averted, but Europe’s leaders must fear the worstRead moreSenior US and Ukrainian officials plan to meet in Saudi Arabia next week asVolodymyr Zelenskyyand his advisers seek to revive relations with the US after a botched summit in the Oval Office during which Trump told Zelenskyy he was “gambling with world war three”.Russia launched a massivedrone and missile attackon Ukrainian energy facilities on Friday in the wake of the US decision to halt intelligence sharing with Ukraine that had helped it target incoming fire.1:04Russia launches strikes across Ukraine after US halts intelligence-sharing – videoSpeaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said: “We’re doing very well with Russia. But right now they’re bombing the hell out of Ukraine.”He added: “I think he [Putin] wants to get it stopped and settled and I think he’s hitting them harder than he’s been hitting them and I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.”In his remarks, Trump once again said he had good relations with Putin, despite the fallout from his first term when suspicions of backroom deals between the two leaders led to political scandal.“Despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax I’ve always had a good relationship with Putin,” Trump said. “He wants to end the war. And I think he’s going to be more generous than he has to be.”Earlier on Friday Trump had threatened new sanctions and tariffs on Russia in response to Russia’s latest attack.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said: “Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a cease fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!”Trump’s vague threat was in contrast to the punitive steps he has already taken against Ukraine, including anend to US military suppliesannounced earlier this week and the intelligence shutdown.On Friday the US aerospace company Maxar Technologies disabled Ukraine’s access to its satellite images after a request from theTrump administration.There were reports that Ukraine’s position on the battlefield had worsened as a direct result of hostile US actions. One source said Ukraine’s drones – used extensively across a 620-mile (1,000km) frontline – were “10-15% less accurate” than before.According to Ukrainian media, North Korean troops havemade significant gainsin Russia’s Kursk oblast, where Ukrainian combat groups seized territory seven months ago. The North Koreans broke through Ukrainian defences south of the Kyiv-held Russian town of Sudzha, cutting off a key road,reports said.Ukrainian troops are now at risk of being encircled, they added. One soldier fighting in the area said the road connecting the enclave with the Ukrainian city of Sumy was still open but under constant attack from Russian drones. “The situation is bad,” he messaged.Zelenskyy saidMoscow launched overnight attacks on Ukraine’s energy and gas infrastructure. It targeted facilities in several regions on Friday, including Odesa and Poltava, using nearly 70 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 attack drones.“All of this was directed against infrastructure that ensures normal life,” Zelenskyywrote on social media. “Currently, repair and restoration work is ongoing.” He said several people were injured when a missile hit a private building in Kharkiv.Zelenskyy is due to travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salman. “After that, my team will stay in Saudi Arabia to work with our American partners,” he wrote. “Ukraine is most interested in peace. As we told Potus [the president of the US], Ukraine is working and will continue to work constructively for a swift and reliable peace.”The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, are expected to hold talks with Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy’s office, and Ukraine’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov.The Trump administration has piled further pressure on Ukraine amid apparent US attemptsto replace Zelenskyy. “I think Ukraine wants to make a deal because they don’t have a choice,” Trump said on Thursday. “I also think that Russia wants to make a deal because in a certain different way – a different way that only I know – they have no choice either.”In the face of escalating US hostility, Zelenskyy has set out a tentative ceasefire plan. On Friday he suggested a ban on the use of “missiles, long-range drones and aerial bombs” as well as a suspension of military operations in the Black Sea.“Ukraine is ready to pursue the path to peace and it is Ukraine that strives for peace from the very first second of this war. The task is to force Russia to stop the war,” he posted on X.Since US and Russian negotiators met in Saudi Arabia last month, the Kremlin has dramatically stepped up its air war against Ukraine. Its advance on land in the eastern Donetsk region has largely stopped, with Ukraine’s armed forces carrying out counteroffensives in some areas.An overnight strike in Kharkiv injured eight people and damaged nine residential buildings, officials said. An adult and a child were injured in Poltava oblast when a missile hit two housing blocks, the energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said.Despite the US weapons cut-off, Ukraine is still able to shoot down some – but not all – enemy missiles. On Friday, Zelenskyy said French-supplied Mirage 2000 aircraft were used for the first time together with F-16 fighter jets to protect Ukrainian skies.He said: “The Mirages successfully intercepted Russian cruise missiles. Thank you! I also want to recognise the performance of our anti-aircraft missile forces, army aviation, all our electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups.”The Kremlin, meanwhile, said Russia may have to respond to what it said were EU plans to boost its military capability and cast Russia as its enemy. The comments were made after Thursday’s meeting in Brussels, in which EU leaders agreed a plan for ahuge rise in defence spending.“We see that the European Union is now actively discussing the militarisation of the EU and the development of the defence segment. This is a process that we are watching closely, because the EU is positioning Russia as its main adversary,” the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

This applies both to those who voted remain and those who voted leave at the 2016 referendum. Some of the leave voters in our groups expressly said that their votes had been a mistake, while others said politicians had failed to deliver on the promises of the leave campaign.“We showed messages both for and against doing a deal and they found the message in favour more persuasive. A strong majority across all groups, including groups considering voting Reform, endorsed doing a deal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After years of muddling through, we need a new approach that honours the referendum result while giving us a much-needed closer trading relationship with EU.“With an increasingly volatile and unpredictable global economy, it’s more important than ever that we secure our trading relationship with our closest neighbours.”The campaign for closer ties with Europe will be discussed among British trade union leaders at a meeting next week.Starmer has often spoken of his hopes for a reset of relations with the EU but has been cautious on an EU proposal for greater youth mobility, including easier travel, study and work opportunities for under-30s.The prime minister’s own priorities are a new veterinary agreement, deeper cooperation on security and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Starmer has also said he wants “an ambitious UK-EU security partnership to bolster Nato”. France is likely to push for securing long-term fishing access in UK waters.Starmer will host von der Leyen and Costa on 19 May to kick off more formal talks at the first UK-EU leaders’ summit. Nowak said it was vital that trade unions were involved in those talks from the beginning.Though there is a major drive to improve the UK’s sluggish growth through removing trade barriers with Europe, senior figures in No 10 are wary of any measures that might be characterised as a return to free movement or to the EU single market and customs union.Nowak said it was clear that a new deal must “honour the referendum result while giving us a much-needed closer trading relationship with the EU”.Explore more on these topicsTUCForeign policyTrade unionsBrexitEuropean UnionKeir StarmerUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

She was struck by the minimalism of “stripped back, not fussy” clothes, she told Vogue before the show. “It is quite clean, quite pure, obviously postwar,” she said.The headliner of Burton’s Givenchy debut, aParis fashion weekhot ticket, was an hourglass-shaped jacket with an exaggerated waist and curvaceous hips (pictured top right). “I wanted to strip it back to silhouette, which is the backbone of this house,” she said after the show. A new logo, Givenchy Paris 1952, was emblazoned across a mesh catsuit or on the strap of a Mary Jane flat shoe, and there was a hat tip to that decade in the form of cone-shaped bras. Burton said the look was “quite Hitchcock”, a reference that neatly skewers both the 1950s genesis of Givenchy and the fashion-noir of the house of McQueen, which still shapes Burton’s thinking.Givenchy stands for black dresses, clean lines, flat shoes, giving it arguably the most modern aesthetic of all the famous French fashion houses. But while Dior and Chanel have turned fashion into blockbuster entertainment and successfully seduced a young fanbase, Givenchy is still defined by Hepburn nibbling a croissant in sunglasses and pearls in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a full 62 years ago. A revolving door of six designers in the three decades since Hubert de Givenchy retired have failed to put a pin on Givenchy’s place in contemporary culture. That is now Burton’s job.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Indigital.TV/GivenchyThis was a major fashion moment, as the first show by a new female creative director, in an industry which has recently seen women overlooked for top jobs. But Burton, who took her bow in her trademark jeans and jumper, does not do jazz hands. Her ideas were fresh – that compellingly curvy jacket might come to replace the menswear-style blazer which has been ubiquitous on streets and shop floors in recent years – but the presentation was understated.There was no traffic-stopping front row. A few twists of lemon yellow, as teased by Timothée Chalamet, who was dressed by Burton in yellow for Sunday’s Oscars, were the exception among muted colours. Party dresses were as short as tutus, but still looked understated, with simple styling and clean lines. A beloved figure both for her talent and for the sensitivity with which she handled being handed the keys to the house of McQueen in the jagged aftermath of her boss and mentor’s shocking death, Burton has earned the right to do things her way. The dominant emotion at the show was thankfulness that after a year out of the limelight she has returned to fashion’s frontline.Hubert de Givenchy, who once said of his client and close friend Hepburn that “she was not like other movie stars, because she loved simplicity” would have approved of the chic minimalism. It is telling of the restrained coding of the house that one of Hubert de Givenchy’s most famous looks was a funeral coat and black chiffon veil, which the designer stayed up all night to make for Wallis Simpson when the Duke of Windsor died in 1972.View image in fullscreenWallis Simpson (C) with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at the Duke of Windsor's funeral in 1972.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsGivenchyParis fashion weekSarah BurtonFranceEuropeFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

All three defendants were involved in the operation.The spymaster also directed gang members, including Ivanova, to steal mobile phone numbers of Ukrainian troops believed to be training at a US barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, using a military-grade snooping device not previously seen in criminal hands.Marsalek communicated directly with the ringleader, Orlin Roussev, 47, from Great Yarmouth, who in turn directed the surveillance activities from a former guesthouse in the Norfolk seaside town. The building was crammed with hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of electronic and surveillance equipment.Roussev has already pleaded guilty to espionage charges, as has his friend and deputy, Bizer Dzhambazov, 43. But the three more junior members had denied the charge of espionage, leading to an Old Bailey trial that lasted nearly three months.Police, however, said they were fortunate to have broken up the spy ring in February 2023, after an unknown period in which members were under surveillance by counter-terror police and MI5.The Met said it was unaware of the gang members’ intention to travel days later to Stuttgart to try to snoop on the phone numbers when police conducted a series of pre-dawn arrests.The head of the Met’s counter-terror division, Commander Dom Murphy, said “the core evidence was obtained from Roussev’s phone” and by identifying other key devices to retrieve 78,747 Telegram messages betweenRoussev and Marsalekoutlining six main plots and other smaller ones.Though Roussev was an IT specialist, he had not deleted the messages and they were not encrypted, painting a revealing picture of not just the spy ring’s activities, but the Kremlin’s interests aroundEurope. At one point Marsalek appeared to suggest Grozev was targeted because “apparently Putin seriously hates him”.Counter-terror officers also said that Kremlin spying and sabotage efforts were still in operation, although largely conducted through criminals or other poorly trained proxies directed from a distance. “This won’t be the only activity Russia is conducting in the UK,” Murphy said.The court heard that Dzhambazov wasin a relationshipwith Ivanova, his long-term partner, as well as Gaberova for a year and a half before their arrest. The third defendant, Ivanchev, was Gaberova’s ex-boyfriend.When police raided Gaberova’s flat, they found Dzhambazov in bed with her. Ivanova had been unaware of the relationship until after her arrest, and during the trial accused Dzhambazov of conducting “a parallel relationship” with Gaberova behind her back. Dzhambazov had also told the two women he had brain cancer, which was false.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It carries a maximum jail term of 14 years. Investigators traced at least €210,000 flowing from Roussev to other members of the gang.Of the three defendants, only Ivanchev was in court. The two women were present via video link from HMP Bronzefield. Ivanova and Gaberova, both seated, remained passive and subdued as the guilty verdicts were read out. Ivanchev, standing in the dock, nodded briefly as he heard the jury’s conclusion.Frank Ferguson, the counter-terror chief at the Crown Prosecution Service, said “this was a high-level espionage operation” with members working under Roussev’s leadership. “The police raid on Roussev’s home revealed a spy factory,” Ferguson said.Officers seized 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 258 hard drives, 33 audio recording devices, 55 surveillance cameras, 16 radios and 11 drones plus wifi eavesdroppers, electronic jammers and 75 fake passports and identity documents in 55 different names. The vast bulk were recovered in Great Yarmouth.Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing fake passports and identity documents at her flat in Harrow, where she lived with Dzhambazov.Mr Justice Hilliard KC, presiding, remanded the defendants into custody until sentencing between 7 May and 12 May. A sixth man, Ivan Stoyanov, 33, from Greenford in west London, was also implicated in some of the spying. He had pleaded guilty before the trial began, but this can be reported only now.Explore more on these topicsEspionageCrimeRussiaBulgariaEuropeLondonMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

The device was found 2 metres below the ground in a location known for potential second world war debris. The rail maintenance work had been carried out with special precautions. When the device was found, work stopped and experts were called in, with the perimeter extended to 1km on Friday morning.MapLocal authorities in St-Denis said people were evacuated from some buildings whose windows faced towards the site where the bomb was being deactivated. Six schools and a care home in the area were also locked down for an hour, although local authorities said there was “no risk” to them. Part of the Paris ring road and the A1 motorway was closed to traffic owing to the disposal operations, the police prefecture said.Matthieu Chabanel, the head of the rail infrastructure management unit SNCF Réseau, said that finding a bomb of such size was “really quite exceptional”.“We know that during world war two, the rail network was heavily bombed, especially here north of Paris where there were also many factories,” he told reporters. “So we are particularly vigilant when we carry out work in this area and we detect an abnormal situation, which is what happened last night.” He added that police teams had been notified immediately.It was not clear at first when and by whom the bomb was dropped and if it dated to before or after the 1940 occupation of Paris by Nazi Germany.All rail traffic to the Gare du Nord, France’s busiest railway terminal, was stopped as Paris police worked to disable the device.The Gare du Nord is a major European transit hub, serving international destinations such as Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as the main Paris airport and many regional destinations. The station, in the north of the French capital, serves an estimated 700,000 people each day, according to the SNCF national rail company.The French transport minister, Philippe Tabarot, said defusing operations were “finally over, they went well”. Earlier, he told French radio: “There’s nothing to be afraid of, but there are procedures we have to respect.” Tabarot said the teams worked as fast as possible within a large security perimeter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Videos of the massacre show people dressed in civilian clothes piled on top of one another as women wailed. Another video in a second town showed gunmen executing seemingly unarmed men who were crawling on their hands and knees away from them.The Guardian was unable to independently verify either of the videos.Syria’s interior ministry said some “individual violations” had taken place as a result of people heading towards the villages being attacked by Assad loyalists, but did not claim responsibility for the alleged executions. “We are working to put a stop to these violations that do not represent the Syrian people as a whole,” an interior ministry source told Syria’s state broadcaster.The Guardian asked for a specific comment from the interior ministry on the SNHR’s claims, but did not receive a response by the time of publishing.The UN special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, urged protection for civilians as clashes intensified. “There is clearly an immediate need for restraint from all parties, and full respect for the protection of civilians in accordance with international law,” Pedersen said in a statement.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises as members of the Syrian security forces battle a nascent insurgency in Latakia.Photograph: Karam Al-Masri/ReutersGovernment forces continued to battle with Assad regime loyalists late on Friday night, launching a military operation in Qardaha, Latakia, the home town of the former Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, according to state media.A source in the military of defence said security forces were targeting the buildings and hills around the town where former regime elements were hiding out.The two-day, coordinated attack was a marked escalation by loyalists to the former government against Syria’s new rulers.The new government in Damascus is struggling to consolidate its grip over the country. An Israeli incursion in south-east Syria, as well as an economic malaise perpetuated by western sanctions, threaten to undermine the fledgling authority’s rule.The attack began in the town of Jableh, Latakia, on Thursday but soon spread to other areas. Gunmen cut off roads in the countryside and seized control of areas in the towns of Qardaha and Baniyas.A video released by a former Assad regime officer shortly after the operation began called on Syria’s various sects to rise up against the government in Damascus in what it dubbed operation “coastal shield”.Lengthy military columns of security officers and militias loyal to the government in Damascus quickly started heading towards Latakia from across Syria to quell the rebellion. Government forces began to carry out “combing operations” to catch gunmenA curfew was established on the coast provinces and in Homs province, with people instructed not to leave their homes until 9am on Saturday.“Civilians are being killed two blocks down from me. The fights are becoming bigger, I have no clue what’s going to happen,” said a resident of Jableh over the phone while sheltering in their home on Friday.Saudi Arabia condemned what it described as “crimes” by “outlaw groups” and reaffirmed its backing for the new authorities.9:25A journey through the new Syria: what is the future after Assad? – videoSyria’s coast is populated by Alawites, the sect from which the Assad family hailed, though most of the sect had no relation to the former regime. Mutual suspicion between Alawites in the coastal region and the new rulers of Syria has persisted since the toppling of the Assad regime.Despite assurances that minorities, including Alawites, would be safe in the new Syria, Alawite communities have been subject to a number of revenge killings since December.In one case, on 31 January in the town of Arza, in Homs province, eight men were asked if they were Alawite and then executed with a bullet to the head. Ten more men were executed in Arza on Friday, with their bodies left out in the open, SNHR reported.Syria’s new rulers have said the killings were “individual cases” committed by individuals and groups unaffiliated with the government in Damascus, but that has done little to quell the growing fears of Alawites.The new Syrian authorities have come under criticism for not being inclusive enough of Syria’s religious diversity and its vast civil society. A transitional government is to be announced in the coming weeks, the makeup of which will be a key test for the new rulers of Syria’s commitment to pluralism.Explore more on these topicsSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He advised the US not to seek agreement on wider issues such as Iran’s missile program or its regional behaviour, a reference to its support to the resistance groups in the Middle East, also known as Iranian proxy forces. Ulyanov said it was not possible to kill three birds with one stone.Trump’s strategy of reaching out to Russia would be enhanced if he could show a side benefit of his closer relations with Moscow was to reduce the growing risk of an Israeli attack on Iran to prevent Tehran acquiring nuclear weapons.The letter, the first step Trump has taken towards Iran since he announced the US was seeking to reimpose maximum economic pressure on Iran, comes at a time when the Iranian government is locked in a public dispute on the wisdom of negotiating with the US, and what pre-conditions should be set.In recent days hardliners opposed to reaching out to the US appeared to have gained a decisive upper hand with MPs impeaching the economy minister, Abdolnaser Hemmati, and the resignation of Javad Zarif, the vice-president for strategy and a long-term advocate of reviving contacts with the west.The ministry of foreign affairs also issued a strategy paper stressing that Iran was not prepared to lose its political independence.The paper said: “Governments that set their policies in the hope of security guarantees from great powers in the end at critical junctures were left alone. Iran has learned this historical lesson well. Independence is not just a slogan, but an inevitable necessity.”The loss of such key ministers reflected both the hardliner parliament’s refusal to reconcile itself to the loss of the presidential election last year, and genuine public anger about the rapidly deteriorating state of the economy largely caused by the accumulation of years of economic sanctions.Iranian politicians for months have been contradicting one another about the wisdom of talks, whether there could be direct discussions with the US and whether the talks should simply focus narrowly on reimposing a UN regime to oversee the safety of Iran’s civil nuclear program.The last nuclear deal signed by Iran in 2015 and negotiated by the US, Russia, China, and three European powers, the UK, France and Germany, was fatally weakened in 2018 whenDonald Trumppulled the US from the deal, and Europe said the breadth of US secondary sanctions meant European firms could not find a lawful way to continue trading with Iran.Gradually Iran, claiming it was taking a legitimate reprisal measures for the failure to lift sanctions, ended cooperation with most aspects of the 2015 nuclear deal, including breaching all the limits on stockpiling highly enriched uranium, the key material to make nuclear weapons. Recent goodwill gestures to allow more experienced nuclear inspectors into Iran never took place.A deadline of sorts is hanging over the process since the UN’s nuclear weapons inspectorate is due to publish a comprehensive report this summer that will set out the level of Iranian non-compliance with the nuclear inspectorate, a report that would then in October trigger currently suspended UN sanctions coming into force. Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency director, told the IAEA board this week that Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% had reached 275kg. He said: “Iran is the only country that enriches uranium to this level without having nuclear weapons.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIranUS foreign policyUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationAyatollah Ali KhameneinewsShareReuse this content"

In his first term in office, Trump’s first foreign visit was to Saudi Arabia, a country with ambitions to be a major diplomatic player despite its horrific human rights record, includingthe kidnap and murderof thejournalist Jamal Khashoggiin 2018.For his part, Trump sees a normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel as the key prize in his attempts to forge a region-wide peace deal after the signing ofthe Abraham accords– bilateral normalisation agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – which he pursued during his first term but which have done little to improve security in the Middle East.If the ties between Trump and his circle and Saudi Arabia have long been close in terms of diplomacy and business, more concerning are perceptions of Prince Mohammed’s proximity to Moscow andVladimir Putin.In recent years, the prince – who is reportedly fascinated by Putin and his grip on power in Russia – has moved closer to the Russian president’s orbit. According to some analysts, he was given a key role in two prisoner exchanges between Russia and the US, including one involvingthe journalist Evan Gershkovichlast year.That warm relationship began in 2015 when Prince Mohammed visited the Russian president in St Petersburg, and Putin then visited Saudi Arabia in 2023.The relationship between Moscow and Riyadh has grown ever more important, as Jens Heibach and Luíza Cerioli pointed out inan essayfor the Contemporary Security Policy journal last year that explained Saudi Arabia’s long-term reluctance to criticise Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia, they wrote, was Riyadh’s “pivotal partner” within the wider Opec+ and “an important pillar of its foreign-policy diversification strategy”.They added: “On one hand, Saudi Arabia voted in favour of adopting key resolutions of the United Nations general assembly on [the war in Ukraine], including those condemning Russia’s illegal use of force against, and its illegal referendums and annexations in,Ukraine. On the other hand, the kingdom avoided seriously encroaching on Russia’s interests by refusing to isolate it diplomatically.”Significantly, as Heibach and Cerioli noted, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022: “Saudi Arabia continued to cooperate with Russia within Opec+ and, on October 5, 2022, led the group’s decision to cut oil production by 2m barrels per day, increasing global oil prices and, implicitly, Russian revenues.“In doing so, Saudi Arabia rebuffed [the Biden administration’s] pleas to use its central position within Opec + to lower oil prices. This decision strained Saudi relations with the United States, which was also dissatisfied with Riyadh’s eventual official stance on the Ukraine crisis.”That closeness has continued. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia hosted Russian and US delegations – though with Kyiv significantly absent – to discuss a Ukraine peace deal, a major reversal of the Biden administration’s efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically.Set against that, however, is the fact that Saudi Arabia also hosted a two-day peace summit on Ukraine in 2023 with representatives from more than 40 countries, although some sceptics noted that was as much about laundering Saudi Arabia’s international reputation.And if Ukraine feels comfortable holding talks in Jeddah it is because of the personal connections of the country’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, who has his own lines to Saudi Arabia through his former business connections as an investment banker.Orysia Lutsevych, the deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia programme at the Chatham House thinktank in London, said those and other links between Saudi Arabia and Ukraine meant there was a degree of trust.“I think it’s a bit of a myth about neutral places for negotiations. Practically, you need to find an actor or a mediator that has a stake or a connection to both parties to have trust,” she said.“Ukrainians have always thought that the Middle East could be [a] counterweight and invested in relations with the global south, arguing that it is a global war because it has had global consequences.”Lutsevych added that Saudi Arabia owned one of the largest agricultural companies in Ukraine, suggesting it may have a “pragmatic interest”.“One of the Saudis’ motivations [in hosting the talks] is to lend a hand to Trump,” she said. “But the bigger risk for Zelenskyy and Ukraine remains Trump himself – the risk of America siding with the Russian agenda. The location doesn’t change that.”Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaUkraineMohammed bin SalmanVladimir PutinRussiaUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Officials will also check news reports of previous demonstrations against Israel’s policies and Jewish students’ lawsuits highlighting foreign nationals allegedly engaging in antisemitism.Some pro-Palestinian groups are Jewish themselves and many protesters have denounced antisemitism and Hamas. However, there have been incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia in pro-Palestinian protests and pro-Israeli counter-protests.Advocates worry that using artificial intelligence for surveillance could lead to errors, misidentifications and privacy violations.“This should concern all Americans. This is a first amendment and freedom of speech issue and the administration will overplay its hand,”saidAbed Ayoub, the executive director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. “Americans won’t like this. They’ll view this as capitulating free speech rights for a foreign nation.”The state department is working with the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, according to Axios. The three departments had no immediate comment.Trump has said he will stop federal funding for educational institutions that allow what he called illegal protests.“Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or ... arrested,” Trump said on Tuesday.The US constitution’s first amendment protects freedom of speech and assembly. Rights advocates have condemned Trump’s rhetoric towards protesters.Students chant support for Palestinians at Barnard College protest in New YorkRead moreOn Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union published anopen letterurging colleges and universities to not bow to federal pressure to use surveillance or punish international students or faculty if they were involved in any campus protests. The group said the protests were constitutionally protected free speech.“It is disturbing to see the White House threatening freedom of speech and academic freedom on US college campuses so blatantly,” said Cecillia Wang, legal director of the ACLU and co-author of the letter. “Trump’s latest coercion campaign, attempting to turn university administrators against their own students and faculty, harkens back to the McCarthy era and is at odds with American constitutional values and the basic mission of universities.”Washington has designated Hamas as a “foreign terrorist organization”. The Islamist group’s 7 October 2023 attack killed 1,200 people, with more than 250 taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s subsequent military assault onGazahas killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza authorities. It has internally displaced nearly everyone there and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS campus protestsArtificial intelligence (AI)Palestinian territoriesJudaismHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They facilitated the works and directed the other organised crime gang members to the illegal road digs.Graham Roberts.Photograph: North West Regional Organised Crime Unit/PAGraham Roberts, known as “Ganny”, was “the skilled worker of the company” and “an integral part of the operation”, according to the CPS. A cable jointer by trade, he did the physical fitting of the new electric cables.Others were groundsmen and responsible for making the work look legitimate. The group would use WhatsApp to communicate about “work” and work in “plain sight”, wearing high visibility clothing.Ross McGinn.Photograph: North West Regional Organised Crime Unit/PAAll of the men pleaded guilty to encouraging or assisting an offence and conspiracy to abstract electricity. McGinn, who wiped away tears as he was jailed for five years and four months, and Andrew Roberts, who was given the highest sentence of six years, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal. Two other men will be sentenced at a later date.James Allison, senior crown prosecutor with the CPS’s Mersey-Cheshire’s Complex Casework Unit, said the men played a vital role in assisting organised criminals to set up large numbers of cannabis farms all over the UK.“The pretence of being genuine workmen digging up the road and repairing utilities was the perfect disguise.“But they were working with and for Albanian nationals and other gangs to assist with the setup of cannabis farms by interfering with the mains electricity to power the farms.“The term ‘professional enablers’ for organised crime describes their involvement.“The work they did to divert the electricity was described by a professional electrical inspector as poor and often dangerous.“They no doubt thought they would get away with their criminal operation but they were wrong and are now behind bars.”A photo found on a phone showed Roberts with burns to his face thought to have been caused while he was at “work”.The investigation found the men were involved in incidents in England, Scotland and Wales. Forces including the Metropolitan police, Avon and Somerset, Durham, Gloucestershire, Humberside, Kent, Leicestershire, Norfolk, Northumbria, Thames Valley, West Mercia and South Yorkshire were involved.Explore more on these topicsCrimeDrugsCannabisPoliceUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

He again criticised Farage, saying Reform was “our party as much as it is Nigel’s”.He also explicitly linked the allegations to his decision to criticise Farage, saying that the day after he had done this, he had received “a knife in my back over false allegations”.In a joint statement by the chair, Zia Yusuf, and Reform’s chief whip,Lee Anderson, they said they were “obligated to disclose that the party received complaints from two female employees about serious bullying” in Lowe’s offices.One of the complainants worked in Lowe’s parliamentary office and the other in his Great Yarmouth constituency office, they said, adding: “We understand complaints have been made to parliamentary authorities.”The statement said: “Evidence was provided to us of workplace bullying, the targeting of female staff who raised concerns, and evidence of derogatory and discriminatory remarks made about women, including reference to a perceived disability.“We feel we have a duty of care to all our staff, whether employed directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we appointed an independent king’s counsel to conduct an investigation into the veracity of these complaints. To date, Mr Lowe has yet to cooperate with this investigation.“In addition to these allegations of a disturbing pattern of behaviour, Mr Lowe has on at least two occasions made threats of physical violence against our party chairman. Accordingly, this matter is with the police.”A Reform spokesperson said Lowe had lost the party whip in parliament.In a reply sent to the Guardian and posted on X, Lowe said he was “disappointed, but not surprised” at the statement, and that he had fully cooperated with the KC, saying she was “shocked” at what had happened.He said: “Allegations of physical threats are outrageous and entirely untrue. I have never made any derogatory comments about women, or those with disabilities. This is a lie. These allegations are not even referring to me. I will be seeking legal advice immediately.“There is no credible evidence against me, as the KC has stated on numerous occasions.”On Thursday, Lowe, the former Southampton FC chair, criticised Farage’s leadership in an interview.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also suggested he could leave the party unless it was centred less around Farage’s “messianic” leadership, and had a formal frontbench. There has been speculation within Reform about tensions between Lowe and Farage, especially after Musk’s intervention.Farage responded angrily, saying Lowe would not have had a chance of winning a seat without his leadership of the party.In his statement, Lowe said it was “no surprise that this vexatious statement has been issued the day after my reasonable and constructive questions of Nigel and the Reform structure”.He added: “I have been pushing for this behind the scenes for many months, with zero success. I have been frozen out of meetings, policy discussions, press conferences and more. My repeated requests for better communication and regular meetings have been ignored and mocked.”The statement went on: “If they want to kick me out over false claims, they’ll have to finally present some credible evidence against me. There is none, as the KC has just told me.“A complete inability to accept even the most mild constructive criticism without such a malicious reaction is not effective leadership.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageLee AndersonnewsShareReuse this content"

Do not target stuff at the poorest and most vulnerable. There are others ways of doing it,” the MP said. “There are lots of backbenchers concerned about this … it’s unhelpful in terms of how this has been trailed in the media and I feel that it’s too politically slanted as well. You can’t outflank the right.”Another Labour MP, Rachael Maskell, a former shadow cabinet minister, told the Guardian many colleagues were “feeling really nervous and concerned” and that mental health services and schools need to be better equipped to help young people before changing the social security system. “We need to get into why people are so challenged at the moment and to force people into work is not going to solve that problem,” she said.“We know people who depend on social security, with people struggling in our constituencies. It should be a Labour government alleviating poverty, not adding to it … the Labour government needing to hold its values about addressing poverty. Measures likeraising the living wageare really helpful but it is [Gordon] Brown economics we need at this time, which are complicated, technical and targeted. That’s not what we are seeing with these broad-brush approaches.”Maskell said many previous governments had tried unsuccessfully to cut the social security bill, so the fresh effort may be “more rhetoric than reality”.But she added: “What I’ve written to the minister with concerns about is people moved into a work-related activity group and being told they can work when they in fact can’t … I am concerned that’s where we will see the shift.”Another Labour MP said: “I think it is not sensible to punish the most vulnerable in society for a situation which is not their fault. We should be helping those with disabilities flourish and forcing employers to be more inclusive, not blaming disabled people for not being able to find employment.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsEconomic policyLabourRachel ReevesKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

She remained under MI5 investigation until the day of her death.Rudd, who was autistic, had started showing signs of far-right radicalisation after being groomed by her mother’s boyfriend, Dax Mallaburn, a US neo-Nazi.She was arrested by counter-terrorism police after the FBI found that a second US white supremacist, named Chris Cook, had supplied her with instructions for making homemade bombs and weapons.A cache of WhatsApp messages revealed that Cook, then 28, had also encouraged Rudd to send him naked images of herself. He had described her as his “14-year-old girlfriend” to a friend, who responded that Rudd should be “taught properly”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She wore camouflage on Adolf Hitler’s birthday, the inquest heard. She was said by Witness A to have been a risk to herself and others.Counter-terrorism police had first begun investigating the teenager in September 2020 after her mother, Emily Carter, reported her concerns to Prevent, the anti-radicalisation programme.Rudd was arrested the following month and later charged at the age of 14 with downloading a bomb-making manual online and plotting a terrorist attack, becoming the youngest girl to be charged with terror offences in the UK.The charges were dropped when the Home Office concluded that Rudd had been a victim of trafficking who had been groomed and sexually exploited. She was found dead five months later.Witness A told the inquest that Rudd’s safety and history of self-harming was repeatedly discussed in meetings with counter-terrorism police but that she remained a risk. “We have to accept that minors can be threats,” he said.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Last year, before Labour’s election victory, Starmercut its green investment planfrom £28bn a year to under £15bn, in a blow to Miliband.Sources close to the government said the Treasury was now running the rule over “everything” before the spring statement this month, which is expected to show that Reeves’s headroom against her fiscal rules has been wiped out.Another source warned of a rerun of the febrile months before the autumn budget, when swirling speculation hit business confidence and investment. “GB Energy has the potential to be a real confidence booster to business. Scaling it back would damage investor sentiment and, frankly, be electoral madness. It’s hugely popular on the doorstep, especially in Scotland,” they said.Last month, GB Energy admitted that itcould take 20 yearsto meet its pledge to employ 1,000 people, as the chair, Jürgen Maier, refused to put a date on when it would bring down energy bills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Epstein replied “what character would you like next?”, to which Staley answered “Beauty and the Beast”.The court was shown notes taken by Higgins after a call with Bailey, in which the former is said to have declared “you have destroyed him,” in an apparent reference to Staley. “I don’t see any evidence of a lack of integrity,” the note adds.“I do remember a conversation along those lines, yes,” Bailey told the court.The conversations with Higgins were detailed in witness evidence, as Bailey took the stand at the upper tribunal.Bailey, who wore a dark suit and purple tie, was sat metres from Staley as he was cross-examined by Robert Smith KC, who is trying to overturn an FCA decision in 2023 to ban Staley from senior roles in the UK financial sector.That decision, which also cost Staley £18m in pay and bonuses at Barclays, came after an FCA investigation found he had misled the regulator after a Barclays letter from October 2019 said Epstein and Staley “did not have a close relationship”.Staley resigned in 2021 over the investigation’s preliminary findings, which were formally released in 2023.Staley’s lawyers are arguing that members of the bank’s board had been briefed on the extent of his ties with the late financier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The couple’s partially mummified bodies were discovered last month at their home in New Mexico.The 95-year-old Hackman may have lived for as long as a week after Arakawa’s death, she said. Officials speculated that he may have been unaware she was deceased.“He was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that’s what resulted in his death,” Jarrell said.The press conference New Mexico authorities held on Friday provided some answers in the mystery of what happened to the couple. Hackman and Arakawa were discovered last week after a maintenance worker, concerned when no one answered the door, contacted neighborhood security, who spotted their bodies through a window and called the police. One of their three dogs was also found dead.The Santa Fe county sheriff’s office said it did not suspect foul play. But officials could not immediately determine what happened to the couple as there were no signs of trauma to their bodies and tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.At the press conference on Friday afternoon, the sheriff, Adan Mendoza, revealed that investigators had been able to piece together Arakawa’s final days and found that she had picked up her dog, who was later found dead nearby, from a veterinary appointment on 9 February and that she had responded to emails and went out shopping on 11 February. The last known activity from Arakawa was that day, the sheriff said.Arakawa’s death was linked to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Exposures occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas.Hackman’s pacemaker last showed activity on 17 February, nine days before maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Officials said it was “reasonable to conclude” that Hackman died around 18 February.Arakawa was found with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on the bathroom counter, while Hackman was found in the home’s entryway.One of the couple’s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed of the dead animal.When they were found, the bodies weredecomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe’s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200ft (2,200 meters).Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including The French Connection, Hoosiers and Superman from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.The couple’s stucco, Pueblo-revival style home sits on a hill in a gated community at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains. Santa Fe is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood’s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Morse did not immediately identify that pair and said he could not immediately rule out obtaining more arrest warrants in the case.Morse explained that investigators were treating Wilson’s death as a manslaughter rather than a murder because it was unintentional yet resulted from criminal behavior – specifically, hazing. Morse said his agency has determined Wilson died after repeatedly being punched in the chest while undergoing the pledging process to join Southern’s Omega Psi Phi fraternity.Louisiana’s legislature criminalized hazing after the 2017 death of Max Gruver, who had been forced to ingest a fatal level of alcohol while pledging to join the Phi Delta Theta fraternity at Louisiana State University, also in Baton Rouge.Omega Psi Phi at Southern has been “ordered to cease all activities”, according to the president of the historically Black school, Dennis Shields. The fraternity could face civil penalties under Louisiana’s anti-hazing laws, the Baton Rouge district attorney, Hillar Moore said.Shields said the school was subjecting an unspecified number of students to disciplinary proceedings, too.“We got to do better, Baton Rouge,” the city’s mayor, Sid Edwards, said at Friday’s news conference. Referring to Wilson, he added, “It’s … sad … to lose such a promising young life. And I encourage all the young people out there to make better decisions.”According to Morse, Baton Rouge police learned of Wilson’s death from medical staff at a local hospital where a group of young men had dropped him off. The group claimed Wilson had collapsed while playing basketball at a public park and then left before police arrived to investigate.Officers nonetheless subsequently determined that Wilson – in his junior year at Southern – was mortally injured during a hazing ritual at a warehouse more than three miles away from the park, Morse said.An arrest warrant affidavit reviewed by the Associated Press said McCray, who is described by Baton Rouge television stationWBRZas a Southern graduate and Omega Psi Phi member, and at least two other people wearing boxing gloves punched Wilson as well as eight other fraternity pledges. After McCray punched Wilson four times in the chest, Wilson “collapsed to the floor and became unresponsive”, the affidavit alleges.“Wilson appeared to suffer a seizure and lose control of his bodily function,” the affidavit added. Wilson had a bruise on the right side of his chest.Morse said McCray turned himself over to authorities as police investigating Wilson’s death had interviewed more than a dozen people as well as executed multiple search warrants.An attorney for McCray, Phillip Robinson, issued a statement to WBRZ arguing that police had not presented him with evidence that he believed was strong enough to support the allegations of criminal hazing and manslaughter against his client.“We are committed to ensuring that all facts are properly examined and that due process is followed,” Robinson’s statement also said.Manslaughter, under Louisiana law, can carry up to 40 years in prison. Criminal hazing can carry a maximum of five years’ imprisonment.Before attending Southern, Wilson graduated from Warren Easton high school in New Orleans and played trumpet for its marching band.The Human Jukebox performed at the NFL Super Bowl played on 9 February in New Orleans.Among those to mourn Wilson’s death was the owner of New Orleans’s two professional sports teams, Gayle Benson, for whom Wilson’s father, Corey, worked security details as part of his job as a deputy with the sheriff’s office of Jefferson parish, Louisiana.“We mourn with [Wilson’s father] … on this senseless passing,” Benson said in a statement reported on by multiple media outlets.Wilson was honored on Thursday at a second line – traditionally, a musical and dancing celebration trailing closely behind a parade – held in his memory in New Orleans’s Treme neighborhood. A friend of Wilson who attended the second line told the Guardian reporting partnerWWL Louisianathat Wilson “had a good spirit”.“He was gifted, gifted with the trumpet,” said the friend, Brandon Mitchell. “And he had a good heart.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsLouisianaUS crimeFraternities and sororitiesUS universitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The EPA did not respond to a request from the news agency on Friday for comment.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate environment and public works committee, called the new directive “troubling”, adding that it means agency actions, including routine contracts and grant awards, “now face unnecessary bureaucratic delays”.‘Little agency that could’ cheered for act of resistance against Trump and MuskRead moreWhitehouse added that the involvement of Musk’s “unvetted, inexperienced team raises serious concerns about improper external influence on specialized agency decision-making”.The latest development came afterDonald Trumpon Thursday gave a clear sign of admitting that drastic government cuts spearheaded by his ally Musk have gone too far. The US president’s views after an explosive, closed-door cabinet confrontation involving Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, exposed simmering anger over the billionaire entrepreneur’s key role, which Musk attended even though he is not a cabinet member.After weeks of turmoil in the federal bureaucracy wreaked by theDogeteam, Trump issued a call for a “scalpel” rather than a “hatchet” to be applied to the task of reducing the federal bureaucracy.The president’s comment in a social media post followed a volatile encounter that saw Musk, the SpaceX and Tesla owner who has assumed a central role in Trump’s fledgling administration, face off against Rubio, whom he accused of “firing nobody”,according to the New York Times. Rubio, who had been furious over Musk’s role in shutting down the main US foreign assistance body, USAid – over which the secretary of state supposedly has control – hit back vigorously, according to the report.Thursday’s cabinet meeting was scheduled abruptly after howls of protest about the effects of Doge’s slashing of government agencies by the constituents of Republican members of Congress, including former military veterans, many of whom have been fired in a wave of indiscriminate cuts.“As the secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,” Trumpposted on his Truth Social platform.“We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the ‘hatchet.’ The combination of them, Elon, Doge, and other great people will be able to do things at a historic level.”Trump’s public call for discretion came after he told cabinet secretaries that they rather than Musk had the final say over whom to hire and fire.Musk conveyed a similar message in a meeting with senators on Capitol Hill on Thursday, claiming he was not to blame for the mass layoffs and giving them his phone number if they wanted to relay concerns.It contrasted starkly with the image he projected at last month’s CPAC conference, whenhe paradedon stage with a chainsaw to symbolise his ruthless approach to downsizing government agencies. He has openly boasted of feeding the now-gutted USAid “into the wood chipper”, while laying off its estimated 10,000-employee workforce.“Elon doesn’t fire people,” Richard Hudson, a Republican member of Congress from North Carolina,told reportersafter a pizza dinner with Musk in the basement of the US Capitol on Thursday.“He doesn’t have hiring and firing authority. The president’s empowered him to go uncover this information, that’s it.”The attempt to downplay a role Musk in which has consistently sought the limelight follows questions from judges in the multiple court cases filed against Doge’s activities about who is leading the staff-culling crusade – and whether Musk himself has a direct role.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Trump undercut that in a prime-time address at the US Capitol on Tuesday by flatly suggesting that he is, a declaration that commentators said could directly affect pending court rulings.Numerous recently hired federal employees have been summarily fired before their probation period ended – when their posts would become harder to terminate because of legal protections.Carlos Gimenez, a Republican representative from Florida, said that the agencies rather than Musk had fired the probationers.“Some of the folks that were the probationary people, he didn’t fire them, they were actually supposedly fired by the agencies – and they messed up,” Gimenez said.The portrait of an impartial, hands-off Musk jarred with anecdotal on-the-ground evidence from agencies infiltrated by Doge operatives.On Thursday, federal marshals escorted members of Doge, along with Peter Marocco, director of the state department’s office of foreign assistance, into the Washington office of the US African Development Foundation (USADF), a day after staff had denied them access in what was seen as a David-versus-Goliath act of defiance by one of the smallest federal agencies.The entry resulted in a “traumatising scene”, employees told the Washington Post, and prompted a federal lawsuit by USADF’s president, Ward Brehm, challenging the authority of Trump, Marocco and Doge to close an agency that the president has deemed unnecessary.Further evidence of a de facto Doge takeover of government came in reports of its workers installing themselves in four separate rooms on the sixth floor of the General Service Administration’s building, “complete with beds from Ikea, lamps and dressers.”Politico said the agency was considering spending about $25,000 to install a washer and dryer on the premises, apparently to serve the resident Doge staff.

There are no official numbers of how many federal employees will be affected, and many of Donald Trump and Musk’s efforts have been stalled in court, but the impact could be big and long-lasting.To understand what the cuts will do to federal operations, we first have to understand who works for the federal government and what they do. Here’s what we know about the federal workforce.How big is the federal workforce?A series of red circles on top of a light red bar chartThere are about3 million federal employeesin the US, about 2% of the entire US workforce, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the data division of the Department of Labor.Much of the federal workforce falls under the executive departments, the leaders of which make up the president’s cabinet. The Department of Defense is the largest employer, as it houses theUS military, which includes the army, navy and air force, and has more than 750,000 employees. This figure encompasses the civil workforce within the defense department. There’s an additional 1.3 million active-duty US military personnel that BLS does not include when counting the federal workforce.The Department of Veterans Affairs is the next largest employer, with approximately 480,000 employees.The number of federal workers has largely remained unchanged over the last 50 years, with exceptions every 10 years for when there’s an influx of employees working on the US Census.What are the demographics of the federal workforce?chart with two numbers highlighted in tan and redWhen compared with the overall employed workforce, federal workers skew slightly older. More than 50% of federal workers are over 45, compared with 43% of the overall workforce.Meanwhile, the racial demographics of the federal workforce largely reflect the demographics of the country as a whole, with one key exception: the federal government has a higher percentage of Black employees than the private sector.Tracking Trump – updates on the presidency’s first 100 daysRead moreThis is likely because the federal government implemented laws after the civil rights era to prevent bias in workplace hiring, allowing more Black workers to enter the federal workforce.In January, Donald Trump signed two sweepingexecutive ordersthat ended diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs inside the federal government. He overturned multiple executive orders, including one from the civil rights era that required private contractors to practice equal employment opportunity when hiring.While the federal layoffs are separate from Trump’s DEI actions, they both encompass dramatic efforts from the Trump administration to curtail the federal government’s role as an employer.Where do federal workers live?A red and light pink cartogram of the United StatesIt’s a common misconception that most federal workers live in Washington DC. While federal workers make up a huge chunk of Washington’s population, the vast majority of federal workers live in other states across the country. They range from a national parks ranger in Montana to an infectious disease researcher in Georgia to a doctor working at a hospital run by the veterans affairs department. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) alone has more than 100,000 employees across 4,500officesnationwide.How do federal employees comparewith state and local government employees?Three line charts, with a yellow one labeled ‘Local’ towering over an orange and red one labeled ‘State’ and ‘Federal’, respectivelyFederal employees make up just a small fraction of all government employees in the US. The vast majority of government workers, about 15 million, work for local governments, while nearly 6 million work for state governments.Local governments manage police and fire departments, parks and recreation and housing services. State governments often work with local governments to help with things such as regulating highways and education.What about federal contractors?BLS does not consider those who work for federal contractors, or private companies that have agreements to do work for the federal government, as federal government employees. There is no official number for how many private contractors there are for the federal government, but a recent Brookings Institutionanalysisestimated that there were approximately 5.2 million private contractor employees in 2023.What does the Trump administration want to do to the federal workforce?Musk is leading the White House’s efforts to downsize the federal government, all supposedly for the sake of saving money. Musk said in October 2024 at a campaign event for Trump in New York City that he wants to cut the federal government budget by $2tn. Keep in mind that discretionary spending, or the amount that Congress has control over, was $1.7tn in 2023.US defense secretary saw few political drawbacks in backing joint chiefs ousterRead moreIn February, Musksaidfrom the Oval Office: “The people voted for major government reform, and that’s what the people are going to get.”There are two main initiatives that Musk’s Doge is trying to carry out. The first is offering federal employees buyouts for voluntarily leaving their jobs, and the second is laying off probationary employees, or employees who have been in their job for less than a year and don’t have civil service protection.It is unclear how many employees these initiatives will affect. The White House has said about 75,000 employees accepted buyouts, which will give workers a few months of pay and benefits if they leave their jobs imminently, what is known as “deferred resignation”. A federal judge temporarily blocked the program, which the Trump administration will now have to defend in court.Meanwhile, thelayoffsof probationary employees appears to have caused chaos across many parts of the federal government. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense all said they each had more than 5,000 employees on probation who could be laid off.The White House said that military service members, postal service workers and those whose positions relate to national security, immigration and public safety would be exempt from the buyout and layoff programs.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpElon MuskUS defence spendingUS militaryWashington DCexplainersShareReuse this content"

Theunemploymentrate was 4.1%, little changed from 4% in January. Economists had been expecting 170,000 new jobs to be added over the month.Chart of US job numbers, 151k added in FebruaryA total of 10,000 federal jobs were lost over the month but those losses were countered by hiring in healthcare, financial activities, transportation and warehousing, and social assistance.The report was based on surveys taken in the second week of February, and it will take longer for the mass government firings to appear in the official data.Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics said the jobs report “confirms the economy started the year soft but is not plummeting towards a recession. Some of those fears may resurface in the March employment report, when recent federal government layoffs will be a much larger drag on employment.” But Ryan said private-sector hiring was still running at a “fairly healthy” average.Other data points from earlier in the week showed signs of a slowing jobs market. The payroll firm ADPreportedjust 77,000 new hires in February, nearly half of what was projected. Meanwhile, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmassaidthat US-based employers announced 172,017 job cuts in February, the highest monthly total since July 2020.The firm calculated more than 62,000 of the job cuts were from 17 different federal government agencies – up from 151 federal government cuts in February 2024.It may take some time for the impact of the president’s policies, particularly the mass layoffs of federal government workers coming from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and the tariffs Trump has placed on China and threatened against Canada and Mexico, to fully impact the jobs market.Trump delays tariffs on many products from Mexico and CanadaRead moreThe full effect of the new policies will have on the labor market will depend on the extent to which they are carried out, which is currently unclear. Unions aredisputingDoge’s buyout programs and the mass firing of probationary employees, and Trumpsaidon Thursday he will further delay tariffs on Mexico and Canada.The uncertainty battered consumer confidence in February, which saw its biggest month-by-monthdeclinein nearly four years. Confidence on Wall Street also fell dramatically after Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.The jobs report is closely watched by Federal Reserve officials, who will meet on 18 and 19 March to decide whether to change the interest rates. Interest rates currently sit at 4.25% to 4.5% after the Fed knocked rates down three times in the fall. The Fed board held rates steady at its last meeting in January, saying that inflation was still above the Fed’s target of 2%.Inflationin January hit 3%, having climbed up slowly in the fall.After the Fed’s meeting in January, chair Jerome Powellsaidthat officials were unsure what would happen with tariffs, immigration and overall fiscal and regulatory policy. “We are going to be watching carefully as we always do,” he added.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment statisticsTrump tariffsUS economyDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsUS unemployment and employment datanewsShareReuse this content"

Now it is the establishment.The crypto giant – tether is the most traded cryptocurrency in the world – has had a strange trip. Four years ago, banks were dropping Tether as a client, and regulators in New York had the company against the wall over questions about commingled client and corporate funds. Treasury officialswere complainingthat dollar-backed cryptocurrencies enjoyed the international privileges of the dollar without the responsibilities of preventing its misuse. Federal investigators werelooking into Tetherfor possible violations of anti-money-laundering and sanctions rules.The cryptocurrency industry anecdotally – and conspiratorially – describes theBiden administration’s posture toward crypto as a systematic effort to debank crypto in the form of tactics such as “Operation Choke Point2.0”. Ardoino says Tether’s leadership needed to become globetrotters in search of someone to take their business.When you’re trying to be a disruptor – in a good sense – you are going to always be attacked by the establishmentPaolo ArdoinoAnd it’s a lot of business. Tether currently is the 17th largest holder of US government debt, with nearly as much in treasury bonds in its digital vaults as Saudi Arabia. Tether’s value remains stable because it is pegged one-to-one to the dollar, meaning the value of each individual tether coin is $1. The company backs the total value of the cryptocurrency with dollar assets like treasury bonds in an American bank – in this case, $140bn deposited with Cantor Fitzgerald.Tether comes just behind bitcoin and ethereum as the most valuable cryptocurrency, and by most measures it is the most widely traded. Investors in countries with unstable currencies, like Turkey or Argentina with their 40%-plus inflation rates, use it to hold on to the value of their savings against the dollar. Crypto traders use tether to park their digital assets in a safe place.The degree of cooperation between Tether and law enforcement reflects an evolving shift in the government’s posture toward the company, even as federal agencies had been cracking down on cryptocurrency more broadly underJoe Biden.“We’ve never been shady,” Ardoino said. “The company has been great. It has been attacked. Debanked. You know, when you’re trying to be a disruptor – in a good sense – you are going to always be attacked by the establishment.”Previous administrations’ hostility to crypto – and perhaps to tether in particular – was the product of strategic mistakes the company had made, Ardoino said.“We were very naive. We thought: ‘Oh, we are going to keep our head down.’ We were not communicating. We were not telling what’s going on, and that was used against us,” he said. “And that’s fair, right? So, if someone is not communicating, or you feel is not transparent enough, then that is how people get to fear.”‘Trump’s grifting tendencies’: how the president’s crypto ties could spur corruptionRead moreAfter settling its case with New York regulators in 2021, Tether began to come out of its shell, publishing quarterly statements and expanding its cooperation with the government. Today, things are different for Tether. Its banker – the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick – has been confirmed as secretary of commerce in theTrump administration. The company says it is proud of its cooperation with US law enforcement. Though Tether’s holding company is headquartered in crypto-friendly El Salvador, the cryptocurrency is expanding in a way that Ardoino says will help the United States secure its position as the world’s reserve currency.“We have 400 million users in emerging markets,” Ardoino said. “We are basically selling the US debt outside the US … We are decentralizing the US debt as well, basically pushing for dollar hegemony. That’s how the US can maintain its dominance when it comes to its currency.”It’s a line Lutnick might have written into his confirmation hearing speech himself. The Senate confirmed Lutnick on a party-line vote 51-45 in February. Ardoino said their relationship is at arm’s-length now, though.“Cantor [Fitzgerald], they are our custodian. So, we will continue to have this relationship with Cantor,” he said. “They have been a great custodian for us. They are primary dealers, so we can have basically direct access to the Fed[eral Reserve] to purchase [government] debt. With Howard, when he goes into government, we cannot talk to him.”Lutnick has been a vocal backer of cryptocurrency and tether’s position in the industry in particular. Senators had some sharp questions for him about tether at his 29 January hearing, with Senator Maria Cantwell pressing him about audited holdings.“Do you think the market needs to comply with audits about whether one-to-one ratios really exist on stablecoins?” Cantwell asked Lutnick.“I believe stablecoins, US dollar stablecoins, should be audited, should be completely backed by US treasuries 100%,” Lutnick replied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If someone’s made a deposit with you, you can’t say: ‘I’m going to withdraw, you’re going to change the price.’”She also asked about reports that “as much as $19bn of Tether could be illicit activity by the North Koreans, the Russians, the Chinese. And so, what do we do about that? What is your solution?”“It’s like blaming Apple because criminals use Apple phones,” Lutnick replied. “It’s just a product. We don’t pick on the US treasury because criminals use dollars. So, I think it’s just a product … They are signed up with all US federal law enforcement. They follow all federal law enforcement instantly.”Ardoino rejects the suggestion of tether’s usefulness to criminals. “There is no financial institution – even the big banks, they don’t have this breadth of collaboration,” he said, citing more than 200 agencies in 50 countries that work with Tether.A Swiss bank might rebuff an American law enforcement agency coming for money in its accounts. Tether, however, touts its ability to return money stolen from others. For example, a notable “pig butchering” scam last year sent Shan Hanes, CEO of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, Kansas, to a 293-month federal prison term for embezzling $47.1m and sending it overseas as cryptocurrency. Tether was able to recover $8.3m for the victims.The traditional banking system is more porous than a cryptocurrency wallet right now, Ardoino argued.“When [criminals are] finally trying to use blockchain and move money on the blockchain in USDT [tether’s trading symbol], we see them and we freeze them,” he said. “And it takes 15 minutes to freeze an address from our stock. We are much more granular and faster than any bank or any other financial institution. So, I’ve been saying very loudly and publicly that any criminal using USDT is a very stupid criminal, because we can see everything and we can catch it.”Ardoino does see a threat in an adversarial regulatory relationship toward crypto, both in the United States and Europe. Both Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and EU-based exchanges removed USDT because it does not comply with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which went into effect at the end of 2024. Traders can hold Tether in non-custodial wallets but can’t trade it on an exchange that complies with European regulations.How do you solve a problem like DeepSeek?Read more“I think that the US understands very well that they should very, very much avoid a DeepSeek moment for finance and crypto,” Ardoino said, suggesting that it is possible that some invention in a stealth-mode lab somewhere beyond the industry’s attention could radically change the competitive environment. Ardoino was referring to the Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek, a large language model AI that emerged seemingly from nowhere in January that could compete with Meta and OpenAI’s offerings at a fraction of the cost. Its emergence is disrupting AI business plans by changing the competitive environment.Ardoino hopes the new administration will have settled on its approach to regulations – likely to be much friendlier than its predecessor’s – by September, he said. “I think that they want to get regulations done by June. June would be very aggressive as a timeline, but September is realistic.”Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We do not need to be in a hurry and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.”US job market grows amid threats of mass federal layoffs and Trump tariffsRead morePowell spoke at a volatile time, with stock markets and bond yields both declining in the wake of Donald Trump’swhiplash announcementsof steep import tariffs on major trading partners Mexico and Canada, followed by delays in implementing them. Trump has also doubled tariffs on imports from China.Though Powell said the economy “continues to be in a good place”, he added: “It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.”Still, key indicators remain solid, Powell added, with ongoing, if uneven, progress on inflation and continued job gains.With the US government on Friday reporting job growth of151,000 in February, Powell noted the economy has been adding a “solid” 191,000 jobs a month since September.Some measures of short-term inflation expectations have moved higher, Powell said, but “most measures of longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2% inflation goal”.Whether inflation slows faster than expected or the economy does start to weaken, “our current policy stance is well positioned” to respond, he said.The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the current 4.25%-4.50% range at its 18 and 19 March policy meeting. Policymakers will also issue new economic projections that will give insight into how the first two months of the Trump administration have influenced the outlook for inflation, employment, growth and the path of interest rates.Investors have begun taking the possibility of an economic slowdown more seriously, and now expect the Fed to approve three quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of this year.Reuters contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyJerome PowellUS interest ratesInflationUS unemployment and employment statisticsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It could serve as a beachhead for his other business ambitions in IndiaHannah Ellis-Petersenin DelhiFri 7 Mar 2025 05.16 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 05.48 ESTShareIt is easy to believe that Elon Musk’s reach knows no limits. But while theworld’s richest manmay control a space satellite empire, own one of the largest social media platforms, produce the world’s bestselling electric car, and have been given carte blanche by Donald Trump to gut the US government, there is one market that Musk has yet to properly crack: India.Now, with his newfound influence over the Trump administration and global geopolitics, it appears likely that Musk’s entrance into the Indian market, both with hisTeslaelectric cars and his Starlink satellite internet, may come smoother and faster than expected.When the Indian prime minister,Narendra Modi, travelled to Washington to meet Trump earlier this month, he also sat down privately with Musk, where according to the Indian government, the pair “discussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and US entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development”.Trump put it more bluntly: “I assume he [Musk] wants to do business inIndia.”Up till now, India’s 110% tariffs on imported electric vehicles have prevented Tesla from entering the fast-growing Indian market. However, Musk vowed last year that Tesla would be in India “as soon as humanly possible” – and after his recent encounter with Modi, it seems he is keen to make that a reality.Tesla has already begun advertising for jobs in Mumbai and Delhi, and has signed a lease to open its first showroom in Mumbai. Tesla could also take advantage of a new Indian government scheme that lowers import tariffs on electric vehicles to just 15% if they commit to investing $500m within three years in a factory that will manufacture the cars. However, the tax break applies only to the first 8,000 vehicles, a limit Tesla is likely to push back on.A Tesla factory would be a boon for India, a country that is desperate for foreign investment and job creation, particularly in manufacturing. Nonetheless, Musk has a chequered record for his commitments to investing in India. Last year, he left the Modi government reeling after he made high-profile plans to travel to India, and had dangled the possibility of a $3bn investment to build a Tesla factory in the country, only to cancel the trip at the last minute. Instead, he travelled to rival China – another huge market that Musk has been equally keen to capitalise on – to cut a major deal.View image in fullscreenElon Musk at the opening of the Tesla factory in Berlin, Germany, in 2022.Photograph: Patrick Pleul/APTesla also faces stiff competition from Indian manufacturers, who are already making and selling popular electric SUVs for about a quarter of the £35,000 starting price that a Tesla costs, which would be far above the budget of most Indian families. (Sales of Tesla cars are also plummeting globally, with a45% decline in Europein January.)Trump, too, has appeared less enthusiastic about Musk’s ambitions to start making Teslas in India. “Now, if he built the factory in India, that’s OK, but that’s unfair to us. It’s very unfair,” Trump told Fox News.Another possibly more lucrative finger in India’s pie for Musk could be Starlink, the satellite internet technology operated by hisSpaceXcompany. Globally, Musk already has a dominant lead on satellite internet, with more than half of all satellites in the skies.Since 2021, he has been fixated on getting Starlink into India. While the current appetite for satellite internet in India is tiny, it is expected to grow to a $1.9bn (£1.5bn) market by 2030 according to Deloitte and is seen as a crucial entry point into India’s flourishing telecomms industry.Speaking to reporters earlier this year, after Trump’s inauguration, at which Musk was highly prominent, India’s communications minister confirmed that Starlink was in the process of seeking necessary security permissions to operate in India.Jyotiraditya Scindia said: “When you check all the boxes, you get the licence. If they [Starlink] do that, we will be very happy.”Yet in India, telecoms, including satellite internet, are among the most strictly regulated and controlled industries in India, placing vast obstacles in the way of foreign companies such as Musk’s being granted security permissions to operate.Smuggled Starlink devices allegedly used to defy India’s internet shutdownsRead moreIn particular, Musk’s close connections and business interests in China and the use of Starlink in the Ukraine war were seen as possibly insurmountable cybersecurity issues, as well as the ability of SpaceX to be able to control access to Starlink’s satellite internet from outside the country. The Indian governmentunder Modi has routinely ordered internet providers to block critical online content andused internet blackoutsas a means of information control.These fears could be heightened after sources in the Indian state of Manipur, which borders Myanmar,told the Guardian earlier this year that Starlink was already being usedby militant groups in the state to circumvent regular internet shutdowns being imposed after outbreaks of ethnic violence.A recent Indian thinktank report warned that Starlink was a “wolf in sheep’s clothing”, citing its use by US intelligence agencies and military, and warned of its potential to be used to undermine Indian security.Yet, after the election of Trump, some believe that the Indian government may be more willing to side-step those concerns. “I think before the US election results came through, India would have had their doubts about giving Musk’s Starlink security clearance,” said Nikhil Pahwa, the founder of MediaNama, an Indian tech news platform.“One of the things that India relies on is control over internet access and control over its operators. But now that Musk is a part of the US government, his leverage in India has certainly increased and his chances of Starlink clearing security approvals have probably improved dramatically – or at least will happen much faster.”View image in fullscreenStarlink could provide satellite internet to rural areas but some have raised fears it could be used to undermine Indian security.Photograph: Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto/ShutterstockPahwa said the decision on Starlink by the Indian government was now “as much of a political decision as a security decision”.What’s been called “Starlink diplomacy” – opening up the country to Musk’s satellites in an apparent attempt to gratify the Trump administration – has already been evident in neighbouring Bangladesh, where this week the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, suddenly extended an invitation for Musk to launch Starlink in the country within 90 days.Even prior to the re-election of Trump, the Indian government had already made manoeuvres favourable to Starlink’s ambitions. In October, the government announced that satellite spectrum for broadband would be allocated administratively rather than through auction, something that Musk had lobbied hard for. “We will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink,” said Musk on X in response.The decision means that Starlink has a far better opportunity to compete against Indian telecoms companies in the battle for control over the country’s satellite internet market. It was met with anger by some of the country’s biggest operators, such as Jio, who also have vast ambitions in the satellite internet space, and have since been lobbying the government to reverse its decision on the auction.One of the main benefits of satellite internet is that it can offer internet access even in the most remote areas. However, in India, most people living in rural areas are unlikely to be able to afford it, unless at heavily subsidised prices.Prasanto K Roy, a technology analyst, said it could set off a pricing war with India’s biggest telecom operators if Starlink repeated what it has done in Africa with heavily reduced pricing, where Starlink costs about $10 compared with $120 in the US. Jio, whose success in mobile internet came from undercutting every competitor, making India’s mobile internet some of the cheapest in the world, is likely to follow suit.“Starlink won’t find it as easy in India as it has in other markets, there is very strong competition here so it will be hard for it to gain a monopoly, even with low prices,” said Roy.He added: “Those using Starlink are obviously going to be a very tiny niche at the top of the socioeconomic pyramid. But once he’s got a hold, it is something Musk could really leverage in India.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaElon MuskNarendra ModiSpaceXTelecommunications industryTeslaTrade and developmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Between hearings, he met journalists and activists to spread word of the health crisis his people face.“A people have been completely destroyed: people’s way of life destroyed; people’s only drinking water, which is the underground water aquifer, has been poisoned; people’s farmland has been completely poisoned; people’s streams that they use [for] their normal livelihood have been completely destroyed,” he said.When oil first flowed from the wells in Ogoniland in 1956, before Okpabi was born, it was a lush landscape of mangrove forests. Its sparkling watercourses were populated by fishes, crabs, oysters and other creatures. The land’s people were primarily fishers and farmers.Five and a half decades later, scientists from the UN Environment Programme visited the region to investigate the industry’s effects. They found extensive soil and groundwater contamination, mangrove roots choked with bitumen-like substances, surface water in creeks and streams covered in thick layers of oil. The fish had fled or died and farmers struggled to grow crops in fields soaked with oil.View image in fullscreenA sign at a creek in Ogale, in Ogoniland in the Niger delta, warns people not to use the water.Photograph: Leigh DayOf all the areas tested,Nisisioken Ogale, Okpabi’s domain, was “of most immediate concern”. People there were drinking from wells contaminated with benzene, a known carcinogen, at levels more than 900 times the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. Follow-up testing carried out in the same area last year found levels that were even higher – 2,600 times the WHO guideline.The effects of this contamination have been tragic, says Okpabi. “There is a lot of cancer: young girls of 20 to 30 years old, 40 years old, developing breast cancer and other forms of cancer; a lot of strange skin diseases that we don’t know the cause of; low life expectancy, people just drying up and dying. Even eye diseases. In some cases birth defects … Strange diseases everywhere in our lives.”The trial centres on claims by Oganiland’s Ogale and Bille communities that the enduring effects of hundreds of leaks and spills from Shell’s pipelines and infrastructure have breached their right to a clean and healthy environment.The three and a half weeks of hearings, which ended on Friday, were a “preliminary issues trial”, heard by Mrs Justice Juliet May, to determine the scope of the legal issues to be decided at the case’s full trial, set for late 2026. Although the case is being heard by a British judge in a UK court, it will apply Nigerian law, and so May heard from a range of senior Nigerian lawyers about what the law is and how it should be applied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A second key issue was whether Shell could be held responsible for damage to its pipelines due to oil theft, or for the waste produced as a result of illegal refining of spilled or stolen oil – endemic in the Niger delta.Shell argues it cannot be held responsible. The company insists its Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), works closely with the Nigerian government to prevent spills and to respond to them and clean them up when they do occur.View image in fullscreenA man stands on fishing canoes surrounded by polluted water in the Niger Delta.Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP“We strongly believe in the merits of our case.Oilis being stolen on an industrial scale in the Niger delta.

But there are a select few for whom hopes of a turnaround in fortunes are a distant prospectOliver ConnollyFri 7 Mar 2025 05.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 10.57 ESTShareFive years ago, we looked at the teams vying for thechampionship belt of incompetence. If a lesson came from the exercise – the Chargers, Commanders and Texans made the list – it’s that a young franchise quarterback can transform a team’s fortunes pretty quickly. The other lesson is that Woody Johnson is aconsistentlyawfulowner. Anyway, here’s our latest list of woe.Cleveland BrownsA single decision can detonate a franchise. At the start of the decade, the Browns were fun upstarts. They had hit on a batch of top draft picks. They made the playoffs. With Baker Mayfield, they finally had a serviceable starting quarterback. It felt like the longtime AFC North doormats were a move or two away from catching up with the conference’s big boys – and they were swimming in the salary cap space needed to make those moves happen. And then they tethered their future to Deshaun Watson, sending three first-round picks to Houston for the quarterback and signing him to a fully-guaranteed, five-year, $230m contract.Three years on, the trade has been an abject disaster. Forget the worst trade in NFL history, it’s up there with the worst deals in any sport. Cleveland mortgaging their franchise for Watson makes the Dallas Maverickstrading away Luka Dončićor the Boston Red Sox letting Babe Ruth walk look like savvy business. Watson is a shadow of the player he wasbefore he was suspendedover allegations of sexual misconduct. Last season, he was the worst starter in the NFL by a comfortable distancebeforehe tore his achilles late in the year. And all that’s before we get tothe ethical considerationsof giving someone with Watson’s history a huge deal.In the Hall of Fame of hopelessness, we should open a new wing for those Cleveland fans who have been scouring through the fine print of Watson’s deal to see if the Browns can wriggle their way out of paying the final years of his contract.‘Culture of fear’: Jets rank bottom of NFL players’ report cards as Washington improveRead moreThe Browns have restructured Watson’s deal to give them morefinancial flexibility on the back endwhile opening up some cap space for this offseason. The move cleared $35m in cap space for this offseason, but still leaves Cleveland in the bottom 10 in cap space as they look to rejuvenate their roster. Still, for all the cap chicanery, the Browns still have a stack of Watson money on their books. They’ve now paid him over half of thecashdue to the quarterback, but they still have over $135m insalary cap moneyto put on their sheet. That money will likely extend beyond Watson’s time in Clevaland, meaning the team will still pay a premium for a player not on their roster. Manipulating Watson’s contract was a must for the franchise, but at some point the accounting mechanics will come due. For now, the Browns are kicking the can down the road in the hopes of rebuilding the rest of the roster with a sinkhole at quarterback.That leaves Cleveland entering this offseason with no established quarterback beyond the injured Watson, no cap room and holes all over their roster. It’s no wonder that Myles Garrett requested a trade. Cleveland’s best hope is that they can move Garrett for a bounty of draft picks, tear the roster down, start again and build toward the blessed day when Watson’s contract is finally off the books.Pittsburgh SteelersThe Steelers are a good team, but what makes them hopeless is the lack of any sign they will improve: being stuck in football purgatory brings a despondency of its own.The Steelers are a perennial playoff team who get crushed in January. They are further away today from contending in the AFC than they have been in years. By all accounts, they will let Russell Wilson walk this offseason and return to the veteran quarterback market to find another stopgap. Justin Fields, who Wilson ultimately beat out as the starter last season, will likely be retained to give the team some continuity.After last season’s playoff defeat, it was clear that Mike Tomlin needed to make more dramatic changes. For as strong as Tomlin has been in the regular season over the past decade, his postseason record has been poor. Tomlin is now 8-11 for his career in playoffs and 0-5 in the last eight years. Worse, the Steelers have looked uncompetitive in all five of those defeats.The Steelers roster is still filled with question marks. Their defense, the backbone of their recent success, is getting old. How long can they bank on Cameron Heyward, who is about to turn 36, being one of the league’s best defensive linemen? Was TJ Watt’s mild decline at the back end of last season a one-off or a sign that he is on the slide?Tomlin has not yet made big moves. He retained his staff this offseason and has spoken, again, of “internal growth”. Reports out of Pittsburgh suggest the team is not sold on the middle band of quarterbacks in this year’s draft class – and the team does not seem interested in striking a blockbuster trade to leap to the top of the draft to grab the University of Miami’s Cam Ward, the No 1 quarterback in the class.That leaves the Steelers in a rut. Under Tomlin, they will never bottom out and grab a top draft pick. The coach is too good. But what is the path to contention? The plan seems to be to run it back with a veteran quarterback and an outdated offense, relying on an aging defense to squeeze out another playoff berth. Tomlin will continue to surpass expectations and guide rickety rosters to the playoffs. But at some point, it becomes taxing on a fanbase to know that you have no shot to compete when it matters most.New York JetsThere is one culprit for the Jets’ never-ending malaise: owner Woody Johnson. Remember those couple of years when Woody stepped back from the team and let his brother, Christopher, run the show? Good times. For two years, the Jets looked positively adequate.View image in fullscreenAaron Rodgers is a free agent after his time with the Jets.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APSince Woody returned from his ambassadorial role in the UK, though, he has been on a hopeless hot streak. The heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune turned his team over to a 40-year-old crank. Aaron Rodgers was given the keys to the building, handpicking his staff, making key personnel decisions and setting his own schedule, to the chagrin of then-head coach Robert Saleh.The result: two lost seasons, endless controversies and another Johnson-inspired debacle.The Jets have the longest-running playoff drought in the league. Since 2011, they have finished above .500 only once. Back in 2022, there were solid-looking foundations. The Jets had a talented young core and a front office that looked like it knew what it was doing. They had missed on quarterback Zach Wilson, but had a roster capable of mounting a playoff push. But the two-year dalliance with Rodgers has set the franchise back – and every part of the Rodgers-led clown show had Johnson’s fingerprints on it.With Dan Snyder out of the league, Johnson has claimed the top spot as the league’s worst owner. Tempestuous. Impatient. Egotistical. Nepotistic. Intrusive. Controlling. Johnson has it all.“It’s the most dysfunctional place imaginable,” an anonymous player told the Athletic last season about the Jets. He was not alone. Johnson was the only owner toreceive an F from playersin the Players’ Association’s annual survey. He finished last in the survey in his willingness to invest in facilities, last in contributing to a positive team culture and second to last in being committed to building a competitive team. Almost the triple crown! Maybe next year, Woody.Culture is a nebulous term. But when the teenage son of an owner is handing out game balls rather than a player or head coach, whatever the culture is supposed to be is broken. You can add to that Johnson and his family’s penchant for criticizing players in the locker room, including reportedly telling quarterback Mike White: “you fucking suck.” Or you can add Johnson reportedly scuppering a trade last offseason because his 15-year-old told him theplayer had a low Madden rating, which sounds like a rejected plot from a crappy Netflix show.Still, hope springs eternal in New York. The Jets have moved on from Rodgers and his buddies and are at the start of another cycle. Aaron Glenn, the new head coach, is an exciting hire. Maybe the Jets will eventually hit on a franchise quarterback who can trigger a quick turnaround. But they’ve taken plenty of shots on smart coaches and talented quarterbacks before. Johnson has a 20-year legacy of losing. Until he sells the team, the Jets are unlikely to build a stable team, let alone a contender.New York GiantsThe Jets’ roommates have question marks of their own. The owner, general manager, head coach and quarterback set the trajectory of a franchise. Three of those positions are up in the air.Owner John Mara retained GM Joe Schoen and coach Brian Daboll after a disappointing 2024, one that brought viral attention after they were featured on Hard Knocks. Credit to Mara; other owners would not have readily accepted that humiliation.Mara keeping the two main pieces in place made sense. Schoen crushed last year’s draft, even if some of his free-agency decisions (betting on Daniel Jones; letting Saquon Barkley walk) have gone awry. Daboll has proved he can develop a young quarterback and can squeeze solid performances out of an incomplete offense. Thatshouldbe a solid foundation, allowing the Giants to tweak this offseason and build methodically rather than chase high-priced names. But Mara’s decision to keep his two chief decision-makers came with a public credo: find a quarterback.Every staff feels offseason pressure, but Schoen and Daboll are working under a particularly thick cloud. If they whiff on their quarterback, they could be out of their jobs before November. And it’s slim pickings out there. Do they want to commit to a multi-year contract for Sam Darnold or spend a fortune in future assets to move up to the top spot in the draft to select Ward? Even if they’re unsold on either, they may have to shut their eyes, sign the contract and hope for the best.The Giants’ first choice was to trade for Matthew Stafford but he ultimately decided to return to the Rams. Beyond pulling off a deal for Darnold or moving up the draft for Ward, they’re left looking in the bargain bin.Rodgers is the fallback plan. If not Rodgers, Schoen and Daboll’s jobs may rest on the shoulders of Wilson, Jameis Winston or a rookie quarterback. The best free agent on the market after Darnold, Rodgers (if you’re Rodgers-inclined) and Wilson is … Daniel Jones.Oops.Mara showed admirable patience by retaining his coach and general manager. But they’re now working from a point of desperation. If they invest heavily in a quarterback this offseason solely to protect their jobs, it could set the franchise back years.Explore more on these topicsNFLCleveland BrownsPittsburgh SteelersNew York GiantsNew York JetsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Andretti name is no longer involved in the project, although Mario is set to be involved as an adviser.F1 testing: what we learned from our first look at the class of 2025 in BahrainRead moreA joint statement from F1 and the FIA read: “The FIA and Formula One can confirm that, following the completion of their respective sporting, technical and commercial assessments, the application by General Motors and TWG Motorsports to bring a Cadillac team to the FIA Formula One World Championship from 2026 has been approved.”The other 10 teams had largely been against the introduction of a new outfit because of the dilution of prize money.However, it is understood Cadillac’s ambition to become a full works team and commitment to a future power unit of their own – as well as the significant financial involvement of General Motors in the project – was too good for the sport to resist.F1’s presence in the United States has increased dramatically in recent seasons following the success of the sport’s Netflix series, Drive to Survive – the seventh season was released on Friday – as well as the growing number of races in America. Las Vegas, Miami and Austin will all stage events this year.It is expected that at least one of Cadillac’s drivers will be American. Briton Graeme Lowdon has already been announced as the team principal and it will have a base at Silverstone.FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, who has called for more teams and clashed with F1 over Andretti’s initial proposal, said: “Today marks a transformative moment, and I am proud to lead the Federation in this progressive step for the championship.“The FIA Formula One Championship’s expansion to an 11th team in 2026 is a milestone. GM/Cadillac brings fresh energy, aligning with the new FIA 2026 regulations and ushering in an exciting era for the sport.“The Cadillac Formula One Team’s presence in the paddock will inspire future competitors and fans. Their entry strengthens our mission to push motorsport’s boundaries at the highest level.”F1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali said: “As we said in November, the commitment by General Motors to bring a Cadillac team to Formula One was an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport.“I want to thank GM and TWG for their constructive engagement over many months and look forward to welcoming the team on the grid from 2026 for what will be another exciting year for Formula One.”The opening round of the new 24-round season gets under way in Melbourne a week on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportGeneral MotorsShareReuse this content"

Brunson got help up from teammates and stayed in the game to make both free throws and tie it at 107. He then came out and went to the locker room.Brunson led the Knicks with 39 points and 10 assists. He sent the game into overtime with a three-point play after the Lakers rallied from a double-digit deficit midway through the fourth quarter.“His mental toughness is through the roof. It doesn’t surprise me the way he played the whole game. He still keeps battling and battling,” Thibodeau said about Brunson, who was 13 of 26 from the field and made 12 of his 13 foul shots.Brunson’s injury could not come at a worse time for the Knicks.

These are momentous times for the Norwegian football club in the agricultural south-western region of Jæren. Last season they were promoted back to the Eliteserien, the top division, for the first time in 22 years in front of a capacity crowd of 5,000 and excitement is building before the start of the season at the end of March. Fans hope they can return to heights not seen since they won the cup in Oslo in 1987 – which would have been considered the club’s crowning achievement were it not for the rise ofErling Haaland.In the brittle, banter-fuelled world of English football, it might feel as if Haaland’s star is waning this season. It is easy to forget he is second only to Mohamed Salah in the Premier League Golden Boot after winning it in the previous two seasons. At the age of 24 he is the all-time Norwegian national team top scorer (38 in 39 matches), and a Champions League, Premier League and Austrian league winner. The school playground of my six-year-old son, Ernest, is no longer consumed by the great Messi-Ronaldo debate but instead is alive to the shouts of “HAAAAARRR-LAND”.View image in fullscreenErnest and Greta Hatton-Burrows on the top floor of Bryne’s only skyscraper, where they can view the artist Pøbel’s mural of Erling Haaland.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIt’s a thrill, then, to take Ernest and the rest of my family to Norway’s latest attraction:the Haaland safari. Bryne FK have even arranged for us to stay in the “Haaland suite” of the local Hotell Jæren, where a mural on the wall of the living space depicts Erling at different stages of his career, starting as the milk-haired boy playing for Bryne FK. My wife, Hayley, and I walk with our children from the hotel through cold blasts of North Sea air to meet the club’s marketing manager, Bjørn Hagerup Røken, and his brother Frode Hagerup, who is on the board and works in local tourism – at the windswept Bryne stadium.With them are some pension‑age fans, including Sandve, who volunteer to take tourists around on the Haaland safari among other tasks from cleaning the stadium to stocking the shop. “We know the club,” says another, Endre Refsnes. “And we love the club.”This summer, tourists from the British cruise ship Iona that docks in Stavanger have a choice: visit the natural wonder of this area of Norway, Preikestolen (the pulpit rock), or be led around a frayed football ground and the other Haaland safari stopping points for which participants are charged 750 Norwegian kroner (£54). The tour, available in English and Norwegian, started as a bit of fun a couple of years ago but it is becoming part of a serious stab at putting Bryne FK and by extension the town itself on the map. Frode says Manacor, Mallorca, where Rafael Nadal is from, and Madeira, the home of Cristiano Ronaldo, are models.View image in fullscreenErnest Hatton-Burrows (six) and Greta Hatton-Burrows (eight) play, while Frode Hagerup, daily manager at Opplev Jæren, shows Tim Burrows another mural.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianWe start at Jærhallen, an indoor training facility rebuilt a few years ago and opened by a surprise visit from Haaland (local kids training at the time didn’t believe it was him). It was initially built to keep players dry because this area of Norway is milder but also wetter. It is open every day for anyone to come and hone their skills – and it is free. Inside, a recently signed young player from Nigeria is pinging balls across the hall.Haaland is the son of the tough-tackling former Nottingham Forest, Leeds andManchester Citymidfielder Alf-Inge Haaland, and lived in England until the family returned to their homestead of Bryne in 2003. He was fast-tracked to play for Bryne at 15, famed for a turn of pace, intelligent runs and lethal finishing after thriving under the tutelage of the youth coach Alf Ingve Berntsen, whose inclusive, person-focused approach led to outstanding results. Endre shows us thedrylaveggen, rebuilt in tribute to the wooden wall where young Erling would try to hit the exact same point over and over again. The word“dryla” is common only in Norway’s south-west. “It typically refers to hitting or kicking something with tremendous force,” writes Lars Sivertsen, in his biography of Haaland. “The most accurate and phonetically pleasing English translation is probably ‘to wallop’ something …”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Marketing manager Bjørn Hagerup, Røken Frode Hagerup, daily manager at Opplev Jæren (regional marketing), and volunteer Kjell Hammervold at Bryne Stadium.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianBefore we leave the Jærhallen, Endre points out the enormous pictures of Haaland and Tuva Hansen, who plays for Bayern Munich’s women’s team, alongside a caption in Norwegian: “We will sow the joy of football, nurture talent, and harvest miracles.” This might make Haaland sound like a freakishly big prize-winning vegetable. But it isn’t just sloganeering. The club’s philosophy ties in with the agricultural character of the Jæren region. Work to turning the rock-strewn hillsides into arable land using only spades, before heavy machinery, was backbreaking, and contributed to the mythos of Jæren as a place where hard work was a prerequisite.View image in fullscreenThe ‘VIP’ tractor section at Bryne Stadium.Photograph: Svenn-Olav Sele, Bryne FKBryne FK have a section of the stadium where farmers can drive their tractors in to watch the game. When the club played Viking FK in the 2001 cup final in Oslo, the Norwegian press reported how a convoy of tractors had travelled laden with cucumbers, cabbage and broccoli to deliver to people they met along the way, before parading through the capital, turning it a sea of red and white. Yet the fans’ plan to use sheep bells to create a menacing din during the game didn’t work, and Bryne lost 3-0.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His posts about drinkinghis “magic potion”, milk fresh from the farm, have given local dairies a boost. Growing up, Haaland drove tractors on the farm of his uncle Gabriel Hoyland, a former star player for Bryne who these days is a potato farmer with a passion for Burnley FC. A picture of Haalandon his uncle’s blue tractora few seasons back has become so iconic in these parts that I am advised to visit the same style of tractor – a Super Dexta made by Fordsons in the 1960s – in a dedicated space at the fascinating Vitengarden museum. When I visit the next day, there are some old boys looking at the older models as if ogling classic sports cars.We arrive at the club shop. A cluster of Manchester City shirts hang among the red and white merch – the locals buy City shirts, but not so much the tourists, who want an authentic home shirt. Like all Norwegian clubs, Bryne are owned by the members, but commerce is still vital to their existence and they have a natural entrepreneurial streak to woo business: in the 1980s they were the first Norwegian club to create a VIP area. Now Bryne are back in the top division, investment is needed, but Bjørn says they still have to be “smart in the transfer market”. The rise of Haaland internationally has coincided with a revival of fortunes for Bryne FK. When Haaland was sold to City, the club were compensated to the tune of 10m NOK (£710,900). Some hope Real Madrid will one day swoop for him, meaning another payday for the club, particularly now he has signed a nine-year contract.View image in fullscreenMarketing manager Bjørn Hagerup and Røken Frode Hagerup, daily manager at Opplev Jæren, in the Bryne FK shop.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianWe head out of the club shop and take a look at the playing surface. “We are only one of few teams in Norway in the top level that are playing on natural grass,” says Sandve. The groundsman is – what else? – a farmer, “so he knows how to do it”, says Endre. The grass will soon be put to the test, when Bryne kick off the new season against last year’s champions, Bodø/Glimt, on 30 March.After playing Where’s Erling? while looking at old youth-team squad photos in the clubhouse, we head into town, passing the high school Haaland went to en route to Forum Jæren, the tallest building in Bryne. From the top you can see the sea, the mountains, the whole town. We look down at the mural of Haaland on the side of a former dairy by the Bryne-born street artist Pøbel, who used a fire extinguisher filled with yellow paint to create it. It is the first thing visitors on the train see as they arrive. We pass a more modest piece, a tribute to Alf-Inge Haaland, designed by Frode’s 12-year-old son, before we head to the last attraction – a mural depicting a cartoon Erling affecting his trademark meditation celebration, positioned next to Wen Hua House, his favourite Chinese restaurant, where you can buy a Haaland special (sweet and sour chicken and rice).View image in fullscreenErnest Hatton-Burrows enjoys himself at the Bryne FK stadium.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIt is hard to tally the small, parochial details of Haaland’s hometown with his gargantuan stature around the world. I notice for the rest of the trip that every shop sells Haaland-branded ice lollies, and talk to Ståle Økland, a former politician and writer whose father, Arne Larsen Økland, played as a star striker for Bryne in the 1970s and 80s. “I remember I was in Japan last year,” he says. “We were up in the mountains hiking. When we met some of the locals, they asked us where we came from, and we said Norway. And the first thing they said was: ‘Haaland.’”Explore more on these topicsErling HaalandManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The midfielder has two years on his deal but the club would be open to ­selling the England international, who is valued at about £70m, to help their finances.The Stockport-born academy ­graduate, 20 in April, joined United aged six and made his debut as a 17-year-old in 2023. Mainoo, who has 10 England caps, has played 60 times for the first team and has been in protracted negotiations over a new deal but no agreement has been found. He has been discussed as a potential Chelsea target but moving to another Premier League club is not currently part of his thinking.Mainoo earns about £20,000 a week and his representatives want to improve his wages to reflect his role in the team. United believe Mainoo could still agree to improved terms.Ruben Amorim fears he ‘will not have same time’ as Arteta to improve UnitedRead moreIf he declines to extend his deal, income from selling Mainoo would be a welcome boost for United, whoneed to bring in moneyif they are to make signings. But losing a homegrown player while Ruben Amorim is trying to rebuild the side would be difficult for many fans to accept.United would be eager to ­maximise Mainoo’s sale value because any fee would go down as profit after he came through the academy, and a player’s value almost always goes down in the final two years of a contract. There has been no direct contact with other clubs.Mainoo was a regular under Amorim before a calf injury in February but the head coach concluded he could not use him in his usual ­midfield role. “He was struggling a lot defending, as a midfielder – now more as a No 10 you can feel he’s ­playing on the ball nearer the box and near the box is really good with his small connections,” Amorim said in late January. “We need time to work with players on what is their best position.”Amorim has also praised Mainoo’s improvement, saying the 19-year-old was “really, really good” but “not the finished product” and has “so much potential to grow up even more”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He may have succeeded in grounding them but Arne Slot’s side still found a way to soar.The exhilarating, aggressive football of Jürgen Klopp has given way to quality control under his successor, butLiverpoolare no less effective for that shift. The league leaders, who can go 16 points clear with victory over Southampton on Saturday, have scored more goals after 28 games of this Premier League campaign (66) than at the same stage of their last title-winning season, under Klopp in 2019-20 (64). Plymouth, Tottenham (in a Carabao Cup semi-final Spurs ultimately lost 4-1 on aggregate) and Nottingham Forest are the only teams to prevent Slot’s team scoring in 44 matches this season.Liverpool fans to have 2022 Champions League final injury claims heard in UKRead moreLiverpool have scored two or more goals in their last 18 games at Anfield in all competitions. Another two at home to Southampton and it will be the longest such sequence in the English top flight since Sunderland scored two or more in 19 consecutive games in 1935. And some people call them lucky. Not that equalling a 90-year-old feat is Slot’s priority, as he called on Liverpool’s players and fans to treat the visit of the league’s bottom club as “the first of three finals in the next week”, before Tuesday’s Champions League second leg against PSG and Sunday’s Carabao Cup showpiece against Newcastle.“It’s always nice but it is not the record I came to England for,” said the Dutchman on the opportunity to equal Sunderland’s run. “We are not focused on those records, we focus on Southampton and then the Champions League and then the cup final.“But it’s a sign that we are balanced and a sign that we have a lot of quality with players who can score goals in our squad. It’s also a sign of consistency and that is what you need, not only scoring goals but also not conceding in a season where you are fighting for the things we are.”Mohamed Salah’s phenomenal output includes a goal or an assist in each of the last 11 league games at Anfield. He requires one goal to become the third-highest scorer in Liverpool’s history outright with 242 and two more league goals to go joint-fifth on the all-time Premier League goalscorer’s chart, alongside Sergio Agüero with 184.No one can touch the 32-year‑old’s contribution of 30 goals and 22 assists in all competitions this season but the load is being shared. Cody Gakpo and Luis Díaz are both in double figures, with 16 and 13 goals respectively, Diogo Jota has eight despite another injury-hit campaign and the midfielders Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister and Curtis Jones have a combined total of 15.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah was stopped by PSG but he could soon mark some important goal milestones.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesSlot envisages a day when Liverpool are even more prolific. The head coach explained: “Wolves was difficult, Southampton away was difficult, the League Cup there was difficult and against Paris Saint-Germain it was really, really difficult. Yes, we are a really good team but we are not a team that every week wins 4- or 5-0 and after half an hour it is already 3-0. We have seen a team doing that a few times in recent years and I think, longer ago, Liverpool also had that where, after half an hour, it was already 3-0. We are not that team yet.“It is somewhere we are trying to go to and therefore it is something we need to improve a lot. But what this team does have is fighting spirit and until now they have always found a way to win a game and not always in the same manner, not always dominating ball possession, sometimes also by defending really hard and being good in transition. We know we have to be on top of our game because even if we are on top of our game we mostly win by one-goal margins.”The latest example, in Paris on Wednesday, was forged onan astonishing goalkeeping displayby Alisson. It would be remiss to focus entirely on Liverpool’s striking prowess after that performance. With Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving from Valencia this summer for an initial £25m and the Brazilian showing why,in Slot’s eyes, he is the best goalkeeper in the world against PSG, the Georgia international has a major fight on his hands to claim the first-choice role he craves next season.“He is in just as important a phase of the season with Valencia as we are in so it wouldn’t be smart for me to talk about him,” said Slot of Mamardashvili. “But in general I can say that if you want to play for Liverpool, you have to accept there is competition. If you don’t want to face competition then Liverpool is not the best place to go to.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Sunday he was pictured in a pub in east Manchester and then at two different places, both of which also served alcohol, in the north-east later that day. Guardiola was asked if he is at ease regarding these pictures of Grealish, who was City’s record signing when hejoined the club from Aston Villafor £100m in August 2021.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“They know what they have to do,” said Guardiola. “A day off is a day off, there is no training. They have private lives to do whatever they want. I’m not going to control what they do in their private life. I judge what I see on the pitch, the training sessions and the performances in the game. That’s where I judge the players.”Grealish has suffered another injury-hampered season that, together with uneven form, has limited him to only 14 starts in all competitions. Guardiola was asked if he would understand the player seeking to depart in the close season to try to guarantee game time elsewhere with a view to securing an England place before the World Cup in 2026.“I understand all the frustrations of all my players,” said Guardiola. “It’s so good to have a dream to play in the World Cup and the European Cup with his national team. I’m not bothered by that. What happens in terms of Jack, in terms of everyone, they will be treated at the end of the season. But now we are playing for many important things for the club.

And so the Arsenal manager waited. Myles Lewis-Skelly, though, knew what was coming and it duly did on Friday, as Arsenal prepared for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Manchester United.The 18-year-old left-back was a lucky boy against PSV. On a booking, he committed to a challenge on Richard Ledezma in the 26th minute and got none of the ball and all of the man. It looked to be a second yellow card and yet the referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, chose to spare him. Which was a surprise to everyone, Arteta included, and certainly those who have followed Gil Manzano in La Liga this season, where he has averaged nearly seven cards a game – more than any other official.Kobbie Mainoo plans to reject Manchester United contract and move abroadRead moreLewis-Skelly had been sent off in his previous Arsenal appearance for alast-man foul on West Ham’s Mohammed Kudusand wasdismissed at Wolves on 25 January for a trip on Matt Dohertyto stop a counterattack, albeit ared card that would be rescinded. Doherty was not far outside his own box. If it was a dark arts move by Lewis-Skelly, it was not dark enough.The bottom line is that lessons have to be learned.Arsenalwere 2-0 up at the time of Lewis-Skelly’s tackle on Ledezma but, as Arteta said on Friday, it “would have been a different game if Myles had got sent off”. Arteta substituted him in the 35th minute for his own protection and that of the team, even if they were 3-0 up by then.“It was today that I did it, when the dust has settled,” Arteta said of his one-to-one with Lewis-Skelly. “It was to talk openly. What can we learn from that situation? How can we expose the team [with an error]? What are the things that we have to try to avoid without losing his essence as a player?“That’s what we have to do – understand where that line is. Because he is a superb player. He has attitude, he has courage … what he transmits. Certainly we have to maintain that. It’s just understanding the risk/rewards. What part of the pitch you are in and when you have to bet certain things that can give you big rewards. And, sometimes guys, stay away from that bet. Because it is not good for us.“It was quite clear that we had a liability there [with Lewis-Skelly against PSV] – with the yellow card and the next action. It wasn’t a moment to take any risk. So, a lesson to learn for him, for sure. The line is really thin in the sport and he needs to understand that.”View image in fullscreenMyles Lewis-Skelly was sent off in his last Arsenal Premier League game for hauling down West Ham’s Mohammed Kudus.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesLewis-Skelly’s essence is his physicality in the duels, whether riding challenges or making them, and there is no doubt that the balance can be delicate. “It’s just to dominate the situation, that’s it,” Arteta said. “Control the situation.“What space are you defending? What is the level of exposure that you have? Is the opponent facing you or not facing you? So, what is the probability to win the ball and when you have to commit to certain duels? Then you have to apply defensive principles that are very clear – to most of the time have the best possibility to win the ball and don’t get exposed. If you don’t do that at this level … big problem.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was, however, interesting to hear Arteta make the point that it was easier to talk about the issue after victory. “To learn when you’ve won … that is much better, believe me,” he said with a smile. “For your confidence and as well for how your team and your colleagues perceive you. So he was lucky on that.”It has not always been the case this season. Arsenal have had more red cards in the Premier League this season than anyone else – in addition to Lewis-Skelly’s there have been sendings-off for Declan Rice against Brighton, Leandro Trossard v Manchester City and William Saliba v Bournemouth. They have dropped points in all but the Wolves game.Lewis-Skelly’s fine performances have put him in the frame for a debut England callup whenThomas Tuchel names his first squad next Fridayfor the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia The same is true of Arsenal’s 17-year-old winger Ethan Nwaneri. “It will be an incredible experience for them if that’s the case … whenever that is,” Arteta said.

Thelwell has been director of football since 2022 and helped steer the club through a turbulent period under Farhad Moshiri, including two points deductions and serious financial constraints, but will leave at the end of the season.David Moyes believes Everton’s new owners ‘want to spend’ on rebuildRead more“I am extremely proud of what we have achieved in the most challenging of circumstances over the past three years and believe I’ll leave the club in a much stronger position than when I joined in 2022,” Thelwell said.Senior appointments to the new sporting leadership team will be announced in due course. Everton have been without a permanent chief executive since Denise Barrett-Baxendale departed amid fan protests in June 2023. Colin Chong has acted as interim CEO since then and is to remain with the club overseeing the new stadium at Bramley-Moore dock, the regeneration of its surrounding area and the future of Goodison Park.TFG’s search for a new CEO has ended with the appointment of Kinnear, who has been in the role at Leeds since 2017. The 47-year-old, who has also worked for Arsenal and West Ham, will start work with Everton on 1 June. A club statement said: “Planning for the summer transfer window is already under way, led by the sporting department and David Moyes.”Everton have also announced the departure of their long-serving chief commercial and communications officer, Richard Kenyon.Meanwhile, Moyes has confirmed he wants Séamus Coleman to stay at Everton next season in some capacity, and potentially lead the team out for its first game at the club’s new stadium.View image in fullscreenThe Everton captain, Séamus Coleman, has struggled with injuries this season.Photograph: Evan Logan/Inpho/ShutterstockColeman is out of contract at the end of the season and has been restricted to only four appearances this term by various injuries. But the 36-year-old remains a big influence behind the scenes, helping Leighton Baines take the team againstPeterboroughin the FA Cupfollowing the sacking of Sean Dyche, and Moyes believes he can still make a valuable contribution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Séamus might be a great person to have around as an extra who, if he wasn’t playing all the games, might be able to play in the under-21s.“There are a lot of teams who have gone with that sort of thing. He could also maybe be a coach with the younger boys if that is what he chooses to do. For me, Séamus picking up the injuries is the problem. We have had too many injuries and I don’t want us to have an emergency ward here. I think the clubs in bigger trouble tend to have too many injuries.”Moyes, however, agreed it would be fitting for Everton’s last captain at Goodison Park to be the club’s first at Bramley-Moore dock next season. “Absolutely, and sometimes you have to do the right thing,” he said. “Séamus might be required to do that job and he might still be one of the best at it.

Children were among those pepper sprayed unprovoked by police.In the wake of the incident,the French government, police and Uefa united to blame Liverpool supporters for the episode, claiming the chaos was caused by thousands seeking entry with fake tickets, reminiscent of the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster,when the deaths of 97 people were falsely blamed on fans of the club.The high court proceedings were brought in April 2023 by the law firm Leigh Day. Uefa then sought to block the cases being heard in Liverpool, using the common law Foreign Act of State doctrine, which is the principle that English courts will not inquire into the legality of acts by a foreign government.This application was heard in July 2024 and was rejected by the high court on Friday morning, which means personal injury claims will be able to be brought in the fans’ home city.One Hillsborough survivor said he feared for his life and was left with lasting flashbacks when held in a crowd by Paris police. Others suffered serious injury after being attacked and robbed by gangs of local men,which the victims alleged French police did little to stop.Many fans were so shaken by the experience they vowed not to return to France or to travel to a European away game in future.An independent review, commissioned by Uefa, found “the near miss experienced at the Champions League final was largely the result of poor planning, a lack of oversight of plans, poor interoperability between various stakeholders, and a lack of contingencies”.The report concluded that Uefa bore “primary responsibility”for the organisational and safety failures. Uefa disputes these conclusions.It says it hasalready settled some claimsby fans “without any admission of liability” and on confidential terms.In a statement after Friday’s hearing, Uefa said: “Today’s judgment says that it is too early in the proceedings to know whether Uefa’s position is correct or not. The judgment says that Uefa’s arguments will be revisited once more information is available.“This is the only remaining claim brought by Liverpool fans in relation to the 2022Champions Leaguefinal. The other two claims were resolved following discussions described by legal representatives of both sets of fans as ‘constructive’.”Clare Campbell, one of the personal injury solicitors representing some of the fans, said her clients were “delighted” the claims could proceed. “However, they have suffered significant delay due to the defendants’ attempt to prevent the claims being heard in the English courts – they now want their claims to be resolved as soon as possible in the hope that they can move on with their lives.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolUefaChampions LeagueHillsborough disasternewsShareReuse this content"

She was Britain’s banker. A cast-iron certainty. And then, with 100m to go, it all went horribly wobbly.At that point, theOlympic 1500m bronze medallistwas leading and looked to have everything under control. But just when everyone expected her to switch on the afterburners, her legs turned into spaghetti – the result, it later transpired, of an ear infection.First Agathe Guillemot of France muscled past her to win in 4min 07.23sec. Then the Portuguese athlete Salomé Afonso did the same. And then came a final indignity as her British teammate Revée Walcott-Nolan snatched bronze in a photo-finish after both athletes had run 4:08.45.‘I wish we’d taken the train’: athlete Innes FitzGerald welcomes Thunberg comparisonsRead more“In the last stage, my legs just completely locked,” said Hunter Bell. “I don’t know when that last happened.“I had an illness, I had an ear infection, I can’t really hear out my ear. Training has been a bit up and down. I thought I would still be fine for today. But I just didn’t have it. I’m obviously really gutted.”The result was particularly shocking given that when Hunter Bell had won bronze in Paris in 3:52, Guillemot had finished seven seconds back in ninth – while Afonso and Walcott-Nolan did not even make the final.However, the 31-year-old has promised to use her shock defeat as inspiration for the rest of 2025 – starting with the World Indoor Championships in China in two weeks – after the first major setback of her career since she returned to the sport after coming out of retirement three years ago. “I will have to go away and reset,” she said. “Last year when I came fourth at the world indoors that really fuelled me for the summer. So when I am done being sad about this, maybe I can take some positives out of it. But I am going to let myself be sad for tonight.”Walcott-Nolan was rightly delighted in her first major medal. “My legs were absolutely going away from me,” she said. “But in my head, I thought: ‘OK, Georgia is a lot stronger than I am, and is a lot quicker than I am. If I just hold it tight to her as I can, and do as good as I can, then I’ll be happy with that.’ And that kind of got me the medal.”There are more potential British medals over the weekend, with George Mills – the son of the former England footballer Danny – particularly bullish about his chances in the 3,000m.The 25-year-old has spent the winter pushing his body through 120-mile training weeks at his sparse altitude camp in Dullstroom, South Africa. Such is his devotion, he could probably teach Benedictine monks a thing or two about abstinence.Asked whether he had any guilty pleasures during the week, he shook his head. “I don’t know,” he said. “I’m a simple guy. I love to train, hang out with my friends and teammates if I’m able to. That’s a good life.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Mills: ‘I love to train.’Photograph: Alex Livesey/British Athletics/Getty ImagesNaturally, he is also in bed by 10pm. “Sleep is when you recover,” Mills said. “You need to try and optimise that. I try to nap most afternoons and obviously get a good night’s sleep. I have blue-light glasses, earplugs, eye masks – all those sorts of things.”The monastic regime does not end there. When he spoke to the British media he was eating boiled chicken and plain rice without any seasoning for lunch. “Flavour doesn’t make you fast,” he said.For Mills to win gold, he will have to beat the double Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who looked hugely impressive in winning 1500m gold in Apeldoorn on Friday. However, Mills is not completely ruling it out.“Obviously he’s a phenomenal athlete,” said Mills. “But everyone’s got a target on their backs and in this sport no one is invincible.”Mills was second to Ingebrigtsen at the European Championships last June. But that has only made him hungrier. “I got a taste of a medal in Rome last year,” he said. “Now I want to be competing for medals at every major championships.”Meanwhile, there was more disappointment for another fancied British athlete as Amber Anning, the favourite for the women’s 400m, was disqualified after winning her heat. The 24-year-old, who came fifth in the Olympics, looked to have progressed comfortably in 51.01. However she left in tears after TV footage showed she stepped on the line multiple times.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both their recent victories, against France and Scotland, were securedby a solitary point, however, with question marks raised over their clunky attack.Anger, spit and sawdust: Ireland says farewell to three gritty heroesRead moreShould Franceoverturn the defending champions Irelandin Dublin, an emphatic victory would improve England’s points difference and with it their chances of lifting the trophy on the final weekend of the championship. Itoje warned his side against chasing a big score from the word go but believes England can turn on the style, insisting that their attack has come in for undue criticism after scoring eight tries in their three matches to date.“We want to win, we want to win well,” he said. “But to do that, we have to do all the tough stuff that rugby requires. It’s not going to be an easy game. It’s not going to be a straightforward game. There’s expectation in games like this. In the last two games we didn’t come in as favourites but there was still a level of expectation from ourselves and even external voices as well that England should do well.“So the level of expectation is there, always there. But I would just say it’s about us, again, going for that performance, having the courage to play the way we want to play and having the bravery to see it through.“My main thing is, win the game. I have been in situations, I remember the [Saracens] game against Castres at the end of the block before we came here. We definitely should have beaten them, our team was stronger, but our mindset was a little bit off. We were probably trying to create a big scoreline before we actually deserved it.View image in fullscreenJamie George will lead out England against Italy this weekend.Photograph: Dan Mullan/The RFU Collection/Getty Images“So for me, first and foremost, get the boys right, myself right to win the game and win it well. Hopefully we get to that position, then maybe [points difference] will play a factor in my mind. But first and foremost, win the game.“[The attack] is an area that we want to improve in. But I would say I don’t think our attack is as bad as everyone is saying it is. Obviously we only scored one last week. But I don’t think that’s reflective of an attack that can’t even start the engine. Don’t get me wrong. We want to improve. But I don’t think we’re starting from a bad place.”Itoje captains England for the fourth time but it will be Jamie George leading the side out to mark his 100th cap on his first start since he wasreplaced in the roleby his Saracens teammate. Itoje was full of praise for the impact George has had on his career, revealing he is saved as “Jamie Under His Wing” in his contacts book – a nod to the mentoring role he provided in his early days at Saracens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have played with him for so long. I’ve definitely become a better player as a result of spending time and playing with Jamie. He’s a great rugby player, he has a great rugby mind, he’s also a great human being as well. He’s great to be around, he’s the man of the people.“I haven’t changed what he saved his number as. It’s ‘Jamie Under His Wing’. He put me under his wing, he helped me, gave me words of advice. He also set the standard. Despite his appearance he is an incredibly athletic player, fit, strong. He set a standard to live up to in many ways.“Him being a hooker, me starting as a second-row and then a lineout-calling second-row, that is a relationship that we have been building for a number of years now.

Tournament officials were comfortable Clark’s ball landed back in its own pitch mark, which allows a free drop. Had the ball instead rolled into another divot, Clark could only have taken a drop under penalty. The 31-year-old, who was leading the tournament at the time, went on to make a par.Keegan Bradley surprised ‘kick their ass’ comment was broadcast on NetflixRead moreIn a statement, the PGA Tour’s rules committee said: “After reviewing ShotLink video of Wyndham Clark’s tee shot on the 3rd hole during the second round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the PGA tour rules committee determined that the ball returned to its own pitch mark, which entitled Clark to free relief.”Clark himself shrugged off the incident. “I didn’t know there was any confusion, obviously when I’m playing,” he said. “We never saw it bounce. Then we get up there and it’s in a plugged lie. My ball was covered with mud. So we took relief and didn’t think anything of it.”By close of play, Clark sat two adrift of Shane Lowry’s 36-hole total. Clark double bogeyed the 15th and dropped another shot at the 17th while en route to a 71. Lowry’s 67 included an excellent birdie at the treacherous 18th. Lowry’s eight under par heads the pack.Given the attributes required to succeed at Bay Hill, Lowry’s prominence should come as no surprise. The2019 Open championadmitted he had extra motivation to secure a late tee time in round three. Lowry’s Saturday start means he will have scope to watchIreland take on Francein the Six Nations. “It was either a late tee time or no tee time,” Lowry said.“My iron play is good and conservative when it needs to be. I think you need that around places like this. I just like the grind of ‘pars are good’. There’s a lot of weeks out here where you get where you shoot level par for nine holes and you feel like you’re beating your head against the wall.“Whereas, weeks like this, level par after nine you’re actually doing OK, you’re a little run away from having a lovely day. I like the type of golf where any time you break 70 you feel like you’ve had a good day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By the 11.30am kickoff on matchday, the temperature reached 90F (32C) again. Worse still, the Silverdome was an NFL stadium designed for winter – to keep heat in, rather than out. The first World Cup match played indoors was conducted in a dome without air conditioning. On the field, the temperaturereached 106F(41C). The grass laid over the artificial turf had been watered so eagerly that, with the sun beating down on the stadium’s fabric roof, the air turned soupy with humidity.Fifa will consider expanding World Cup to 64 teams for 2030 tournamentRead more“We were boiling in there,” Ramos says. “They were carrying people out from the upper deck; fans were passing out.”The heat was one of the players’ biggest gripes all the way through to the final between Brazil and Italy in Pasadena, California, which kicked off in 100F (38C) temperatures. Fifa was unsympathetic. “Journalists predicted players would die [in Mexico],” a spokesman told theLA Times, pointing to the lack of casualties from the 1986 edition, where it was also hot and the air thin and smoggy, as some kind of perverse validation. “We encourage them to drink water.”More than three decades on, with the World Cup returning to the United States along with co-hosts Mexico and Canada, the story may be much the same.Fourteen of the 16 host cities for next summer’s biggest-ever, 48-team, 104-match World Cup are predicted to see afternoon temperatures high enough to endanger the players. So saysa studyof the 20-year meteorological record published in The International Journal of Biometeorology in January, which urges organizers to avoid afternoon kickoffs. Nine of the venues will probably experience a wet bulb globe temperature – a measure that combines the effects of the air temperature, humidity, solar radiation and wind speed – above the safety threshold of 82.4F (28C) on more than half the afternoons of hot summers. The risks will be highest in half a dozen cities with open-air stadiums: East Rutherford, Foxboro, Kansas City, Miami, Monterrey and Philadelphia. (An earlier study, published in October, made a similar prediction, forecasting “very high risk of experiencing severe heat stress conditions” in 10 of 16 venues.)“The threat of extreme heat will be bigger at this World Cup than it was [at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar],” says Dr Donal Mullan, a climate scientist at Queen’s University Belfast and the lead author of the most recent study. “Some of these venues are kind of a disaster waiting to happen.”The 2022 World Cup in Qatar was moved from the scorching summer months to November and December to protect the players. The highest wet bulb temperature – which is slightly different from wet bulb globe temperature – recorded during the World Cup in Qatarwas 73.4F (23C)– a little less than 10 degrees below predicted figures in the US.Fifa and US Soccer recommend that games implement cooling and hydration breaks when the WBGT exceeds 89.6F (32C). More cautious governing bodies, like the Australian federation, set a WBGT limit of 82.4F (28C) before matches can be delayed or even postponed. However, temperatures below those guidelines can still be dangerous. During the 2024 Copa América, held in the United States, an assistant referee collapsed from heat stress during a match in Kansas City when the WBGT was a mere 81.5F (27.5C). A few days earlier, defender Ronald Araujohad to be substitutedout of Uruguay’s opening game with Panama in Miami due to dehydration.View image in fullscreenAssistant referee Humberto Panjoj collapsed and required treatment due to heat exhaustion.Photograph: Bill Barrett/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesWhen WBGT reaches the mid-80s, the body’s physiological frailties are exposed. “The weakest link in the chain is going to break first and the heat will bring that about quickly,” says Dr Robert Huggins, a kinesiology professor at the University of Connecticut who worked with the US women’s national team and the Portuguese men’s team to prepare them to play in major tournaments in high heat. “From a thermoregulation perspective, the hotter the ambient temperature and the higher the humidity, the worse our body can dissipate the heat. If my sweat cannot evaporate off the surface of my skin and be accepted by the environment, I will not be able to physically cool my body.”Kickoff times have not been announced for the 2026 World Cup yet, and Fifa did not respond to an email asking whether it would consider player safety in scheduling games and avoid afternoon kickoffs at its hottest venues.“That’s the obvious answer, schedule it outside of these [afternoon] kickoff times,” says Mullan. “If you avoid those afternoon hours between 12 and 6pm, that would make an enormous difference.”The tournament’s expanded format will make that difficult. For most of the first two rounds of the group stage, there will be four matches a day. During the last round of group stage matches, there will be six games a day. The round of 32 has five days with three scheduled matches. To maximize TV viewership around the world, a good number of those matches will probably have to be played in the afternoon heat.The study Mullan authored was based on the summer temperatures from 2003 through 2022, which is to say, Mullan points out, that it represents a conservative estimate that did not incorporate the record heat in the summers of2023and2024. Nor, for that matter, does it account for the possibility of wildfire smoke.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet even those measures may not be enough in the eyes of some experts.A paper co-authoredby Fifpro’s chief medical officer, Vincent Gouttebarge, questions whether a single cooling break per half is sufficient.The 2026 Trade War World Cup encapsulates our new nativist world order | Aaron TimmsRead moreAnd lowering the threshold at which cooling breaks or delays and postponements kick in may not be enough to protect players and match officials. Dr Glen Kenny, a professor of human and environmental physiology at the University of Ottawa and a world-renowned expert on the links between exercise and heat strain, warns that WBGT limits may prove insufficient to protect players and officials. Because there are, he argues, still too many loose variables that portend risk – like the number of games and training sessions a player has completed in the previous days, and at what temperature.“I get the idea that we want to be protective,” says Kenny. “You’re trying to come up with a threshold that is all-encompassing, essentially protect everybody – one size fits all. But there will be other factors that may come into play here that are essentially going to limit that person’s ability to thermoregulate.”After studying the effects of heat strain for decades, Kenny says that it remains difficult to predict how individuals will cope working in dangerously hot conditions, especially if the exposure is sustained over a longer period. Someone playing or practicing in the heat for a 14th consecutive day, he argues, will respond differently than they did on the first day. “Even if they hydrate adequately, you will see that the next day the vast majority of them are going to be dehydrated,” Kenny says. “That in itself degrades their capacity to lose heat. So that same threshold may not be relevant on day 14.”If there was a silver lining to the chaos sowed by pushing the Qatar World Cup to the fall, in the middle of the European club season, it was that players were not yet exhausted by the cumulative strain of a season that runs 10 months or longer. That won’t be the case in 2026.“If you think of the timing of the World Cup, June and July, it comes at the end of a very challenging season for a lot of the players, playing 50, 55 domestic and continental games,” says Mullan. “A lot of these players are at massive risk as it is.”Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

During the round-table summit, which had more than a dozen attendees, the president thanked each of his guests.“High-IQ individuals around this table, high-IQ,” Trump said. “We feel like pioneers.”Trump hosted players including crypto entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; Michael Saylor, co-founder and the executive chair of MicroStrategy; and Zach Witkoff, one of the founders of the president’s own crypto business, World Liberty Financial.Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood Markets, also attended.Trumpsigned an executive orderon Thursday creating a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency for the United States. During the summit, he said this reserve will be like a “digital Fort Knox for digital gold to be stored”.David Sacks, a tech investor whom Trump has named his “crypto czar”, thanked the president for his leadership in the digital asset industry and remarked: “Your administration is moving at tech speed.“This was an industry that was subjected to persecution,” Sacks said. “And no one understands that better than you do.”After the initial introductions, the attenders began their off-camera summit. The event is expected to focus on Trump’s plans to build the strategic reserve, which the president said will containbitcoinand four other coins. Trump directed the secretaries of treasury and commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies” for acquiring additional bitcoin that have no “incremental costs” on taxpayers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, Sacks earlier said in a post on social media platform X.“This [strategic reserve] is going to be the biggest point of contention for many of us,” said JP Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Exodus, a bitcoin wallet developer. Although he owns the four other coins that Trump has suggested including in the reserve, he does not think they have a place in a strategic reserve.Crypto giant Tether CEO on cooperating with Trump administration: ‘We’ve never been shady’Read more“Crypto has made big strides, but it’s still a relatively nascent industry,” Richardson said. The other coins are smaller and function in a very different way, one he said may create more risk. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, posted on X on Sunday that a bitcoin-only reserve was “probably … the best option”. Both Richardson and Armstrong attended the summit.In a post on X, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, who also attended the summit, hailed Trump’s recognition that “we live in a multichain world” stretching beyond bitcoin. XRP, the coin tied to Ripple, is one of the four other cryptocurrencies Trump has suggested may be added to a crypto reserve.

That could speed up the process of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of a flurry of new listings of exchange-traded funds.Trump’s family has launched cryptocurrency meme coins and he also holds a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform, which has sparked someconflict-of-interest concerns. His aides have said Trump has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers.

Now it is the establishment.The crypto giant – tether is the most traded cryptocurrency in the world – has had a strange trip. Four years ago, banks were dropping Tether as a client, and regulators in New York had the company against the wall over questions about commingled client and corporate funds. Treasury officialswere complainingthat dollar-backed cryptocurrencies enjoyed the international privileges of the dollar without the responsibilities of preventing its misuse. Federal investigators werelooking into Tetherfor possible violations of anti-money-laundering and sanctions rules.The cryptocurrency industry anecdotally – and conspiratorially – describes theBiden administration’s posture toward crypto as a systematic effort to debank crypto in the form of tactics such as “Operation Choke Point2.0”. Ardoino says Tether’s leadership needed to become globetrotters in search of someone to take their business.When you’re trying to be a disruptor – in a good sense – you are going to always be attacked by the establishmentPaolo ArdoinoAnd it’s a lot of business. Tether currently is the 17th largest holder of US government debt, with nearly as much in treasury bonds in its digital vaults as Saudi Arabia. Tether’s value remains stable because it is pegged one-to-one to the dollar, meaning the value of each individual tether coin is $1. The company backs the total value of the cryptocurrency with dollar assets like treasury bonds in an American bank – in this case, $140bn deposited with Cantor Fitzgerald.Tether comes just behind bitcoin and ethereum as the most valuable cryptocurrency, and by most measures it is the most widely traded. Investors in countries with unstable currencies, like Turkey or Argentina with their 40%-plus inflation rates, use it to hold on to the value of their savings against the dollar. Crypto traders use tether to park their digital assets in a safe place.The degree of cooperation between Tether and law enforcement reflects an evolving shift in the government’s posture toward the company, even as federal agencies had been cracking down on cryptocurrency more broadly underJoe Biden.“We’ve never been shady,” Ardoino said. “The company has been great. It has been attacked. Debanked. You know, when you’re trying to be a disruptor – in a good sense – you are going to always be attacked by the establishment.”Previous administrations’ hostility to crypto – and perhaps to tether in particular – was the product of strategic mistakes the company had made, Ardoino said.“We were very naive. We thought: ‘Oh, we are going to keep our head down.’ We were not communicating. We were not telling what’s going on, and that was used against us,” he said. “And that’s fair, right? So, if someone is not communicating, or you feel is not transparent enough, then that is how people get to fear.”‘Trump’s grifting tendencies’: how the president’s crypto ties could spur corruptionRead moreAfter settling its case with New York regulators in 2021, Tether began to come out of its shell, publishing quarterly statements and expanding its cooperation with the government. Today, things are different for Tether. Its banker – the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick – has been confirmed as secretary of commerce in theTrump administration. The company says it is proud of its cooperation with US law enforcement. Though Tether’s holding company is headquartered in crypto-friendly El Salvador, the cryptocurrency is expanding in a way that Ardoino says will help the United States secure its position as the world’s reserve currency.“We have 400 million users in emerging markets,” Ardoino said. “We are basically selling the US debt outside the US … We are decentralizing the US debt as well, basically pushing for dollar hegemony. That’s how the US can maintain its dominance when it comes to its currency.”It’s a line Lutnick might have written into his confirmation hearing speech himself. The Senate confirmed Lutnick on a party-line vote 51-45 in February. Ardoino said their relationship is at arm’s-length now, though.“Cantor [Fitzgerald], they are our custodian. So, we will continue to have this relationship with Cantor,” he said. “They have been a great custodian for us. They are primary dealers, so we can have basically direct access to the Fed[eral Reserve] to purchase [government] debt. With Howard, when he goes into government, we cannot talk to him.”Lutnick has been a vocal backer of cryptocurrency and tether’s position in the industry in particular. Senators had some sharp questions for him about tether at his 29 January hearing, with Senator Maria Cantwell pressing him about audited holdings.“Do you think the market needs to comply with audits about whether one-to-one ratios really exist on stablecoins?” Cantwell asked Lutnick.“I believe stablecoins, US dollar stablecoins, should be audited, should be completely backed by US treasuries 100%,” Lutnick replied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“How do we prove that?” Cantwell then asked.“A US audit and one-to-one backed by US treasuries,” Lutnick continued. “And lastly, you can’t change the rules; meaning if someone has bought the stablecoin, you can’t change the price. If someone’s made a deposit with you, you can’t say: ‘I’m going to withdraw, you’re going to change the price.’”She also asked about reports that “as much as $19bn of Tether could be illicit activity by the North Koreans, the Russians, the Chinese. And so, what do we do about that? What is your solution?”“It’s like blaming Apple because criminals use Apple phones,” Lutnick replied. “It’s just a product. We don’t pick on the US treasury because criminals use dollars. So, I think it’s just a product … They are signed up with all US federal law enforcement. They follow all federal law enforcement instantly.”Ardoino rejects the suggestion of tether’s usefulness to criminals. “There is no financial institution – even the big banks, they don’t have this breadth of collaboration,” he said, citing more than 200 agencies in 50 countries that work with Tether.A Swiss bank might rebuff an American law enforcement agency coming for money in its accounts. Tether, however, touts its ability to return money stolen from others. For example, a notable “pig butchering” scam last year sent Shan Hanes, CEO of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, Kansas, to a 293-month federal prison term for embezzling $47.1m and sending it overseas as cryptocurrency. Tether was able to recover $8.3m for the victims.The traditional banking system is more porous than a cryptocurrency wallet right now, Ardoino argued.“When [criminals are] finally trying to use blockchain and move money on the blockchain in USDT [tether’s trading symbol], we see them and we freeze them,” he said. “And it takes 15 minutes to freeze an address from our stock. We are much more granular and faster than any bank or any other financial institution. So, I’ve been saying very loudly and publicly that any criminal using USDT is a very stupid criminal, because we can see everything and we can catch it.”Ardoino does see a threat in an adversarial regulatory relationship toward crypto, both in the United States and Europe. Both Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and EU-based exchanges removed USDT because it does not comply with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which went into effect at the end of 2024. Traders can hold Tether in non-custodial wallets but can’t trade it on an exchange that complies with European regulations.How do you solve a problem like DeepSeek?Read more“I think that the US understands very well that they should very, very much avoid a DeepSeek moment for finance and crypto,” Ardoino said, suggesting that it is possible that some invention in a stealth-mode lab somewhere beyond the industry’s attention could radically change the competitive environment. Ardoino was referring to the Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek, a large language model AI that emerged seemingly from nowhere in January that could compete with Meta and OpenAI’s offerings at a fraction of the cost. Its emergence is disrupting AI business plans by changing the competitive environment.Ardoino hopes the new administration will have settled on its approach to regulations – likely to be much friendlier than its predecessor’s – by September, he said. “I think that they want to get regulations done by June. June would be very aggressive as a timeline, but September is realistic.”Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now a row over a billionaire maverick has thrown the Royal Society into crisis, splintering the fellowship and raising existential questions about its role in society.A growing number of scientists have called for the academy to investigate the conduct of Elon Musk – who was elected a fellow in 2018 – resulting in apassionate debateat a meeting of the scientific body on Monday evening.Critics claim Musk’s behaviour has violated the Royal Society’s code, citing hisincendiary comments about British politicians, his calls for the American doctor and scientist Anthony Fauci to be prosecuted, and his role in slashing research funding through his work with the so-called US “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – among other acts.Royal Society urged to expel Elon Musk as fellows sign open letterRead moreSeveral fellows have even called openly for Musk to be ejected from the academy.“I thinkElon Muskshould be expelled from the British Royal Society,” the Nobel laureate and AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton wrote on X. “Not because he peddles conspiracy theories and makes Nazi salutes, but because of the huge damage he is doing to scientific institutions in the US. Now let’s see if he really believes in free speech.”Musk replied: “Only craven, insecure fools care about awards and memberships. History is the actual judge, always and forever. Your comments above are carelessly ignorant, cruel and false. That said, what specific actions require correction? I will make mistakes, but endeavor to fix them fast.”Perhaps it is just such a volte-face the Royal Society is banking on. Because despiteprivate communications, anopen letter signed by more than 3,500 membersof the scientific community,resignations by fellowsandjournal editorsandMonday’s meeting, the academy has yet to comment on the tech entrepreneur.While Musk’s behaviour is very public, the Royal Society insists its handling of concerns remains confidential. Fellows have been instructed not to talk to the press while the academy itself has released only abroad statement after Monday’s meetingoutlining fellows’ concerns about cuts to research funding in the US and the need for the society to step up its efforts to advocate for science and scientists.“The society agreed to look at potential further actions that might help make the case for science and scientific research and counter the misinformation and ideologically motivated attacks on both science and scientists,” the statement added.What form that might take is unclear. The Guardian understands a letter will be sent toMusk from the Royal Society(although its contents have yet to be decided) and – at present – no formal proceedings or investigations are under way.It is not the first time Musk has divided opinions among the fellowship. Not everyone was happy when he was proposed for election – an honour apparently bestowed for his work in fields including space travel and sustainable electric transportation.Becoming a fellow of theRoyal Societyis often seen as the pinnacle of a long research career. But Musk is a businessman, not an academic, and some argue that he is not himself an innovator.At the heart of the latest furore is whether Musk has violated theacademy’s code of conduct, which includes the stipulation that fellows shall “not act or fail to act in any way which would undermine the Society’s mission or bring the Society into disrepute”.“I haven’t yet come across anybody who has made a clear argument that actuallyElon Muskis not in contravention of the code of conduct,” said Stephen Curry, an emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, who – while not a fellow – wrote the open letter many fellows signed.Curry said rebuttals had focused on concerns about punishing people for their political views. “But I reject that completely,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe Royal Society is based in Carlton House Terrace in central London.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesProf Dorothy Bishop, a leading expert on children’s communication disorders, revealed that after she and other fellows initially raised concerns about Musk’s behaviour in the summer of 2024 and a lawyer for the academy determined Musk had not breached the code. The group subsequently set about gathering further evidence of breaches but for Bishop the situation became untenable. Sheresigned her fellowshipin November.In February, another fellow, ProfAndrew Millar, followed suit.The Royal Society’s documents set out that if an investigation into allegations of misconduct is upheld, the matter would pass to the conduct committee, a hearing would take place, and – if misconduct is deemed to have occurred – sanctions would be applied, with expulsion among the options.Yet Bishop said no fellow has been ejected from the academy in more than 150 years.“It does suggest that the statutes are worded so that it is virtually impossible to do anything about fellows who breach the code of conduct,” she wrote inher resignation statement.One of the few fellows to be ejected was Rudolf Erich Raspe, who was booted out in1775after being charged with “divers frauds and gross breaches of trust”.Expelling Musk might bring new headaches, not least as he isnot the only controversial fellow. In inviting fellows to Monday’s meeting, the academy’spresident, Sir Adrian Smith,said: “The business of the society is the advancement of the cause of science through rigorous rational scientific debate and council considers that we are on difficult ground if the society makes judgments as to the acceptability of the views or affiliations of our colleagues.”Expelling Musk could also be politically difficult at a time of heightened tensions between the UK and US. Some in the scientific community are adamantscience should not be politicised, and have arguedrevoking Musk’s fellowship could undermine trust in science.“In a nutshell, my argument is that the public trusts scientists more than politicians because it believes they are impartial and objective experts. Scientists who stray beyond the evidence and become campaigners or advocates for particular policies risk losing that trust,” Fiona Fox, a fellow of the Royal Society and chief executive of the Science Media Centre, wrote. “My worry is that ejecting Musk from the Royal Society would be seen as a political move.”Otherscientists who have voiced support for Muskhave argued that, despite his actions being reprehensible, Musk has made huge contributions to engineering.At present, the Royal Society insists “any issues raised in respect of individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence”. But some fellows back public action suggesting that, regardless of whether they launch an investigation – something that is required to be confidential under the organisation’s rules – the Royal Society should release an open letter or public statement condemning Musk’s attack on science.Fundamentally, it seems, the Royal Society must decide, and explain, where its red lines lie – not only in theory, but in practice.Explore more on these topicsRoyal SocietyIsaac NewtonElon MuskCharles DarwinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It could serve as a beachhead for his other business ambitions in IndiaHannah Ellis-Petersenin DelhiFri 7 Mar 2025 05.16 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 05.48 ESTShareIt is easy to believe that Elon Musk’s reach knows no limits. But while theworld’s richest manmay control a space satellite empire, own one of the largest social media platforms, produce the world’s bestselling electric car, and have been given carte blanche by Donald Trump to gut the US government, there is one market that Musk has yet to properly crack: India.Now, with his newfound influence over the Trump administration and global geopolitics, it appears likely that Musk’s entrance into the Indian market, both with hisTeslaelectric cars and his Starlink satellite internet, may come smoother and faster than expected.When the Indian prime minister,Narendra Modi, travelled to Washington to meet Trump earlier this month, he also sat down privately with Musk, where according to the Indian government, the pair “discussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and US entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development”.Trump put it more bluntly: “I assume he [Musk] wants to do business inIndia.”Up till now, India’s 110% tariffs on imported electric vehicles have prevented Tesla from entering the fast-growing Indian market. However, Musk vowed last year that Tesla would be in India “as soon as humanly possible” – and after his recent encounter with Modi, it seems he is keen to make that a reality.Tesla has already begun advertising for jobs in Mumbai and Delhi, and has signed a lease to open its first showroom in Mumbai. Tesla could also take advantage of a new Indian government scheme that lowers import tariffs on electric vehicles to just 15% if they commit to investing $500m within three years in a factory that will manufacture the cars. However, the tax break applies only to the first 8,000 vehicles, a limit Tesla is likely to push back on.A Tesla factory would be a boon for India, a country that is desperate for foreign investment and job creation, particularly in manufacturing. Nonetheless, Musk has a chequered record for his commitments to investing in India. Last year, he left the Modi government reeling after he made high-profile plans to travel to India, and had dangled the possibility of a $3bn investment to build a Tesla factory in the country, only to cancel the trip at the last minute. Instead, he travelled to rival China – another huge market that Musk has been equally keen to capitalise on – to cut a major deal.View image in fullscreenElon Musk at the opening of the Tesla factory in Berlin, Germany, in 2022.Photograph: Patrick Pleul/APTesla also faces stiff competition from Indian manufacturers, who are already making and selling popular electric SUVs for about a quarter of the £35,000 starting price that a Tesla costs, which would be far above the budget of most Indian families. (Sales of Tesla cars are also plummeting globally, with a45% decline in Europein January.)Trump, too, has appeared less enthusiastic about Musk’s ambitions to start making Teslas in India. “Now, if he built the factory in India, that’s OK, but that’s unfair to us. It’s very unfair,” Trump told Fox News.Another possibly more lucrative finger in India’s pie for Musk could be Starlink, the satellite internet technology operated by hisSpaceXcompany. Globally, Musk already has a dominant lead on satellite internet, with more than half of all satellites in the skies.Since 2021, he has been fixated on getting Starlink into India. While the current appetite for satellite internet in India is tiny, it is expected to grow to a $1.9bn (£1.5bn) market by 2030 according to Deloitte and is seen as a crucial entry point into India’s flourishing telecomms industry.Speaking to reporters earlier this year, after Trump’s inauguration, at which Musk was highly prominent, India’s communications minister confirmed that Starlink was in the process of seeking necessary security permissions to operate in India.Jyotiraditya Scindia said: “When you check all the boxes, you get the licence. If they [Starlink] do that, we will be very happy.”Yet in India, telecoms, including satellite internet, are among the most strictly regulated and controlled industries in India, placing vast obstacles in the way of foreign companies such as Musk’s being granted security permissions to operate.Smuggled Starlink devices allegedly used to defy India’s internet shutdownsRead moreIn particular, Musk’s close connections and business interests in China and the use of Starlink in the Ukraine war were seen as possibly insurmountable cybersecurity issues, as well as the ability of SpaceX to be able to control access to Starlink’s satellite internet from outside the country. The Indian governmentunder Modi has routinely ordered internet providers to block critical online content andused internet blackoutsas a means of information control.These fears could be heightened after sources in the Indian state of Manipur, which borders Myanmar,told the Guardian earlier this year that Starlink was already being usedby militant groups in the state to circumvent regular internet shutdowns being imposed after outbreaks of ethnic violence.A recent Indian thinktank report warned that Starlink was a “wolf in sheep’s clothing”, citing its use by US intelligence agencies and military, and warned of its potential to be used to undermine Indian security.Yet, after the election of Trump, some believe that the Indian government may be more willing to side-step those concerns. “I think before the US election results came through, India would have had their doubts about giving Musk’s Starlink security clearance,” said Nikhil Pahwa, the founder of MediaNama, an Indian tech news platform.“One of the things that India relies on is control over internet access and control over its operators. But now that Musk is a part of the US government, his leverage in India has certainly increased and his chances of Starlink clearing security approvals have probably improved dramatically – or at least will happen much faster.”View image in fullscreenStarlink could provide satellite internet to rural areas but some have raised fears it could be used to undermine Indian security.Photograph: Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto/ShutterstockPahwa said the decision on Starlink by the Indian government was now “as much of a political decision as a security decision”.What’s been called “Starlink diplomacy” – opening up the country to Musk’s satellites in an apparent attempt to gratify the Trump administration – has already been evident in neighbouring Bangladesh, where this week the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, suddenly extended an invitation for Musk to launch Starlink in the country within 90 days.Even prior to the re-election of Trump, the Indian government had already made manoeuvres favourable to Starlink’s ambitions. In October, the government announced that satellite spectrum for broadband would be allocated administratively rather than through auction, something that Musk had lobbied hard for. “We will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink,” said Musk on X in response.The decision means that Starlink has a far better opportunity to compete against Indian telecoms companies in the battle for control over the country’s satellite internet market. It was met with anger by some of the country’s biggest operators, such as Jio, who also have vast ambitions in the satellite internet space, and have since been lobbying the government to reverse its decision on the auction.One of the main benefits of satellite internet is that it can offer internet access even in the most remote areas. However, in India, most people living in rural areas are unlikely to be able to afford it, unless at heavily subsidised prices.Prasanto K Roy, a technology analyst, said it could set off a pricing war with India’s biggest telecom operators if Starlink repeated what it has done in Africa with heavily reduced pricing, where Starlink costs about $10 compared with $120 in the US. Jio, whose success in mobile internet came from undercutting every competitor, making India’s mobile internet some of the cheapest in the world, is likely to follow suit.“Starlink won’t find it as easy in India as it has in other markets, there is very strong competition here so it will be hard for it to gain a monopoly, even with low prices,” said Roy.He added: “Those using Starlink are obviously going to be a very tiny niche at the top of the socioeconomic pyramid. But once he’s got a hold, it is something Musk could really leverage in India.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaElon MuskNarendra ModiSpaceXTelecommunications industryTeslaTrade and developmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trapped in the sizeable quarantine zone surrounding the accident site, you must stay alive long enough to figure out how to escape – a task made rather more challenging by the presence of aggressive cultists, irradiated monsters and highly territorial terror bees. ImagineStalker, but set in northern England, and you’re edging towards what Oxford-based developer Rebellion has in store.Fallout may seem like another obvious inspiration for this irradiated game world, but after playing a two-hour demo, it’s clear the game draws more from classic British sci-fi. Here you are, stuck in the picturesque Lake District, with its lush woodlands, gurgling rivers and dry-stone walls. But all around you are the burned-out remains of 1960s cars and tanks, abandoned farm buildings and odd sounds and symbols that suggest something extremely sinister is happening. The development team have mentioned Dr Who, The Wicker Man the novels of John Wyndham as key inspirations, and you can see it in the grubby dislocated scene all around you. Approach a phone box and pick up the ringing handset, and you may hear a disembodied voice warning you about an apparently friendly character you met up the road. Stray into a cave and a ghost-like monster comes at you, infecting you with a paranoid mind virus. This is very much the stuff ofQuatermassand Jon Pertwee-era Who.View image in fullscreenSomething sinister is happening … Atomfall.Photograph: Rebellion DevelopmentsIt’s not long before I bump into a gang of druids stalking the undergrowth and I’m suddenly thrust into combat. But in the spirit of Stalker, and other survival games such as Escape From Tarkov, I have to rely on improvised melee weapons such as cricket bats and scythes, or on rusty guns that may or may not fire the meagre handfuls of ammo I’ve managed to accrue. The developers have said they want this game to be about grimly hanging on to life; you’re not a super-soldier. Everywhere there are little trinkets to scavenge, from apples to machine parts.When characters aren’t trying to clobber you with bats, they may offer you information or trading opportunities. It seems you’re free to wander through overgrown farms and ruined industrial buildings looking for clues about what the hell even happened here. Just watch out for the glowing greeny-blue bees nests hanging from trees – those guys arereallyterritorial. And poisonous.View image in fullscreenLooking for clues about what the hell even happened here … Atomfall.Photograph: Rebellion DevelopmentsEven in my short demo, there’s a nice sinister sense of tension in the air. Relying on faulty handguns and explosive devices that you’ve stuck together, Blue Peter-style, with double-sided sticky tape and things you’ve found in an abandoned military checkpoint adds a sense of desperation and disaster.I did find some of the menus and weapon selection tricky, and for a game that relies heavily on stealth, it’s very easy to accidentally mess up because you’ve not loaded your shotgun in advance. But then this is the stuff of the survival game: often it’s better to hang around in the long grass than engage with the enemy (although sometimes it’s not exactly clear where you’re in cover and where you’re not, so I was giving my location away alot).Atomfall looks like an interesting amalgam of Stalker, , Resistance: Fall of Man and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, with some role-playing elements lobbed in. Skill points improve your stealth, health and combat efficiency as you progress, and there are plenty of little notes and clues scattered about the wilderness to find. I think a lot is going to depend on just what the mystery at the heart of the game turns out be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a question that’s plagued our greatest minds for almost three decades. Yes, she appeared on the cover of the Face magazine next to the tagline “bigger than Pammy” in 1997, and yes, in 2006 lad mag FHM created a wholeTV specialdesigned to find the “real” tomb raider. But what does science say? In a world where American academicscan’t use the word “women”without jeopardising their scientific funding, it’s a relief that a gambling site called Casino Days is willing to do this important work, recently ranking “The Top 10 Most Attractive Video Game Characters According to Science”.Using the so-called “golden ratio” – which determines how beautiful someone is by measuring their facial features – the companyhas foundthat Lara Croft is the second most attractive video game character in the virtual world. In a move that will finally leave women with nothing to complain about, first place goes to The Witcher’s Geralt of Rivia.You can probably guess the rest – Red Dead Redemption’s gruff, stubbly Arthur Morgan in fifth place, Geralt’s situationship Yennefer of Vengerberg in eighth. What’s most offensive about these “findings” is not the fact that, for some reason, people are still bothered about the hotness of video game characters, but that familiar faces continue to get snubbed. When will Guybrush Threepwood get a look in? For how much longer must Mario ask, “Why is it never a-me?” Pointy pixelated chests are one thing, but matching your hat to the shirt under your dungarees before a hard day’s plumbing? That takes effort. Consistency. Grace.View image in fullscreenHello, is it me you’re looking for … the dashing protagonist of Luigi’s Mansion 3.Photograph: NintendoScientists (real ones, this time) have found that “good conduct” canmake your face seem more attractiveto others – honest people are considered hotter than dishonest ones, whereas men lose points for seeming aggressive. So isn’t it a little archaic to judge video game characters based on how perfectly symmetrical their faces are, when all this time, Luigi’s kind eyes have been blue enough to swim in?Here are the most attractive video game characters according to science, if “science” means me: Bella Goth from The Sims, Harvey and Haley from Stardew Valley, the King of Hyrule when he’s scowling at me, the red ghost from Pac-Man, Flo from Diner Dash.If we insist on ranking and rating each other – and after hundreds of years, I can’t see why we’d stop now – can’t we at least make our desires a little less base? Can’t we admit there’s something about that king that’s always on fire in those mobile game ads?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is it not enough that Ganondorf is way too into her, and like Princess Peach before her, she can’t seem to go a day without being kidnapped? The textitselfdemonstrates the dangers of being blond and cute in a world dominated by malevolent men, and yet we insist on reminding Zelda that actually, she’s not blond and cuteenough.

I don’t mean thatthe third world war is waving at us from the horizon; I mean thatthey put hair on women’s facesin games now and Ciri in The Witcher 4 is possiblynot going to be as hotas she was in teenagers’ minds. It’s a relief, then, that some things remain consistent in our wild and wicked world, and that’s that everyone – from left to right (to B, A, Start) – can agree that Lara Croft and Geralt of Rivia are hot.

The upside is they are doing something about itFri 7 Mar 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 10.45 ESTShareIt’s the love-hate relationship that defined a generation. We think we know all about teenagers and the phones to which they’re so umbilically tied: sleeping with them under the pillow, panicking at the prospect of ever being denied wifi, so glued to the screen that they’re oblivious to the world unfolding around them. Yet the first generation to have never really known a life without social media – the drug that primarily keeps them coming back to their phones for more – is now grown up enough to reflect on what it may have done to them, and the answers are almost enough to break your heart.Two-thirds of 16- to 24-year-olds think social media does more harm than good and three-quarters want tougher regulation to protect younger people from it, according to polling for theNew Britain Project, a thinktank founded by a former teacher, Anna McShane. Half think they spent too much time on it when they were younger, with regret highest among those who started using social media youngest. And most tellingly of all, four in five say they’d keep their own children away from it for as long as they could if they became parents. This isn’t how anyone talks about something they love, but how you look back on a relationship that was in retrospect making you miserable.Though the focus groups she conducted confirmed that parents were desperate for help weaning children off screens, what’s refreshing about McShane’s research is that it suggests the generations aren’t as locked in combat as they sometimes feel; that increasingly, we’re all on the same side. Gen Z, it turns out, don’t need more lectures from their (often equally addicted) elders about getting off that bloody phone. If anything, they may have something to teach us.This Friday, parliament will vote on the Labour MP (and former teacher) Josh MacAlister’s private member’s bill on safer phone use, expected to be backed by the government but only after beingnotably watered down. Though MacAlister originally favoured raising the legal limit for accessing social media from 13 to 16, the bill now only commits ministers to reporting back in a year’s time on the case for doing so, plus conducting further research and publishing fresh guidance on children’s screen time. With X’s CEO, Elon Musk, virtually embedded in the White House, some will suspect ministers of ducking a confrontation with American tech giants. But there are other reasons not to rush in, at least until the complex new Online Safety Act due to come into force this spring has settled down, and ministers have had a chance to learn from similar bans beingintroduced in AustraliaandNorway.Rather cheeringly, however, it seems in the meantime gen Z are taking things into their own hands. A generation of kids who grew up online, spent lockdown in their bedrooms, and all too often started their first jobs dialling remotely into Zoom meetings, now seems to be actively trying to teach itself to socialise the analogue way.Nightclubs and gig venuesfrom Manchester to Ibiza to Berlin have started asking punters to put stickers over their phone cameras, encouraging them not to film on the dancefloor but just tolose themselves in the momentlike their parents got to do. Meanwhile an explosion of gen Z running clubs, reading groups, in-person singles parties for people exhausted by dating apps, and “digital detox” events where phones are left outside the door, reflect a palpable and touching new hunger for old-fashioned face-to-face connection.The 25-year-old writer Adele Zeynep Walton foundedLogging Off Club, which organises real life social meet-ups for people trying to wean themselves off their phones, after a chance conversation during a 25th birthday weekend away with friends. All of them, it turned out, were worried about their screen time and were secretly trying to cut it down, but felt self-conscious talking about it. At Logging Off Club events, she says cheerfully, “we take people’s phones off them at the door and put them in a bucket”. It’s like ripping away a comfort blanket at first, but it makes people talk to each other rather than hiding behind a screen. At one event she organised jointly with City Daze, another social club that organises phone-free walks round London, attendees were even given cue cards to help them start conversations.What seems to be building up among younger women in particular isn’t just a backlash against the kind of toxic content, bullying or political disinformation rampant in their online lives, but a feeling that spending so much time on their phones has deprived them of something human and important. Walton is starting to think about where she might want to settle down in the next few years, only to realise that she feels curiously unrooted from any real-life community: though she’s been talking for years online to people she has never met, she doesn’t even know her physical neighbours’ names. Her generation has, she says, “been sold that lie of connection” by the big platforms but are finding the pseudo-communities offered there ultimately unsatisfying, leaving them wanting more. Her book about all of this,Logging Off, is published in June and though it’s hard to read as a parent without thinking guiltily that society has been asleep at the wheel here, there’s something oddly uplifting about watching gen Z start to try to rebuild the lives they clearly feel they’ve been missing.The US sociologist Robert D Putnam is best known for describing the downs in his classicBowling Alone, which argued that society became more fragmented, polarised and distrusting over the second half of the 20th century as Americans retreated from collective activities – from team sports to churchgoing – that once knitted them together. But in his more recent book,The Upswing, written with Shaylyn Romney Garrett, Putnam goes back another half a century to explore how that sociable state of bowling together originally came about. It was, he argues, also in part a reaction to a period of loneliness and isolation, but this time caused by people moving from close-knit rural and small town America to bigger towns and cities where there were jobs and opportunities, but where they had few ties. What followed was a mushrooming of social clubs, from rotary clubs and scout groups to unions, that brought them together; though they didn’t know it, in retrospect their members were building the beginning of an upswing. The moral of the story, for those daring to be hopeful? That once societies get far enough down the path of isolation, sometimes the only way left is up.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionYoung peopleChildrenSocial mediaMental healthOnline abuseHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

Can Democrats grab it?EditorialThe presidency is no longer just a ‘bully pulpit’. It’s become part of the disinformation machineFri 7 Mar 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 13.36 ESTShareDonald Trumpwon the White Housenot with money, though he spent plenty of it, but bydominating the conversation. He hasn’t stopped campaigning. He uses attention to bolster his political power, and uses his office to make sure that everyone keeps watching.He wasbarred from leading social media platformsafter the January 6 attack on the Capitol, but four years later, their owners attended his inauguration. Many of his key hires appear picked for their media presence as well as their ideological bent and sycophancy. Tuesday’s interminableaddress to Congresswas garnished with the kind ofwild claimsor outright lies that he knows take off on social media. For him, posting onlineultimatums to Hamasand a disturbingAI-generated “Trump Gaza” videois all part of foreign policy. One of the most chilling, and telling, moments of last week’s attack on Volodymyr Zelenskyy was Mr Trump’s remark: “This is going to be great television.”Strikingly, key membersof the Trump circle have consistently championed the self-styled misogynist Andrew Tate, one of the rightwing influencers who drove young men towards Mr Trump. Romanian authorities allowed Mr Tate and his brotherto fly to the USlast week, despite outstanding charges including rape, human trafficking and money laundering, all of which they deny. (The brothers are also wanted by UK authorities over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to 2012, and four British women are pursuing a civil case against them.) Though Romania denies any US pressure, and the president claimed to know nothing, the travel ban was lifted days after Mr Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell,raised the casewith Romania’s foreign minister.The Tate brothers are part of the far-right disinformation networks that not only promote vile and extreme views but also undermine reputable sources of information. Mr Trump embraces this, and far-right media activists are invited to “report” from the Oval Office while the Associated Press isshut outfor referring to the Gulf of Mexico. The White House press operation hasreinvented itselfas a social media machine, spewing out endless memes, attack lines and deliberate provocation to drown out rival voices. “They’re all offence, all the time,” said Steve Bannon approvingly.Like a social media algorithm made flesh, the president himself serves up anendless but unpredictable(and increasingly extreme) stream of material. It keeps admirers coming back for more and overwhelms critics, who don’t know where to focus. This strategy may offer diminishing returns, not least because it requires a constant ratcheting-up of content. Mr Trump can only do so much to bend reality: administration failures, U-turns and the costs ofpolicies such as tariffswill probably temper voters’ enthusiasm.But even without commanding political leadership or control of any branch of government, Democrats can’t justsit backand wait to find out. The political commentator and author Chris Hayesnotesthat they have been defined by risk aversion, preferring no attention to critical coverage. Finding ways to seize the initiative is essential. Mr Trump’s lies must be challenged. But fact‑checking his provocations, without compellingly promoting political alternatives, will not be enough. Procedural and legal responses are essential, but so is the ability to grab back the megaphone – or find another one.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They’re part of a strategy to condemn and isolate the countryFri 7 Mar 2025 11.47 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 14.42 ESTShareOn 7 February, less than three weeks after taking office,Donald Trumpissued anexecutive order: “Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa.” The order directed US agencies to halt aid toSouth Africa, condemned South Africa’s case against Israel at the international court of justice (ICJ) as an “aggressive position”, and declared that white Afrikaners be prioritized for resettlement in the US based on the duplicitous claim that they are “victims of unjust racial discrimination”.The humanitarian consequences of this executive order are devastatingly clear. On 26 February, notices were sent out terminating support for HIV organizations funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), initiated in 2003 by then president George W Bush. The termination of funding to Pepfar is catastrophic for South Africa. Studies predict this could result in more thanhalf a million unnecessary deathsand up to half a million new infections.US suspends aid to South Africa after Trump orderRead moreBut Trump’s order is an escalation of an existing strategy to condemn, isolate and punishSouth Africafor charting an independent course for its people and their relationship to the international community at large.On 11 January 2024, the South African government presented its case at the ICJ, arguing that Israel’s military actions in Gaza – endorsed, funded and armed by the United States – constituted genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The ICJ case was not the first time that SouthAfricahad broken with Washington on the global stage; in 2003, South Africa strongly opposed the invasion of Iraq, warning that the war amounted to “a blow to multilateralism”, in the words of its then president Thabo Mbeki.South Africa’s renewed appeal to multilateralism did not keep the Biden administration from responding to the ICJ case against Israel with immediate hostility. On 3 January, before arguments were even made, the state department spokesperson Matthew Miller declared: “We find this submission to be meritless, counterproductive, and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever.”The Trump administration makes an intentional target of South Africa’s health policy. The deadly cruelty is the pointWhile South Africa’s ICJ case was widely welcomed at home, some white actors with significant power in the country’s public sphere were hostile. Strident demands for South Africa to align with the west were issued by organisations such as the Johannesburg-based Brenthurst Foundation, among others. They found easy allies in Washington. In early 2024, several members of Congress argued that South Africa’s stance on Israel should disqualify it from receiving preferential trade benefits, including removal from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which aims to improve economic ties between the US and sub-Saharan Africa.Last month’s executive order marks a dangerous new phase in the efforts to strangle South Africa’s international solidarities – but this time with an explicitly white supremacist twist, focused on the country’s efforts to redress the compounded, multi-generational inequalities of apartheid. Trump has long supported the far-right conspiracy theory that falsely claims white farmers in South Africa are subject to a government-backed campaign of violence. In August 2018, he tweeted that he had asked then secretary of state Mike Pompeo “to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large-scale killing of farmers”.These views have been nurtured by organisations such as AfriForum, a rightwing Afrikaner group that has actively cultivated relationships with American conservative institutions since around 2017. In 2018, AfriForum representatives met with then National Security adviser John Bolton and conducted interviews on Fox News, promoting conspiracy theories about a non-existent “white genocide” in South Africa. A network of far-right white South Africans in the US, including Elon Musk, has similarly gained access and influence. Joel Pollak, an editor at Breitbart, is widely tipped to be Trump’s new ambassador to South Africa.‘White supremacists in suits and ties’: the rightwing Afrikaner group in Trump’s earRead moreThese conspiracy theories aim to present white farmers as victims as South Africa moves toward remedy for dispossession. A 2017 government land audit found that white people, 9% of the population, owned approximately 72% of all privately owned farmland – a direct result of colonial dispossession that must be addressed as an urgent moral priority, as indicated in South Africa’s 1996 constitution.But if the target of Trump’s executive order is South African land reform, its principal casualty will be the beneficiaries of Aids treatment. One of the great successes of South Africa’s democracy has been its HIV treatment program. With approximately 5.9 million people receiving antiretroviral therapy through the public healthcare system, it is the largest HIV public health program on the planet. Pepfar has been funding a fifth of these costs, part of a program estimated to have saved 25 million lives worldwide.TheTrump administrationmakes an intentional target of South Africa’s health policy. The deadly cruelty is the point.From Mexico to Greenland, Panama to Ukraine, theTrump administrationis bullying allies to align with its vision of national primacy and ethnic supremacy. The rapid implementation of this new Trump doctrine requires Americans to join together with people across the world not only to oppose reactionary measures – but also to remain steadfast in their joint commitment to internationalism that enhances wellbeing. That commitment will require richer countries to spend in solidarity, not charity.The immediate task is of course the most urgent: rapid multilateral action is needed to secure the safety of the huge numbers of HIV patients whose lives are now in danger. The many pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities dotted through the global south should be turned to producing what people need, even as land and housing reform also necessarily shape regional agendas.But the risks posed by this executive order transcend its particular measures. There is enough; the problem is allocation, and the symbolic and conceptual as well as material means to realize human well-being.Achille Mbembe is a research professor in history and politics at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research in Johannesburg, South Africa.Ruth Wilson Gilmore is a professor of earth and environmental Sciences, and American studies, at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaOpinionDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAfricaUS politicsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Of course, one hesitates to make the comparison, not least because Donald Trump would like it. And because the Godfather is an archetype of strength and macho glamour whileTrump is weak, constantly handing gifts to America’s enemies and getting nothing in return. But when the world is changing so fast – when a nation that has been a friend for more than a century turns into a foe in a matter of weeks – it helps to have a guide. My colleague Luke Harding clarified the nature of Vladimir Putin’s Russia when he branded it theMafia State. Now we need to attach the same label to the US under Putin’s most devoted admirer.Consider the way Trump’s White House conducts itself, issuing threats and menaces that sound better in the original Sicilian. This weekthe president saidthat a deal ending Russia’s war on Ukraine “could be made very fast” but “if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long”. You didn’t need a translator to know that the somebody he had in mind was Volodymyr Zelenskyy.On Thursday,Trump was confidentthat the Ukrainians would soon do his bidding “because I don’t think they have a choice”. Almost as if he had made them an offer they couldn’t refuse. Which of course he had. Byending the supply of military aidand the sharing of US intelligence, as he did this week, he had effectively put a Russian revolver to Ukraine’s temple,its imprint scarcely reduced by Trump’s declaration today that he is “strongly considering” banking sanctions and tariffs against Moscow, a move that looked a lot like a man pretending to be equally tough on the two sides, but which should fool nobody.He expects Zelenskyy to sign away a huge chunk of Ukraine’s minerals, the way Corleone’s rivals surrendered their livelihoods to save their lives.This is how the US now operates in the world. Dispensing with the formalities during his annual address to Congress on Tuesday, Trumprepeated his threat to grab Greenland: “One way or the other, we’re going to get it.” That recalled his earlier warning to Copenhagen to give him what he wantsor face the consequences: “maybe things have to happen with respect to Denmark having to do with tariffs”. Nice place you got there; would be a shame if something happened to it.It’s the same shakedown he’s performing on the US’s northern neighbour. Canada’s outgoing prime minister Justin Trudeauspelled it out this week, accusing Trump of trying to engineer “a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us”, adding that: “We will never be the 51st state.” It’s a technique familiar in the darker corners of the New Jersey construction industry: a series of unfortunate fires that only stops when a recalcitrant competitor submits.Both the substance and the style are pure mafia. Note the obsession with respect, demonstrated in last week’s Oval Office confrontation with Zelenskyy. Between them, JD Vance and Trumpaccused the Ukrainian leader three timesof showing disrespect,sounding less like world leaders thantouchy Tommy DeVito, the Joe Pesci character in Goodfellas.Note too the humiliation of subordinates. In his address to Congress, the president introduced secretary of state Marco Rubio as the man charged with taking back the Panama canal. “Good luck, Marco,”said Trump, with a chuckle. “Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong.” Cue anxious laughter from the rest of the underlings, briefly relieved that it wasn’t them.It’s hard for aides and opponents alike to keep up because power is exercised arbitrarily and inconsistently. Tariffs are imposed, then suspended. Indeed, one reason why import taxes so appeal to Trump is that they can be enforced instantly and by presidential edict. That extends to the exemptions Trump can offer to favoured US industries. As MSNBC’sChris Hayes observed: “This is very obviously going to be a protection racket, where Trump can at the stroke of a pen destroy or save your business depending on how compliant you are.”Because, naturally, Trumpism does not confine the Cosa Nostra tactics to foreign affairs. This weekReuters reportedthat several federal judges in the Washington DC area had received pizzas sent anonymously to their homes, a gesture that police interpreted as “a form of intimidation meant to convey that a target’s address is known”. Already rattled by a fusillade of posts from Elon Musk denouncing as “corrupt” and “evil” those judges who have stood in the way of his ongoing demolition of large swathes of the federal government, the judiciary is now fearful for its safety. “I’ve never seen judges as uneasy as they are now,” said John Jones, who retired from the bench in 2021.Whether neutering the judges – “Thank you again, I won’t forget,”Trump told John Roberts, chief justice of the supreme court, as he slapped him on the back this week – or movingto control the press, it’s all straight out of the Corleone playbook. The effect has been remarkably swift, with a strange silence falling on America’s public square.One Democratic congressman saysRepublican colleagues have told him they won’t criticise Trump because they worry for their physical safety and that of their families.But it’s not just politicians. “University presidents fearing that millions of dollars in federal funding could disappear are holding their fire. Chief executives alarmed by tariffs that could hurt their businesses are on mute,”according to the New York Times, which again cited the growing anxiety among would-be critics that online attacks from Musk and Trump could lead to violent assaults on themselves or their loved ones.All this protects Trump, encouraging him to ape the corruption and callousness of a mafia don. See how blatantly he now charges individuals to dine with him at Mar-a-Lago:$5m for a one-on-one, $1m to be part of a group. In case you didn’t get the message, Trump has announced that the US willno longer enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibited Americans from bribing foreign officials, while his attorney general has dissolved all of the kleptocracy-related task forces at the Department of Justice. As for callousness, note Musk’s glee at feeding the US agency for international development“into the wood chipper”,therebyensuring death comesto the sick and the starving who relied on US medicine and food.At least the Corleones were guided by their own supposed code of honour. They believed an act of service had to be remembered and, in time, reciprocated. But Trump has gone to court rather than pay suppliersfor work already donefor the US government and has no memory of those to whomthe US owes a much greater debt. How else could his vice-president so glibly forget the blood spilled by America’s allies, including the UK, when hedismissed the offerof “20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years”?These are despicable people, lacking even the morality of the hoodlum – and now they run the country we have regarded as our closest friend since the Edwardian age. Given all that, of course British politics should be contemplating a radical new direction, whether that means an economy rewired for rearmament or a rapprochement with the European Union, given that the world of the Brexit vote of 2016 has vanished and to stand apart from our nearest neighbours is now not only stupid but dangerous. When the planet’s most powerful country has become a mafia state, you do whatever it takes.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistOn 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as theydiscuss Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall London, and live streamed globally.

The changes hit me close to homeFri 7 Mar 2025 07.53 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 11.34 ESTShareWhen we rang in the New Year, I wasn’t remotely expecting politics to collide with my career, my family and me. In a matter of weeks, I had lost my job, my father and, I felt, my country.I spent a dozen years as a program officer forUSAid, serving in countries in South America, Africa and Asia with my family. I loved my job working with governments and NGOs to improve the lives of those in need. Doing good and doing well, we said. I was helping to build an information system to improve aid transparency and efficiency when sudden news arrived.At 5pm on a Friday, we received an email saying our particular contract had been shut down. In all, 10,000 professionals were dismissed from their jobs, whileElon Muskcalled us a criminal organization and its staff – me included – a “ball of worms”. The wrecking had begun.Be clear about what Trump and Musk’s aid axe will do: people will face terror and starve, many will die | Gordon BrownRead moreAt USAid headquarters, administrative assistants were ordered to take down all the pictures of the many people the agency helps around the world, as if it had been something shameful. Only clocks were left on the walls. More cravenly, the administration blocked access to the wall of names honoring those who had given their lives to the cause.Trump officialscanceled USAid’s building contract andhanded it overto US Customs and Border Protection.The same clocks on the walls that had once marked time over Americans helping people in need overseas may now mark time over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents deporting people to those countries and others.TheTrump administrationis abandoning millions of people around the world and cutting off life-saving services. We are losing goodwill and influence – diplomatic, economic and moral. A good sign that closing USAid was a mistake: China is already moving in to fill the void, and strongly rightwing leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán are applauding.The destruction is also almost certainly unconstitutional in a number of ways, and aspects continue to be reviewed, blocked or upheld by courts lagging behind the speed at which laws are being broken. A showdown on the reach of executive power has begun.These changes hit me very close to home. A significant number of my family are conservatives who voted for Trump, fueled by two decades of misinformation promoting hate and anger. Despite this, in the interests of our family integrity, we have learned to talk to one another respectfully. We avoid topics related to politics and focus on our love for each other, jigsaw puzzles and American football (until even that became “woke”).Despite some people’s attempts to reshape the US and its place in the world, we have not seen the end of American generosityBlindsided at work, I was next blindsided at home. Two days afterUSAidwas lost, my father died unexpectedly. Thankfully, my dad and I had been able to say we loved each other before he died. The kids and I flew out and we spent a beautiful week together with the family grieving his loss.However, in a strange moment at the end of the week, my mother told me that I shouldn’t talk about USAid because I didn’t know what I was talking about (as if I had no idea about the organization where I had spent my career). Armed with details from her trusted websites, she informed me that USAid was performing sex changes on children and funding terrorist groups. We defused the moment, but it demonstrated how unchecked deception fomented by wealthy interests so gravely distorts people’s views.Obviously, all of these sudden losses have given me pause to reflect.Despite some people’s attempts to reshape the US and its place in the world, we have not seen the end of American generosity. Humans are successful because we cooperate. We have obligations to each other as living beings. We also know that we can’t make ideas go away, and the best ones – like kindness and caring for others – are actually what bind us.The dismantling of USAid as an institution does not mean that the US’s generosity of spirit has also been eradicated. USAid was a longstanding independent agency established by John F Kennedy, receiving consistent bipartisan support because it advanced America’s foreign policy objectives by helping others.Such values have not disappeared. We can be certain that, in one form or another, US aid will return.Christian Smith is an American citizen and former USAid officer who lives between Dublin and SpainExplore more on these topicsUSAidOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskTrump administrationUS foreign policyFamilyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Even so, how has this not been internationalised? Or at the very least Americanised, where its dictionary definition would presumably be adorned by a picture of the face of US vice-president JD Vance – already faultlessly playing the role of worst American at your hotel. You can immediately picture him at breakfast, can’t you? Every single other guest on the terrace with their shoulders up round their ears, just thinking: “Where is he now? How unbearable is he being NOW?” Next, imagine breakfast lasting four years.I say theBackpfeifengesichtdefinition would be accompanied by JD Vance’s face … but then again, what is the face of JD Vance? The internetis awashwith people suffering an acute case of not being able to remember it any more, having seen so many hideous comic distortions of Vance that those meme versions are not simply the only results on the first page of your own mental Google search, but stretch deep beyond the second and into the third. Somewhere on page four, where you might as well publish the nuclear codes or pictures of Taylor Swift giving cocaine to babies, is an unmodified snap of what JD Vance actually looks like. Or at leastwhat he looks like with eyeliner.Before you get there – and you don’t, really – your synaptic filing systems throw up every variety of Photoshopped Vancefake: swollen manboy, face wearing a Minion suit, a bearded egg … I’m hoping that sooner or later, an American news outlet will accidentally use a modified photo, because even the picture editor has forgotten what the vice-president looks like, and then we can have one of those massively self-regarding legacy media-blow-ups, where the entire staff has to resign after a remorseless investigation by the executive editor reveals Vance isn’t actually a big purple grape. “This is a stain on our newspaper’s history. A big purple stain.”Vance is more meme than man, now, and it is, of course, something of a consolation that he is so extremely online that he can’t help but have noticed this. The VP is like a one-man government troll-feeding programme – please don’t cut him, Elon! – which is probably why people have become so heroically committed to taking the piss. The probability of the vice-president seeing you insulting him is basically one.Just as previous holders of his office like Teddy Roosevelt and Richard Nixon once did, Vance spent a notable amount of this week both denying he suggested Britain and France were random countries that hadn’t fought a war in 40 years, and replying to random X posters called things like “Jeff Computers” to counter the suggestion that he wasn’t loved and feted onhis recent skiing holiday.View image in fullscreenProtest in Waitsfield, Vermont, during JD Vance’s skiing holiday, 1 March 2025.Photograph: Jeff Knight/APOver on this side of the Atlantic, it must be said that the latter vignette in particular serves as a helpful reminder of the cultural differences between our great nations – and indeed between our great anti-elitists. British politicians would rather admit they’d sexually harassed an intern than gone skiing. (You can, of course, do both – and many do.) If a British cabinet minister were to sally forth on to social media like Vance did, and honk that actually, he had agreattime on the ski slopes, it would probably be the end of him. Let’s face it, our rightwing politicians still make time twice a week to do a drive-by on “latte drinkers”, seemingly unaware that the only thing left in most high streets, and quite a lot of people’s lives, is a hot milky drink at a Costa. Yet in our country, would-be populists treat having the temerity to order a coffee like it’s Marie Antoinette skiing past a workhouse – which is a useful illustration of why we don’t have growth, and why our many political failures speak to near-empty rooms at conservative conferences in the US.Trump dreams of a Maga empire – but he’s more likely to leave us a nuclear hellscape | Alexander HurstRead moreAnyway: Vance. On or off skis – and I would prefer him to sod offski – the vice-president can be judged successful in his deliberately adopted mission to become mesmerisingly awful. On British army talkboards this week, I spent some very enjoyable time watching veterans of the US’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan offer their thoughts on JD, who I believe was some kind of military journalist for about 15 minutes. Though that wasn’t quite how they put it, naturally. Real soldiers can be hilariously creative with their insults, while Vance is drawn towards the artless, perhaps most neatly embodied in his decision to whine at Volodymyr Zelenskyy: “Did you even say thank you?”Then again, while I’m sure that the memes will keep us warm in the event of an unscheduled nuclear winter, it must be said that other forms of digital manipulation are passing notably without the comment they used to, even until very recently. So perhaps the moral slippage has not been entirely one-sided.I noticed this week that people who only a couple of years ago were hand-wringing about the horror AI deepfakes could wreak upon democracy were now cheerfully sharing synthetic scenes of Zelenskyy slapping Donald Trump in the Oval Office, or Trump crying like a baby, or some other eerie piece of fakery that felt qualitatively different from a still of a lollipop-wielding kiddie Vance. I think people used to think this stuff was bad and corrosive and potentially politically dangerous? Maybe they still do – or maybe only when the other side do it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s a colossal mistakeFri 7 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 08.24 ESTShareIn a recent New York Times Op-Ed, Democratic super-consultant James Carville boldly called for “the most radical thing [Democrats] can do” – nothing at all. Standing over the putrefying carcass of three-day-old road kill, thinking we don’t notice the fur sticking to the bumper of his F-150, this man is pointing at the rotting heap and screaming “Don’t move!”His argument is simple and incredibly dangerous: give the Republicans enough rope to hang themselves and they will do it. Their inability to govern, he argues, is self-evident and when they shut down enough social programs, people will notice and Democrats can swoop in and save the day.Here’s the thing: it is not true, and it is a massive, world-historic error to think that it is. (Ask the post-first world war German Social Democrats – they also believed that the Nazis would disgrace themselves and be rejected by the public once their true colors were shown. It didn’t end like that.)The rapid-fire destruction of institutions that we’ve seen from the Republicans since Trump’s second inauguration should tell any thinking person that these are not the bumbling incompetents that the pundit class claims. Republicans and the billionaires who fund them are consolidating power right in front of our eyes. This isn’t simple looting; it’s state violence against the most vulnerable sectors of our society and a final, the decisive evisceration of every gain made during the civil rights movement and every social welfare program that somehow survived the Reagan era.There is no guaranteed Republican self-destruction coming down the pike; we cannot simply wait this outBut here’s the other thing: James Carville knows this. He knows that no competent army would take a “tactical pause” when they’re about to lose an entire war, and he knows that rope-a-dope requires you to be willing and able to throw the right cross in the eighth round.There is no guaranteed Republican self-destruction coming down the pike; we cannot simply wait this out. By abdicating their responsibility to the working class, the Democrats (and their mega-donors, so often shared across the aisle) are telling on themselves. Their commitment to privatization, neoliberal imperialism and their corporate donors – to capitalism – means they cannot be credible opposition to a political movement that stands for all of these things (but without the paint job).So what does this mean for the working class? We have to build that credible opposition ourselves. There is no one coming to save us – we are the cavalry. We are already seeing examples of this – from therapid and effective response of the Federal Unionist Networkagainst Elon Musk’s Doge’s layoffs to themassive and effective community rallies at hospitals and universitieswhich had absurdly decided to comply in advance with anticipated anti-trans orders.We see it in the growing number of municipalities following the lead of local organizers todivest from companies profiting from Israeli war crimes,declare sanctuary status for undocumented people, protect local tenants withgood cause eviction laws,raise minimum wagesand enshrine reproductive rights locally and statewide across the country. We see it in mutual aid programs that seeneighbors buying and forgiving medical debt, offering food and supplies to unhoused people after tent city raids and providing on-the-ground help after natural disasters when the federal funds run out.When we organize, we keep ourselves, our neighbors and people we don’t know safe, housed, cared for. We, the working class – nurses and teachers and farmworkers and letter-carriers and parents that make the world turn – have the power to be agents of change and the protagonists of our own story, and now is the time to exercise that power. We fight not just to end the tyranny of one billionaire overlord over the headlines, but also for the ability to control our own destiny as a class and do with our time, energy and resources what we will. That power is socialism – and we will only achieve socialism by taking the class struggle on directly.What does that mean for you? It’s time for you to get organized. If you’re a labor union member, get involved andlearn how socialists are strengthening the labor movement. If you’re not,form a union. If you’re a renter or otherwise do not control your own housing,learn how tenant unions are taking power back from the landlord classand learn how to form one.Join a democratic member-led organization like mine (the Democratic Socialists of America) and help build the grassroots movement that can and will build ourprotagonism. Joining and forming member-led and member-driven organizations is how the working class can fight back against the Trump agenda. Rolling over and playing dead is not an option for anyone whose class interests don’t revolve around million-dollar consulting contracts. The Democrats may not do anything, but we can.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A key faction of judges supports the ideaJan-Werner MüllerThe ‘unitary executive’ theory – backed by some conservative lawyers – is largely bogus. But it could wreak havoc on democracyFri 7 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 05.03 ESTShareWhile Democrats are dithering and debating with consultants about which anti-Trumpian strategy to adopt, courts are confronted with an unprecedented power grab by the president.Donald Trumpand Elon Musk are simply not spending money appropriated by Congress, which in turn is unwilling to play its constitutional role and assert the power of the purse. Entire agencies are de facto dismantled – which is also unconstitutional – and civil servants protected from removal by a president keep getting pink slips.The illegality of it all seems so obvious that one would think defenders of democracy could relax and trust judges to do the right thing. But it’s not just that some judges seem to be in the president’s pocket – as evidenced by Trump, after his address to Congress, patting the supreme court’s chief justice on the back andthanking himfor a favor he won’t forget, mafia-style. It is also that some jurists have been itching to defend a further concentration of presidential power – John Roberts likely among them.Conservative lawyers trace what is known as the “theory of the unitary executive” – which is also reflected inProject 2025– back to the founding; according to this theory, the president should always be able to remove officers at will. There are also not supposed to be independent agencies (though even diehard defenders of the unitary executive theory exempt the Federal Reserve: markets wouldn’t like the idea of politicians fiddling with interest rates before an election).Republicans want corporate oligarchy. We need economic democracy | Rashida Tlaib and Michael A McCarthyRead moreAs with so much history told by conservative lawyers, this account islargely bogus. But the call for a strong executive is not necessarily a rightwing agenda: it was also issued by progressives early in the 20th century and shared by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whom wanted to fire civil servants who he thought were sabotaging his New Deal. But, as the legal scholar Noah Rosenblumhas shown, the committee on administrative management, a presidential advisory panel that sought to empower Roosevelt, also proved acutely aware of the dangers of fascism. A crucial lesson of the 1930s was that an executive should never become an extension of the personality of the president. Hence, they advocated for a separation of powers also within the executive.The Reagan revolution did not spare the administrative state: much stronger oversight of agencies was instituted to push a deregulatory agenda. One of Reagan’s successors, Bill Clinton, shared some of that neoliberal agenda; in the face of a hostile Republican Congress, he sought toadvance policieswith executive orders (and talk about them loudly from the bully pulpit). He also reduced the federal workforce, but, unlike with Trump’s shock troops, the idea was never to “traumatize” civil servants.The “unitarians” – Clarence Thomasforemost among them– keep invoking democracy as the only appropriate check on a president. Some law professors have gone so far as to argue thatan unbound executive– unbound from meaningful restraints by Congress and the judiciary – is not something to lose sleep over, since, ultimately, “public opinion” will set a limit on any illegitimate conduct by a president.Such a notion – very much welcomed by the George W Bush administration pursuing its global “war on terror” – runs afoul of a basic fact: citizens will in all likelihood not be terribly familiar with the finer points of regulatory policy (Justice Elena Kagan haspointed outthat courts aren’t either, which is why checks by experts inside the executive are so important). The trust in public opinion appears also exceedingly naïve in a highly polarized country featuring an enclosedrightwing media ecospherethat values political validation over accurate information.What’s more, independent agencies in charge of elections and media regulation – not to speak of independent prosecutors – are crucial for the preservation of democracy as a whole; if they can be manipulated, “public opinion” can hardly be a restraint on an aspiring autocrat. It isnot an accidentthat countries such as Turkey, Hungary and Poland have seen a hijacking of what were meant to be non-partisan commissions by populist parties.The assault on what Mike Johnson has called a “totalitarian” fourth branch of government could proceed without mass firings of probationary civil servants, the senseless destruction of data and expertise and other wanton acts of sabotage; in fact, it seems completely to undermine the very goal of a strong president fully in charge of a competent executive. But then again, not just since Trump, the GOP has made government dysfunctional in order to convince citizens that it can never be competent.Musk claimsprivatizing much of the state and handing it over to tech bros will bring “efficiency”. Never mind whether that is true – experience suggests the opposite – and never mind the corruption that will come with it; it is also difficult to square with the notion of a president being visible, responsible and accountable. As the Stanford political scientist Adam Bonicahas shown, rather than pursuing efficiency, Trump and Musk are simply taking a chainsaw to whatever institution is considered “liberal” and assists the worst off. The result will be an executive all at once unchained, chaotic and corrupt.Jan-Werner Müller is a professor of politics at Princeton University and is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsRepublicansOpinionDonald TrumpUS justice systemTrump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicsElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

The film, the government judged, was simply too “horrifying” for the public. Two decades after that, The War Game finally aired, prior to the release of the 1984 film Threads, which, in imaginingthe aftermath of a nuclear attackon the UK, was the first movie to deal with the scientific reality of nuclear winter.When I was 11, I had nightmares for a few weeks after seeing a trailer for a nuclear doomsday film (The Sum of All Fears) that ran prior to a cinema screening of The Fellowship of the Ring (I had just read the three Lord of the Rings volumes). TheNazgûlwere disturbing, of course, but they were not of the real world, unlike nukes. This January, I was confronted with The War Game at an exhibition on The Atomic Age at Paris’s Museum of Modern Art; I finished the exhibit in near silence. A week later, I watched Threads; it ruined the remainder of my afternoon.Both films are the bleakest things I have ever seen – enough to induce nightmares in any adult. It is fitting that words fall short of the power of their imagery in revealing the pointless atrocity that would end healthcare, agriculture and even language itself for the mentally ruined, deformed, illiterate generations that would linger on, subsisting through a collective non-life.During the cold war, the world narrowly escaped that fatemore than once. Among the near misses, two are particularly harrowing. In 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis,36-year-old Vasili Arkhipov, a senior officer on a Soviet submarine, averted nuclear conflict after his two fellow commanders thought non-lethal depth charges exploding around them were the outbreak of war. In 1983, the Soviet officerStanislov Petrovrefused to believe that a launch warning flashing on a radar system was actually an American first strike, and simply decided not to report the incident up the chain of command.A decade later in 1994 Ukraine, which had the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world,relinquished its nuclear warheadsas part of a complete nuclear disarmament. It did soin exchange for iron-clad security guaranteesfrom the US, UK and Russia. Donald Trump’s betrayal of Ukraine (or, worse, active sabotage by cutting it off from someintelligence sharing) and in-process realignment of the US with Vladimir Putin’s geostrategic objectives guarantees that no state will ever do anything similar in the future.For months,maps floating around the Maga-spherehave shown quite clearly what the Trump regime’s vision of the world is, and what its intent is. It’s a vision Trump has made little effort to conceal. As if they were playing the board game Risk, they have decided that the “winning strategy” is to take and hold North America. The first economic shot has been launched at forcibly making Canada the “51st state” – and during his address to the US Congress, Trump was equally explicit that Greenland (“we’re going to get it one way or another”) and thePanama canalwill be next.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House in Washington DC, on 28 February 2025.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesTheir dark vision is that an imperial America will do as it wants in its corner of the world, as will China and Russia in theirs. The European Union, however, will be a special target of their hostility, ire and predation because it stands for everything that they appear to want to bury: the rule of law, constraints on the powerful, equal sovereignty for the small, government as a bulwark against corruption rather than its enabler, multilateral action to tackle grave ecological and climate crises instead of thewanton spoliationof the earth.With the US under Trump rapidlybacksliding on democracy, drawing from an authoritarian playbook and verging on open hostility towards its former allies, the logical conclusion with regard to nuclear weapons –almost miraculouslylimited to just a handful of states today – doesn’t take much stretch of the imagination. Japan, South Korea, Australia and Canada all have clear reasons to pursue them, and if Iran reached the breakout point, Saudi Arabia would quickly join the race.Europe’s leaders seem to have understood the seriousness of this swift-moving moment.“I want to believe that the United States will stay by our side, but we have to be prepared for that not to be the case,” said Emmanuel Macron in abroadcast to the French nationon Wednesday night. Macron opened the door to the “European dimension” that France has historically maintained with regard to its nuclear deterrent beingmade more explicit. France is the only EU country with nuclear weapons.However, even if in the short term France’s deterrent – so wisely keptfully independent– is extended to the rest of the EU, would that be sufficient for European states under more immediate threat? Faced with an imperialist Russian regime that has repeatedly invoked nuclear blackmail in its war on Ukraine, chances are the EU will have to seek its own EU-level deterrent at some point in the future.Even if France’s nuclear deterrent is extended to the rest of the EU, would that be sufficient?This is the tragedy thatDonald Trumphas wrought: the world will rearm, defence stocks will soar. Perhaps we’ll find a new balance; if not, there will be war. Precious resources that should have been used to heal, feed, educate, create, conserve and explore will be redirected to a world order the United States once knew well enough to do away with.It wasn’t just nightmares when I was a kid – I also dreamed of going to space.As we all try to grapple with the shifting of what we thought our world was, and would be, I find myself thinking about these reckless, dangerous, small-minded men – Putin, Trump, Musk – obsessed with power and grandeur. I would trade my own childhood dream of orbiting the Earth for them to go to space instead, in the hope that they too would look back at our bright blue orb of a planet and be transformed in the way so many real astronauts have been. Perhaps they would come away with a lessonSamantha Harvey offered usin her Booker prize-winning novel about astronauts, Orbital: “Some metal separates us from the void; death is so close.

Those days are gone.Most of our kids get more nutritious lunches than we ever did, and that’s great. But food waste is a serious problem. You don’t necessarily need to opt for the elaboratebento boxesthat have become de rigueur in recent years, but it’s worth considering how we pack it and what will actually get eaten.Claire Thomson’s recipes for back-to-school packed lunchesRead moreDon’t over packA2019 studyestimated that each year Australian students throw away 5 million sandwiches, 3 million pieces of whole fruit and 3 million items of packaged food. Mark Boulet, the study’s lead researcher, says getting kids more involved in choosing and preparing the food they bring to school is a crucial step in bringing those numbers down.The first thing parents should think about is how much food they’re sending to school with children. “Everyone wants to look after their kids but that ‘just in case’ food often gets wasted,” he says, adding that too often “we give them far more than they can get through in the given time at school”.It pays to be aware then of what their eating schedule looks like: when and where your child has a chance to eat and how much time they have. Ask your kid, check in with their teacher and start to develop a suitable school day menu around that.What’s on the menu?Packing things your child is familiar with and enjoys eating is obviously a good first step, but that doesn’t mean hitting the chips and choccy milk aisle. Most processed and packaged food is going to be less nutritious and will produce more waste than food you can make at home and send in reusable packaging.Of course not everyone has time or inclination to prepare homemade everything, but provided the ingredients you use aren’t ultra-processed, a good old-fashioned sandwich, some fresh produce and a treat should be nutritionally adequate and limit packaging waste.Pack it rightWho among us doesn’t remember the disappointment of a soggy tomato sanga, squishy pear or damp crackers at recess? “If it’s not stored and packaged properly it can become pretty unappealing by lunchtime,” Boulet says.He reminds us it’s worth investing in the right kit (cooler bags, ice blocks and containers that don’t cross-contaminate) to ensure food makes it to lunchtime as something you’d be happy to eat yourself.Get kids involvedEvery parent knows their child the best, but Boulet reckons we often do more for them than is needed – and it’s good to think about what they’re capable of doing themselves. Boulet’s study indicates that working with kids on a reasonable shopping list for lunch and taking the time to teach them how to prepare parts of it – even if that is just putting things in the cooler-bag – is empowering and can make a big difference in how interested they are in it come lunchtime. His advice: “Start earlier than you think.”Lunch recipes for your bento box | The lunch boxRead moreDon’t ‘go crook’There’s not much more disgusting and infuriating than unpacking a lunchbox at day’s end only to find a pile of mutilated, half-eaten scraps. But Boulet says it’s imperative parents don’t “go crook when food comes home uneaten”. He says some waste is inevitable and we should encourage kids to bring home any leftovers, moderate our reactions and assess the waste together so it can be used to inform future choices.“Have that dialogue around their tastes and what they actually feel happy and comfortable eating in the confines of the school day.”It’s a moving targetLike most things with young kids, what works for lunch is not a set-and-forget thing. “It’s never static, checking in with kids every day is important,” Boulet says.Boulet, a parent himself, says he is more than sympathetic to how tedious it can be to make school lunches a focal point of your week any more than is strictly necessary.“The food provisioning routines in most family households are pretty tightly wired, so there’s always a bit of discomfort that comes with change. But we have found that if you can sit with that for even a short period of time, you will quickly see a pretty significant change in how much food is getting wasted during the school day.”Share your experienceWhat are your strategies for reducing waste in school lunches?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The sector is hi-tech and low labourKhem Rogaly is a senior research fellow at the thinktank Common WealthFri 7 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 12.41 ESTShareKeir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have announced their latest rescue remedy for Britain’s economy. Old promises – good jobs, thriving small businesses andregional equality– will now be delivered by an increased military budget, used to buy equipment from the private sector. More military spending is not a tonic, however, but a poison that will worsen our economic ills and make Britain less safe in the long run.Assurances of prosperity for small businesses and ex-industrial towns rest on a misleading depiction of military spending. Last financial year, 56% of Ministry of Defence spending with UK businesses went toLondon and the south of England. In the same year,nearly 40%of the £37.6bn military equipment budget went to just 10 multinational companies. “Slashing red tape” and granting small businesses more access to the military budget will not build a family-run missile factory on every street corner of ex-industrial Britain.BAE Systems, leading weapons dealer to government and happy recipient of 15% of the equipment budget, has just declaredrecord orders and rising profits. Military contractors are large multinationals that reward their asset manager shareholders from government contracts: since 2015, BAE has paid out £9.8bn to shareholders while receivingmore than a fifthof its global revenue each year from the British government.While in a few specific areas, communities are reliant on jobs at military contractors, this is the result of public spending decisions, not the benevolence or dynamism of private companies. Although the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard now relies on contracts to build nuclear submarines, in the early 1960s itsmost profitable workwas making engines for British Rail. Policy choices have left communities dependent on military contracts because of divestment from public services and civilian industry.Regardless, military spending is not a viable strategy for growth or the creation of good jobs nationally: Ministry of Defence spending on business directlysupports130,000 full-time jobs in the UK; if including supply chains, this rises to 209,000 or 0.83% of the workforce. Even with the military budget set to grow further over the next parliament, the industry it supports is too small to transform the nation’s economy.More important, the connection between military spending and job creation has weakened over time. Despite falling as a share of GDP, Britain’s military budget has grown in real terms since the early 1980s – the height of the cold war – yet at the same timemore than halfof jobs in the military industry have been lost. The military sector is increasingly a hi-tech employer that relies less on manufacturing and more on IT and engineering jobs in the south of England. Modelling in theUSandcontinental Europesuggests that investment in public services, environmental protections or renewable energy creates more jobs and more economic output than military contracts. This is intuitive: while new energy infrastructure provides long-term value by reducing bills, a faulty tank or aircraft carrier has little connection to the rest of the economy.Perhaps worst of all, the government is claiming that military spending is Britain’s economic salvation while wearing fiscal handcuffs of its own making. Military investments have already come at the cost of the foreign aid budget, and the chancellor has announced that a fund primarily for green industrial developmentcan be used on military spending. A commitment to higher defence spending in the next parliament has been swiftly followed by a reported intention to cut social security. These cuts will take from those who need support most and leave deep economic scars,reducing the money spent in the economy. The poorest in society are told that state coffers are empty while, for defence contractors, abundance is more than a political horizon.The government and the opposition are united in presenting “rearmament” as a difficult but necessary step – to keep Britain safe in a turbulent global order. This conceals the reality that Britain already has the world’s sixth largest military budget, which funds deployments that sprawl across the globe. There is little discussion of how bases in Oman and Bahrain keep us safe or of why paying £9bn to Mauritius to keep the US air force on the Chagos Islands is necessary for national security. Britain’s fantastical efforts to remain a global military power have left a trail of blood in Palestine, Yemen, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan in this century alone. This litany of devastating intervention and military collaboration has nothing to do with national defence.Perversely, faced by a US administration that is redrawing its relationship with Europe, there is an opening for Britain to reconsider its alliance with US global dominance. To focus on national defence and regional collaboration, the government should draw down British military resources in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific that are devoted towards upholding US power and a vain attempt to compete with China.Amid global instability, there is an opportunity to focus on genuine national and economic security – energy independence, public services and resilient industries – instead of sacrificing our societal health at the altar of military power.Khem Rogaly is a senior research fellow at the thinktank Common Wealth, where he leads a research programme on the military industryExplore more on these topicsDefence policyOpinionMinistry of DefenceBAE SystemsEconomic policyForeign policyUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

We need new laws nowFri 7 Mar 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 08.07 ESTShareReports of non-consensual intimate image (NCII) abuse, or “revenge porn”, in the UK haveincreased tenfoldover the past few years. But the true scale of the problem is probably larger, as many victimsdo not come forward.I didn’t. When I was 17, my Instagram account was hacked by someone I knew, and a graphic image of my body was posted on my profile. Despite being up for only five minutes, it was screenshotted and shared around by boys in my year. The worst part was the powerlessness I felt. I had to seek out these people and beg them to remove the screenshots, and when they didn’t, I went to my school to ask them to intervene. Going to the police felt like it would escalate the situation when I just wanted everyone to forget it. My experience, like those of so many others, never showed up in the official statistics.Recently there has been a rise in legislation meant to combat NCII in the UK. TheOnline Safety Act 2023has made it easier to punish individuals without the difficult bar of having to prove “intent to cause distress”.It places some liability on platforms for user safety, and nowcovers “deepfakes” too.Given my experience, I’m glad the government is taking steps, but they have arrived too slowly and piecemeal. It was only in 2015 that NCII abuse became illegal in the UK (in many countries, it still isn’t). Since then, technology, regulations, legislation and reporting systems haven’t caught up with the pace and intricacy of online harms.By 2016, the ability to share images over large social platforms had been around for years, so I can’t help but think other avenues should have been available to me. I wish the screenshot had been blocked, but instead, it was passed around on Facebook, which, five years later in 2021,partnered with StopNCII– a technology that allows victims to create a hash of their content (a kind of digital footprint) then share this hash with other platforms to rapidly block it.Back then, I couldn’t do this. I assume the screenshot is still on people’s phones, buried in old chats, perhaps posted on some shady corner of the internet. Years later, I still feel ashamed: if I ever go viral, work in politics or education, or come under the public eye, this image could resurface and cause me continued grief. But I’m also frustrated – not with the individuals as much as with the environment that allowed it to happen.The Online Safety Act is a good step forward, but it is not enough. As it stands, it is thesharingof NCII that is illegal, not the images themselves. This is blamed on complexity around consent; NCII must first be verified as such, then removed. The powers granted to Ofcom are not sophisticated enough to process this efficiently.So, for instance, if a perpetrator is convicted for NCII abuse, this does not take the harmful content down. There is no immediate takedown system. And of course, the recourse of seeking a court order to take something down is beyond most victims.Because it is only thesharing of harmful content, not the content itself that is technically illegal, this can also result in bizarre cases where victims go to the police, and a criminal conviction is obtained, but the devices that contain the harmful content arehanded back to the perpetrator. These gaps in appropriate procedure go hand in hand with a police force that isuneducated in online harms, what NCII abuse is and what the victim needs in terms of protection. I do not blame my younger self for not wanting to go to the police – there is unfortunately evidence that many victimsdo not feel supportedwhen they do so.Also, I was lucky to be able to remove the initial image myself, as it had been posted on my own account. But in the majority of cases, NCII images are shared online without the knowledge of the victim, onwebsites that are unregulated. Ofcom cannot take down these unregulated platforms immediately; the process for removal takes months, by which time the images or footage would have beendispersed even more widely.So, what could be the solution? In the UK there is at least a growing awareness of this issue.A new report from the parliamentary women and equalities committee (WEC) has recommended creatinga new commissionto flag NCII and support individuals pursuing legal action. And Ofcomrecently publishedits illegal harms codes, which states that “sites and apps must also take down non-consensual intimate images (or “revenge porn”) when they become aware of it”, but does little to explain how this would be practically enforced.There is a mention of using hash technology to combat NCII, with further consultations planned in 2025. Improved legislation could make it mandatory for platforms to partner with existing, effective systems such as StopNCII. It is currently partnered with 13 regulated platforms, but thousands more platforms need to partner to create a more hostile environment for non-compliant websites. Google, for example, refuses to partner with StopNCII for reasons that are not entirely clear. In evidence given to the WEC committee, itclaimed to beonly a “window” on to the internet, and not a host – hard to believe, given its overwhelming monopoly as a search engine.It is true that the scale of online content and potentially harmful images is enormous. It is snowballing out of control: in 2023 there were 36.2mreports madeto the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children cyber helpline. But we saw during the pandemic that tech companies were capable ofrapid changeto prevent the spread of misinformation.Tech companies don’t have the impetus to partner with StopNCII, because legislation has not yet made it mandatory. Tech platforms will only do as much as they have to, so legislation needs to be more comprehensive and specific, not more severe on the individual.There are countries that are more advanced in their approach: Canada hasonline processesthat act swiftly – a straightforward and inexpensive court order to get material removed. We need a similarly bespoke process. Australia also has acentralised eSafety commissionerwho can take action on behalf of individuals who cannot go through criminal or civil courts.The impact on victims can be huge: 51%report thoughtsof suicide, and there are numerous recorded cases of people following through with these thoughts. StopNCII was not available in 2016 when this happened to me.

It is at root the same issue, that of local autonomy, that led to regional unrest in Ukraine and splintered leadership in Palestine. It underlies the devastating conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Allthese places are flush with guns, allies and bombast. What they lack are national constitutions that allow their citizens sufficient local control to live at peace with others in one nation. They lack the skills of political federation.The present Ukraine war followed the failure of peace accords reached in Minsk in 2014 and 2015; critically, they depended on the technical details of how self-determination was to be allowed in eastern Ukraine. A later failure was that of theIstanbul dealafter the Russian invasion in 2022. It appeared to be the result of President Zelenskyy’s reaction to Vladimir Putin’sBucha massacre. But the origins of failure go back to Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine’s reaction to years of corrupt and oppressive rule from Kyiv. Similar dissent exists among Russian minorities in the Baltic states. Everywhere, localism matters.A constitution capable of bringing stable peace through self-government to Palestine’sWest Bankand Gaza may seem almost inconceivable, but one day it has to emerge. Peace does always follow war. We assume that Qatari and Egyptian mediators are wrestling with this now, but it remains mystifying what leverage they can have over parties whose command structures are so wholly committed to armed conflict. No less urgent is for Syria to be helped towards a coalition similar to that which has kept neighbouring Lebanon at peace, however hesitantly. Syria needs an invasion of constitutional entrepreneurs.Devolved constitutions work. India held together after partition by permitting a ruthless regionalism. It took Spain decades of civil war to reach an accord with its Basque separatists, but that has held. Britain failed. It is four years since Ireland celebrated the centenary of its departure from the United Kingdom, after a bitter civil war following a denial of home rule. Even today,neither Northern Ireland nor Scotlandare stable members of the union. The reason is simple: London’s obsessive centralisation.The more technology concentrates power on central governments, the more regions and provinces – in democracies and autocracies alike – demand greater freedom. Deprive them of it and they rise in varying degrees of revolt. Governments subject to no constitutional constraint, as in Britain, simply find devolution unpalatable. Every British political party swears to honour localism while in opposition, and then crushes it when in power. Virtually the last area of local discretion in England, town and country planning, is now being overruled by Keir Starmer. He is abolishinghundreds of democratic district councilshe finds inconvenient to his bureaucracy.Europe’s wiser regimes use their constitutions to appease local dissent, such as Italy regarding Sicily, Spain in Catalonia, Denmark in Greenland. Switzerland has long decentralised to its cantons, almost to the limit of national sovereignty; even qualification to vote was once discretionary. Germany’s constitution was carefully crafted after the second world war to distribute power among theLänder,to limit the reach of the central state. When Tito’s Yugoslavia fell apart, the failure to establish a vigorous federal constitution led its provinces into bloody civil war and disintegration.Sound constitution-building is essential to a secure statehood. Arguably the most successful is that created by the United States – plural – of America in the 18th century. It is safeguarded with a central balance of powers and autonomy vested in the rights of states, a balance that may soon be tested to destruction. But the US has held together a union of disparate ethnic and national peoples in a way that has defeated subsequent efforts at union in both Europe and South America.Constitutions may be hard to write in peacetime, but they are even harder after countries have collapsed into war. When guns are blazing and bombs falling, talk of contested boundaries, devolved assemblies, discretionary taxes and local policing seems eerily irrelevant. Yet such accords there must be. Constitution-building may offer no headlines, but what it can do is stop hundreds of thousands of people dying.Trump’s plan for Gaza leaves Arab nations facing an impossible choice | Nesrine MalikRead moreThe masters of postwar diplomacy, such as George Kennan and Henry Kissinger, kept Europe free of war for half a century. The philosophy of containment meant the avoidance of head-to-head conflict with Russia. It also involved a measured response to Russia’s handling of its relations with its frontline neighbours, such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Containment held until finally Russia could no longer maintain authority over its family of subordinate states, their regimes exhausted by impotence. Most departed totally from Moscow’s empire.Both Gaza andUkrainewill need constitutions of masterful robustness. Yet while generals parade the majesty of their command, diplomatic peace-making seems in its infancy. Someone has to fashion political structures for these places that meet the long-term cravings of their citizens on the ground – cravings above all for freedom from interference from a higher authority. That is a freedom that modern governments, in peace or at war, still find hopelessly difficult to deliver.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Abolish it – me includedCarmen SmithI came here a year ago because Plaid Cymru seeks to protect Welsh interests. But I think Labour should keep its vow and scrap this chamberFri 7 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 11.53 ESTShareWhen I took my seat in theHouse of Lordsalmost a year ago, I pledged to campaign for the abolition of my job. Our second chamber has become a gated community of more than 800 members, making it the second largest legislative chamber in the world, topped only by China’s National People’s Congress. The House of Lords casts a shadow over parliament, and its unelected peers have a huge influence on the laws that get passed.Last March, I joined the second chamber representingPlaid Cymru. Aged 28, I was the youngest member of the chamber, and the youngest ever life peer. Plaid Cymru doesn’t believe that an unelected chamber should form part of our democracy, but we do believe that we should have a seat at the table wherever decisions affecting Wales are being made. Since taking my seat in the Lords, I have been clear about my desire to change the system from within, while standing up for Welsh people and for young people across Britain.As much as I have enjoyed working with members across the political spectrum, over the past year I have gained a rare insight into how Westminster functions behind the scenes and, at times, how it fails to function altogether. One only need look at the recentLords debate investigationin this newspaper to see the conflicts of interest that persist within the second chamber, where some peers have used their positions to advance commercial interests.With a large new intake of MPs, there is increasing momentum for change from within Westminster. The recent election resulted in the highest ever number of parliamentary newbies in the House of Commons –335 new MPs, including 20 under the age of 30, the highest number of MPs from ethnic minority backgrounds, and the lowest proportion of MPs who attended fee-paying secondary schools. Many have claimed this is the most diverse House of Commons in history.Yet while Keir Starmervowed to abolish the Lordsbefore he was elected and replace it with a democratically elected second chamber, his plans have since been scaled back to merely scrapping the 92 all-male hereditary peers. The resulting bill is a minimal reform. It falls far short of what was outlined in the Labour party’s manifesto, and does nothing to stem the jobs-for-life handed out by prime ministers to their party donors and friends.The time is up for these outdated traditions and procedures. That’s why I have tabled several amendments to the hereditary peers bill, with the aim of strengthening it, pushing for the delivery of Labour’s manifesto commitments, and ultimately making the Lords into an elected chamber. People should be involved in the political decisions that affect their day-to-day lives, either directly, via citizens’ assemblies, or by electing representatives they trust to advocate on their behalf. Those decisions should not be taken and shaped by unelected peers, some of whom are there for no other reason than birth.Several new MPs have already expressed frustration with outdated procedures on their side of the Houses of Parliament – from the requirement to“bob” repeatedlyto catch the speaker’s attention, to the insistence that MPs must vote in person in London rather than from their constituency offices. After the general election, several new MPs founded a modernisation committee in the House of Commons to update parliament’s working practices. Something similar should be set up for the Lords, where the need for modernisation is even more urgent.The Guardian view on the House of Lords: ministers risk a hollow reform with a partisan approach | EditorialRead moreIn redesigning the UK’s second chamber, we don’t need to reinvent the wheel. We can simply adopt the best practices of our democratic friends. Most second chambers across the world are elected, either directly by the people or through an electoral college. Ultimately, Britain needs a democratic second chamber that ensures the people who make and shape our laws are accountable to the people who live under them.The UK is highly unusual and archaic in maintaining a system of parliamentary appointments based on nobility, patronage and the church. The second chamber remains an anomaly and a mystery to most people. The government has a unique opportunity to change and transform this. I understand why some want to preserve Westminster’s status quo – power protects power, and those in power rarely seek to relinquish it. But the right to govern shouldn’t be bestowed by birth, title or political favour. It must be earned at the ballot box.Carmen Smith, Baroness Smith of Llanfaes, has been a member of the House of Lords for Plaid Cymru since March 2024Explore more on these topicsLords reformOpinionHouse of LordsPlaid CymruLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The upside is they are doing something about itFri 7 Mar 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 10.45 ESTShareIt’s the love-hate relationship that defined a generation. We think we know all about teenagers and the phones to which they’re so umbilically tied: sleeping with them under the pillow, panicking at the prospect of ever being denied wifi, so glued to the screen that they’re oblivious to the world unfolding around them. Yet the first generation to have never really known a life without social media – the drug that primarily keeps them coming back to their phones for more – is now grown up enough to reflect on what it may have done to them, and the answers are almost enough to break your heart.Two-thirds of 16- to 24-year-olds think social media does more harm than good and three-quarters want tougher regulation to protect younger people from it, according to polling for theNew Britain Project, a thinktank founded by a former teacher, Anna McShane. Half think they spent too much time on it when they were younger, with regret highest among those who started using social media youngest. And most tellingly of all, four in five say they’d keep their own children away from it for as long as they could if they became parents. This isn’t how anyone talks about something they love, but how you look back on a relationship that was in retrospect making you miserable.Though the focus groups she conducted confirmed that parents were desperate for help weaning children off screens, what’s refreshing about McShane’s research is that it suggests the generations aren’t as locked in combat as they sometimes feel; that increasingly, we’re all on the same side. Gen Z, it turns out, don’t need more lectures from their (often equally addicted) elders about getting off that bloody phone. If anything, they may have something to teach us.This Friday, parliament will vote on the Labour MP (and former teacher) Josh MacAlister’s private member’s bill on safer phone use, expected to be backed by the government but only after beingnotably watered down. Though MacAlister originally favoured raising the legal limit for accessing social media from 13 to 16, the bill now only commits ministers to reporting back in a year’s time on the case for doing so, plus conducting further research and publishing fresh guidance on children’s screen time. With X’s CEO, Elon Musk, virtually embedded in the White House, some will suspect ministers of ducking a confrontation with American tech giants. But there are other reasons not to rush in, at least until the complex new Online Safety Act due to come into force this spring has settled down, and ministers have had a chance to learn from similar bans beingintroduced in AustraliaandNorway.Rather cheeringly, however, it seems in the meantime gen Z are taking things into their own hands. A generation of kids who grew up online, spent lockdown in their bedrooms, and all too often started their first jobs dialling remotely into Zoom meetings, now seems to be actively trying to teach itself to socialise the analogue way.Nightclubs and gig venuesfrom Manchester to Ibiza to Berlin have started asking punters to put stickers over their phone cameras, encouraging them not to film on the dancefloor but just tolose themselves in the momentlike their parents got to do. Meanwhile an explosion of gen Z running clubs, reading groups, in-person singles parties for people exhausted by dating apps, and “digital detox” events where phones are left outside the door, reflect a palpable and touching new hunger for old-fashioned face-to-face connection.The 25-year-old writer Adele Zeynep Walton foundedLogging Off Club, which organises real life social meet-ups for people trying to wean themselves off their phones, after a chance conversation during a 25th birthday weekend away with friends. All of them, it turned out, were worried about their screen time and were secretly trying to cut it down, but felt self-conscious talking about it. At Logging Off Club events, she says cheerfully, “we take people’s phones off them at the door and put them in a bucket”. It’s like ripping away a comfort blanket at first, but it makes people talk to each other rather than hiding behind a screen. At one event she organised jointly with City Daze, another social club that organises phone-free walks round London, attendees were even given cue cards to help them start conversations.What seems to be building up among younger women in particular isn’t just a backlash against the kind of toxic content, bullying or political disinformation rampant in their online lives, but a feeling that spending so much time on their phones has deprived them of something human and important. Walton is starting to think about where she might want to settle down in the next few years, only to realise that she feels curiously unrooted from any real-life community: though she’s been talking for years online to people she has never met, she doesn’t even know her physical neighbours’ names. Her generation has, she says, “been sold that lie of connection” by the big platforms but are finding the pseudo-communities offered there ultimately unsatisfying, leaving them wanting more. Her book about all of this,Logging Off, is published in June and though it’s hard to read as a parent without thinking guiltily that society has been asleep at the wheel here, there’s something oddly uplifting about watching gen Z start to try to rebuild the lives they clearly feel they’ve been missing.The US sociologist Robert D Putnam is best known for describing the downs in his classicBowling Alone, which argued that society became more fragmented, polarised and distrusting over the second half of the 20th century as Americans retreated from collective activities – from team sports to churchgoing – that once knitted them together. But in his more recent book,The Upswing, written with Shaylyn Romney Garrett, Putnam goes back another half a century to explore how that sociable state of bowling together originally came about. It was, he argues, also in part a reaction to a period of loneliness and isolation, but this time caused by people moving from close-knit rural and small town America to bigger towns and cities where there were jobs and opportunities, but where they had few ties. What followed was a mushrooming of social clubs, from rotary clubs and scout groups to unions, that brought them together; though they didn’t know it, in retrospect their members were building the beginning of an upswing. The moral of the story, for those daring to be hopeful? That once societies get far enough down the path of isolation, sometimes the only way left is up.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionYoung peopleChildrenSocial mediaMental healthOnline abuseHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

It sits on the seafloor in a canyon about 3.5 kilometres below the surface.View image in fullscreenThe Nuyina DMV departs Hobart.Photograph: Nathan Bindoff (AAPP)As the most northerly ice-shelf system outside the Antarctic peninsula, the Denman Glacier is already one of the fastest retreating glaciers in Australian Antarctic Territory.If the Denman were to melt entirely, it could contribute about 1.5 metres to global sea level rise, let alone what could be unleashed from the inland ice sheet it holds back.This voyage has been a long time coming. It’s the culmination of about a decade of planning for a dream experiment to investigate the interactions between ice shelf and ocean, from both the marine and terrestrial sides.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut its genesis began even earlier. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports in 2007 marked a turning point with the recognition that ice sheets are the problem for global sea-level rise, and that ice shelves are their “soft underbelly”.World’s largest iceberg drifts threateningly toward remote island of penguins and sealsRead moreWe realised Antarctica was on the move. In 2008, scientists showed that changes in glacier flow have a “significant if not dominant impact” on the loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet.In 2011, scientists tagged a seal that ended up swimming through a deep trough in the ocean bed near the Denman Glacier, measuring unusually warm water there.In 2019, a new elevation map of the continental bedrock beneath the Antarctic ice sheet revealed the deepest valley on Earth beneath the Denman Glacier.For months from the end of 2020, Australian oceanographers tracked a robotic float that travelled underneath the Denman Glacier ice shelf.Before it disappeared under winter sea ice, the float sent back measurements showing warm water flooding through the deep valley into the ice shelf cavity, enough to rapidly melt the glacier from below.The only way to get information like this is to be thereSo this voyage aims to discover not only how vulnerable the Denman Glacier is to the warming ocean, but also the likelihood of it making a larger and faster contribution to sea-level rise during the next few decades.TheDenman Marine Voyageunder the Australian Antarctic Program brings together diverse groups of researchers to answer critical questions about the ocean, ice and climate. The onboard science teams – mostly from universities, with a significant number of early-career scientists and PhD students – will cover a broad range of biological, oceanographic, geological and atmospheric research.As an oceanographer, perhaps what I’m most excited about is the prospect to be measuring the properties of seawater – from both underneath the glacier and over the continental shelf – all at the same time, in a region where few observations have been collected before.In January, as part of the Denman Terrestrial Campaign from the land side, a string ofmoored sensorswas lowered through a hole in the floating ice shelf and left hanging in a deep underwater canyon near the grounding line of a glacier.Every day the mooring automatically sends researchers the temperature, salinity and current speed of the water. These data help us track the pathways for deep, warm, salty water to access ice shelves, where it can drive rapid melting.And now, with the RSV Nuyina moving into position to take simultaneous measurements right in front of the glacier, we should have the vital link that connects the warm flows we detect just offshore in the ocean to what’s under the ice shelves.The only way to get information like this is to be there. With it, we can refine our projections and better understand the hazard that Antarctica presents to our coastlines from the global sea-level rise we can expect – or avoid – this century.Prof Nathan Bindoff leads the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership, based in the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of TasmaniaExplore more on these topicsAntarcticaOpinionGlaciersClimate crisisSea icecommentShareReuse this content"

As the Edinburgh hit goes on tour, Minnitt explains why her mum’s doing the drivingFri 7 Mar 2025 10.17 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 11.44 ESTShareEvery now and then a comedy concept comes along that seems so obvious, you can’t believe no one has done it before. How canRosalie Minnitt’s Clementinebe the first character-comedy show to really mine the absurdities of our love of all things Jane Austen, all things frilly-bonneted andBridgerton? OK, it’s not a completely untapped seam of funny: think West End improv perennialAustentatiousor that fantastic touring theatre hitPride and Prejudice* (*Sort Of). But Minnitt is the first to distil it into a single comedy character, and to make it far funnier than we have any right to expect – not by doubling down on period pastiche, but by making her alter ego both none-more-Regency and thrillingly 21st century too.The character debuted in 2022 and Minnitt, 28, has been threatening to retire her for a while. But demand never quite goes away and a UK tour now beckons for a character her creator didn’t initially envisage as a comedy act at all. Lady Clementine’s genesis took place under lockdown. “Everyone had lost their minds a bit,” says Minnitt, a graduate of Durham University, where she performed with the Durham Revue. “And I had lost a bit of confidence in myself. I was working in a bar, then in a summer camp, then for a charity. Then I lost my job and was on furlough. I didn’t know what I was doing with my life. I was lost and directionless. Then I went through a breakup – classic!” She rolls her eyes. “So I was like, ‘I need to put this energy into something.’ And it was this.”It manages to be achingly of-the-moment too, with as many references to Reddit as riding cropsInitially, it was just an impulse, half an idea with no outlet. “I’ve always loved history,” she says, “and at the time there was this idea of‘girlboss’history. Anne Boleyn was a girlboss, all of that. But I liked the idea of a historical figure that was vaguely uninspiring and caught within the traps of her own era’s patriarchy.”Minnitt was struck by the fascination with all things Austen, more so perhaps because she’s a part-outsider to Englishness. The daughter of teachers, she spent much of her childhood in Belgium before moving to Wiltshire. “We live in an age where people are obsessed with not living in the present. They’re either looking for an escape to the future, or fantasy, or the past. And we’re romanticising things. I find that fascinating. So it was a perfect storm of these strands, and of people feeling dissatisfied with their love lives. All of that came together in this quite weird patchwork show.”View image in fullscreen‘Joyous in an extremely female way’ … Minnitt.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIt’s a patchwork that needs to be encountered to be fully understood. “It very much started as a parody/spoof,” says Minnitt, who was inspired by an “insane” handbook she found in a charity shop advising Edwardian women on how to find a spouse. But it didn’t stay that one-dimensional: “I didn’t want to be making knowing winks to genres all the time.”The show, which follows Clementine manically hunting down a husband before that most terminal of deadlines, her 27th birthday, makes hay with corseted costume-drama stereotype: the decorousness, the snobbery, the deeply repressed subtext. But it also artfully fudges the particular period Minnitt is dramatising, as Clementine’s Austen-alike backdrop blurs with every other period in which a woman’s liberty was put out to market, her self-worth pegged to her age, attractiveness and whatever assurances she may have from this or that tailcoated beau.Hmm, you think, that doesn’t soundsodifferent from 2025. Reader, you’d better believe Minnitt is wise to that too. Her coup with Clementine – a sleeper hit at the Edinburgh fringe two summers back – was to cross-fertilise a period parody French and Saunders might have attempted with the achingly of-the-moment standup pioneered byKate Berlant,Catherine Cohenand a generation of comics capturing always-online life and its endless neurotic identity curation. So this great time-bending whirlwind of a show contains as many references to Reddit and Instagram as to riding crops and perfumed billets-doux.The result feels like a fantasia on feminism and female identity through the ages. It was greeted, when I saw it at Soho theatre, by great gales of laughter, of the type generated only when a show touches more than just a funny bone, but a deep nerve too. “It can get feral,” says its creator. “It can feel like I’ve whipped the mob up and I can’t control it!”View image in fullscreenNext stop Les Mis … Minnitt as her alter ego.Photograph: Sonja HorsmanBut if the response can be unwieldy, it’s thrilling too. “It feels joyous, in an extremely female way. I’ve spoken to audience members who are like, ‘It’s girly, it’s childlike, it’s about being a woman but it’s not sexualised. It’s about being silly.’ I got a message from someone that said, ‘If someone asked me why I like being a girl, I’d tell them to go see this show.’ I loved that. That’s why I’m doing this.”The show’s continuing success seems so deserved, and assured, that it’s startling to hear Minnitt describe the difficulties she had making it happen – and asserting herself in comedy. A few years and one hit show into her career, she still feels like an outsider, not always welcomed by the industry. “I think people don’t like stuff that feels like chick lit. That’s why some of the industry reception has been a little bit cold. It can be a difficult sell to a male audience.”At any rate, she says: “I still feel impostor syndrome. I’m struggling to find my feet and where to put my energy. If you have a successful show, you’re expected to know how to do everything, which is quite difficult. But I’m coming to terms with that.”Part of coming to terms with it is taking Clementine on the road. This (memo to anyone who thinks Edinburgh fringe success means Fleabag glory) is not a glamorous process. “For the next two months,” says Minnitt, “I’m going to work three jobs so I can afford to dohalfthe dates I wanted to do. And my mum’s doing the driving for me. I’ve had to get her involved to cut down costs.”View image in fullscreen‘Mostly, I just want to make stuff that’s silly’... Minnitt.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianShe is also marking out next steps – for the Clementine character, and for her own career. Minnitt writes for CBBC, recently appeared in cult comicJordan Brookes’s faux-musical Fontanelle, and has a guest role inthe new Alan Partridge series, How Are You? (in which “the satirical broadcaster checks in on the mental health of the nation”). AlongsideJohn Shuttleworth, say, andCount Arthur Strong, Partridge’s is a face on the (typically male) Mount Rushmore of character comedy: an exemplar (or maybe a warning) of what a career that’s dedicated to the lifelong performance of a comical alter ego might look like. Is that a path Minnitt can see herself taking?“When I look at people who are more experienced, I do think I should apply the same rigour to my character,” she says. “What does she do? What doesn’t she do? It’s so fun to have all those rules for your world. I don’t know why everyone doesn’t do character comedy: it’s so much more fun than standup.”Rosalie Minnitt: Clementine review – a frilly-bonneted comedy for todayRead moreAs we speak in London on the eve of her tour, she is already planning a new show for Clementine. “I’d like to put her in a revolution show, a Les Mis parody. That would be so fun.” And not too hard, you’d think, for a performer already used to whipping up her crowds into a riotous mob. “I want her to go to the city, too, and for that to have a Dickensian energy. But mostly, I just want to make stuff that’s funny and silly. That has always been my guiding principle.”In the meantime, as the ground shifts ever more turbulently under feminism, Minnitt is just excited to be getting her delusional, delightful and neurotic alter ego back on stage. “It feels so hard to be a woman in this year and this age – it’s more complicated than it used to be. There’s a lot of pressure that we don’t quite know how to name yet. But Clementine is a great vessel for exploring that. The show will always change, because the world is changing. It’s a great mirror to what is going on now.”Rosalie Minnitt: Clementine is atShakespeare North Playhouse, Prescot, on 8 March,then touringExplore more on these topicsComedyFeminismWomeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

They were, of course, really making a sly reference to the queer code slang term for a gay man. But when Field eventually figured this out, it gave him an idea for a song.The Wiggles’ Tree of Wisdom works it better than Missy Elliott. It’s no wonder he’s a viral sensation in a $2 wig | Molly GlasseyRead moreOn Friday, when Australia’s best-known children’s entertainers release their 63rd album (yes, really), audiences will finally get to hear Friends of Dorothy. It’s a collaboration with Orville Peck, the modern country songwriter known for his face masks, cowboy hats – and being an out-and-proud gay man.The Wiggles nervously took the idea for Friends of Dorothy to Peck on Zoom. To their delight, Peck, who has a young nephew who loves the band, jumped at the chance.“Orville was so happy to do it,” Field says. “And he’s a friend of Dorothy’s as well!”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningPeck isn’t the only contemporary collaborator the Wiggles have snagged for their next album. Wiggle Up, Giddy Up is a 17-track country album rhinestone studded with the genre’s biggest contemporary names – Dasha, Lainey Wilson, Jackson Dean and Morgan Evans among them. There’s an appearance from the late Slim Dusty (who collaborated with the band on a song back in 2000) and two songs featuring none other thanDolly Parton, including a reimagining of 9-5, titled Counting 1-5 (“Well, I just wiggled my way out into the Wiggles’ world!” Parton says in a press quote, best read in her voice).View image in fullscreenThe Wiggles, pictured with Dolly Parton, in a promo image for their country album Wiggle Up, Giddy Up!Photograph: The WigglesIt’s a list of names that reflects both the Wiggles’ celebrity stature and their desire to make “music for the preschoolers, which is, of course, our audience – but then we can put things out that older people can enjoy, and get the joke of”, as Field says.This is a new approach for the Wiggles, who first formed in 1991 and operated as a four-piece, Field, Murray Cook, Jeff Fatt and Greg Page delighting tiny listeners with simple, catchy songs such as Hot Potato and Fruit Salad for the next two decades. But in 2012 when some of the founding members began eyeing retirement, instead of winding up the band, Field opted to bring in a next generation of performers and create the Wiggles 2.0.The Wiggles, which has since had its lineup refreshed more than once, is currently a team of eight skivvy wearers, including fresh blood like 19-year-oldTsehay Hawkinsand 21-year-old Lucia Field, Anthony’s daughter.Field describes the decision to restaff the group as “selfish” – he simply didn’t want to retire.“I call myself the last of the V8s. And the reason I’ve stuck around is because I love it,” he says. “I don’t know what else I’d do [with my time], to be honest with you.”View image in fullscreenAnthony Field says he decided to restaff the Wiggles because he didn’t want to retire.Photograph: Carly Earl/The GuardianThe new Wiggles still play 400 to 500 shows per year (a feat achieved by cramming up to four gigs into a single day) but have also expanded in more modern directions. They have a big presence on YouTube and TikTok, where they have recentlygone viralthanks to the bombastic dance moves of Wiggles supporting cast memberthe Tree of Wisdom(played by Anthony’s nephew, Dominic Field).

As Hawkins puts it, their starry collaborators on Wiggle Up, Giddy Up “says it all” about the reach the Wiggles now have.Of all those big names, Field is most excited about snagging Parton for the album; at 61, he admits he wasn’t familiar with some of the younger collaborators but left it to his younger colleagues to write most of the songs, not wanting his “old-school” tastes to ruin their contemporary feel. And while Field has long considered himself the creative director of the Wiggles, he knows where to delegate: “As far as TikTok, I don’t understand that – I stay right out of it.”View image in fullscreenThe Wiggles perform before a soccer match between Australia’s Matildas and the US Women’s National Team at Stadium Australia in 2021.Photograph: Matt King/Getty ImagesWhat Field looked for in his next generation of Wiggles was talent, diversity and the sort of personality that can match the joy kids bring to shows. Many of the newer members started as supporting cast members (Gillespie, for instance, played Captain Feathersword for years before being asked to don the purple skivvy) or back-up “Wiggly dancers”.Nepo-Wiggle Lucia Field admittedly had an easier path to the group, having appeared in Wiggles videos since she was two months old. Becoming a Wiggle has changed her relationship with her dad – and the band. Today, she thinks it’s an “absolutely fantastic” inheritance. But growing up, she never told anyone she had a Wiggle for a parent and would make her dad park the car around the corner and walk in by himself to any school event, embarrassed at the prospect of being seen with him.Hot Potato: The Story of the Wiggles review – documentary will wiggle its way into your heartRead more“I don’t know if she thought I was going to come in singing Big Red Car, but I really wasn’t,” laughs the elder Field.For his part, Field has found there are perks to sharing a band with your daughter: Lucia tells him what time to get up every morning on tour, “keeps him honest” and introduced him to Orville Peck. But while Field is a lifelong country and western fan, and the gen Z Wiggles are acutely aware that country is “cool” right now, the idea for Wiggle Up, Giddy Up actually came from the band’s CEO – because yes, they have one.“Apart from being children’s entertainment and music, it is still a business,” Field says. “I’m a preschool teacher. I’m glad I’m not running the business side of things because we wouldn’t be working.”View image in fullscreenWhen the Wiggles did America … a still from the 2023 documentary Hot Potato: The Story of the Wiggles.Photograph: Courtesy of Prime VideoField says the Wiggles has always had someone in a CEO-type role – a necessary job for a band that has sold about 30m albums, and was formally consolidated in 2005 (founding members such as Fieldreportedlyown stakes in the Wiggles, while newer recruits are paid a salary). Certainly, the Wiggles are big business – they reigned as Australia’s highest-earning performers for four years in a row in the noughties, the era when the Wiggles were so huge in the US they played 13 sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden.They had the Disney Channel to thank for their US fortunes – the channel played them four times a day, putting the Wiggles in front of 85 million subscribers. But when Wiggles management agreed to a deal that put Wiggles-themed areas in Six Flags, a rival theme park to Disney, the gravy train came to an end. “I don’t think Disney liked that,” Field says. Disney took them off the channel and the band lost its audience base in the US.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The WigglesApart from those glory days, Field says, this is “the biggest era we’ve ever had … it’s really good times now for the Wiggles.”Their YouTube presence is helping the band claw back that all-important American audience, as is, Hawkins adds, the ever-popular Tree of Wisdom, who has his own dance album on the way. All their new US collaborators, too, are no doubt part of the play to regain Yankee listeners.So with that title and Peck on board, is Friends of Dorothy the first Wiggles’ gay anthem?“It could be taken like that,” Field says. “But there’s other ways you can look at it as well, as long as you have a good laugh, because that’s what we’re here for. Wiggles are for everyone. And wearejust friends of Dorothy.”Wiggle Up, Giddy Up! is out nowExplore more on these topicsThe WigglesAustralian musicDolly PartonCountryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why this is, and whether it lessens the stigma of such work, is an open questionFri 7 Mar 2025 10.57 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Mar 2025 12.57 ESTShareAnora emerged triumphant from last week’s Academy Awards presentation, winning five Oscars including best actress forMikey Madisonfor her performance as Ani, a sex worker who elopes with the feckless son of a Russian oligarch, only to find herself at odds with his powerful family and their henchmen. As in his previous films, writer-director Sean Baker shows generosity and affection for the marginalised characters, and especially for its heroine. Even when she gets roughed up, it’s played for laughs and you’re confident she won’t meet one of the sad fates of screen sex workers of yore, such as Louise Brooks as Lulu, stabbed to death in Pandora’s Box, or Vivien Leigh as Myra, who throws herself under a lorry in Waterloo Road.Madison said in her acceptance speech, “I also just want to again recognise and honour the sex worker community. I will continue to support and be an ally.” However, members of the East London Strippers Collectiveweren’t impressedby Anora. “We didn’t see any of, like, who she really is as a person,” said Maddie, who went on to admit it was a step in the right direction. “But if they had gone just a little bit further and said: ‘We need full decriminalisation now,’ that could have actually had a much bigger impact.”But if you want to see more about sex workers’ lives on screen you have only to check out the history of the Academy Awards, first given out in 1929. The original best actress award went to Janet Gaynor for her performance as the “street angel” in Street Angel, with Gloria Swanson nominated the same year for playing a “fallen woman” in Sadie Thompson. In the 97 years of the Oscars’ existence, best actress or best supporting actress awards have gone to actors playing sex workers 16 times, from Elizabeth Taylor in BUtterfield 8 to Jane Fonda in Klute, to last year’s winner Emma Stone, who has a jolly old time working in a Parisian brothel inPoor Things. And that’s not even counting the nominations for, say, Greta Garbo in Camille, Shirley MacLaine in Irma la Douce or Julie Christie in McCabe & Mrs Miller.Sixteen best actress or best supporting actress Oscars have gone to actors playing sex workersI haven’t totted up how many times women have been nominated for performances as, for example, architects or witches, but looking at the statistics, it’s clear that Hollywood has for decades acknowledged sex work as a viable career. Or just as viable as being a hitman, another of those “exotic” jobs its film-makers keep returning to. There are some films about sex workers’ lives that could be described as social-realist – Lukas Moodysson’s heartbreakingLilya 4-Everfrom 2002 springs to mind, as does Chantal Akerman’s 1975 filmJeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080, Bruxelles, which topped Sight and Sound magazine’s 2022 critics’ poll of the greatest films ever made.View image in fullscreenOld professional … Louise Brooks as Lulu in Pandora’s Box.Photograph: Ronald GrantBut such unflinching depictions are a long way from mainstream Hollywood, which prefers its sex workers portrayed as fairytale princesses who have fallen on hard times, exemplified by Pretty Woman, for which Julia Roberts, of course, was Oscar-nominated. It’s an aspirational blueprint: sell yourself on Hollywood Boulevard and you too can snag a millionaire. Having excised the dark elements and downbeat ending of its original script, Pretty Woman has been described as a modern-day Cinderella story.Anora, in turn, has been called the anti-Pretty Woman – though it still manages to be shiny and upbeat, with Ani showing the sort of smiling-through-tears resilience exhibited by Elisabeth Shue in Leaving Las Vegas.Why is the Academy so fond of sex worker performances anyway? Is it that they are considered courageous in a world that still looks down its nose at the oldest profession while pretending not to? Or are some male film-makers so unfamiliar with women from other walks of life that their most deeply considered female characters, when they bother to include any, tend to be on the game? Sex workers, mostly female but sometimes male as well, were a recurring feature of the New Hollywood in the 1970s, when the Hays Code had given way to so-called sexual liberation, and every movie brat except Steven Spielberg inserted at least one prostitute into their films.‘We didn’t see who she is’: Anora missed chance to spark real change, say sex workersRead more“It’s male projections of the kind of women they think they’d like. And for actresses it’s a juicy role, a stretch, a chance to be bad and desirable and rebellious,” film critic Molly Haskellsaid in the New York Times in 1996, the year of nominations for Shue in Leaving Las Vegas, Sharon Stone playing a former sex worker in Casino, and Mira Sorvino, who won best supporting actress for her performance as a dim-witted sex worker in Woody Allen’s Mighty Aphrodite. The rollcall of actors who have seized that chance is extensive, from Jodie Foster (Taxi Driver) and Kim Basinger (LA Confidential) to Charlize Theron (Monster), Anne Hathaway (Les Misérables) and Naomie Harris (Moonlight).Sam, another member of the East London Stripper’s Collective, says that, with more people entering sex work these days for economic reasons, “we are already in a culture where I think we are quite destigmatised.” Indeed, as the economy becomes ever more precarious, perhaps sex work will soon be seen as a career more viable than, say, journalism.

Roy Ayers, who has died aged 84, would go on to blaze a trail as a vibraphonist, composer, singer and producer.A genre-bending pioneer of hard bop, funk, neo-soul and acid jazz, Ayers was most famous for his feel-good trackEverybody Loves the Sunshine, from the 1976 album of the same name.Hetold the Guardianthat the song was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York on, naturally, a warm summer’s day. Among those who feature are Debbie Darby (credited as “Chicas”) on vocals and Philip Woo on piano, electric piano and synthesiser. Woo explained that Ayers did not like to work from charts or scores, with the song based around a single chord that the band in the studio then developed.While it was never released as a single, Everybody Loves the Sunshine’s warm, jazz-soul sound has won it numerous admirers over the past 50 years. As well as being sampled hundreds of times, by artists including Dr Dre and Mary J Blige, the track has also been covered by musicians ranging from D’Angelo to Jamie Cullen.Perhaps the sheer simplicity of the song’s structure explains its appeal to such a variety of musicians. The hazy chords set up a steady state condition that allows the performer room for manoeuvre. D’Angelo covered the song in sweaty desire; Cullen’s Live in Ibiza version is as light and moreish as your favourite ice-cream; the Robert Glasper Experiment cover is edgy, an exercise in deconstruction. Other notable versions include the electronica-infused track from the DJ Cam Quartet and the modern jazz take of trumpeter Takuya Kuroda.View image in fullscreenAyers at the PDX Jazz festival in Portland, Oregon, February, 2017.Photograph: Anthony Pidgeon/RedfernsAyers was born in the South Park (later South Central) district of Los Angeles, and grew up on Vermont Avenue amid the widely admired Central Avenue jazz scene during the 1940s and 50s, which attracted luminaries such as Eric Dolphy and Charles Mingus. His father, Roy Ayers Sr, worked as a parking attendant and played the trombone. His mother, Ruby, was a piano player and teacher.He attended Thomas Jefferson high school, sang in the church choir, and played steel guitar and piano in a local band called the Latin Lyrics. He studied music theory at Los Angeles City College, but left before completing his studies to tour as a vibraphone – or vibes – sideman.His first album, West Coast Vibes (1963), was produced by the British jazz musician and journalist Leonard Feather. He then teamed up with the flautistHerbie Mann, who produced the “groove” based sound of Virgo Vibes (1967) and Stoned Soul Picnic (1968).Relocating to New York at the start of the 1970s, Ayers formed the jazz-funk ensemble Roy Ayers Ubiquity, recruiting a roster of around 14 musicians. At this time he composed and performed the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Coffy (1973), starring Pam Grier as a vigilante nurse. The Everybody Loves the Sunshine album was released under the Ubiquity rubric, reaching No 51 on the US Billboard charts, but making no impact on the UK charts.His 1978 single Get On Up, Get On Down, however, reached No 41 in the UK. He also scored chart success with Don’t Stop the Feeling (1979), which got to No 32 on the US RnB chart and 56 in the UK. The track was featured on the album No Stranger to Love, whose title track was sampled separately by MF Doom and Jill Scott.Ayers was a regular performer at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club in London during the 80s and his shows there were captured on live albums. Other live recordings include Live at the MontreuxJazzFestival (1972) and Live from West Port Jazz Festival Hamburg (1999). Ayers played at the Glastonbury festival five times, with his last appearance there in 2019.View image in fullscreenAyers, left, with Fela Kuti.

Ayers also performed onWhitney Houston’s Love Will Save the Day (1988); with Rick James on Double Trouble (1992); and with Tyler, the Creator on Cherry Bomb (2015).A soul-funk album, Roy Ayers JID002 (2020), was the brainchild of the producers Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad. The latter was a member of the hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, who had sampled Ayers’ Running Away on their track Descriptions of a Fool (1989), and Roy Ayers Ubiquity’s 1974 song Feel Like Makin’ Love on Keep It Rollin’, from their 1993 Midnight Marauders album.Ayers also collaborated with Erykah Badu on the singer’s second album, Mama’s Gun (2000). The pair recorded a new version of Everybody Loves the Sunshine for what would be Ayers’ final studio album, Mahogany Vibe (2004).“If I didn’t have music I wouldn’t even want to be here,” Ayers told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s like an escape when there is no escape.”Ayers married Argerie in 1973. She survives him, as do their children, Mtume and Ayana, a son, Nabil, from a relationship with Louise Braufman, and a granddaughter.Roy Edward Ayers Jr, musician and band leader, born 10 September 1940; died 4 March 2025Explore more on these topicsMusicJazzSoulobituariesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps that’s one more reason why Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler’s lively 1993 picture bookA Squash and a Squeeze– their first collaboration – remains so well loved. The woes of a little old lady whose house feels too small began asa songDonaldson wrote for television, resulting in the catchy rhythms and rhymes in the book. Now the story has been adapted by Barb Jungr and Samantha Lane, with music and lyrics by Jungr, in a jolly if overstretched hour for children aged three to eight.Lane’s production opens with a wise old man squeezing his way through a squash of young theatregoers to arrive at the lady’s doorstep. Kate Bunce’s set design directly reflects Scheffler’s illustrations and finds a smart solution to presenting a claustrophobic abode on a not particularly titchy stage. What at first looks like a wendy house intermittently spins around, its roof splitting to reveal a three-walled interior. With each farmyard animal that the lady is encouraged to bring in as part of the man’s canny scheme, the house closes up again and mayhem is heard within.View image in fullscreenComical expressions … Mark Esaias and Gilbert Taylor.Photograph: Suzi CorkerThe only downside to that strategy is that we have less time to admire the wonderful puppets designed and made by Maia Kirkman-Richards. There’s a Tabby McTat-esque moggy as well as a handheld hen (eyes as startled as Scheffler’s animals), a goat that is part wheelbarrow, a pig with a barrel for a body and, most ingeniously, a horse constructed with a yoke holding two pails (one including udders). Each creature gets a song and a routine to entice them indoors, with Jungr employing a variety of musical genres including cha-cha-cha, country and disco.Jungr and Lane’s dialogue is merged with the narrator’s voice from the original, not always smoothly, and the new material is often in a minor key compared with Donaldson’s vibrant verse. But the man is winningly presented as a “purveyor of easy-peasy solutions” and the goat wittily puts a “baa” into his bad reputation. A trio of actor-puppeteers, Ruth Calkin, Mark Esaias and Gilbert Taylor, excel in comical expressions and the animals are brought to life with attention to the subtlest movements such as a ruffle of feathers or a cat’s wiggle before leaping.You’d expect the show to milk more from the cow’s tabletop jig and the comedy could be more anarchic. But it’s hard to grumble and grouse when this menagerie are at their most madcap.AtLittle Angel Studios, London, from 8 March to 27 April.

Aged five, the son of two musicians – and by all accounts already showing talent as a pianist – he was famously presented with his first set of vibraphone mallets backstage at a gig by Lionel Hampton. If you wanted to take a romantic view, you could look on that as an act of benediction: the man who had more or less singlehandedly popularised an instrument that had previously been viewed as a novelty passing on the mantle along with his mallets. Hampton had broken racial barriers in the process: at a time when jazz bands were almost entirely segregated, Hampton and pianist Teddy Wilson’s work with Benny Goodman’s quartet was subtly acclaimed by one critic as “the most beautiful example of men working together to be seen in public today”.For a time, it looked as if Ayers was following in Hampton’s footsteps. By the time of his debut album, 1963’s West Coast Vibes, Ayers was clearly carving out a space for himself in the jazz world. Running through versions of Charlie Parker’sDonna Leeor Thelonious Monk’sWell You Needn’t, he was already his own man: a little hotter in his approach to the vibraphone than Milt Jackson, less inclined towards the avant than his friend Bobby Hutcherson.But, as it turned out, playing post-bop standards wasn’t Ayers’ destiny. You could already sense him looking beyond jazz by the late 60s. He started confidently essaying contemporary pop, and seemed to have a particular thing for Laura Nyro’s album Eli and the 13th Confession: her Stoned Soul Picnic provided thetitle trackof his 1968 album;Emmieturned up on 1969’s Daddy Bug, in among bossa nova tunes, and a surprisingly funereal, noir-ish take on Bacharach and David’sThis Guy’s in Love With You.Ayers was just getting started: you could divine a lot from him naming first his 1970 album Ubiquity, then his new band. On their 1972 debut He’s Coming, their music appeared to go everywhere: constantly switching from jazz to soft soul to hard funk to Gil Scott-Heron-ish proto rap, displaying both extraordinarily catholic taste in covers – the Hollies’He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother, I Don’t Know How to Love Him from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s Jesus Christ Superstar – and Ayers’ increasing talent as a songwriter, most notably on the superb, dramatically orchestratedWe Live in Brooklyn, Baby.It was jazz-funk before anyone came up with the phrase – although infinitely tougher and less smooth than the music said phrase later came to encapsulate. What the kind of jazz purist who felt Miles Davis’s Bitches Brew represented a craven capitulation to commerciality made of it can well be imagined, but that really didn’t matter. For the rest of the 70s, Ayers produced one fantastic album after another – Red, Black and Green, Vibrations, his incredible soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film Coffy – gradually honing and homogenising his style until it reached a point of perfection on 1976’sEverybody Loves the Sunshine.If the utterly blissful title track understandably became Ayers’ theme song, it’s ultimately just one moment among many:Hey Uh-What You Say Come On, The Third Eye,Keep on Walking. Its sound was effectively reprised on Come Into Knowledge, the solitary album by RAMP, a sophisticated Cincinnati funk band whose name – an acronym for Roy Ayers Music Productions – told you everything about Ayers’ level of involvement: ignored on release in 1977, its blend of silky, wide-eyed soul and hard-edged funk took on a new lease of life after A Tribe Called Quest sampled one track,Daylight, on their 1990 hitBonita Applebum, adding their names to a faintly mind-boggling list of artists and producers who have plundered Ayers’ back catalogue for beats: Dr Dre, Mary J Blige, J Cole, Tyler, the Creator, J Dilla, Kendrick Lamar, Public Enemy, Erykah Badu, Madlib and Tupac among them. Ayers’ samples are the link between Deee-Lite’sGroove Is in the Heartand NWA’sFuck tha Police; they’re also probably the only thing that MF Doom had in common with the Backstreet Boys.Ayers’ beats are the only thing that MF Doom had in common with the Backstreet BoysAyers was a great bandleader in time-honoured jazz style, capable of attracting incredible musicians (David Bowie pinched both drummer Dennis Davis and guitarist Carlos Alomar from Ayers; after Davis’s departure, Bernard “Pretty” Purdie took over on drums), and spotting talent in its nascent state. He alighted on songwriter Edwin Birdsong when he was a recently demobbed soldier struggling to make his way in New York’s jazz scene; he gave vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater a starring role on the Coffy soundtrack at the start of her career. He was also able to move nimbly with changing times: the sound of disco lurked in the background of Everybody Loves the Sunshine, but on the following year’s Lifeline, he and Birdsong plunged wholeheartedly into the genre, producing one of its indelible classics, the sparklingRunning Away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

But if said detractors thought the direction he was heading in was now obvious, they were in for a shock. Hot on the heels of 1980’s slick Love Fantasy came Music of Many Colours, a collaboration with Fela Kuti consisting of two raw and implausibly thrilling side-long tracks recorded at the end of a joint tour in Africa that perfectly melded Kuti’s Afrobeat and Ayers’ jazz-funk. Its influence continued to course through Ayers’ subsequent albums Africa: Center of the World and 1983’s Lots of Love. He was concurrently producing slinky post-disco for Eighties Ladies and their singer Sylvia Striplin – the latter’s debut solo album Give Me Your Love is a particular delight that, like the RAMP album before it, belatedly became a rare-groove classic. He might have stopped using the Ubiquity name, but his sound was still everywhere.Ayers kept releasing new albums, but never quite regained the commercial form he had found at Ubiquity’s peak, and his output began to slow as the 80s drew to a close. But by then, it scarcely seemed to matter: the attentions of crate-digging producers and DJs alike meant that Ayers’ name was rightly revered by a new generation of artists. His influence hung very heavy indeed over both acid jazz and neo-soul – he worked with Badu and Alicia Keys – and, whatever twists and turns hip-hop took, Ayers’ music always seemed to have a role within it: he turned up alongside Branford Marsalis and Donald Byrd on Guru’s acclaimed solo album Jazzmatazz in 1993, then again 22 years later, in an entirely different rap era, on Tyler, the Creator’s Cherry Bomb, dubbing the latter “a lovely young man”. He toured relentlessly, claiming he wanted to be on stage “until I die”, a feat he very nearly achieved.“Everybody is important,” he reasoned, “so it is important I reach as many people as possible with my voice.” That seems the perfect explanation not just for his constant gigging, but Roy Ayers’ whole, boundary-free musical approach.Explore more on these topicsMusicHip-hopJazzDiscoDance musiccommentShareReuse this content"

She talks about cuppas with Sarah Lancashire and hitting it big in her 50sFri 7 Mar 2025 08.00 ESTShareIt may be one of the most devastating scenes in the history of British television. In the final series ofHappy Valley, Catherine Cawood begins to understand that her sister Clare has betrayed her, and has been lying about where she is. Catherine watches Clare from outside a cafe, then walks in, sits down at Clare’s table and says one iconic word: “Hiya.”Siobhan Finneran, who played Clare for a decade, pops up on my laptop screen. Surely there is only one way to start the conversation. “Hiya,” I deadpan, in my best Sarah Lancashire voice.“Hiya,” Finneran says, cheerfully.“No,” I say, and try again. “Hiya.”She smiles politely. Surely you get “hiya” all the time? “Where’s that from? Benidorm?” she asks.Finneran is perched on a floral sofa, vape in hand. She stopped smoking six months ago, and this has helped keep her off the cigarettes. “Oh, it’s revolting, darlin,” she says. (She says darling a lot, more a northern “darlin” than a luvvie’s “dahling”). Finneran grew up in Oldham and still lives in Saddleworth. “I keep buying the worst ones in the vain hope that I’ll stop. This is called Strawberry Ice.” She giggles. “Absolutely ridiculous. It’s embarrassing asking for them: ‘Two packets of Watermelon Surprise for me.’ Awful!” She’d much rather have a rollie, she admits. “I liked smoking, all day long. So it’s meant I’m not doing that, which is great. But at some point, it will stop. We hope.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d never been the princess’: Siobhan Finneran.Photograph: JF/ITVFromHappy Valleyto Downton Abbey toAlma’s Not Normal, Finneran is a fixture of quality British television. But, amazingly, despite a career so lengthy she had her first role in 1987 and spent nearly a decade in TV sitcom Benidorm, it is only now, in her late 50s, that she is about to get her first top billing in the new ITV thriller Protection. She plays DI Liz Nyles, who runs a witness protection scheme. Can it really be right that this is her first leading role on TV? “Yeah, maybe, darlin. I don’t know. Probably? I’m trying to think. It probably is.” She is clearly not bothered by it. “As long as I can get up and do my job and I can remember my words, that’s really what it’s all about, because I’m much happier, as you always are on a set, working in a team.”I was so gripped by Protection that I was shouting at the screen. It puts practically every character, on all sides of the law, in danger, and refuses to let you trust anyone as deception builds upon deception. “That’s good, if you’re shouting at the telly. I do that all the time. You should go on Gogglebox.” Maybesheshould go onGogglebox. “But I don’t like being on telly other than playing a character. And I’m not sure people need to see me eating bags of Revels and shouting things at the telly.” She likes her private life to be private. Interviews, she says, are “like a form of torture. You haven’t got a character to hide behind. But I’ve got my vape and a glass of water, so I’m all right.”She is happy to talk about acting, though. “Oh, I can talk to you about that, darlin, I can easily talk to you about that,” she says. Her grandmother was a seamstress who loved the theatre. As one of the oldest grandchildren, Finneran would be taken on day trips, getting the train down to the RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon to see whatever was on at the time. “Something must have gone in, or something must have excited me, or there was something I was fascinated by,” she says. She always knew, somehow, that acting was what she’d always wanted to do. “But I didn’t really understand how you got into it.”A careers adviser nudged her towards what was then Oldham Technical College, and its theatre studies A-level course. Jane Horrocks went there. Sarah Lancashire was a couple of years above her. “We did think we were like the kids from Fame. We’d do music, dancing, singing, and then we’d do acting.” She was there for two years, and when she left, did “bog standard jobs” for a while. Through a friend’s mum, she heard about a casting call for a film calledRita, Sue and Bob Too. She was 19 when she got the part of Rita. The now celebrated British film, about a married man who has an affair with two schoolgirls, was written by the lateAndrea Dunbar, who adapted it from her play, and was set and filmed on an estate in Bradford. It was 40 years ago, she points out. “And I can’t remember what I had for my breakfast! I just remember it being a bit of a blur. I was probably terrified every day. It was like another language. It was another world, completely, that I knew nothing about.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m happier on a set, working in a team’: Finneran in Protection.Photograph: Matt SquireFor a long time after that, she didn’t act at all, even though it seems, to the casual observer, as if she’s been working solidly ever since. “That’s a really great myth,” she laughs, good-naturedly. Over the years, she did the soaps (Coronation Street and Emmerdale), plenty of dramas and a handful of earlySally Wainwrightshows. “I’ve only been in work consistently, I would say, for the last 19 years. I’ve done the complete opposite to a lot of people. I hit 40, and started to pick up regular characters, as opposed to three lines as the woman who lives next door, or, you know, a scene as the sister-in-law.”In her 30s, she did turn up as a regular in Paul Abbott’sClocking Off, alongside her old friend Sarah Lancashire, but after that, she had another period of not working. “You sometimes look back and think, yeah, I made a decision not to work when the children were small.” She has two children, now in their late 20s. “But I don’t think I’d made a decision. I think there probably wasn’t a lot of work coming in, and that just fitted in quite brilliantly with the fact that I had two kids under the age of two.”Towards the end of the 00s, that all began to shift. In 2007, Finneran was cast as the mouthy matriarch Janice Garvey in the hit holiday sitcom Benidorm. A couple of years later, she appeared as the vicious housekeeper Sarah O’Brien, a villain of earlyDownton Abbey, where she remained for three series. “People were seeing me playing the wonderful and loud and fabulous Janice Garvey in a comedy, and then they were watching me playing, again, a fabulous, but completely nasty piece of work, Miss O’Brien. I don’t know if people were sitting at home going, oh, she can do that, and she can do a bit of that. That might be what it was.”Does she have any idea why her career took off after she turned 40? “I don’t, really. I’d never been the princess. A lot of the actresses I know were the pretty ones who, from leaving drama school, could play the girlfriend or the pretty sister. I was never in that casting bracket.” But with Benidorm and Downton, she found her feet. “I was just very lucky that those two jobs, that were so very different, were happening around the same time. It’s the luck of the Irish, isn’t it?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My mum’s family were Irish. My mother’s father’s family was Scottish. I am a bit desperate to do one of those … what are they called?” I assume she means the BBC genealogy series, Who Do You Think You Are?, but when I suggest that, she hoots. “No! I do love watching that, and I’m nosy enough to want to find out more about my family. But I mean those DNA tests,” she laughs.In recent years, she has appeared in two knockout shows. She remembers getting the script for the first three episodes ofHappy Valley. “I couldn’t breathe, reading those scripts. I sometimes lose the will to live, reading [scripts], because you just think, whatisthis? That’s me being really brutally honest. But with that, I remember ringing my agent the next day and going; ‘Oh my God, it is fucking brilliant.’” It meant she got to work with Lancashire again. “I love working with Sarah. We have a good time together. And I think that sisters relationship is just so true to life. One minute, they’re literally spitting at each other and the next they’re making each other a cup of tea and having a chat.”And then there was Alma’s Not Normal, in which she plays Lin, Alma’s mother and another long-term addict with mental health issues, who is repeatedly let down by social services and the state. “It’s like I’ve said about Happy Valley: you get a script like that, and you’d have to have some serious holiday booked, or you’d cancel a holiday for that. You just go, this is a work of genius.”She was scared of playing Lin at first, because the character is “very, very big”.“If you think about an unfiltered, unedited six-year-old, it’s sort of that energy. She does say exactly what she thinks about things, and it’s probably what everybody else is thinking. She just says it. She’s honest. And what I love about her is that she’s optimistic,still. She’s still got hope. And you think, how the fuck, when you’ve been treated the way she’s been treated? That’s massively appealing to me, in another human being.”I wonder if Finneran feels optimistic about the gloomy state of British television. Amid budgets cuts and slashed production rates, what does she think the future holds? “I don’t understand that, in terms of the production companies. From my point of view, what I see is really brilliant actor mates of mine who are not getting any work. I’ve never known the industry be as bleak, in terms of that. And I mean people who consistently have worked for the last 30 years, who’ve spent the last two or three years with nothing.” She hopes it will pick up soon. “We’ve been told for the past two years that it was down to the strikes in America, and that next year will be better. Well, we’re now two years on from that, and it doesn’t seem to be picking up. I don’t want to sound like a wanker saying that, because I have had work, so I know there’s stuff being made. But I just know there’s not the quantity of work that was being made maybe even five years ago.”I don’t think you sound like a wanker. “Well, that’s good,” she says. “But it’s tough out there. And for kids starting off now, fucking hell, I don’t know. So many regional theatres closing and all of that.” She pauses, vape still in hand. “We just have to be optimistic, don’t we? We have to be a bit more like Lin. Less editing of ourselves, and far more optimistic about the world.”Protection is on ITV1 and ITVX on16 March.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionHappy ValleyDownton AbbeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From his rise in the underbellies of an early-millennium rap and grime scene, to his mainstream success and songs with the likes of Ed Sheeran and Emeli Sandé, Stormzy and Giggs, he is among the handful of UK rappers who have scaled the heights of the British music scene while maintaining a deep connection to their communities.At 39, Scott is ready to release his seventh album, Home?, a soul-searching record that reflects on his relationship with that word. “I feel like it always moves. I feel like it always changes,” he says of his relationship to “home”. “I’m still trying to put an exact location on it but as it stands it’s more who I’m with. I feel like I could make a home in any house.”More than that, the album is a detailed account of his inner world, and a tender narration on the community that surrounds him. Over its 15 songs, it ruminates on themes of belonging, and on British-Caribbean and Black British history, as well as further commentary on the contemporary climate of the country at large.“I think the word that comes to mind is ‘displacement’,” he says. “For anyone who feels like: ‘I’m here, but am I accepted here? Or am I just tolerated here?’ Anyone who is in the middle of that, this record is for you.”View image in fullscreenWretch 32 on stage at the Reading festival in 2018.Photograph: C Brandon/RedfernsOn the album, home is a two-way street – one existing between a community and its country, as well as a country and its communities.Scott more than most embodies this sentiment. His grandparents – both paternal and maternal – arrived in the UK from Jamaica, settling in north London, a family line starting anew on British soil. Both of his parents were raised in Tottenham. He is the third generation of his family to have called the area home.Activism runs in the family. Growing up, he remembers a sense of communal resistance and care in the household. Both his dad, Millard Scott, and his uncle, Stafford Scott, were renowned in the local area for their community work and advocacy, standing firm in the face of entrenched racism and repression. “My uncles and Dad would be on GMTV before school,” he says. “I remember seeing my gran, my dad and my uncle on London Tonight because they had taken the police to court for harassment and had won.” Formative memories like these meant that from a young age “I was knowing that something’s not right in the system”.As a child there were community activists holding meetings in his front room; he recalls the teachings he received on the likes of Marcus Garvey and the African National Convention, or on apartheid in South Africa, the posters of Muhammad Ali on the walls, and a deep-set understanding of Britain and its relationship to his people being seeded in his mind.“The first thing was understanding it’s a difficult ride for Black people in this country,” he says. “I remember feeling displacement on that level, hearing these conversations with my dad, with my uncles, hearing them talk about injustices, the first Broadwater Farm riots, and the uprisings.”I remember watching my dad on the news and now I’m beside him on London Tonight. It’s not the full circle you would wantEventually, as he grew older and into his own life, he began to experience his own early feelings of displacement, subtle questionings of Britain and his place in it. There were early encounters with the police, being stopped or chased when he was as young as eight, and the occasional screams from passing cars, their passengers telling him to go back to where he came from. “On Black Boy Lane I was caught on my own,” he raps on Black & British, a track from Home? with Little Simz and Benjamin AD, “he told me to go back to my country, I thought I was home.”In the late 00s and early 2010s, years after the first peaks of Dizzee Rascal and Kano, British rappers and MCs began to resurface in pop culture. Wretch 32 was among them, a rare case of an artist who managed to tailor his music for a wider audience without corrupting his reputation. After signing with Ministry of Sound, he released the commercially successful singles Traktor, Unorthodox and Don’t Go, the latter reaching No 1 on the UK singles chart. Emerging into the mainstream changed his fortunes. He moved out of working-class Tottenham to the north London and Hertfordshire hinterland of Barnet. Despite turning music into a viable career, that sense of displacement still followed.“There was less of a community there than there was in Tottenham,” he reflects. “[In Tottenham] I knew all my neighbours. I knew their names; we helped each other out. We held doors, we carried bags for elderly women. When I moved into the gated community in Barnet it wasn’t the case.”The sense of resistance that runs in the family continues today. In 2020, his dad, 62 at the time, was tasered by police, and subsequently fell down the stairs. The Met Police, in a review of the incident, “found no indication of misconduct”. After the footage was posted to social media, London mayor Sadiq Khan called for an urgent review by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Scott appeared on ITV News alongside his father to speak on the incident. His father believed the tasering would not have happened if he were a white man.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s not the full circle you would want but it is [what happened] nevertheless.”Scott was born in 1985, the same year the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham blazed with late-autumn riots after the death of 49-year-old Cynthia Jarrett. She died from heart failure after the police raided her home on suspicion of her son having handled stolen goods.Stafford would write in the Guardian years later: “There was such anger about Cynthia’s death, given the regular harassment local black people faced from the police, that the following day a riot broke out.”This history is carved into the album. Stitched into Home? are voices and echoes from that time gone, catalogued in excerpts from a 1988 documentary titled Scenes from the Farm. Originally aired on Channel 4, the documentary was shot in the aftermath of the riots, capturing the mood and immediate realities of 80s Black Britain on the estate.Scott’s grandma owned a copy on VHS, before accidentally taping over it. It would be years before he would watch it in full, eventually seeing it for the first time when the full piece was uploaded to YouTube. By this time, his grandma had died, her memory only existing in family photos and albums. So, as he watched for the first time, her presence came into full colour. Speaking to the pastor in a scene outside Scott’s baptism, she says: “If I die today I’m just dead, but as long as I know I died to let someone else live …” The scene struck Scott at his core. “To hear her voice was such a big, impactful moment, it was such a feeling. I haven’t heard this voice before. She only existed in family photos.”Home? is a weaving of these realities, of a history extending beyond Wretch 32’s immediate reality. It was a charting of the political, social and cultural forces and history that preceded his entry into the world. In that way, this album, and his wider discography, are an extension of the work and legacy started by the generations of his family who came before him.Home? is out this spring; the single Black and British ft Little Simz is out now.Explore more on these topicsMusicRapHip-hopGrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The couple’s partially mummified bodies were discovered last month at their home in New Mexico.The 95-year-old Hackman may have lived for as long as a week after Arakawa’s death, she said. Officials speculated that he may have been unaware she was deceased.“He was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that’s what resulted in his death,” Jarrell said.The press conference New Mexico authorities held on Friday provided some answers in the mystery of what happened to the couple. Hackman and Arakawa were discovered last week after a maintenance worker, concerned when no one answered the door, contacted neighborhood security, who spotted their bodies through a window and called the police. One of their three dogs was also found dead.The Santa Fe county sheriff’s office said it did not suspect foul play. But officials could not immediately determine what happened to the couple as there were no signs of trauma to their bodies and tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.At the press conference on Friday afternoon, the sheriff, Adan Mendoza, revealed that investigators had been able to piece together Arakawa’s final days and found that she had picked up her dog, who was later found dead nearby, from a veterinary appointment on 9 February and that she had responded to emails and went out shopping on 11 February. The last known activity from Arakawa was that day, the sheriff said.Arakawa’s death was linked to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Exposures occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas.Hackman’s pacemaker last showed activity on 17 February, nine days before maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Officials said it was “reasonable to conclude” that Hackman died around 18 February.Arakawa was found with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on the bathroom counter, while Hackman was found in the home’s entryway.One of the couple’s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed of the dead animal.When they were found, the bodies weredecomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe’s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200ft (2,200 meters).Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including The French Connection, Hoosiers and Superman from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.The couple’s stucco, Pueblo-revival style home sits on a hill in a gated community at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains. Santa Fe is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood’s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

They live in memory and in song, and I dedicate this to him. If You Hadn’t Been There.”The couple had been married for nearly six decades after tying the knot in a small ceremony in Georgia in 1966.They met outside the Wishy Washy Laundromat on the same day that Parton moved to Nashville at 18 to pursue her music career full-time. Parton told NPR in 2008 that she wrote the song Jolene about a flirty bank teller who seemed to take an interest in him.Dean, a businessman who had owned an asphalt-paving business in Nashville, largely remained out of the spotlight of his wife’s glowing success.In 1984, the two-time Oscar nominee and 10-time Grammy winner told the Associated Press: “A lot of people say there’s no Carl Dean, that he’s just somebody I made up to keep other people off me.”On Thursday, three days after her husband’s death, Parton wrote that she was sharing a “love note to family, friends and fans”.She added: “Thank you for all the messages, cards and flowers that you’ve sent to pay your respect for the loss of my beloved husband, Carl. I can’t reach out personally to each of you but just know it has meant the world to me.”“He is God’s arms now and I am OK with that. I will always love you.”In 2023, she released the album Rockstar, which included collaborations with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Elton John and Sting. At the time, Parton said that Dean had enjoyed the record, which featured new versions of some of his favourite songs.Alongside her singing career, Parton has also starred in films such as 9 to 5, Steel Magnolias and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.Her tracks 9 to 5 and Travelin’ Thru, from the film Transamerica, were nominated for Academy Awards, while Jolene and I Will Always Love You have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.Explore more on these topicsDolly PartonCountrynewsShareReuse this content"

A statement posted to his official Facebook page called him “one of the true pioneers of music”. No cause of death was shared.His Damned bandmate Captain Sensible, AKA Raymond Burns, shared a tribute on X: “We’re shocked to hear that creator of the Damned, our great chum Brian James, has sadly gone. A lovely bloke that I feel so lucky to have met all those years ago and for some reason chose me to help in his quest for the music revolution that became known as punk.”James wrote the first British punk single, New Rose – released five weeks before the Sex Pistols’ Anarchy in the UK – and was the lead songwriter on the band’s debut album, Damned Damned Damned, which was released in February 1977.That November, James left the group after the release of their second album, the poorly received Music for Pleasure, and pursued several solo groups, including the Lords of the New Church, who released three albums in the 1980s.James was born Brian Robertson in Hammersmith, London, in February 1955. After playing in the proto-punk band London SS alongside future Clash member Mick Jones, he formed the Damned with singer Dave Vanian, bassist Captain Sensible and drummer Rat Scabies in 1976.Captain Sensibleexpanded on his post on Facebook, recalling that when James was recruiting bandmates, he instituted short hair as a rule – “a radical departure from the mid-70s hippy look” – and had such a “blistering technique” on guitar that he persuaded Sensible to switch to bass.“The next couple of years were a pretty wild ride but Brian’s vision of a music revolution had been absolutely spot on … and boy do I feel lucky that he chose me cos I had no plan B if the music game failed.”They played their first gig in July 1976, as support to the Sex Pistols at the 100 Club in London. The Pistols’ manager Malcolm McLaren kicked them off a subsequent support tour.The Damned: how we made New RoseRead moreAfter departing the group, James collaborated with Iggy Pop as a member of his touring band. Stewart Copeland of the Police performed on his first two solo singles, Ain’t That a Shame from 1979, and Why? Why? Why? from 1982.In 2000, James joined forces with Copeland, Wayne Kramer of MC5, Duff McKagan of Guns N’ Roses and Clem Burke of Blondie as the Racketeers for the album Mad for the Racket.In 2013, he re-recorded his Damned material for a solo album, Damned If I Do, and toured the record with Rat Scabies (AKA Christopher Millar). In 1988 and 2022, the original members of the Damned reunited for a UK tour.James is survived by his wife, Minna, and son Charlie.Explore more on these topicsMusicPunkPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

In this solo(ish) triple bill, Royal Ballet principalNatalia Osipovasteps into the shoes of two great female icons of modern dance, Martha Graham and Isadora Duncan, perhaps absorbing some of their pioneering spirit along the way.In Graham’s Errand Into the Maze, Osipova is quelling demons – explicitly Marcelino Sambé’s Minotaur, but inner ones too – with the power of her mighty ankle-to-ear kicks. It is a dance of strength and sharp accents, geometry and gravity, and Osipova’s character simmers with power as well as trepidation. Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan is a homage by Frederick Ashton, presented here in a new film by Grigory Dobrygin, spiritedly shot and beautifully lit. A handheld camera chases Osipova under a flowing chiffon scarf, capturing her giddiness and wild freedom while closeup detail sees the vulnerability at heart. The voluptuousness of the movement is womanly but there’s a childlike quality too, in its abandon and in the certainty of one’s own presence at the centre of the world. It’s a film that does the ballet justice.View image in fullscreenQuelling demons … Osipova with Marcelino Sambé in Martha Graham’s Errand Into the Maze.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianNatalia’s night: Royal Ballet puts the spotlight on Osipova – in picturesRead moreSo that’s the first half of Osipova’s offering. The second half diverges eccentrically from the historical into something of right now. Jo Strømgren is a Norwegian choreographer, playwright and director whose The Exhibition is a piece of comic dance theatre. Two people arrive in a gallery: a well-groomed Osipova and the scruffier Christopher Akrill. She speaks Russian, he English. There’s mischief and misunderstanding and the two are drawn into an odd relationship which is hampered and enhanced by their inability to understand each other.You never know where the piece is going, but it engagingly dances around themes of connection, prejudice, art and beauty, and what the body can and cannot say. Even if you can’t understand Osipova’s words there is a naturalism and cheeky character to her animated chatter. We know she’s a good dance-actor, but speech is something different. It’s a surprising swerve for Osipova, a statement about who she is, or might want to be as a performer. It’s a triple bill that honours past legends while telling us that Osipova is determined to be her own artist.At theLinbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, until 10 MarchExplore more on these topicsDanceNatalia OsipovaRoyal BalletRoyal Opera HouseBalletreviewsShareReuse this content"

Composed of an all-Native cast, it ruminated on power, storytelling, dispossession, erasure and historical memory. The novel’s off-the-wall structure placed its central event – a mass shooting at an Oakland powwow – at the book’s end, leaving its aftermath largely unattended.Now comes an emotionally incandescent and structurally riveting second novel, Wandering Stars. A companion to There There, it brings news about Orvil Red Feather, who was hit by a bullet while dancing at the event. It tells, too, the story of Orvil’s younger brothers Loother and Lony; their great-aunt Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield, in whose care they have been since losing their drug-addicted mother to suicide; and Jacquie Red Feather, Opal’s half-sister and the boys’ estranged “real grandma”, a recovering alcoholic.Wandering Stars asks: what becomes of a person and a family when the things they inherit from their forebears are overwhelmingly the bad stuff – wounds and torments, ill luck, curses and injurious predilections? What kind of life is possible after genocide and colonisation? Toni Morrison once said: “A writer’s life and work are not a gift to mankind; they are its necessity.” Hyperbole be damned: Orange’s work feels, to me, as vital as air.Yagnishsing Dawoor£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseCrime fictionNot-to-be-missed treatDown Cemetery RoadMick HerronDown Cemetery RoadMick HerronNot-to-be-missed treatIf you’re one of the many who love Mick Herron’s Jackson Lamb novels, but missed his previous series, starring the Oxford-based private investigator Zoë Boehm, never fear: the first in the sequence and Herron’s debut, Down Cemetery Road, is about to be adapted by Apple TV (starring Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson). Handily, it’s being reissued by its publisher and is a not-to-be-missed treat.This novel is less about Zoë than her partner, Joe, who is called on by an Oxford housewife, Sarah, to investigate when a house on her street explodes, killing two adults. Sarah becomes obsessed with what has happened to their young daughter, as no one else seems interested, and asks Joe to help. “I won’t lie. Philip Marlowe, I’m not. But who is? Most of what I’m hired to do, I manage,” he tells her. As they dig deeper, they discover all sorts of nefarious government goings-on (this is Mick Herron, after all), and we see a side of Sarah she’d previously kept hidden. “Inside, Sarah was storms and hurricanes. Twisters. Summer madness.” Herron’s incisive portraits, of everyone from Sarah’s awful husband, Mark, to her hippy friend, Wigwam, are as pitch perfect as ever, and even if you’ve read this series before, it’s worth reminding yourself of its excellence.Alison Flood£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseAutobiographyVoice of the leftA Woman Like MeDiane AbbottA Woman Like MeDiane AbbottVoice of the leftThere is a sense of poetic justice in seeing Diane Abbott back in parliament after the 2024 election. She is now Mother of the House – the title given to the longest serving female MP – and all those who plotted to block her from standing must watch as she receives the respect she deserves. After enduring so much racism, and at a time of few political wins for the left, we have to ask: how did Abbott end up having the last laugh?Her autobiography offers some clues. Born to working-class Jamaican parents in 1953, she was clearly always both strong-willed and intellectually gifted. Which is not to say she didn’t have to work hard: early signs of her determination include insisting to her teachers that she apply to Cambridge, swotting up on Latin for the entrance exam, and beating considerable odds by winning a place from her state school. After graduation she entered the Home Office as part of the civil service fast stream, and made history in 1987 as the first Black woman MP.But this book is far more than just a list of her achievements. Inside its pages are 70 years of Black British history, and four decades of political ups and downs, encompassing Thatcher, Kinnock, Blair, Brown, Corbyn, and Starmer. Among other things she recounts how the left took charge of the Greater London Council under Ken Livingstone, the New Cross house fire in 1981 and the organising across the Black community that followed, as well as resistance to the Iraq war. History, they say, is written by the victors. But as this book and Abbott’s career show – history, as written by the underdogs, can be powerfully inspiring.Faiza Shaheen£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA history of violenceA Very Private SchoolCharles SpencerA Very Private SchoolCharles SpencerA history of violenceMaidwell Hall school, Northamptonshire, 1972. The chief abuser is the headmaster, Jack Porch, who keeps two canes in his study, the Flick and the Switch, and patrols the school dorms at night in hope of catching pupils talking – in which case, he’ll pull any culprits over his knee and whack them with a slipper. Next comes Mr Maude, who forces boys to swim even if they can’t, with one victim – hauled from the bottom of the pool - needing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and who beats Charles Spencer with a cricket boot, its metal spikes puncturing his skin. And then there’s the hulking teacher whose signet ring draws blood when he thumps Spencer round the head, the trickles drying invisibly in the boy’s thick red hair.Such was life in the private boarding school to which Spencer was admitted at the age of eight and which was so traumatising that it has taken him till now, after years of therapy, to record the damage. The tone is fervid. He has talked to many other Maidwell ex-pupils who still bear the scars of their years in an upper-class prison camp staffed by bullying paedophiles.Charles Spencer was one of the Queen’s godchildren and there may be readers who assume that the world he describes (servants, country houses, deep pockets) must have cushioned the impact of his traumas.

When she inherited some money from the sale of her parents’ house in China after they both died of cancer, Guo begins looking for a place to live and work on the South Coast of England. Having lived in London, she missed “the salty wind, the contour of shorelines, and the ceaseless changing waves in the viewfinder of my eyes”.Guo eventually settled on “rain-stained dilapidated” Hastings, which she describes as “a cursed place but, at the same time, sexy, mysterious and somehow quintessentially English”. Her modest requirements are a “sea view and a tub” in which “to soak my body in the endless cold English evenings”. She moves into the tiny top-floor flat in December 2021.Divided into the four seasons, the book is an account Guo’s first year in a run-down part of the seaside town. Discovering a copy of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in a second-hand bookshop, she also buries herself in the ancient history of the area. Aware that the locals seem uninterested in their city’s remote past, she wonders why she, “a Chinese immigrant to Europe, a woman with neither power not any Western ancestry”, should care about the fate of King Harold or the invasion of the Normans in 1066. After visiting a re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings (“a strange and wonderful idea”), she concludes that a country that is able to view a great defeat from its past as an entertainment for families, reveals a detachment from its history that would be unimaginable in China: “I must admit that this is one of the good qualities the British have.”As well as exploring Anglo-Saxon history, Guo describes the challenges of her new life, such as renovating the cold and damp flat, as well as the pleasures, including walks in the countryside to gather wild garlic for cooking and visits from her partner and 9-year-old child, Moon, who collects shells on the beach. Her chronicle of life in Hastings with its “loudly crying seagulls” becomes a wonderfully evocative meditation on migration, history, war (two months after she moves in, Putin invades Ukraine, which she compares to the Norman Conquest), and politics (after the third prime minister in a year, she concludes “the country which I have adopted as my home cannot be saved”). \nGuo’s delightfully frank and often moving memoir is also a poignant exploration of identity and belonging. At one point she memorably compares herself to a jasmine seed blown in the wind: “we drift and then we land somewhere, we try to grow in its soil…We either germinate or turn into dust.”PD Smith£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseSocietyThe human impacts of AICode DependentMadhumita MurgiaCode DependentMadhumita MurgiaThe human impacts of AIWhat’s in the box? That’s the question almost everyone that Madhumita Murgia speaks to seems to be asking. If the “black box” of the algorithm is going to make critical decisions about our health, education or human rights, it would be nice to know exactly what it contains. So long as it remains a mystery, what can you do if you find your child added to a list of potential future criminals based on flawed, even racist, data, as happened to hundreds of families in the Netherlands in the late 2010s?It’s these Kafkaesque absurdities, and how they play out on a human level, that interest Murgia, the Financial Times’s first artificial intelligence editor. Code, she reminds us several times in this troubling book, is not neutral.This book, shortlisted for the Women's Prize for nonfiction 2024, isn’t a story about ChatGPT and the other large language models and their looming impact on everything from Hollywood to homework, though there is a bit of that. Instead, it’s an account of how the everyday algorithms we have already learned to live beside are changing us.There is a little optimism. Murgia – a former Wired writer – is alive to the potential of AI to improve health outcomes. And we meet people such as Hiba, whose family, refugees from Falluja, in Iraq, used their work as data labourers to fund a new life in Bulgaria. There are also cheering stories of how frustration at being exploited has led to gig economy workers quietly organising – even in China – to regain some of the autonomy they have sacrificed at “the altar of the algorithm”.But the bass note here is pessimistic. We are way past the techno-boosterism of the early 00s, and, for every government official wondering how AI can help them streamline health and welfare services, there are thousands of people asking whether it will allow them to continue making a living. Worse than that, as in the Chinese government’s facial recognition systems and pre-emptive detention lists in Xinjiang, it’s the story of a dystopia we are already living in.Will Dean£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionTales of the countryMona of the ManorArmistead MaupinMona of the ManorArmistead MaupinTales of the countryA decade ago, Armistead Maupin boldly declared that it was over. The Days of Anna Madrigal, the ninth in his illustrious queer novel cycle Tales of the City, was, he claimed, the last outing for the residents of 28 Barbary Lane. But ever since the first of the Tales was published in 1978, the lure of the “logical family” has proved irresistible. Maupin is back with a tenth instalment. How tuneful is this unexpected encore?This iteration of the Tales is set in the early 1990s, and helmed by Anna Madrigal’s daughter Mona Roughton (previously Mona Ramsey). She has inherited Easley House in the Cotswolds – based on the real Stanway House in Gloucestershire – after the death of her gay husband Lord Teddy Roughton. Domineering Mona is a riff on the eccentric lord of the manor figure: a weed-smoking, fiery-haired diva who, by her own admission, “tends to bring a water cannon to a gunfight”. While Mona and her mother share the same kindness, self-possession and generosity of spirit, Mona is a much larger than life incarnation of these traits.For all its colourful ribaldry and appealing warmth, some aspects of the narrative are less successful. I found the fleeting treatment of significant plot moments odd, and the tendency for set pieces to be heavily prefaced is puzzling. The ending, too, falls curiously flat, with the long-trailed high drama of the midsummer party fizzling out within a few pages.But perhaps that’s taking this knowingly unserious novel too seriously? Good-natured and entertaining enough, intent as it is on highlighting the importance of pleasure, Mona of the Manor is really an extra little gift for Maupin’s fans – and it will delight them.Michael Donkor£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionBravura portrait of a football tragedyMunichsDavid PeaceMunichsDavid PeaceBravura portrait of a football tragedyWhy the plural? There’s only one Munich in David Peace’s new novel, and we see very little of it: the slushy runway where British European Airways flight 609 crashes on February 6, 1958; the hotel room where two survivors spend their first bewildered night; the hospital where their fellow passengers recover – or don’t. This is surely the story of one accident, one time, one team: the air crash that killed 23 out of 44 passengers, including eight of Manchester United’s players, three of its staff, and eight journalists.But Peace’s reasoning becomes clear over the several hundred pages of this relentless, electrifying, harrowing novel. The Munich Air Disaster, so integral a part of how the football club developed, and which had such a profound impact on the city, the north of England, the sporting community and the country as a whole, might easily not have happened had takeoff been aborted. And what would the world look like then?Like much of Peace’s work, Munichs is an obsessional study in hauntology; not merely the idea that the past lives with us, but that multiple futures do, too. In extremis, time may seem to stop, but in reality, it judders on regardless, bringing with it, in this case, a grotesque juxtaposition of funerals and fixtures.Peace has explained that Munichs was written after the death of his father, who had suggested he pay attention to the events of February 1958. Born in 1967, Peace experienced these events and their wider context only as memory and retelling, to which he has now, valuably and valiantly, added his own.Alex Clark£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA wild weekend in New LagosLittle RotAkwaeke EmeziLittle RotAkwaeke EmeziA wild weekend in New LagosAkwaeke Emezi’s singularly menacing new novel opens with an ending – that of Aima and Kalu’s relationship. Now, it is “all small talk, nothing she could hold with both hands, meaningless chatter that avoided the truth of what they had both become”. Little Rot, like all Emezi’s books – from their debut novel Freshwater to their memoir Dear Senthuran – measures the difficult push and pull between the self and the world.Kalu drops Aima at the airport on a Friday evening. Their four-year relationship is over and they choose to go their separate ways: Aima to a high-society nightclub with her best friend, and Kalu to his childhood friend Ahmed’s exclusive sex party. Two Nigerian sex workers visiting from Kuala Lumpur and a celebrity pastor known as Daddy O enter the storyline, upending everything. What unspools is a dizzying, harrowing and entertaining journey as the characters’ fates collide. Mistakes are made, morals are questioned. Did their relationship ever have a solid foundation or was it resting on shaky ground? The stakes are high and the consequences are serious. In this world, everything comes at a price, and there’s a price to pay for every choice.Little Rot is about hypocrisy, toxic masculinity and sexual cruelty. It is a novel oozing with dirty secrets and ugly reveals. The deliberately outrageous tone is not for the faint-hearted: enter at your own peril. Emezi is here to shred the facade of society, to unsettle and subvert rules and beliefs.Sana Goyal£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionLife in exileThe MorningsideTéa ObrehtThe MorningsideTéa ObrehtLife in exileOn Island City, which may be, or may once have been, Manhattan, in a once-luxurious apartment block called The Morningside, an 11-year-old girl watches and learns about the community she lives in while yearning to discover more about the community she comes from.Silvia and her family – her mother and her aunt, Ena, the superintendent of the block – are refugees from an unnamed country whose traditions and myths they carry with them in revealingly different ways. Ena treasures the past and revisits it, preserving artefacts and telling folk tales from the old country, while Silvia’s mother, who has her own reasons to want to leave everything behind, is against reminiscing and discourages her daughter’s questions about her father, her family and life in the old country.As Obreht draws them, aunt and mother represent the two ways of navigating exile, holding on and letting go: “If the past had previously felt like a forbidden room briefly glimpsed as my mother was shutting its door, here was Ena, holding the door wide.” But because Obreht’s characters are so vibrant and individualised, they are never ciphers for particular ways of being. In this novel, letting go and holding on have more in common than we – and the characters – think.Obreht is a novelist of great skill and warmth, for whom the ancient forms of storytelling – folk tales, myths and legends – retain all their capacity to explain and mystify, soothe and terrify.Patrick McGuinness£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseScienceHow animals communicateThe Voices of NatureNicolas MathevonThe Voices of NatureNicolas MathevonHow animals communicateIn this remarkable study, Nicolas Mathevon – a professor of neurosciences and animal behavior at the University of Saint-Etienne – explores the voices of the natural world, from crocodile calls and bird song, to the “tchik-tchik-tchik” of cicadas. His specialism is bioacoustics, which attempts to understand how animals make and hear sounds, as well as what information these sounds contain and what this is used for. It’s challenging for the general reader to understand the subject, as our vocabulary for describing the biophonic world is less rich than it is for the visual world. But Mathevon succeeds brilliantly in bringing his subject vividly alive, using a mix of evocative writing and lucid scientific explanation. His website also provides helpful recordings of the animal sounds and the book itself is charmingly illustrated by his father.Each chapter explores a different soundscape and the animals that contribute to it, revealing how their voices have evolved to help them survive in that environment as part of “the great concert of life”. From Mediterranean scrubland and rainforests, to the extremes of the Arctic (“the most hostile environment I’ve ever been in”), animals use the sound-transmitting properties of air or water to communicate, in order “to find a partner, to defend a territory, to signal the presence of a predator or food source, to collaborate in hunting, and to recognize and interact with members of the group”.He shows that their communications are comparable to our own, though our articulated language reveals an extraordinary complexity, reflecting the unprecedented range of our social interactions. Nevertheless, he argues that animal communications can indeed be described as a language, albeit not a single one: there are, he says, as many languages as there are animals using sounds to exchange information.Mathevon’s book reveals the often-ground-breaking experiments he and his fellow bioacousticians have conducted to decipher the meanings of the signals in animal sounds and how this relates to their behaviour. One of these experiments involved working in a Brazilian swamp to study the communications between jacaré caiman mothers and their young, research which involved catching a newborn caiman. However, Mathevon is seemingly unfazed by the risks he took for this experiment, noting drily: “we made it out in one piece and got good recordings”. His survey of this intriguing field offers a fascinating insight into the dedication and ceaseless curiosity of the scientific mind, and Mathevon’s enthusiasm for the “worlds of sound” that surround us is certainly contagious.PD Smith£18 (RRP £20) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

The narrator has found refuge from the dangerous wastelands behind the walls of a repurposed monastery, ruled over by a whip-wielding Superior Sister on behalf of an unseen, nameless “He”. Only young, unblemished women are allowed to join the Sacred Sisterhood; they begin as the Unworthy, but hope to be Chosen, although this means they will be mutilated – eyes sewn shut, tongue removed, eardrums pierced – to serve as conduits to the hidden God. Little is said about the tenets of this new religion, beyond its need to punish. The flagellations and bloodlettings are all too familiar from De Sade and other perverse fantasies, and while there is some very fine writing, it is most affecting when the narrator recalls memories from before her arrival; despite its serious themes, the faux-religious set-up feels too contrived to convince.View image in fullscreenDissolutionby Nicholas Binge (HarperVoyager, £16.99)Maggie is in her 80s and has been losing her beloved husband to memory loss over the years. She is offered unexpected hope by a radical new process that could allow her to connect her mind to his, to retrieve their shared memories. If that works, she will have to dive deeper in search of a discovery he made before she knew him; a secret about the workings of memory that could restore him to her. But there are those who want the secret to remain hidden, and Maggie does not know who she can trust. This twisty, absorbing thriller is both a moving love story and fascinating speculative fiction exploring memory, time and reality.View image in fullscreenThe RiverHas Rootsby Amal El-Mohtar (Arcadia, £14.99)The solo debut from the co-author of This Is How You Lose the Time Waris the tale of two sisters, living near the magical river that flows between Arcadia (also known as Faerie) and England. Since childhood they have sung to the willows that grow along its banks and are especially prized for basket-weaving. One sister loves tragic ballads and the other prefers riddling songs, but they are devoted to one another, and their voices in harmony are stronger and more beautiful than either singing alone. When one is not only wooed by a local man, but attracts the interest of a mysterious, shape-shifting being from beyond the border lands, how will this affect their bond? A pitch-perfect story of love and sacrifice, yearning and discovery, like a classic folk tale, but freshly minted.View image in fullscreenWhen the Moon Hits Your Eye by John Scalzi (Tor, £20)The absurd premise of this science fictional jape has our familiar moon suddenly replaced by a gigantic cheese ball. Scalziexplores the idea with as much scientific scaffolding as possible, but mostly with jokes and great good humour, aiming to show how ordinary Americans, whether working for Nasa or behind the counter in a specialist cheese shop, might respond to such an inexplicable change to known reality. The author is clearly an optimist. Except for one narcissistic billionaire, the characters are sympathetic, sane and exceptionally rational, normal folks trying to keep their lives on track. Often very funny and occasionally moving, this is a welcome bit of comic relief.View image in fullscreenThe Foot on the Crownby Christopher Fowler (Bantam, £20)The final novel by the late author of the Bryant & May series is a giddy, violent romp through an imaginary dark ages, set in an enormous castle fortress called Londinium, ruled by a grotesque warrior king known as “the Great Wound” whose attempts to get his daughter married off incite the war that will end his reign. Most of the characters meet a hideous death, or narrowly escape one, as a lost chapter of London’s forgotten early history unfolds. It might have benefited from a few revisions, but this coda to his career is an exuberant entertainment.Explore more on these topicsBooksScience fiction booksFantasy booksFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hunchback fits gloriously into the former. A debut novel, it won the Akutagawa prize, Japan’s most prestigious literary award, and has beenlonglisted for the International Booker; it is translated by Polly Barton, who also translated last year’s potboiler feminist hit,Butterby Asako Yuzuki.It begins with a titillating story about a visit to a sex club, written by our narrator, Shaka, from her room in the care home set up by her parents. She has never been to a sex club. The care home is named, with some irony, Ingleside, after the house Anne of Green Gables lives in with her husband and children. Shaka has myotubular myopathy: her spine is S-shaped and therefore, she says, her life is too, unable to follow the conventions of Japanese society which “works on the understanding that disabled people don’t exist”.When not taking online university courses or writing sex journalism, she tweets things she believes no one will see – “I’d like to know what it’s like to have an abortion”, “In another life, I’d like to work as a high-class prostitute” and “I want to do the job in swingers’ clubs where you get to scatter condoms from the ceiling.” Most of her needs are taken care of; she donates the money she makes from sex writing, so that families can have “furikake to sprinkle on … rice so then it’d feel like a meal”. And the work is not entirely selfless. As Shaka notes, “I went to the toilet and changed my pantyliner, where writing the sex scene had left its trace in strings of see-through liquid.”Ichikawa uses the vantage point of her disability for a particular insight into human natureEveryone deserves a little sprinkling of furikake, of joy and flavour, is the novel’s easy-to-get-on-board-with philosophy; but when Shaka tries to apply this philosophy to her own needs, things go darkly awry. A male careworker, Tanaka, hints that he’s been reading her tweets and erotic stories. A “beta male”, he tells her of his own (financial) disadvantages. She offers him money to have sex with her. Both have power and are powerless, and, in different ways, hold each other in contempt. Is Shaka’s goal orgasm, an abortion or true annihilation? The sex act she chooses hints at the final option.In Barton’s deft translation, a man who visits a brothel resembles “a lanky minion” and phlegm is “like green olive oil”. Faced with a real live penis, Shaka “had the urge to cut a long strip of flavoured nori to size and stick it on top, to serve as the censoring black bars that I was used to” from erotic manga. Sex for Shaka is mediated through pornography instead of emotion, as it is for many people now. This may be unpalatable for some readers, but the prevalence of porn is discussed with a mischievous and nihilistic humour.There are rants against the fetishisation of bookshops and physical books, which are cumbersome and difficult to handle for someone with Shaka’s disability. There are asides on Wagner and his complexes about height, on David Lynch and the disability activist Tomoko Yonezu, who sprayed paint at the Mona Lisa when it was on loan in Tokyo to protest against the fact that people with disabilities had restricted access. The novel asks us which is more important: access to culture or to sexual expression? And, like all good fiction, it doesn’t provide a straight answer.Ichikawa uses the vantage point of her disability for a particular insight into human nature, but we mustn’t condescend to call this novella autobiographical. Its structure – beginning and ending with a story, the latter possibly written by the narrator, possibly not – would tease us if we do.Hunchback by Saou Ichikawa, translated by Polly Barton, is published by Penguin (£10.99).

Shirley has told us about her irritating neighbour Gillian, a master at one-upmanship, when unexpectedly she receives a gift from her. Far from thinking herself superior to Shirley, Gillian turns out to be awestruck. Not only that, but she fully believes the lie that the 42-year-old mother of two is about to elope with a lover.Equally marvellous is the way Helen Carter plays this twist. As she takes on board the way the other woman perceives her, she transforms before us. She grows younger. Some of the weight of midlife drudgery lifts. She sparkles and glows. In Russell’s voyage of self-discovery, she is becoming herself. Goodbye Mrs Bradshaw, hello Shirley Valentine.In Liverpool, this packs a special punch. The comedy premiered at the Everyman nearly 40 years ago and has now been revived to round off the theatre’s 60th anniversary year. In a programme note, the playwright remembers the terror of driving past a gigantic sign reading “Opening March 86 – new play by Willy Russell” before he had written a word.View image in fullscreenBecoming herself … Carter in Shirley Valentine.Photograph: Andrew AB PhotographyDuly, the jokes about finding a squat in Childwall, meeting Liverpool poetAdrian Henri(or Henry Adrian, as Shirley has it), and suffering culture shock on a trip to Chester get a happy laugh of recognition. And Carter has the absolute measure of Russell’s Merseyside rhythms, her manner at once brash and funny. Jokes are a survival tool but laughing is a sign of weakness.But although rooted in the city, the play reaches far beyond it in its humanist appeal. This is a play for anyone who has felt their youthful ideals slipping away. “Why do you get all this life if it can’t be used?” says Shirley, taking control.In Stephen Fletcher’s finely calibrated production, Carter draws the audience towards her in a warm, generous performance, majestic not only in its big laughs but in its contrasting moments of vulnerability and tender sentiment – followed, of course, by even bigger laughs.At theEveryman, Liverpool, until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreEveryman theatreWilly RussellComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s an upmarket establishment that looks down its nose at the council-run care home at the bottom of the hill. While giving a tour of the premises, the supervisor, Mrs McBryde, tells a prospective new client: “We don’t vegetate at Hill Topp. And the cuisine is not unadventurous. It’s not long since we had a Norwegian evening.”Certainly, there are unusual goings-on among these senior citizens, several of whom are treated to “services that [are] hardly detergent” in the cycle shed courtesy of Gus, the window cleaner. Then there is compulsive flasher Mr Woodruff, the oldest resident, who is of the opinion that there is “an etiquette to indecent exposure. It must not be clumsy”, and is irked when incontinence pads hinder his display. Elsewhere, residents bicker and spend “long and phlegm-flecked” afternoons doing jigsaws or watching television in the Library, a room that, despite its name, has no books.Familiar Bennett themes of infirmity, mortality and quietly subversive urges underpin this tale, which is narrated by its 90-year-old author, the mordant humour of the prose evident in his gently sardonic if now somewhat frail tones. When word of a new virus reaches Hill Topp, few take it seriously, with Mrs McBryde calling it “some silliness off the television”.But as the death toll grows, the residents face both a troubling new reality and a thrilling release from the dreary order of their days.Available via Faber, 1hr 53minFurther listeningCharacter Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed TwitterKate Conger and Ryan Mac, Penguin Audio, 15hr 20minEdoardo Ballerini narrates this account of Musk’s takeover of the social media platform now called X, and its subsequent descent into chaos.Unfortunately, She Was a NymphomaniacJoan Smith, William Collins, 9hr 2minA feminist history of Rome’s imperial women by the author of the 1989 classic Misogynies.

That is, until the bebop revolutionaries of the 1940s started blowing impromptu ideas that often sounded better than the pop songs whose chords they borrowed. Post-1960s, free improvisation took themes and variations on epic, extemporised journeys that sometimes never returned to their starting point.Michael Wollny, the 46-year-old German pianist/composer, has long been familiar with the implications of that rapid evolution, and his powerful decade-old trio with David Bowie’s Blackstar bassist Tim Lefebvre and punk-to-postbop drummer Eric Schaefer has become one of the world’s most skilfully free-thinking contemporary jazz groups.View image in fullscreenMichael Wollny Trio: Living GhostsNow comes the exceptional Living Ghosts, a live recording of one night on tour in Germany in 2024 that shows just why Wollny refers to the group’s recent concerts as “seances where the ghosts of the trio’s songbook visit us at their will”. There’s no setlist, no agreed arrangements or forethought about which tunes might be made to segue into each other or for how long. Two night-themed miniatures by Alban Berg and Paul Hindemith are recast in racing solo piano streams, bowed-bass sweeps, a tramping rock-drums pulse, and then flat-out postbop over Lefebvre’s fast bass-walk.The harmonic implications (though only barely the tune) of Duke Ellington’s In a Sentimental Mood give way to the lovely pop-song melody of Jon Brion’s ballad Little Person. A warp-speed treatment of Nick Cave’s Hand of God ascends to a tumult of mercurial piano runs over a marching drum pulse before hymnal harmonies turn it into Guillaume de Machaut’s Lasse! A one-off rammed with surprises, but of the kind that bear plenty of repeated listening on what already sounds like a 2025 standout.Listen on Apple Music or on SpotifyAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

Lechner’s rapturous long tones and Holland’s darting counterpoint against Brahem’s nimble urgency and Bates’s attentive piano figures create a restlessly beautiful soundscape – deeply affected, as Brahem stresses, by the disaster of Gaza.The unique German/Afghan singerSimin Tander’s The Wind (Jazzland Recordings), a mix of originals and Pashto and European traditionals, draws on her tender ballad delivery, wild, wordless improv and percussive exhalations, while Norwegian-Indian violinist Harpreet Bansal and electric bass and drums often kick up hard-grooving storms. And that idiosyncratically inventive UK pianist/composerElliot Galvinis joined by bassist Ruth Goller, drummer Seb Rochford, Shabaka Hutchings and strings onThe Ruin (Gearbox Records), a cyclical electro-acoustic work inspired by his early recordings on an old family piano, and morphed into a trip of typically quirky revelations.Explore more on these topicsMusicJazz album of the monthJazzreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s colourful, musical business as usual, with Auli’i Cravalho’s ebullient Polynesian navigator Moana setting off into the blue to seek a drowned island – cursed by bad-tempered storm deity Nalo – whose revival will reconnect all the scattered ocean peoples. Dwayne Johnson as demigod Maui vies for the comic foil position with her pet pig and hapless rooster, and it’s good to see the coconut pirates back in fighty form. Gods and monsters abound, with Nalo clearly being positioned as the Thanos of the series.Simon WardellWednesday 12 March, Disney+The French DispatchView image in fullscreenWhimsical … (from left) Anjelica Bette Fellini, Pablo Pauly, Bill Murray and Elisabeth Moss in The French Dispatch.Photograph: © Searchlight PicturesArguably themost Wes Andersonyof all Wes Anderson’s films, this whimsical doll’s house of a comedy dramatises the contents of a fictional American magazine based in Ennui-sur-Blasé, France. Sections include Tilda Swinton’s art critic profiling Benicio Del Toro’s jailed killer turned painter, Frances McDormand’s reporter taking in a May 68-style student protest, and Jeffrey Wright’s James Baldwin-like food writer being caught up in a kidnapping. Gently satirical, with nods to the Nouvelle Vague, Jacques Tati and the New Yorker, it’s a feast for the eyes.SWFriday 14 March, 11.20pm, Film4Blood for DustView image in fullscreenPleasing echoes of fargo … Kit Harington in Blood For Dust.Photograph: Ralphie Taylor AllenHangdog travelling salesman Cliff (Scoot McNairy) is struggling to get by when he bumps into ex-colleague Ricky (a smirking Kit Harington), his partner in an embezzlement scam at their old firm. Ricky offers him a simple job, driving drugs and guns from A to B – but, inevitably, there’s nothing straightforward about it. Rod Blackhurst’sforeboding thriller– all deadbeat motels and snowbound Montana roads – has pleasing echoes of Fargo, with Cliff finding reserves of cunning and stamina as his options narrow.SWSaturday 8 March, 11.15am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereCliffhangerView image in fullscreenHang on … Sylvester Stallone in Cliffhanger.Photograph: Tristar PicturesSylvester Stallone is nobody’s idea of an elite rock climber – those biceps would just get in the way – but suspension of disbelief is at the heart of Renny Harlin’s precipitately enjoyable1993 action thriller. Sly plays a former Rockies mountain rescuer who falls foul of bank robbers in search of suitcases full of loot lost from a crashed plane, with his outdoors expertise helping him to escape their clutches.

Back home in Newcastle upon Tyne to find out who killed his brother, London-based gangster Jack rubs everyone up the wrong way. But will he get to the truth before the local mobsters send him packing, or worse?

Written byStephen Grahamand Jack Thorne, it tells the story of 13-year-old Jamie (a remarkable debut from 15-year-old Owen Cooper) who is arrested for the murder of a classmate. Each episode is filmed as a single continuous shot – this is no directorial affectation, but a technique for eliciting a level of tension that occasionally feels like a panic attack. The story is unavoidably distressing, touching on modern-day bugbears including social media and the pernicious influence of the so-called “manosphere”. But the sheer artistry on display means it is impossible to look away.Netflix, from Thursday 13 MarchDope ThiefView image in fullscreenStreetwise … Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in Dope Thief.Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/Apple TV+Ray and Manny are rogueish but amiable small-time crooks from Philadelphia who rob low-level stash houses while disguised as DEA officers.

At its heart is the third Lord Glanville (Benjamin Wainwright), a nervy young chap who is attempting to woo Clara Dunn (Harriet Slater).

The premise always feels slightly undermined by the reality; while the idea of falling in love with someone on the basis of an emotional connection alone is undeniably sweet, it just so happens that most of the contenders also look like models, so how big a gamble anyone is taking remains to be seen. As ever, expect tears, tantrums, staged catharsis and the sense of a formula being pushed to breaking point.Netflix, from Thursday 13 MarchThe Wheel of TimeView image in fullscreenInner turmoil … Olivia Williams as Morgase and Shohreh Aghdashloo as Elaida in The Wheel of Time.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeItstarted lifeas a pretty transparent attempt by Prime to build its own epic Game of Thrones-type show.

Still, the wheel continues to turn: this time the threats against the Light are multiplying as the White Tower is in danger of destroying itself from the inside.

But if you are looking for a cycling holiday away from the crowds you’re better off heading 40 miles north to the Kop van Noord-Holland. Here you will find the largest contiguous bulb area in the country. April is the best time to cycle among the millions of colourful crocuses, daffodils, hyacinths and tulips. Between Schagen, Den Helder, Den Oever and Middenmeer you will find flower fields as far as the eye can see. I’d highly recommend the dune road from Callantsoog to Den Helder. The mostly well-paved surfaces are easy to cycle on and great for any fitness level.Peter DienderPalermo in the pinkView image in fullscreenA view of the Pretoria fountain in central Palermo.Photograph: FilippoBacci/Getty Images/iStockphotoIf there was ever a tonic for the winter blues, then the heat and dazzling pink brightness of Palermo in May will make you wonder where it’s been all your life. The Sicilian capital is made for simply wandering around its breathtaking architecture, a veritable ice-cream confection of styles from the ancient world. We stayed near the Quattro Canti (a baroque square) from which you could venture out from all four corners and simply go for it. The former Libreria Dante, now calledBisso Bistrot, serves up a deliciouspasta alla normafor any desperate vegetarians. Our meanderings took us past a house where you can still see rubble caused by bombing in the second world war, and thePalazzo Conte Federico– one of the oldest buildings in Palermo. We also enjoyed the fascinatingAntonio Pasqualino International Puppet Museum– a must for any big kid. For those with a macabre fascination, theCapuchin Catacombsare for you.

I recommend trying the east coast if you haven’t been before – starting at Cala Domingos and working your way up to Porto Cristo, 10 miles farther north. The terrain is rocky yet fairly flat, so easy to walk on with good trainers. There are lots of lovely coves to stop at if you do fancy an early sea dip, with fewer tourists than the main towns on the island. Sun and sea breeze is always a winner for me.JemimaCider with Picos, SpainView image in fullscreen‘Stunning when still snow-capped’ … Picos de Europa, Asturias.Photograph: Sebastian Wasek/AlamyIn Asturias, northern Spain, take a bracing wild dip, hike a stunning mountain range and be welcomed with gargantuan portions of heartyfabadastew and delicious fresh local cider.

The hills are dotted with white-greyish patches of clay that look like tiny doors into the hills. The fields are filled with an abundance of flowers, including several types of wild orchids, and small ponds with frogs making an amusing racket. I stayed in the small hamlet of Isola d’Arbia where a number of walking paths intersect. I spent happy days walking loops in different directions through bare clay fields, heath and grassland, and visited tranquil medievalborghi(villages) such as Cuna, Monteroni d’Arbia and Buenconvento along the way.ArielaSpring on the rocks, SpainView image in fullscreenThe town of Chulilla is popular with climbers.Photograph: Cavan Images/AlamyTwo years ago, we spent an early spring week in Chulilla, a small town tucked away in a mountainous limestone area, about an hour’s drive from Valencia. We went for the rock climbing, for which the town is well known, sitting among the impressive cliff faces that shine gold if you wake up to watch the sunrise, or sit with a beer as the sun sets in the evening. For daytime activities, there are trails to explore that lead you through the surrounding gorges, with hanging bridges, azure rivers and prehistoric rock paintings. In the evenings, you can relax in restaurants and bars. In all, a great place to catch some warmth away from the UK winter and for a bit of adventure too.KatieUtrecht – better than Amsterdam?View image in fullscreenMiffy-spotting is easy in Utrecht, home to a museum about the children’s character created by Dick Bruna.Photograph: Arcaid Images/AlamyUtrechtis Amsterdam’s cool and pretty little sister, and luckily for you, it’s still under the radar. It is one of the most beautiful, understated cities in Europe, a short train ride from Amsterdam. Think curving cobbled streets, beautiful Dutch architecture, and picture-postcard canals twinkling under nightlife. Miffy the rabbit is Utrecht’s most beloved resident, her creator Dick Bruna lived here most of his life, and little kids are going to love theMiffy Museum(best to book). You’ll spot Miffy’s dainty silhouette everywhere around the city, on giant plinths and even in the traffic lights. Everyone cycles in Utrecht – the city’s been named the best in all of Holland for cyclists. There is plenty to explore around the medieval centre – by bike or on foot. We loved the museums and galleries, but it’s the independent eateries and quirky shops that give Utrecht its special warm buzz.Daisy AyliffeBergen, Norway, before the summer crowdsView image in fullscreenSkomakerdiket Lake, Bergen.Photograph: AlamyWhile Bergen’sFløibanenfunicular is a must for its sweeping views, most visitors snap their photos at the top of Mount Fløyen and head straight back down. But if you walk just a little further into the woods, you’ll findSkomakerdiket. A tranquil lake surrounded by pine trees, perfectly still in the crisp spring air. At this time of year, before the summer crowds arrive, it feels like a hidden world. We rented a canoe and glided across the glassy water, the only sounds being the soft dip of paddles and birdsong echoing through the forest. It’s the perfect place to breathe in the fresh Norwegian air, and only one or two woodland trolls causing mischief.Hannah PreeceScandi without scanties, Denmark and SwedenView image in fullscreenRibersborgs Kallbadhus swimming pool and sauna in Malmö.Photograph: Jeppe Gustafsson/AlamyIf you want swims, saunas and Scandinavian socialising, a weekend in Copenhagen with Malmö thrown in is perfect. Flying into Copenhagen as a group of six friends we shared two rooms at the fantasticNext House Hostel– well placed for station and city centre. We went toCopenhotwith its relaxing sauna, incredible cityscape, hot tubs and cold plunge pools. We jumped on the train to Sweden to visit theRibersborgs Kallbadhus saunain Malmö and swim in the Baltic Sea. This was a liberating and soul-enriching experience where we embraced nudity without judgment and enjoyed the sensory saunagus fiery experience. Finally, social media provided contact with a local swimming group in Copenhagen whose hospitality means we, the Salty Sisters of Dunbar, can’t wait to swap our usual Scottish North Sea for the Baltic Sea again very soon.KatyMarseille’s cuisine and wildflowers, by bicycleView image in fullscreenThe Mucem museum.Photograph: AlamyVisit Marseille in spring to discover its unique blend of French and north African food and culture.

It was more drunken argy-bargy than fisticuffs, but enough to count as floor entertainment. Sadly, no spats occurred on my recent visit toSatori, an enlightening Japanese restaurant in the same postcode, though that’s probably because it’s so dark in there – black walls, black floors, black tables – that its customers wisely choose to remain safely seated.But this is not aDans Le Noir-style themed restaurantwhere you eat in a blackout; no, it has instead merely been designed by someone who clearly really loves shiny, black surfaces with blood-red trimmings and busts of dragons. It’s giving, as the kids say, 1980s MFI showroom doing international playboy lair. Or the time Adrian Molepainted over his Noddy wallpaper with black paint, but the gold hat bells kept gleaming through.View image in fullscreenSatori’s sushi platter: ‘Pretty indistinguishable from the freshly rolled options at Waitrose.’Satori is inspired, the website says, by the Japanese concept ofsatori, a moment of “awakening”, and offers a dining experience “that transcends the ordinary and becomes a journey of discovery, flavour, and connection”. That’s a slightly pompous claim for somewhere that serves tuna and avocado maki, chicken wings, miso cod fillet and duck breast with honey and soy, but then pomposity chimed loudly in the air as we were led brusquely to our shiny table.We had ordered drinks from the small bar by the front door, a shiso fine made with Afsana Lion non-alcoholic spirit, red shiso and rhubarb and hibiscus tonic, plus a kendo made with Afsana Warrior, toasted rice tea, coconut water and sesame. Both sounded delicious, but they remained a dream because they never showed up. Did I maybe get off on the wrong foot with the front of house? Admittedly, there was a certain fractiousness from the moment I began ordering. “We’ll start with some sushi,” I said confidently.“The sushi platter?” our server replied, guiding us to the £30 option.“Well, how many pieces are on it?” I asked.“Twelve,” he said, tapping his pad. “And what then for starters?”“Do we need starters?” I asked, having already seen several platters of rather cumbersome-looking maki and nigiri pass by.“Yes, you’ll need starters,” he said, curling a lip.“Tea-smoked miso aubergine?” I said, hoping to placate him. “Karaage?”“And?” he said.“Can we order mains now?” I said, ignoring his rolling eyes. My request for the black cod at £35 and the £30 lamb cutlets seemed to persuade him that we weren’t just cluttering a table.View image in fullscreenSatori’s black cod: ‘A chunk of rather nice fish.’A weird, dry, wilted cracker with spring onion and goat’s curd appeared as an amuse-bouche. Then a plate – black slate, naturally – topped with salmon and tuna nigiri dressed with rather thickly sliced okra and some caviar, and a slightly stodgy dragon prawn tempura maki topped with pea shoots. This wasn’t sushi worth making a special trip for, and pretty indistinguishable from the freshly rolled options at Waitrose.View image in fullscreenSatori’s tea-smoked aubergine: ‘Sweet, mushy and pleasant enough.’Next up came two thick slices of that tea-soaked aubergine, which was sweet, mushy and pleasant enough. Four small, thumbnail-sized pieces of karaage followed, which we’d been told had a layer of bonito under the drab, dry batter. Chopsticks were whisked away for our mains, which is when Satori ceased to push the boundaries of Japanese cuisine, ahem, and landed firmly in a 1990s UK pastiche of “sophisticated Japanese”, with a chunk of rather nice fish in a buttery miso sauce on a couple of pak choi leaves, and three deliciously plump, pink pepper-seasoned lamb chops with a few smears of yoghurt and some spindly heritage carrots, which owed more to Bengal than to Tokyo.View image in fullscreenSatori’s baked Mount Fuji: ‘Ordered mainly out of sheer curiosity.’This was the sort of dinner where you order dessert mainly out of sheer curiosity. “The baked Mount Fuji!” I declared triumphantly. Within a matter of minutes, and certainly not within time actually to bake anything, a chunk of matcha ice-cream ensconced in sticky meringue was on our table, a shot of whisky was hurled over the top and the whole thing was then set ablaze. At this point, semi-hysteria set in, although that might have been the whisky fumes. After the flames abated, the plate – black, of course – was a mound of singed, still moist meringue mix sitting on some melted ice-cream and a puddle of whisky. You really can’t put a price on that kind of excitement, although in this case it came to £12.Dinner was £168.77 including the warm service, but without the cocktails that, to date, are still being made in a very black room in Moseley.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.No wry anecdotes this week, no obscure references or jokes that only I find clever or funny. Today, I’m getting serious about xinomavro. If you haven’t heard of it, allow me to make its introduction, but if I’m already preaching to the choir, why are you still reading? Pour yourself a glass to have with lunch.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Derived fromxino(meaning sour) andmavro(black), this is a grape with some serious gravitas. One of hundreds of grape varieties native to Greece, it has become the country’s flagship red, and is now most synonymous with the region of Naoussa in Macedonia, the first Greek wine region to be awarded a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin).If you haven’t tried xinomavro and want to know what it tastes like, it’s a bit like a cross between a sort-of pinot noir and nebbiolo. Think bright-red fruit flavours with earthiness and firm tannins that signal a willingness and ability to age gracefully. Comparison only gets you so far, however, so while that might give you an idea of what to expect, xinomavro is also totally unique in and of itself. It’s layered, idiosyncratic – this is serious stuff.And while xinomavro might be best known for producing red wines, it’s also used to make rosé and sparkling wine (think of the latter as Greek blanc de noirs; I suggesteda particularly good onefrom Domaine Karanika last Christmas, which is both alluring and half the price of some of the grandes marques you get in the supermarket).Half the bottles in today’s pick are ready-to-drink, easy sippers – you know the type: find them in a supermarket, then use them as a gateway into a new fascination. But if you’re a fan of mature, complex pinot or barolo, might I suggest a periodical scan of theMaltby & Greek website, a UK supplier of Greek produce, including a selection of wine from lesser-known (in the UK, at least) wineries, where just a few names dominate. Prices start in the late teens, but if you want to experience xinomavro’s ability to age, they’re certainly a step up from the supermarket offerings.In terms of food, look at xinomavro, again, as you might a pinot noir or nebbiolo. It can handle white or pink meats with ease, though I prefer to drink it with food that’s a little more umami (which is typically a little harder to pair with), such as a mushroom risotto or goose with stuffing. It’s a wine that feels familiar, yes, but it’s not something that is made great by comparison. It’s time to take xinomavro seriously. Wry anecdotes will resume next week.X marks the xinomavro spotM&S Expressions Xinomavro£10.15 Ocado, 14%. Fruity and aromatic.

We serve it as part of our new “Slow Sundays” offering, and instead of the usual Tabasco, we use a house-made burnt harissa to add a real kick and smokiness.Harissa bloody maryServes1For the burnt harissa10-15red chillies, to tasteA pinch of salt1 small garlic clove, peeledOlive oilFor the drink45ml vodka– we useEast London Liquor Co.150mlgood-qualitytomato juice2 dashes Worcestershire sauce10ml freshlemon juiceA pinch of celery salt, plus extra to rim the glass, if you like1 tsp burnt harissa(see above and method)1 guindilla chilli, 1 pickled cauliflower floret and 1 olive on a skewer, to garnishFirst make the harissa. Scorch the chillies over a gas flame until blackened and blistered all over. Once they’ve cooled down slightly, peel off and discard the skins and finely chop the chilli flesh. Put this in a blender and grate in the garlic – add a little more, if you like, but you really don’t need much (at the restaurant, we use about a tablespoon in every two-litre batch). Add a pinch of salt and a dash of olive oil to loosen, then blitz to a smooth paste. The harissa will now keep in a clean sealed container in the fridge for about a week.To build the drink, measure everything into a mixing glass filled with ice and stir gently to combine. Strain into a highball glass (we use a 350ml one) filled with fresh ice (if you like, rim the glass with celery salt first). Garnish with a skewer of a guindilla chilli, a pickled cauliflower floret and an olive.Oded Oren, chef/patron,Oren, London E8Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodMiddle Eastern food and drinkBrunchTomatoesSauces and graviesrecipesShareReuse this content"

I had them in every way possible: blitzed into a juice; sitting on a cheesecake at the iconicContramar; or as a sticky, jam-filled pastry found at nearly every bakery I visited. My favourite version also came with a layer of cream cheese, and I’ve taken those flavours and put them in biscuit form. Shop-bought guava jam is as close as I’ll get here in the UK, but these remind me of a delicious trip every time I make them.Guava jam sandwich biscuitsPrep5 minChill1 hr 15 minCook1 hr, plus coolingMakes9For the biscuits175g plain flour50g ground almonds80g caster sugar¼ tsp salt100g unsalted butter,diced1 medium egg,beatenFor the filling100g cream cheese½ tsp vanilla bean paste or extract15g icing sugar,plus extra to dustA pinch of salt3 tbsp guava jamTo make thebiscuits, mix the flour, almonds, sugar and salt in a bowl until combined. Rub in the butter using your fingertips, until you have a fine breadcrumb consistency.Make a well in the middle, add the egg then use a table knife to mix until it comes together into a dough. Turn it out on to a clean surface and use your hands to pat the dough into a disc. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and line two baking trays with baking paper. Roll out the chilled dough between two sheets of greaseproof paper to about 2-3mm thick, then return to the fridge for 15 minutes.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Use a round or square cookie cutter to stamp out 18 biscuits (if you like, re-roll the dough offcuts to make more biscuits). Use another smaller cutter to stamp out holes in the middle of half of the biscuits (these will be the tops). Put all the biscuits on the lined trays and bake for 12-14 minutes, until the edges are very lightly browned. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.For the filling, mix the cream cheese, vanilla, sugar and a pinch of salt together until smooth. Spread a little guava jam and a small dollop of cream cheese on the biscuit bases (ie, those without holes), then sandwich with the remaining holey biscuit tops. Dust with icing sugar and serve.Explore more on these topicsBiscuitsThe sweet spotFoodBakingSnacksCheeseFruitrecipesShareReuse this content"
