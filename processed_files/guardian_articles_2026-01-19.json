That is the question. When even Piers Morgan has taken his head out of Donald Trump’s bum far enough to see a glimmer of daylight, then it’s fair to say the US president has probably overstepped the mark.Not content withthreatening tariffsagainst the UK and seven EU countries for sending troops to Greenland – having previously demanded Nato allies get stuck in to protect the country from Russia and China – The Donald has now sent a letter to the Norwegian prime minister tocomplain about not winning the Nobel peace prizeand to say he was so pissed off he was thinking of starting a war instead.If this is the new alignment of the rules-based order then the west is falling apart in front of our eyes. Presidents Putin and Xi must be living their best lives. This is everything they dreamed of and more.All their sins can be forgiven and they now have licence to do as they please in Ukraine and Taiwan. And all because the Orange King Baby in the White House is having a temper tantrum at not getting his own way. His doctors urgently need to do a review of his meds. A little less aspirin and industrial quantities of antipsychotics would be doing us all a favour.Meanwhile,Keir Starmerjust can’t catch a break. Two weeks ago, he had been planning to make a big new year speech on the cost of living crisis. That got scrapped when Trump kidnapped Nicoás Maduro. Second time unlucky.This same domestic relaunch speech just got hijacked again at the weekend by the US president. By the time the prime minister gets round to telling us what he’s planning to do about the domestic situation, the cost of living will have gone up again.So Monday morning found Starmer giving an emergency press conference in Downing Street. This was Keir at his most grave. And, to be fair, he is better at being serious than he is charismatic and engaging. This was Keir from his barrister past. Explaining to a client why he had lost his appeal against the death sentence. Next stop a spell as an undertaker. “I am so sorry for your loss.”Greenland’s sovereignty could only be determined byGreenlandand Denmark, he said. Our values are resolute. Here was a line in the sand. Something on which we could all agree. Though he didn’t have any helpful insights into what he might do if the US took matters into their own hands and seized the island by force.2:32Greenland's future must be decided by Greenland and Denmark 'alone', says Starmer – videoInstead Starmertried to take the heat out of the situation. Now was not the time for overreaction. An implicit rebuke both to Emmanuel Macron for threatening retaliatory tariffs and to Ed Davey and Zack Polanski for making trouble.What was needed was a cool head. Calm diplomacy. No need to make a drama out of a crisis. Just sit down with The Donald and talk things through. Man to man. Once Trump had had things explained to him, he would have a rethink. Realise he had acted a bit hastily. A gentle reminder that starting a trade war with your allies was a wee bit over the top. This wasn’t the way the special relationship was supposed to work.All of which was fine as far as it went. Only it was all predicated on a category error. Because it all presupposed that The Donald was a sentient being. Someone who could respond sensibly to reason. A proper grownup. Except it has long been clear that this isn’t the reality we are dealing with. And to be fair, Trump has never pretended to be anything other than what he is.The Donald is a bully who enjoys using his power on those weaker than him. He doesn’t care about Nato and other global alliances. Everything is about his machismo. And he doesn’t need a reason for taking Greenland other than he quite fancies it. Because he can. He likes the attention. Likes to see Starmer and other leaders desperately scrabbling around to coordinate a response. He enjoys other people’s weakness and wants to go down in history as the president who extended the territory of the US.If Keir had hoped to offer some reassurance, he failed badly. The journalists at the press conference understandably wanted to know if there was a plan B. OK, so the prime minister hoped to change the president’s mind. Yup. We could all agree that would be a good thing. But we all knew that wasn’t very likely. The Donald tends to do exactly what he feels like. Keir tried to tell us that he didn’t think the president was planning to take Greenland by force. Except that’s exactly what he has said he will do if the Danes continue to say it isn’t for sale.“Retaliatory tariffs are a bad idea,” said Starmer. He isn’t wrong. A trade war would undoubtedly harm the UK economy. And falling out with your most important ally who helps maintain your nuclear deterrent can generally be filed under “bad idea”. But where do you draw the line when The Donald goes ahead and does all the things he says he is going to do? Imposes tariffs; annexes Greenland; trashes Nato.In KeirWorld where no boat should ever be rocked, The Donald operates in a world without consequences. Where every humiliation is only greeted with an invitation to inflict further humiliation. Were Trump to take a fancy to Scotland – hell, he owns a couple of golf courses so why not the whole country: first he takes Turnberry then he takes Holyrood – what would Starmer do then? Apart from saying how disappointed he was and that we needed to maintain good relations with the US at all costs.Maybe Keir will prove us all wrong. He will secure a meeting with the president in Davos and The Donald will see the light. But you wouldn’t put money on it. Starmer has acquired the reputation of being the world’s best Trump wrangler but right now it’s hard to see we have got that much in return.It could just be that Keir used his best bargaining chip long ago when he offered the president a state visit on the first date. That’s the only thing The Donald has ever really wanted from us. We gave it away too cheaply.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchForeign policyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsGreenlandDenmarkUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

But the endearing protagonists of the latest spin-off of the franchise, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, invite it.Their names, as in theGeorge RR Martinnovellas on which the series is based, are Dunk – short for Ser Duncan the Tall – and Egg. Dunk (Peter Claffey, a suitably tall former Irish rugby union player, last seen in Bad Sisters) was squire to a hedge – non-noble – knight, Ser Arlan of Pennytree (Danny Webb), who took the boy under his wing but never quite got round to knighting the man before dying. We first meet Dunk burying his mentor under an old elm tree and taking up his arms against the sea of troubles that are about to engulf him. Dunk is a simple soul (very simple, some might say – he may look like a medieval Jack Reacher, but inside he is more of an eager but baffled labrador) and sets out to find a lord he can himself serve as a hedge knight.Fortunately, one of his early pit stops is at a tavern that brings him into the orbit of the bald-headed, ethereal-looking, rovingly intelligent child Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell, a mighty screen presence in a tiny frame and quite fascinating to watch). Egg offers to be Dunk’s squire (“You look like you need me the most”) and off the underdog and underpuppy go through the back roads of Westeros, 100 years before GoT, with the Targaryens on the Iron Throne and some familiar surnames floating around elsewhere, towards a jousting tournament that might provide Dunk with the win and mentor he needs.View image in fullscreenA mighty screen presence … Dexter Sol Ansell as Egg in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc.In Game of Thrones franchise terms, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a bagatelle. If House of the Dragon was born of a desire to turn the tide of fans’ anger over the original’s finale (or final season. Or final seasons. Discuss animatedly until even Jon Snow is bored to death) while keeping the appetite for more alive until GRRM had completed his masterwork, this new offering seems to be something quite different. What this means for our collective hopes for the two remaining books in the sequence, let us not dwell.One of the most obvious points of departure is that while GoT burned through plot like Maester Pycelle’s wildfire through Stannis’s fleet, very little happens in the average episode of AKotSK (which comes in at about the 30-minute mark instead of its progenitor’s full and weighty hour). We are here for the budding friendship between knight and squire, even if it is not always clear – given Egg’s much greater knowledge of how the world works than dear old Dunk’s – which way round those roles are allocated, and a level of emotional investment in the pair that it would have been frankly foolish to apply to any of the characters in GoT once we saw what they did to Ned Stark.It’s not exactly entry-level stuff – there is too much swearing, too many inventive tortures (albeit more often graphically described than shown in full and granular detail as was traditional), plus a bit of full-frontal male nudity that … raises questions. Plus, later on, there is an episode too full of gore for the series to be safely shown to unsupervised non-Eggy children. But it is a much, much gentler proposition than either Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon. Instead of severed peens we get Dunk bumping into lintels. Instead of Red or Purple or Sansa’s weddings, we have averagely drunken nights in taverns. Instead of sons being served up in pies we have no sons being served up in pies. It’s much more restful. And there’s no Ramsay Bolton, save still in your nightmares.View image in fullscreenNo sons being served up in pies here … A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.Which does rather make you wonder who the target audience is? Not children, who might otherwise warm to this tale of a bumbling adult periodically saved by the wise child at his heels. Not epic fantasy fans jonesing for the next instalment of A Song of Ice and Fire (though dragons exist in living memory, this era of early Westeros is free of magic and sorcery). And although it gestures towards larger questions, like the corruption of innocence and the pros and cons of the feudal mentality, it doesn’t delve into them deeply or carry enough weight on its own to attract a great audience of non-diehard GRRM fans.But perhaps the fact that it is not going to set the world on fire, either literally within the show or metaphorically without it, is the point. The real world is now too Westeros-like for us to cope with any more. The land of fabled violence is now our safe space. We are all Dunk, just hoping for protection from even something as fragile as an Egg.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK; in the US it is on HBO; in Australia it is on MaxExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGeorge RR MartinGame of ThronesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not that close. This inky screenprint is bigger than she is, its face wider and taller. But it’s not a picture of the outer person but an inner vision. As we stand in front of it I seem to fall into radiating pools of blackness – to cross into darkness.Emin has curated an exhibition for the depths of winter. It’s a generous, unexpected show with an eclectic yet profound openness to kinds of creativity many might think incompatible: paintings, installations, performance art all face the night here. She sets artists she nurtures at theEmin Studiosalongside her heroes Edvard Munch, Louise Bourgeois and other luminaries of modern art – if luminary is the right word in this stygian setting. For, by a stroke of lighting genius, the Carl Freedman Gallery has been plunged into nocturnal shadow that still lets you see the art.View image in fullscreenBaconian screaming mouth … The Castle and the Citadel by Laura Footes.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist and Carl Freedman Gallery, MargateIt begins with a concrete waistcoat, like something that might be dredged up encasing a skeleton. The body has gone, leaving holes for arms, legs, neck. It’s by Antony Gormley, cast from himself, and you wonder if he is a bit of a Houdini to have escaped it. Uneasy portraiture dominates this room. Munch gazes like a numbed, ragged pair of claws from his 1895 self-portrait, with a skeletal arm.Joline Kwakkenbos, a resident artists at Emin’s Margate studios, displays three bizarre, striking paintings including Self-Portrait as a Painter as Lucretia, in which she sits in 18th-century costume stabbing herself. It gets doomier. A wailing, stuffed head, malformed and agonised, isolated in a vitrine, is Bourgeois’s answer to Munch’s Scream.Some artists have answered Emin’s sombre call with blasts of hokey gothic.Lindsey Mendickhas made ceramic busts of putrid zombie women whose festering sores and disintegrating flesh look all the more repulsive in shiny glazed pottery. Is this horror or comedy horror? Mendick may not be sure herself. PainterLaura Footes, another graduate of Emin’s studios, is clearly serious in her big allegorical painting of the lords of business and politics seated at a long meeting table with a Dracula castle hovering nearby. It uncomfortably smacks of conspiracy theory but a brilliant detail of a Baconian screaming mouth in a pink flesh-cloud shows her ability.Next to Footes’s painting is a relic of a performance byHermann Nitsch, the Vienna actionist who staged outrageous “Orgy-Mystery Theatre” mass happenings at his own castle with lashings of animal blood. It’s a board covered in sketchy lines and real blood from which emerges a skull-faced figure like some Mesoamerican god of death. It’s entitled Design for “Grablegung (Burial)”. Close by, Anselm Kiefer displays a hammer and anvil in a vitrine with Thor written on the glass, a sculpture that shakes with the power of the Norse thunder god.View image in fullscreenCareful with that axe … Georg Baselitz, Ein Werktätiger, 1967, oil on canvas.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist and Modern Collections Limited, LondonMyths and monsters, floating castles and vampire orgies – terrors of the dark. But sometimes you see the uncanny in broad daylight. Walking near his Suffolk home at dawn, the photographerJohnnie Shand Kyddcaptures eerie mists over icy still waters, banks of whiteness shrouding bare trees, clouds looming over wind-raked reeds. These black-and-white pictures hold their own with Kiefer’s mythic vitrines andGeorg Baselitz’s 1967 painting Ein Werktätiger, in which a woodcutter with an axe appears to break into pieces before our eyes, as if he’s chopped himself up with his own axe. The final work is by Gilbert & George. Emin tells me it makes her think of the gates of hell. It’s is a picture in which their faces are compressed, twisted into monster masks amid stark winter branches that form a black gate.Her exhibition, she says, recognises the dark times we are in – you can fill in your own nightmares – but also offers solace from her experience of cancer: “I thought I would die but didn’t.” There is hope in darkness, as stone-age crowds knew when they gathered for the winter solstice at Stonehenge. It is where you have to go to start again. Of course you don’t have to go through what Emin has to know that by entering darkness we discover light. This happens to everyone every 24 hours. You go to bed, put out the light and cross into darkness. When we wake up everything is new. What were those passing phantoms in the night – just dreams and fears?View image in fullscreenAbandon all hope … Gilbert & George, Bowery, 2008.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist and White Cube, LondonFor this artist they are more real than that. In Emin’s large new painting at the centre of the show, a woman is curled up on her bed. Over her stands a cowled visitant. It looks pretty spooky to me but the artist seemingly sees this ghost as a friend, for the painting is called I Am Protected. Maybe we’re all being watched over until we wake up soon: here’s hoping.Crossing into Darkness is at Carl Freeman Gallery, Margate, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsArtTracey EminEdvard MunchAntony GormleyAnselm KieferGilbert & GeorgereviewsShareReuse this content"

You arrange to open the day’s trading on the stock exchange to hail a “new golden age” for the City and bask in the sight of theFTSE 100 index above 10,000, and what happens? Youhave to skip offto the prime minister’s statement on Greenland.In the event, Rachel Reeves needn’t have worried about the poor optics of overseeing a terrible day for share prices. Donald Trump’sweekend threat of tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK, did not cause an explosion in the London stock market.The Footsie closed down 0.4%, which doesn’t register on the doomsday radar, although European stocks did worse. There was even a£7.7bn bid for the insurer Beazley at a fat premium.Why the relative calm? Well, markets have learned to live with Trumpian tariff adventures. They know the attention-grabbing initial threats do not always translate into action, at least not at the advertised level. With hindsight, Trump’s“liberation day” last April, which did shake markets, created one of the best buying opportunities in years and 2025 as a whole wasa bumper year for stock markets almost everywhere.Markets fall and gold and silver hit new highs after Trump’s latest tariff threatRead more“More than a year into Trump’s second term, market participants have become increasingly desensitised to his rhetoric and sceptical that it will feed through into action,” says Jonas Goltermann, the deputy chief markets economist at the thinktank CapitalEconomics. Quite: markets expect Trump’s 1 February deadline for the first 10% tariff to be postponed. In any case, the next step is the US supreme court’s ruling on the legality of Trump’s existing tariff policy.Investors’ complacency obviously guarantees a bigger reaction if it is misplacedBut two other points are worth noting in the market’s reaction. First, investors’ complacency obviously guarantees a bigger reaction if it is misplaced. The risk of a UK or eurozone recession – highly likely if extra tariffs were to be imposed for an extended period, say economists – is almost the least of it. If the breakup of Nato is also on the cards, that is one of those long-term geopolitical shifts that markets tend to be terrible at pricing – or, rather, they take their time to do so because the consequences are genuinely unclear.But the Deutsche Bank currency strategist George Saravelos also raised the more immediate – and alarming – spectre of tit-for-tat measures going beyond tariffs on goods and into capital markets. “Europe owns Greenland, it also owns a lot of Treasuries [US debt],” he wrote, suggesting that European funds may be less willing to own US assets “in an environment where the geoeconomic stability of the western alliance is being disrupted existentially”.What are Trump’s latest tariff threats and could the EU hit back with its ‘big bazooka’?Read moreThose holdings are indeed large: European countries own $8tn of US bonds and equities, almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined, he calculates. It is indeed one card Europe holds: the US is running large external deficits that need to be funded without, Trump hopes, creating a slide in the dollar or a rise in US borrowing costs.In practice, we’re miles away from a coordinated European decision to hold fewer US treasuries, assuming it could even be agreed. European funds probably don’t want to be told to sell into a market where the aim is lower prices. On the other hand, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is talking aboutactivating the EU’s “anti-coercion instrument”to restrict access to the single market for US companies, so one can see which direction the wind is blowing.“It is a weaponisation of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets,” Saravelos says. Yes, that would be the big short-term market escalation. It is remarkable that it’s even being discussed – but not as remarkable, of course, as the idea of annexing a fellow Nato member’s territory.Explore more on these topicsTariffsNils Pratley on financeStock marketsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEconomicsGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

Will it capture you too?Keith StuartMon 19 Jan 2026 10.35 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 19.12 ESTShareReleased last October Arc Raiders has swiftly become one of the most successful online shooters in the world, shifting 12m copies in barely three months and attracting as many players as established mega hits such as Counter-Strike 2 and Apex Legends. So what is it about this sci-fi blaster that’s captured so many people – and how can you get involved?So what is Arc Raiders?Created by Swedish developer Embark Studios, Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter: an online multiplayer game that drops you into a world with other people to search for valuable weapons and items before attempting to escape with all your spoils. You can play alone or with up to two friends in a squad. Most extraction shooters feature two types of gameplay: Player vs Environment (PvE), which means exploring the world and fighting computer controlled enemies, and Player vs Player (PvP), which means fighting any other players you come across on your travels and then stealing their stuff. In Arc Raiders, you don’t have to fight everyone you meet: in fact human raiders often choose to ignore each other or band together instead of shooting on sight. The game gives you a few stock phrases to shout such as “don’t shoot!”, or you can plug in a mic, chat to strangers you meet and form alliances.What’s the story?Arc Raiders is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth in the distant future. The planet has suffered an ecological disaster that has wiped out most of the population and most technology. Now, a robotic alien invasion force named Arc has arrived to plunder all the remaining natural resources and kill off humanity, forcing everyone to flee underground, where a vast subterranean city named Toledo has been built. Now Earth is patrolled by a menagerie of deadly android guards.What do you do?You play as a raider making daring trips topside to scavenge ruined towns and facilities. As you go on more raids, your character earns experience points, which can be spent on improving their survival, looting and movement abilities, and finds blueprints that enable them to make more stuff. You can also carry out missions for traders, who will reward you with useful items. Traders also sell you things that you haven’t yet learned to craft yourself.Why is it so popular?There are a lot of extraction shooters out there, from dystopian survival thriller Escape from Tarkov to the southern gothic horror of Hunt: Showdown 1896. What Arc Raiders brings is a strong retro-futuristic sense of style, with interesting environments, excellent music and audio, compelling lore and engrossing set-piece battles with the giant robots. Some enemies, such as the vast mecha-spider-like Matriarch, are absolutely huge and require lots of players to join forces in ad-hoc battles. These thrilling encounters have been widely shared on Twitch, TikTok and Instagram – as have comic moments where players fall off buildings, or accidentally kill themselves with guided missiles. The enemies, from the drone-like Wasps and Hornets to the lumbering land-based Bombardiers, are powered by machine-learning and AI that make them fun and unpredictable combatants.How should I start?Just jump in! Arc Raiders is available onPC, Xbox and PS5 and I’d recommend getting a gaming headset so you can chat to other players, if you haven’t got one. Also, listening to the world through headphones gives you a better understanding of where threats are coming from. Once you customise your character, you can start going on raids. In the beginning you can only access one map, the Dam Battlegrounds, but others such as the wrecked urban landscape of Buried City and the deadly industrial complex Stella Montis open up later. I’d advise sticking to the Dam until you have many hours of experience, as the other places are swarming with enemies and other players tend to be more aggressive. For your first few raids, just explore the map, get to grips with the different enemies and pop into buildings to search cabinets, lockers and desks for items.Collect absolutelyeverythingat first – useful resources such as wires and springs will let you craft items later, while rare goods such as toasters and radios can be sold or recycled for scrap. You’ll begin with a very basic weapon and accessories but as you go you’ll find new guns, grenades and healing items, which you can store in your room or sell. With the money you earn, you can buy better kit from traders. It’s important to become self-sufficient as soon as possible, so concentrate on upgrading your workstations (where you craft new items). Whenever you find a blueprint, which teaches you a new item to craft, put it in your inventory’s safe pocket – this lets you keep it even if you’re killed during a raid. Blueprints are more likely to be found in high value areas (marked on your map in red) or during daily special events such as night raids and electromagnetic storms – but these are more risky and competitive.These player guides byGames Radar,IGNandRock Paper Shotgunare extremely useful.Any last tips?View image in fullscreenJust jump in! … Arc Raiders.Photograph: Embark StudiosThe game’s skill tree has three branches – Conditioning, Mobility and Survival. You won’t be able to unlock everything, so think about how you’re going to play. I’d prioritise Mobility skills that focus on stamina at first as you’re going to be doing a LOT of running away. After this, it depends on you: if you’re going to fight other players, prioritise Conditioning skills: if you just want to loot and get outta there, prioritise the more stealth-focused Survival options.As soon as you can, arm yourself with two guns: one that’s effective against Arc enemies (the Ferro is great for this); and one that is useful against other players, such as the Kettle or Stitcher, which are effective against even the best guns in the game. You should also carry bandages, shield rechargers and adrenaline shots. Consider taking smoke grenades everywhere as they’ll help you escape both Arc robots and aggressive players. Even when you have the best weapons and armour, you can still be overpowered by basic flying enemies such as Wasps and Hornets, so buy a bunch of seeker grenades – they’re cheap and highly effective against these tenacious foes.As soon as you have the money, increase the size of your stash – ie the number of items you’re allowed to store. Keep doing this until you max it out to 280 slots. You’re gonna need them.If you need to make money fast, go to Dam and visit the Pale Apartments, Ruby Residence and Pattern House – they are filled with high-value trinkets such as statues, snow globes and pottery jugs, and are relatively safe to explore.Arc Raiders review – pure multiplayer pleasureRead moreAt the beginning of each run, after you choose which map area you want to visit, the game offers you the chance to start with a free load-out, which includes a basic gun and some useful random items. It lets you get to grips with the area and do a bit of looting without the risk of losing valuable equipment. This is a brilliant option for when you’re exploring a new map for the first time, or if you just need to recoup your supplies after being killed on a previous run. If you survive, you can visit the trader named Lance and swap your basic Augment for a better one for no charge.The game takes aggressive behaviour into account when matching you with other players. If you shoot people, you’re more likely to be put on servers where people shoot back. If that doesn’t sound like fun, be nice to other raiders. Use the emote wheel to greet them, and join up to fight larger enemies. You’ll learn faster and I’ve often been given items by players who I’ve helped out.Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it,” he added.The Nobel peace prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel committee, a five-member private body whose members – mostly retired politicians – are appointed by Norway’s parliament but whose decisions are independent of the government.Trump campaigned hard to win last year’s prize,which was awarded to María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader. She collected it in Oslo last month but has since dedicated it to Trump andlast week gave her medal to him.In his text message to Støre, Trump said Denmark “cannot protect” Greenland from Russia or China, adding: “Why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago.”The US president said he had “done more for Nato than anyone else since its founding, and now Nato should do something for the United States”. The world was “not secure unless we have Complete and Total control of Greenland”, he said.Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said on Monday he and the Greenlandic foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, had discussed with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, the possibility of a Nato mission in Greenland and the Arctic.The Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said it was “important that all of us who believe in international law speak out to show Trump you can’t go down this road”. Trump had to see that “putting pressure on us” would not work, he said.Greenland said it was a democratic society and must be allowed to decide its own future. “We will not be pressured,” said the territory’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen. “We stand firm on dialogue, respect and international law”.EU leaders will meet for an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss their response, which could include a package of tariffs on €93bn (£80bn) of US imports that has been suspended for six months since the two sides reached a trade deal last year.Another possibility is the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument” (ACI), which has never been used but would limit US access to public tenders, investments or banking activities and restrict trade in services, including digital services. The EU said it was continuing to engage “at all levels” and the use of the ACI was not off the table. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Lars Klingbeil, and France’s finance minister, Roland Lescure, both denounced Trump’s tariff plans as blackmail.Støre, who had not been scheduled to attend this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said he would do so on Wednesday and Thursday, overlapping with Trump’s planned appearance at the annual political and business gathering.Støre said on Monday Trump’s Sunday text messagehad come in response to a message from him half an hour earlier saying he and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, wanted to “take this down and de-escalate”, and proposing a phone call.Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said he would also try to meet Trump in the Swiss resort on Wednesday, adding that “if we are confronted with tariffs we consider unreasonable, then we are capable of responding”.Merz said Germany and other EU countries agreed “that we want to avoid any escalation in this dispute if at all possible”, but “if necessary, we will of course protect our European interests as well as our German national interests”.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was working closely with EU leaders and called for calm discussion between allies. Trump’s tariff planswere “completely wrong”, he said, but he added he did not think military action to take Greenland was likely.Globe map showing western European military support to GreenlandSeveral EU states including Germany, Denmark and Italy, as well as the UK, have suggested Trump believes the eight Nato countries that sent troops to Greenland last week – and are now the targets of his tariffs – did so as a warning shot to the US.Some diplomats have said this may be a misunderstanding based on biased US TV reports: the troops were on a reconnaissance mission, and their deployment was in line with US concerns over a supposedly growing Russian threat in the Arctic.Others lean more towards wilful misinterpretation in Washington: US representatives were present when the joint operation’s purpose was outlined at a Nato council meeting last week, and the US was invited to join it.“The difficulty is that as trust breaks down, Trump makes his decisions based on wild speculation on US TV, and not from his diplomatic allies,” one western diplomat said.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpNobel peace prizeNorwayEuropean UnionNatoMaría Corina MachadonewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday afternoon, Esther Ghey, the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, became the latest high profile figure toadd her nameto those in support of a ban.The announcement comes as peers prepare to vote on an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill on Wednesday, which would enact a ban within a year of the bill passing.Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has said he is open to the idea of a ban, but allies say he wants to wait to see moreevidence from Australia, where a ban was enacted in December, before making up his mind.Kendall said in a statement: “Through the Online Safety Act, this government has already taken clear, concrete steps to deliver a safer online world for our children and young people.“These laws were never meant to be the end point, and we know parents still have serious concerns. That is why I am prepared to take further action.”The consultation will explore a range of options, including whether to introduce a social media age limit, how to enforce such a limit, stopping technology companies accessing young users’ data and limiting addictive tools such as “infinite scrolling”.The government also says it expects every school to be free of mobile phones by default, with Ofsted to include reports on phone use as part of their regular inspections.The move is partly intended to buy the government time before Wednesday, when peers will vote on a proposal by the Conservative peer Lord Nash to set an age limit for social media at 16.SeveralLabourpeers are expected to vote for the amendment, while the Guardian revealed over the weekend that 61 Labour MPs had also written to Starmer to express their support.Nash said on Monday he did not feel the government’s consultation went far enough, and that he would be pushing ahead with his amendment.“This announcement offers nothing for the hundreds of thousands of parents, teachers, medical professionals, senior police officers, national security experts and parliamentarians of all parties who have been calling for a raising of the age limit for social media.“The prime minister must be in no doubt about the strength of feeling on this. The longer we delay, the more children we fail. I continue to urge all peers to back my amendment on Wednesday which would begin to end the catastrophic harm being done to a generation.”The government’s announcement came hours after Ghey wrote to Starmer explaining in detail how she felt her daughter’s eating disorder and self-harm had been exacerbated by TikTok influencers with whom she had become obsessed.Ghey joined eight other sets of bereaved parents in calling for the government to back Nash’s amendment, which they said “sends an important and unambiguous message that social media is not appropriate for children under the age of 16”.She wrote: “Brianna had a social media addiction and struggled with her mental health from the age of 14. She developed an eating disorder and was self-harming, and all of this was significantly exacerbated by the harmful content she was consuming online.”Ghey added: “I was constantly having heated conversations with Brianna, who became determined that she wanted to be both TikTok famous and a sex worker.“Alongside this, I was in constant fear about who Brianna might be speaking to online. I tried to monitor her phone through spot checks, but she was able to hide things from me very easily.”Brianna was murdered in 2023 in Warrington, Cheshire, bytwo teenagersin a brutal attack partly motivated by her transgender identity.Her motherlater describedhow she had become obsessed with social media in the months before her death, accessing content related to anorexia and self-harm.Brianna had cultivated a friendship with one of her killers, who at one point tried to poison her with ibuprofen, telling her it was MDMA. That girl had also been spending time in parts of the dark web, looking at websites that featured live abuse.The prime minister said at a press conference on Monday: “I think we need to do more to protect children and that’s why we’re looking at a range of options and saying that no options are off the table. We’re obviously looking at what’s happened in Australia – something I have discussed with the Australian prime minister.”Explore more on these topicsSocial media banSocial mediaSocial media bansDigital mediaChildrenLabournewsShareReuse this content"

In the aftermath of the collision near Adamuz in Córdoba province, just one of them, a six-year-old child, had been accounted for.‘We had to remove the dead to get to the living’: train crash shocks Spanish townRead more“Now we’re searching for the four who are missing,” Barroso told reporters. “We’ve been all over. All of the hospitals in Jaén, Úbeda and in Córdoba.”Others used social media to post photos of their loved ones, pleading for people to get in touch. “If anyone in Adamuz recognises this man, he’s my father, please contact me,” read one message.Police said they had opened several offices where people could file reports and “provide DNA samples for the purpose of identification”.Speaking to reporters during a visit to the site, the country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, vowed that the investigation into the cause of the crash would be full and transparent.View image in fullscreenSpain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez (2-R), promised a thorough investigation.Photograph: Jorge Zapata/EPA“Spanish society, like all of us, is wondering what happened, how it happened, how this tragedy could have occurred,” he said on Monday as he declared three days of mourning starting at midnight . “And I’m convinced that time and the work of experts will provide us with those answers.”The collision occurred just before 8pm on Sunday night, when the rear part of the Madrid-bound traincame off the railsand into the path of an oncoming train.The impact knocked the first two carriages of the southbound train off the track, sending it plummeting down a 4-metre (13ft) slope, said Spain’s transport minister, Óscar Puente.Map of where the trains crashedWhile the cause of the accident had yet to be established, Puente described it as “really strange” that a derailment had happened on a straight stretch of track. This particular section had been renovated in May, he added.The train that derailed was less than four years old and had been inspected four days earlier, Iryo, the private company that operated the train, said in a statement on Monday.The president of the state rail company, Renfe, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said it was too early to talk about the cause. But he noted that the accident had taken place in “strange conditions”, telling the broadcaster Cadena Ser that “human error is practically ruled out”.A source told Reuters that technicians had identified a broken joint on the rails, which they said had created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track. The faulty joint could prove important in identifying the precise cause of the accident, the source added.Neither Adif, the state-owned rail infrastructure administrator, nor the Spanish commission tasked with investigating rail accidents replied to requests for comment.Since 2022, Adif has publicly flagged 10 infrastructure issues in the area where the collision occurred, from signalling failures to issues with overhead power lines. In August, the union representing train drivers said in a letter that increased rail traffic had led to severe wear and tear on the tracks, resulting in frequent breakdowns and train damage.On Monday the train drivers’ union called for caution in linking their earlier warning to the crash, stressing that the cause of the collision remained unknown.View image in fullscreenSome passengers managed to slip out of overturned carriages and twisted masses of steel on their own, using emergency hammers to break through windows.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APAs reports of the collision began circulating on Sunday evening, emergency officials rushed to the remote area where it took place.Grappling with darkness and largely limited by the single-track road that leads to and from the site, they worked through the night to pull people out of the wreckage. Some passengers managed to slip out of overturned carriages and twisted masses of steel on their own, using emergency hammers to break through windows.map of the high-speed rail lineThe mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, told Europa Press that he was among the first to arrive at the scene. “It was horrific,” he said. “It was a tremendously tough, sad night.”The small Andalucían town, which sits in the countryside a few kilometres from the crash site, was in shock on Monday.The town’s municipal hall had been turned into a hastily improvised response centre where many of the victims of the accident had been brought for first aid, food and warmth before being taken elsewhere.Officials warned the death toll was likely to rise. The head of the Andalucían government, Juanma Moreno, told the broadcaster Cope: “Some carriages are in a very deteriorated, very regrettable state. I’m told it’s a twisted wreck, which makes things very difficult. We have to use mechanical means and heavy machinery.”He said the search area had been widened beyond the crash site. “The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of metres away, which means that people were thrown through the windows.”Map of Spain's rail networkThe accident shook Spain, where the cutting-edge rail network has long been a source of pride. With almost 4,000km of track, Spain’s high-speed railway network is the largest in Europe and the second in the world after China, according to Adif.In 2024, Renfe said more than 25 million passengers had travelled on its high-speed trains.Explore more on these topicsSpainTrain crashesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I’m not being controlled, I’m standing up for myself for the first time in my life.“For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.“Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they’ll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.”View image in fullscreenVictoria and David Beckham after he was knighted last year.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/AFP/Getty ImagesNicola, who is the daughter of the American billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz and former model Claudia Heffner Peltz, married Brooklyn in 2022.He is the eldest son of the former England footballer and his fashion designer wife. The couple are also parents to sons Cruz and Romeo, and daughter Harper.Brooklyn added: “My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn’t stopped.“My mum cancelled making Nicola’s dress in the 11th hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress.“Weeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife and our future children.“They were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated. My holdout affected the payday and they have never treated me the same since.“During the wedding planning, my mum went so far as to call me ‘evil’ because Nicola and I chose to include my Nanny Sandra, and Nicola’s Nanny at our table, because they both didn’t have their husbands. Both of our parents had their own tables equally adjacent to ours.”The statement continued: “Since the moment I started standing up for myself with my family, I’ve received endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders.“Even my brothers were sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last summer.”Brooklyn went on to claim that his mother “hijacked” his first dance with Nicola and danced “inappropriately on me” in front of their guests, adding that he had never felt more “uncomfortable or humiliated” in his entire life.He also alleged that his wife has been “disrespected” by his family and that she was not invited to his dad’s 50th birthday party.Brooklyn continued: “My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family ‘love’ is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it’s at the expense of our professional obligations.“The narrative that my wife controls me is completely backwards.

TodayItalyloses a legend, but his legacy will continue to inspire generations. Thank you for everything.”Known simply as Valentino, the designer was renowned for his opulent and elegant take on fashion that attracted famous fans. He founded his house in 1959 and could soon count Sophia Loren and Elizabeth Taylor among his devotees. He designed the clothes worn by Monica Vitti in Michelangelo Antonioni’s film La Notte in 1961, while Jackie Kennedy wore his clothes for several years in the 1960s. In 1966, sheurged him to “live 100 years!”She went on to marry Aristotle Onassis in 1968, wearing a Valentino wedding dress.The red dress was Valentino’s signature item, part of his aesthetic from the very start. His first collection featured a red tulle dress called the Fiesta. The shade of red that he has used – halfway between crimson and poppy – is now so well known that it is officially recognised by the colour authority Pantone.View image in fullscreenThe red dress was Valentino’s signature item.Photograph: Nebinger-Taamallah/Abaca/ShutterstockValentino was at the top of the fashion game for more than 45 years –retiring in 2007, after a final haute couture show where every model wore a red dress. During his career he was on speed dial to an increasingly A-list coterie of women: models including Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer were often seen wearing his clothes off the catwalk, while film stars such as Julia Roberts, Laura Linney and Penélope Cruz wore his designs on the red carpet. Diana, Princess of Wales, wore his designs in the years after her divorce.Arguably, glamour was there from the start. The designer was born in 1932, in Voghera, a town near Milan, and named after the Italian actor Rudolph Valentino by his mother. Childhood experiences were formative to his future career. Helater saidhis love of red came from a visit to the opera, watching Carmen. “All the women in the boxes were mostly dressed in red, and they leaned forward like geraniums on balconies, and the seats and drapes were red too … I realised that after black and white, there was no finer colour,” he said.Valentino was an apprentice to the designers Jean Dessès, Christian Dior and Guy Laroche, moving to Paris as a young man. A year after he began his own label at 27, with financial backing from his family, he met Giancarlo Giammetti, who became his romantic partner and business partner –initially saving the business from bankruptcy. An all-white collection in 1962 brought him to the attention of the fashion world.Although their romantic relationship ended in 1972, Giammetti and Valentino ensured the label became known throughout the world. In 1998, they sold the company to HdP, an Italian conglomerate, for about $300m. It is now owned by the Qatari investment fund Mayhoola, whileKering holds a 30% stake.If the label dressed the rich and beautiful, Valentino and Giammetti dressed the part and lived the life too. Valentino was always impeccably dressed in a suit, with a deep suntan (interviewing the designer for the Observer in 2012, Decca Aitkenheaddescribedhis complexion as “dipped upside down in lacquer”). The 2008 filmValentino: The Last Emperordocumented the duo’s jetset lifestyle – showcasing private jets, five homes, yachts and six pampered pugs, as well as the preparation of the designer’s final collection.View image in fullscreenValentino with Elizabeth Hurley at Cannes in 2007.Photograph: Guignebourg Denis/ABACA/ShutterstockValentino’s life was not without controversy. In the interview with Aitkenhead, he complained about the idea of bringing models of different sizes to the catwalk and the fact that theatregoers were becoming too casual. He recalled his horror at seeing a fellow audience member dressed in a T-shirt: “No, oh my gosh. [It was] not very clean. And a Bermuda short and a flip-flop on the foot.”His ideas on female beauty were also controversial. He told RTL television in 2007: “When I see somebody and unfortunately she’s relaxed and running around in jogging trousers and without any makeup … I feel very sorry. For me, woman is like a beautiful, beautiful flower bouquet. She has always to be sensational, always to please, always to be perfect, always to please the husband, the lover, everybody. Because we are born to show ourselves always at our best.”In 2007, Alessandra Facchinetti was appointed creative director of the house after the retirement of Valentino. Just 12 months latershe was dismissedand replaced by Pierpaolo Piccioli and Maria Grazia Chiuri. Following the departure of Grazia Chiuri in 2016, Piccioli was named as sole creative director. He held the role until 2024 when it was announced that the former Gucci designer Alessandro Michele was taking over.Explore more on these topicsFashionItalyDressesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Hillsborough law is one of the Starmer government’s flagship policies.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesHillsborough disasterExplainerHillsborough law: what is happening and why is it dangerous for Starmer?Amendment to bring intelligence agencies into legislation’s scope has prompted a fierce backlashJosh HallidayNorth of England editorMon 19 Jan 2026 08.25 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 08.27 ESTShareAlmost 40 years after the Hillsborough stadium disaster, which claimed the lives of 97 people, the families of those killed or injured reached a milestone last year in their long struggle for justice.It came in the form of the Hillsborough law, which would compel public bodies and officials, such as the police, NHS and local authorities, to assist investigations with full and truthful information or face criminal sanctions.In practice, it would mean that those who lie, evade or withhold information would face prosecution, potentially resulting in prison sentences.But the Hillsborough law has hit a significant roadblock. Here we explain what has happened and what may happen next.Why is the Hillsborough law so significant?This legislation – officially called the public authority (accountability) bill – seeks to address concerns that public bodies have been able to withhold information or mislead investigations in which they face criticism.The most high-profile example of this is the Hillsborough disaster, in which a crush during an FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 led to the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans. More than 100 witness statements given by police officers were found to have been amended to remove or change comments unfavourable to South Yorkshire police, who were responsible for fan safety on the day.In 2016, nearly30 yearsafter the disaster, a landmark inquest found that those who died were unlawfully killed – and that the behaviour of Liverpool fans played no part in the tragedy, as officers had claimed.For Keir Starmer, the Hillsborough law is one of his government’s flagship policies. He placed it at the heart of his speech to Labour party conference in September, where he was introduced on stage by Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James died in the disaster. With this new law, hesaid, “injustice has no place to hide”.What is happening now?Last week, Labour introduced a new amendment to the bill that would bring intelligence agencies such as MI5 and MI6 into its scope – subject to the approval of the chief of those services.In practice, this would mean spies would be compelled to give full, honest and transparent evidence to inquiries regardless of whether it would be unfavourable to the agency.However, campaigners said this allowed intelligence officials to decide what information is released to investigators, potentially allowing cover-ups to continue. It prompted a fierce backlash from many Labour MPs, mayors and families of the victims.The government pulled this amendment late on Sunday, just 24 hours before it was due to be laid in parliament, in the wake of the criticism.Why is this so damaging for Labour?Starmer has wedded himself to the Hillsborough law – it was one of the key pledges in Labour’s 2024manifesto– so failing to introduce it in full would be hugely politically damaging.Paula Barker, the Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree,saidthe government’s insistence on the amendment would feel like the “ultimate betrayal” to the people of Liverpool. Other Labour MPs said a watered down bill was “untenable and unacceptable”.Charlotte Hennessy, whose father, James, died in the tragedy, said the bill was “95% there” but urged the spy clause to be dropped, telling Starmer: “Please don’t destroy all that we have achieved.”Labour has been accused of backtracking or U-turning on several policies since it was elected last June. But failing to pass a full Hillsborough law would be one of the most politically toxic.What happens next?The Hillsborough law is due to enter its penultimate stage in the House of Commons on Monday before going to the House of Lords.Ministers said on Sunday they would meet with campaigners and MPs to discuss any planned changes that may be introduced when it reaches the Lords.This, then, is a critical stage. MPs and campaigners have vowed not to support any “weakened” bill and losing their backing could delay the law being introduced and be hugely damaging for the prime minister.The campaign group Hillsborough Law Now said on Monday that the pause was “frustrating” but “gives the chance for government to listen further”. It added: “The Hillsborough law must leave the Commons with the families’ support.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLabourexplainersShareReuse this content"

What if this was the year we finally learned to rest?Madeleine AggelerMon 19 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 12.06 ESTShareEvery new year – after the holiday glut of travel, parties, shopping and baked goods – there can be pressure to do and be more: more active, more productive, more creative, more thrifty. Maybe this will be the year I finally start meal planning or doing morning pages. New year, new me!But what if the thing we needed more of was to do less? What if this was the year we finally learned to rest?“We all involuntarily participate in the stress Olympics, and are aware that the busiest person wins gold,” says Amelia Nagoski, co-author ofBurnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle.In a culture that glamorizes hard work, sacrifice and the grind, rest is often seen as self-indulgent and lazy, Nagoski says.Not only does this attitude leave us worn out, it’s counterproductive. “Rest is what helps us function at our highest level of capacity,” says DrSaundra Dalton-Smith, a physician andauthorof Sacred Rest. Although many people are accustomed to pushing through feelings of tiredness, doing so generally results in a lower quality of work.So why not start this year more energized and less depleted? Here’s how to start resting.What is rest?“Rest is anything that gives you more energy,” says Nagoski.This doesn’t necessarily mean a cessation of activities, she adds: “Sometimes, it’s just doing different things.”Indeed, the most restorative rest is often more active than passive, argues Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, author ofRest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less.“That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with sitting on the couch with a bag of salty snacks in one hand and the TV remote in another,” he says. “But the things that deliver the biggest restorative bang for your buck are things like going for a walk, spending time in nature or exercising.”What are the biggest obstacles to rest?If a twisted scientist were to sit down and invent a society designed to de-legitimize rest, it would look a lot like ours, says Pang.“We all come with decades of cultural programming that tells us that in order to succeed, we have to spend enormous amounts of time at work,” he says.There is another, more personal obstacle: many people don’t know what kind of rest they need. As we’ll see below, there are many ways to catch a break.Take rest seriouslySo you’re finally open to throwing off the yoke of overwork. But how does one actually incorporate more rest into their lives? If you’ve read this far, that’s a good start. “If you’re asking this question, you’re taking rest seriously,” says Pang. “That’s the first thing you’ve got to do.”Look at how you workIf you are in a job that allows you to have some control over your schedule, Pang suggests combining periods of deep, focused work – 90 minutes to two hours – with breaks of about half an hour. The break could be running errands, going for a walk or having lunch – anything that’s not work.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’If your job does not have a predictable schedule, Pang recommends better preserving nights and weekends. He points tostudiesthatshowthat people who have better boundaries between work and non-work time are more likely to have longer, happier careers.Think about what kind of rest you needWhen she worked in a hospital ICU, Dalton-Smith said she got eight hours of sleep a night, but still felt exhausted most days. Eventually, she realized the rest she needed was emotional, because the amount of energy required to appear calm in the face of horrible situations was leaving her depleted.Drawing on Dalton-Smith’s work, theAmerican Psychological Associationput together examples of how to practice the seven types of rest:Physical rest: making sure you get enough sleep; taking naps.Mental rest: journaling; meditating; doing tasks that are not mentally taxing, like puzzles.Emotional rest: talking through feelings and experiences with a friend or therapist.Social rest: setting aside time alone to recharge; making sure you’re spending time with people who don’t leave you feeling drained.Sensory rest: spending time outdoors; taking breaks from screens.Creative rest: engaging in creative hobbies like drawing, reading or dancing.Spiritual rest: connecting to a cause or tradition that feels meaningful to you.Enlist others for helpPerhaps the most important and effective way to incorporate more rest into your life is to recruit other people in your efforts.Nagoski explains that she and her twin sister, sex educator and researcher Emily Nagoski, were inspired to write Burnout together after Amelia ended up in an emergency room with stress-induced illness. “My sister drove two-and-a-half hours to the hospital and fed me a big stack of journal articles about rest and the importance of overcoming burnout,” Nagoski says.Experts agree this kind of care and support – reminding loved ones that their wellbeing is more important than work – is essential to pushing back against a culture of overwork.“All these external pressures to sacrifice and give everything you have to give – it’s like a rushing river,” Nagoski says. “If you try to stand against it alone, you’re going to get washed away really fast. But if you surround yourself with people who care about your wellbeing as much as you care about theirs, you can all stand together, and that’s the only way to resist the river.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s worth investing in a quality pair that fits well, and they’ll last for years if you look after them.

I’ve hiked thousands of miles in more than 100 different pairs of boots, and worn them everywhere from the summit of Mount Kenya to my favourite local trails in Cornwall and the Cotswolds. I’ve also just finished working on two UK walking guides – a great excuse to put on my boots and go exploring.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I wore each pair on at least 10 miles of trails.’Photograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianThe only way to determine if a hiking boot is up to scratch is to put in the miles, and the boots I’ve recommended came along for a good walk in the wild. I wore each pair on at least 10 miles of trails, ranging from Lake District fells and the South West Coast Path to wild-camping walks on Dartmoor. I’ve been able to test some boots over several months – I’ve walked more than 40 miles in the Lowa Innovos, for example, so I can feel that they’re built to last.My first criterion when picking a hiking boot is waterproofing, so I made sure each boot was stomped through puddles and squished through mud (including an interesting detour into a Lake District bog). I also look for boots that fit like a glove (or should that be sock?), with a snug-fitting ankle, a bouncy sole and a comfy inner sole, so my feet feel cushioned over long distances.The boots called in to test for this article will be donated to theJulian Trust night shelterin Bristol, which gives outdoor kit to homeless people.The best women’s walking boots in 2026View image in fullscreen‘The comfiest hiking boots I tested’: the Lowa Innovo GTX mid.Photograph: Mary Spender/The GuardianBest walking boot overall:Lowa Innovo GTX midLowaInnovo GTX midfrom£113.99£113.99 at SportsShoes£190 at Cotswold OutdoorWhat we loveReliable performance, comfy female-specific fitWhat we don’t loveThey’re wide, so won’t suit hikers with narrow feetPhotograph: Mary Spender/The Guardian£113.99 at SportsShoes£190 at Cotswold OutdoorI always recommend Lowa to those who want to invest in a comfy boot that can tackle most terrain, and this year the brand’s Innovo GTX boot was the best all-rounder I tested. These waterproof boots have grippy soles and a high, close-fitting ankle, but still feel light and easy to wear all day, and on various surfaces.Why we love themI’ve owned a pair ofLowa Renegadesfor years, so I can vouch for the brand’s performance over time, and after five or six wears, I think the Innovos are even better. These sturdy-looking boots are surprisingly lightweight, at 418g per shoe, and are warm enough to feel comfortable through British winters, but just about breathable enough to use in summer.These were also the comfiest hiking boots I tested and can be laced up snugly to support your ankles. They feel light and springy underfoot, making them a treat to wear even on long journeys and multiday walking holidays. Lowa uses a female-specific last (the foot-shaped tool used to craft shoes), and these boots are wide enough to suit women with bunions or who tend to get blisters. Sizing is on the bigger side – try these on at home before you head for the hills. There’s also alow trainer versionthat would be a nice swap for summer.It’s a shame that …they’re not the lightest boots on test – and they fit on the wide side.Suitable for:day hikes on varied terrainMaterial:suede and fabricWaterproofing:Gore-TexSole:Lowa Terra TracSizes available:3½-9LowaInnovo GTX midfrom£113.99£113.99 at SportsShoes£190 at Cotswold OutdoorWhat we loveReliable performance, comfy female-specific fitWhat we don’t loveThey’re wide, so won’t suit hikers with narrow feetBest budget walking boots:Regatta Holcombe IIIRegattaHolcombe IIIfrom£40£40 at Debenhams£40 at DecathlonWhat we loveGreat value if you’re buying your first hiking bootsWhat we don’t loveLimited grip, but great on groomed country trails£40 at DebenhamsFrom £40 at DecathlonGood hiking boots can be painfully expensive, but there are still some bargains to be had out there. Regatta’s Holcombe III boots feel light and lovely to wear from the get-go, and they’re good value for hiking boots that are waterproof enough to withstand rainfall.Why we love themThe Holcombe IIIs are pleasingly comfortable, feeling much like trainers when you pop them on. They have supportive insoles and a cushioned collar that laces up snugly around your ankles. These boots are fully waterproof but don’t have the most grippy soles I tested, so they’re better for exploring groomed paths rather than trekking on challenging rocky ground. They’re not warm in bitter winter, either. But they come into their own on casual country walks and spring and summer treks, offering all-day comfort, repelling rain and proving breathable in hot weather.If you’re on a budget, are buying your first pair of walking boots or simply don’t need a hiker designed for all-mountain terrain, these boots are a steal that’ll give you confidence (and dry feet, of course!) on relaxed weekend hikes or walking holidays abroad.It’s a shame that …they offer limited grip and warmth.Suitable for:day walks in warmer weatherMaterial:polyurethane and polyesterWaterproofing:IsotexSole:EVASizes available:3-8RegattaHolcombe IIIfrom£40£40 at Debenhams£40 at DecathlonWhat we loveGreat value if you’re buying your first hiking bootsWhat we don’t loveLimited grip, but great on groomed country trailsBest waterproof boots:Scarpa Ranger 2ScarpaRanger 2£230£230 at Go OutdoorsWhat we loveOutstanding grip meets good ankle supportWhat we don’t loveToo warm for the dog days of summer£230 at Go OutdoorsScarpa has taken a perennially popular leather boot and made it more lightweight with this second iteration of the Ranger. The result may look like a retro leather hiking boot, but it’s bang up to date thanks to Gore-Tex waterproofing and the natural waterproofness of leather, plus great Vibram soles.Why we love themOut on the trail, the Ranger 2s impressed me with their great grip and stability.The Vibram outsole’s robust tread bites well on slick paths, loose scree and muddy trails, giving me confident footing wherever I roamed while testing them on the South West Coast Path. They’re supportive without feeling clunky and require very little breaking in – rare for leather boots.The ankle support is another highlight: snug enough to keep my feet steady on uneven ground, and with a padded collar to help to seal out rain and grit.

If you tend to sprain or roll your ankles on tough ground, as I do, this boot’s design is perfect for protecting them and keeping you striding along confidently. The grip on these boots was reassuringly sticky even when I tested it on wet rock and scree, and there’s a solid rubber toe box to further protect your feet from knocks and bumps.The sole and body of the Trekker Pro II felt more structured than other boots I tested, but didn’t weigh me down, rub or feel restrictive, and combined with a well-made insole, made my high arches feel supported and protected, mile after mile.It’s a shame that …they’re expensive and too warm for summer.Suitable for:cold-weather adventuresMaterial:suede and fabricWaterproofing: Gore-TexSole:VibramSizes available:4-8½AkuTrekker Pro II£255£255 at AkuWhat we loveGood ankle and arch supportWhat we don’t loveToo insulated to work in warm weatherBest lightweight walking boots:Keen LeikiKeenLeikifrom£87£87 at Keen£101.50 at Outdoor and CountryWhat we loveThese light and comfy kicks feel like (grippy) trainersWhat we don’t loveThe wide fit won’t work for all; not warm enough for winterPhotograph: Mary Spender/The Guardian£87 at Keen£101.50 at Outdoor and CountryKeen’s Leiki boots feel as light and breathable to wear as your favourite pair of trainers; if warm-weather wear and comfort are top of your wishlist, these lightweight boots are ideal.

They wicked away sweat well on mild days and so far, have proved waterproof on wetter ones. Anti-odour insoles are effective at reducing, if not eliminating, sweaty smells after long days of walking, making these boots a good choice for taking on your next walking holiday abroad.If you like the look and feel of leather but don’t want its usual stiffness and weight, this is a great choice.

Hanwag’s boots have always performed well on test for me, and the Nazcat II is one of its hardier designs for women, built with more challenging terrain in mind.Why we love themSolid as a rock, the Nazcat IIs feel ready for mountain summits and multiday slogs through hill and high water. I tested these boots in the Lake District, and they proved happy in heavy rain and when striding through puddles. Thick soles and a solid toe box protect feet on rocks and grip well on wet surfaces, and plush, soft leather means these boots are comfy and flexible but warm enough to wear in winter. I like the soft yet snug-fitting collar, too.All that good stuff does make these boots feel a touch heavy, at 650g each, although the chunky soles and cushioned insoles go some way to mitigate that.

These barefoot-style boots have flat, flexible soles designed to let your feet move naturally while still offering protection on rough terrain. They feel strange to walk in initially, but I liked feeling the ground beneath my feet more closely than in a traditional hiker, and these barely there boots are lightweight and freeing at just 326g per shoe.I like the retro styling of these boots, but I wouldn’t recommend the white version, which will look dirty at the first glimpse of mud – stick to the brown colourway. Although these boots do feature a waterproof membrane, I found the canvas uppers eventually soaked through in heavy rain or when immersed in a puddle during testing. These attractive boots are very breathable and cool, though, so they’re well suited to summer hikes when the forecast is for light rain at worst.They didn’t make the final cut because …they’re not ideal for wet or cold conditions, and the white will look dirty fast.Suitable for:dry warm conditions;material:canvas and suede;waterproofing:waterproof membrane;sole:rubber;sizes available:4½-8½Xero ShoesRidgeway£170£170 at Xero ShoesWhat we loveBarefoot boots might just transform the way you trekWhat we don’t loveThe Ridgeways aren’t fully waterproof – or very warmDanner N45DannerN45£230£230 at DannerWhat we loveThey’re rather gorgeous – and pleasingly comfortableWhat we don’t loveNot much!

These all-American hiking boots have a cult following, and they’re perfect for comfort and performance on the hills.The midsole is cushioning and bouncy; the Vibram outer sole offers reassuring grip; and Gore-Tex makes sure they’re waterproof even in heavy rain. I did find the ankles of the N45 too wide to give good support, though, so I’d only wear them on groomed paths rather than challenging hikes. Danner offers arecrafting service, extending the life of your boots by replacing the soles if they ever wear out, so despite being expensive, the N45s could technically last forever.They didn’t make the final cut because …they’re expensive and the ankles are wide.Suitable for:comfortable casual walks;material:nylon and polyester;waterproofing:Gore-Tex;sole:Vibram;sizes available:7-13DannerN45£230£230 at DannerWhat we loveThey’re rather gorgeous – and pleasingly comfortableWhat we don’t loveNot much!

The mesh upper is reinforced with protective toe and heel caps, so the Peakfreak Rush was also great on unstable, rocky terrain.At 332g, these boots are liberatingly lightweight, but I found sizing and fit let them down – my usual size of a UK 6 was too small and narrow. While you could simply size up, I haven’t included the Peakfreak Rush in my top picks here because other customers report that the excellent out-of-the-box waterproofing can fade over time, so you’re likely to need to re-waterproof them down the line.They didn’t make the final cut because …they fit on the small and narrow side, and waterproofing may not last.Suitable for:wet conditions;material:fabric;waterproofing:OutDry;sole:Adapt Trax;sizes available:3-10ColumbiaPeakfreak Rush Midfrom£89.99£125 at Columbia£89.99 at AmazonWhat we loveHeavy rain forecast?

Leather is warm, long-lasting and naturally waterproof, while fabric boots tend to be lighter and more breathable, but less durable.Stiff leather boots have traditionally required some breaking in, although these days many leather boots feel comfortable right out of the box. Leather boots tend to require more care to prevent them from cracking. Warm, insulated leather is better for winter use, while breathable fabric performs best in warmer weather – if you can afford to, it’s a good idea to invest in a pair of each, so you can tackle hikes in all seasons.WaterproofingYour new boots should be waterproof, rather than just water-resistant, so you can go adventuring in all kinds of weather. Water-resistant boots use durable water repellent (DWR) treatments to repel rain, while waterproof boots also use a membrane that blocks water but lets sweat out, so your feet can breathe. Boots may use branded or own-brand waterproofing technology – Gore-Tex (or GTX) is one of the best-known (and best-performing) waterproof technologies.How to choose a waterproof jacket: prices, features and fabrics demystifiedRead moreFitAlways try hiking boots on in person and take along the hiking socks you’ll wear on walks. Check that boots feel comfortable when tightly laced, with plenty of wriggle room for toes and with a nicely supported ankle and heel. You’ll find high-, mid- and low-cut hiking boots on sale: higher-cut boots are best for hiking on challenging terrain as they offer ankle support. Wider feet? Look for boots that specify a wide fit, especially if you have bunions.How much to spendI often shop secondhand or choose more affordable models when I’m buying outdoor kit, but hiking boots are an exception: buy new and spend as much as you can afford. New boots will mould to your feet over time for a custom fit, and you’ll know they’re still waterproof and that their soles are sound from the get-go. Most decent hiking boots for women cost £150 and up, but it’s worth spending as much as you can afford and looking after them for years to come. Clean your boots after use, treat leather regularly and re-waterproof if needed; they’ll take you on many an adventure.What to do with worn-out, old bootsby Paddy MaddisonYou can practise rigorous boot care, but if you use your boots the way they’re supposed to be used, they will eventually wear out. When that happens, you have a few options.DonateIf there’s some life left in your boots, you might be able to take them to a charity shop or a shoe bank. Just be mindful that these types of places waste lots of time disposing of items that aren’t fit for sale, so don’t donate if the boots are falling apart.RepurposeYour old boots might not be fit for hiking any more, but could you extend their life by using them in the garden or for walking the dog instead?RepairIf you have leather boots and the sole has worn out, there’s a chance you may be able to have them repaired. Resoling is a common service offered by most cobblers, and you can find ones that are used to dealing with walking boots by searching theVibram website.RecycleSome outdoor retailers and brands run recycling programmes where they take old kit, including boots, and rehome or repurpose them.Cotswold Outdoorgoes as far as to put recycling points in many of its stores. If the boots are wearable or repairable, they’ll be given a second life with one of many participating charities around the world. If they’re completely done, they’ll be stripped down and used for their materials instead.For more:The best waterproof jackets for womenThe best hiking essentialsThe best walking boots for menSian Lewis is an award-winning freelance outdoors and travel journalist and author who loves putting adventure kit through its paces while hiking, swimming and wild camping.

What absolutely rubbish behaviour this is. You make me sick.Because I happen to know things?No, because you go around rubbing it in everyone’s faces. You know what you are?At a push, based on context, I’d wager that I’m disgustingly educated.Exactly! Everyone’s at it, you know. I’ve had enough.Enough of education?No, because it’s not school or uni that makes you disgustingly educated. You get it from – shudder – wanting to improve yourself.An example, please.In 2024, corners of Reddit started to fill up with guides on how to become disgustingly educated. Some were lists of improving books, nonfiction essays or old films.So far so good.But now it’s all over the place. EvenTikTokis full of people telling users to read specific books if they want to boost their knowledge of Greek mythology or extinction cycles or emotional intelligence.What’s wrong with that?Because it’s just reading books, isn’t it? It’s something that people have managed to do for thousands of years without making a fuss, and now it’s being rebranded by TikTokers as a sign of extreme cleverness.Well, yes, but those old-timey people didn’t have phones.Oh, I see. So this is less about being an autodidact and more about making a show of improving your attention span and impulse control by going offline for meaningful periods of time?That seems about right.And the thing that’s going to encourage that is videos of influencers telling you to read about ancient Egypt?Don’t be a snob.I’m not being a snob. I’m just worried that a trend like this going viral on something as shallow as TikTok will lead to a rise of pseudointellectualism. The achievement of actually knowing things is going to be superseded by a grim desire to simply look as if you know things for likes.That’s definitely a danger, but in this day and age it’s a start.I guess you’re right. Maybe it isn’t such a bad thing. After all, you’re disgustingly educated enough to know the etymology of the word “gross”.Actually, I looked that up on ChatGPT.Oh.

His style was a model of critical integrity – authoritative and intelligent, sometimes enthusiastic and sometimes slightly grumpy, dry-humoured yet never showy.Music may say things that words cannot express, but he mastered the rare art of putting music into words, always using language with precision; reading him, you knew what a performance had sounded like. Best known for championing new music with tireless devotion, Andrew had much wider musical interests than many realised.However, music was only one of his passions. Topping the list of other fascinations were natural history and Latin American literature, and these strands all came together when he reviewed the world premiere of Peter Eötvös’s opera Love and Other Demons – based on Gabriel García Márquez – at Glyndebourne in summer 2008. Welcoming the work, Andrewended his reviewby saying that only the production disappointed “for its failure to evoke any real sense of place, despite the lavish use of video projections full of writhing bodies, insects and reptiles; someone might have pointed out to [the director] that there are no chameleons in South America”.‘He was, above all, a treasured spirit, who understood how vital music is for the human soul’: tributes to Andrew ClementsRead moreWith such wide interests, Andrew could have taken several professional paths but worked in music journalism – at times as an editor as well as writer – almost all his adult life. But his first job after graduating was in the editorial department of the Open University, where he met Kate (Kathryn) Coltman. They married, and had two daughters, Lara and Holly; they separated in the 1990s.Andrew served as music critic of the New Statesman for 11 years from 1977, also contributing to Time Out. He had a brief spell (1987-88) as editor of the Musical Times, and wrote for many years (1979-93) for the Financial Times, not only on classical music but also as the paper’s rock and pop critic. Later, in a Guardian classical review he would say that Brian Wilson’sGod Only Knowswas still the most perfect pop song.Overlapping with his writing, Andrew was commissioning editor for books on music at Faber & Faber (the publisher’s connection to poets and poetry was not lost on him), midwifing several significant titles. He first wrote for Opera magazine in 1983 and joined its editorial board in 1990. When he succeededEdward Greenfieldon the Guardian in August 1993, the appointment was clinched at least in part by a recommendation from the pianistAlfred Brendel.An unstinting admirer of some of the most challenging composers –Harrison Birtwistle,Luigi Nono,Elliott Carter,Luciano Berio,Helmut Lachenmann,Pierre BoulezandIannis Xenakisamong them – Andrew also lent critical support to many less well-known names in contemporary music.He also had a fondness for the English pastoralist composers of the early- and mid-20th century, and indeed had grown up in Hucclecote, a village that has become a suburb of Gloucester. His mother, Linda, a domestic science teacher before her marriage, was from the Forest of Dean; his father, Joseph, who had grown up on a small family farm in Down Hatherley, to the north of Gloucester, made aeroplane parts for Dowty Aviation.An only child, Andrew attended The Crypt school, a grammar in Gloucester, and was the first member of his family to go to university. He studied theoretical physics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and played the flute in a university orchestra. Contemporaries remember him as a little unsocial and enigmatic – qualities that later allowed him to maintain a professional distance and to write without fear or favour.With such a background, Andrew was well placed to attend the Cheltenham music festival during its vintage years, and also the Three Choirs festival; this was his first musical landscape, and Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius held special appeal. He would remain more committed than most critics to covering the regional scene.In 1992 he became a director of the Holst Foundation, honouring the Cheltenham-born composer, and the poetry of Ivor Gurney meant a great deal to him. Reading the Guardian’s Country Diary was a daily ritual (as was doing the paper’s Cryptic Crossword).Music was not in the family, but his parents had been keen gardeners and lovers of the countryside. Andrew started collecting plants as a boy and was soon ordering Bhutan alpine seeds and indexing specimens. Birds, amphibians and reptiles were special interests, and he kept many creatures as pets – on one occasion, some burglars are said to have been frightened off by his poison dart frogs.A holiday in Crete in 1979 – his first trip abroad – made a huge impression on him, and Greece would remain one of his favourite countries for the rest of his life. Bird-watching took him the length of South America, from Costa Rica to Ecuador and the Amazon to Patagonia. This he often did with his partner Amanda Holden, the opera librettist and translator, with whom he lived in London for several years.She died in 2021.Andrew, who I was lucky to count as a colleague and friend for three decades, contributed to The New Grove Dictionary of Music, The New Grove Dictionary of Opera and The New Penguin Opera Guide. He wrote a compact account of the composerMark-Anthony Turnage(2000). In opera, he responded not just musically but had a strong sense of theatre.Pianists and the piano literature were close to his heart, andhis penultimate reviewfor the Guardian, of previously unpublished recordings by Radu Lupu, had a valedictory feel: “Of the many hundreds of pianists I must have heard in more than 50 years of recital going, a multitude that has included many of the greatest names of the 20th century, none gave me more consistent pleasure or a greater sense of wonder.”An illness starting in early 2025 meant that Andrew’slast concert review(of the Dunedin Consort) appeared in early March. Despite these difficulties, he retained the sense of humour that countered an often gruff exterior. From his home in Oxfordshire he continued reviewing recordings; his final piece, about Nadia Boulanger’s operaLa Ville Morte, was written just before Christmas and published at the start of January, by which time he had contracted the flu that led to his death.Kate survives him, along with Lara, Holly and two grandchildren.Andrew Joseph Clements, music critic, born 15 September 1950; died 11 January 2026Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe GuardianPop and rockNew StatesmanTime OutMagazinesEdward ElgarobituariesShareReuse this content"

It is currently the most watched film on Netflix, because it is a Netflix movie. So how is Damon choosing to promote his new Netflix movie? By kind of laying into Netflix.During an interview on The Joe Rogan Experience, Damon went to great lengths to describe the differences between going to see a film theatrically and watching it on television. Explaining his experience of watchingOne Battle After Anotherin an Imax screening, Damon said: “I always say it’s more like going to church – you show up at an appointed time. It doesn’t wait for you.”Making something that you know will be primarily watched onNetflix, on the other hand, means resigning yourself to a lack of concentration. Maybe the lights are on. Maybe you’re watching it in chunks. Maybe your kids won’t shut up. Damon told Rogan that the streamer asks film-makers to dumb things down a little, adding a big action set piece early on to keep viewers interested, and advising them that: “It wouldn’t be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they’re watching.” Describing this, Damon added: “It’s going to really start to infringe on how we’re telling these stories.”View image in fullscreenThey are cops, going after a drug gang, or something like that … Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in The Rip.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/PANow, there are three ways to take this. The first is: well, duh. If you’ve ever watched anything on Netflix, you’ll know that what Damon said is completely true. If the streaming era of film-making has a signature tell, it’s that things quite often have to be slowed down and explained to us over and over again like we’re a bunch of children.It isn’t a film, but the last season of Stranger Things was a perfect demonstration of that. In fact, I’m convinced that its episodes were so long because, before anything actually happened on the show, some characters had to slowly explain exactly what they were about to do. This arguably reached its nadir in a scene where someone literally used some props to carefully reiterate the plot so far, which is the storytelling equivalent of watching a pub bore demonstrate the offside rule with beermats.There are exceptions to the rule, of course – typically if Netflix thinks it’s got a sniff of an Oscar, maybe with aFrankensteinor aTrain Dreams, then directors are usually allowed to be as oblique as they want. But aside from that we should all sit down, shut up and wait to be spoonfed.The second takeaway is that maybe, just maybe, Netflix knows what it’s talking about. Obviously it’s very depressing to think that the owner-elect of Warner Bros thinks that anyone who watches anything is a distracted, attentionless idiot. Had this always been the case, then there is an enormous possibility that 2001: A Space Odyssey would have had a wacky sidekick who kept asking David Bowman what all the whizzy colours mean.View image in fullscreenPay attention … Matt Damon in The Odyssey.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyHowever, Netflix is also in possession of a colossal amount of granular viewing data. It knows what we watch, why we watch it and how long we watch it for. And this is plain, concrete data that doesn’t deign to flatter us with highbrow assumptions. It has looked into its crystal ball and seen that we’re all just a bunch of slack-jawed apes who watch things with one hand gripping our phones and the other shoved down the front of our trousers. In other words, if Netflix says that we need to have the plot explained to us over and over again, it’s because it has run the numbers and knows that we do.But obviously we shouldn’t ignore the third takeaway here, which is that Damon is a few months away from the biggest hit of his entire career. As the star of Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey, Damon knows that he’s about to feature in a huge, theatrical-first spectacular that will probably play with the concept of time and (whisper it) in all likelihood be quite hard to follow at times. And he knows that it’s going to make a billion dollars, which gives him quite a strong position to crap on Netflix.That said, if Netflix had made The Odyssey then Damon would have kept halting the action to explain why so many characters have such similar names. And it probably would have made two billion dollars, because this is what we deserve.Explore more on these topicsFilmMatt DamonNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What else is this ‘board of peace’?Owen JonesBlair, Putin, Erdoğan, Orbán: the names of those invited to serve say it all. And it's about so much more than GazaMon 19 Jan 2026 13.27 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 17.39 ESTShareThe fate of the Palestinian people offers a warning about the future of humanity. When I recently visited the West Bank, Palestinians kept impressing the same point on me: Israel has turned their land into a laboratory. The technology of oppression that it has deployed – including in its genocide in Gaza – ranges from hi-tech surveillance to military drones and AI on the battlefield. These technologies have beenexportedto oppressive states across the world. And it doesn’t stop there.This brings us to Donald Trump’s “board of peace”, now set to rule Gaza. In the sleepy Oxfordshire village of Sutton Courtenay, where George Orwell lies buried, the ground itself ought to be shaking. This isn’t peace. It’s naked neocolonialism.Not a single seat is reserved for a Palestinian, let alone a survivor of Gaza. Trump will serve as chair in an individual capacity rather than as US president – in other words, as Gaza’s emperor. Its invited members include Tony Blair, who is despised across the Middle East as an architect of the illegal invasion of Iraq. If you’re curious about his skill set when it comes to rebuilding ravaged Arab territory, recall what the Chilcot inquiryconcludedabout that catastrophe: “the UK failed to plan or prepare for the major reconstruction programme required in Iraq”.Who else? At least two property developers, including Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whoonce boastedof the “very valuable” potential of Gaza’s “waterfront property”. Hungary’s far-right autocrat Viktor Orbán. An Israeli billionaire, Yakir Gabay, and an Americanprivate equity tycoon, Marc Rowan. Vladimir Putin, who helped pioneer reducing predominantly Muslim lands to rubble in Chechnya, also has an invite,according to the Kremlin. Sure,Israel isn’t happy, presumably because the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been invited. Nothing but total control of Gaza would satisfy them – but that is little consolation for its traumatised Palestinian population.The clues about where this is heading are hardly subtle. Trump isdemanding $1bn from each countryto be a permanent member, and the draft of the charter appears to suggest, as per Bloomberg, that he will control the money. A year ago, heproposedpermanently resettling Gaza’s population: ethnic cleansing. He posted an AI-generated video showcasing Gaza as a luxury resort, featuring a giant golden statue of himself.It would be naive to assume that he has abandoned such plans, even if pressure from Arab statesappears to have had some effectlast year, when he said “nobody is expelling any Palestinians”. That was clear in little-noticed comments he made at a recent press conference withBenjamin Netanyahu – the Israeli prime ministerwanted by the international criminal courton charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Trump suggested that if Gaza’s population “were given the opportunity to live in a better climate, they would move. They’re there because they sort of have to be.”He leaned on polling suggesting almost half of Gaza’s populationwould leave. Hardly surprising: the territory has been reduced to apocalyptic ruin, its survivors living in tents, deprived of life’s essentials.When Netanyahu says Palestinians will “be allowed to exit,” ashe did last year, he clearly anticipates they will not return. At the beginning of the genocide, he privately backed “voluntary migration” in principle, perhaps knowing his army was going to make Gaza unliveable. “Our problem is [finding] countries that are willing to absorb Gazans, and we are working on it,”he told his alliestwo years ago.Note, then, that Israel recently recognised Somaliland. Somalia’s president suggestedit had intelligencethat the breakaway republic had agreed to take refugees from Gaza in exchange. Somaliland denies it,but its foreign minister didn’t rule it outlast March. Gaza is a devastated wasteland, now destined to be a money-making scheme for property developers and Trump’s courtiers.But this isn’t just about the Palestinian people. The “board of peace”’s charterdoesn’t even mention Gaza. It reads as an attempt to build an alternative to the UN: a blunt instrument for Trump to exercise American power. In other words – here is a template, with Gaza merely acting as a trial run.Yet if Trump believes this will serve the interests of US hegemony, a brutal collision with reality awaits. Western dominance was founded on three pillars: military supremacy, economic dominance and moral superiority. The first was slain in the killing fields of Iraq and Afghanistan. The second was discredited by the 2008 financial crash. And moral superiority? This was always a con, of course, as the torture chambers of US-backed dictatorshipsin Latin Americaor the peeling skin of Vietnamese children hit by American napalm can testify. But, unlike older rivalries between great powers, the cold war was sold as a clash of universal philosophies: democracy and freedom v socialism and equality. The Soviet collapse was presented as the triumph of the western creed.As the US militaryincineratedAfghan wedding parties, and American soldiers werephotographedwith rictus grins as naked Iraqis were piled into a human pyramid at Abu Ghraib prison, those moral claims disintegrated. When US Democrats armed and facilitated the liquidation of Gaza, American moral bankruptcy was exposed as a bipartisan affair.What is striking about Trump is that he has abandoned even the pretence of moral superiority. On Venezuela, he openly boasts that US companies are going to “take back” the country’s oil. Gone are claims that US hegemony is driven by a desire to protect the freedom of all humanity – “a country that would be a light unto the nations, and a shining city upon a hill,” as Ronald Reagan put it.Trump’s crude honesty merely hastens the fall of US power. Moral supremacy was always a deception, but it was a useful lie. It bought at least some support and acquiescence. Now it is dead, the world will be ever more eager to turn the page on its failing masters.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We know Farage’s party will only enrich the wealthyMon 19 Jan 2026 12.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 13.40 ESTShareClass politics is back, as if it ever went away. Robert Jenrickdeclares thatTories are toffs and “the divide in British politics has become Reform’s workers party versus the Tory posh party”. He says the Tories are so “out of touch” they are no longer “the party of working people, of provincial Britain, of the towns and cities”. He’s not wrong, says Prof Tim Bale, political analyst: “Reform can claim to be a disproportionately working-class party.”Considering the social class difference between the two rightwing parties, where does Jenrick belong? As a private school and Cambridge-educated former director of Christie’s auction house, is he too posh for Reform, even though he’s the son of a small businessman and first in his family to go to university? Hardly, since it’s a party founded by zillionaires. It’s a forever political mystery that low-paid/working-class voters will opt for the very wealthy with contrary financial interests. Bale points out that the Tories’ grip on power always relied on backing from a third of working-class voters.Populist demagogues of the Jenrick/Reform stamp seduce with appeals to “anti-elite” emotions, only to betray supporters as cannon fodder once in power. As money flows to thehyper-rich in the US under Donald Trump, the trickery in Reform’s tax-and-spend policies would similarlyreward better-off peoplemost. But Nigel Farage is adept at the theatrics of class, brandishing a pint and last weekopposing a tougher drink-drive limitas an assault by Labour’s “Islington, north London, bicycling classes” on British pub culture in rural areas. The irony is that this Labour cabinet, as it earnestly strives to save lives on the road, has the most working-class origins ever, but it lacks that bogus working-class blokey swagger of the Dulwich College city trader.Class always matters. Tomorrow’s report from the National Centre for Social Research shows education has become an even stronger class proxy and predictor of voting. “A person with education below A-levels or no educational qualifications had about two times the odds of voting for either theConservativesor Reform UK than someone with a university degree or higher,” it finds. The more educated join the liberal-left side of the great line, the least educated vote most right. That’s a long tradition. Over 150 years ago the political economist John Stuart Mill said: “Stupid people are generally Conservative.” Tories were often called “the stupid party” – even by themselves sometimes, approvingly, as a sign that they are closer to public sentiment than liberal pointy-heads. Before that, the Know-Nothings in the US in the 1850s were a nativist, anti-immigration, anti-Irish Catholic movement. Education humanises, which is why the right wants to reverse the trend of more learning.Class may shift and morph, but gross inequality is more pressing than ever. Narrowing that class gap is Labour’s founding mission: its governments always make some progress. How it hates the “metropolitan elite” tag, trying to cling to the identity of its name and old roots in the north and Midlands. That nostalgia is an error, says Bale: even in red-wall marginals the votes it can win are not now the old working class. AlthoughLabourat the last general election won most working-class votes, it has to face up to its definition by Prof Sir John Curtice, doyen of psephologists: “Labour’s core vote is now the young middle-class professionals in London. That’s a stereotype, but that’s who they now are, mainly.”That’s hard to accept for middle-class Labour people who see themselves as on the side of the working class, committed to improving the lot of those with the least. The mortal blow to their self-image was the Brexit vote, when so many working-class voters they thought they stood with shoulder-to-shoulder marched away in the opposite direction. That hurt, viscerally. Yet the class mission is just as pressing as ever when the top 10%owns five times the wealthof Britain’s entire bottom half and, well educated or not,84% thinkthe income gap is too wide.No amount of defections will change the fact that Reform and the Tories are singing the same tunes | John HarrisRead moreThe great rise in education is a Labour success, withhalf of working-age adults having a degreeor level 4 equivalent, increasing with each age cohort. Only around7% of my generationwent to university. All of the cabinet and shadow cabinet have degrees, but only four out of seven Reform MPs. It’s quite a class divide that onlyone in five Reform supportersare graduates, partly because they are older.Britain’s failure has beenleaving behindthe one in five who have no qualifications, worse than in similar countries. An unintended consequence of better education for most has been “credentialism”, making qualifications obligatory, barring the old tea-boy-to-boardroom route up the ladder. In trying to prevent any more left-behind children, Labour’s education funding priorities go to early yearsBest Start hubs, further education and apprenticeships, as ever putting class first. Will well-intentioned middle-class Labour be rewarded for that? In the long run, yes, as more educated people are less likely to vote right.For a crumb of comfort in facing the hard right, Curtice reminds me that Reform voters are a lot older, as are Tories. “They remember primary schools with world maps coloured British empire pink, those values are unrecognisable now.” Brexit was their last hurrah, now widely rejected. Unless Reform swerves in new ways to attract the young, this rising up against the socially liberal “elite” may be a dying gasp, not a rising force. If Reform wants class to be the battleground, that’s Labour turf – so bring it on.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsInequalityOpinionLabourConservativesReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Quick recap: if you’re a woman, or even if you’re not and don’t yet love it: Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) are two professional ice hockey players on rival teams. It matters that they’re hockey players, beyond the athletic perfection of their “insanely oiled, slick bodies” (as my friend, Eve, who’s 21, put it). And it matters that Rozanov is Russian, because the obstacles are real: he cannot be gay – think about the sponsorship, think about the fans, think about the oppressive patriarchal regime. Think about it for two seconds and this can not happen; and it achingly doesn’t, and almost does, and does, then doesn’t happen, over years.Heated Rivalry dropped in Canada and the US at the end of November, and the fandom around it is so intense that Williams and Storrie have a compound nickname (HudCon). The actors are all over the late-night US TV shows; the clip of thempresenting at the Golden Globeshas been viewed more than a million times, and their most throwaway remark on social media blows up.Although Eve isn’t the only young woman to love the show, people don’t mention how much gen Z women love it, since it’s priced in that they’ll watch anything (which in itself is quite sexist). The audience getting all the attention is heterosexual women in middle-to-late middle age – in the US,we’re known as wine moms. One minute we love it because the men are “unthreatening”; the next, we prefer a love story without a woman in it so we don’t feel jealous. One person – this wasn’t on the internet, this was my actual friend – said Heated Rivalry was like porn without the sex (it’s true that there’s way more yearning than action), so there was nothing really there to detain gay men. Straight middle-aged women were just enjoying playing with our sexy man dolls, a bit like Lego.View image in fullscreen‘HudCon’ … Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie in Heated Rivalry.Photograph: Sphere Abacus/SkyHeated Rivalry discourse has cracked open a rich seam of contempt for women. We are simultaneously insatiably horny, yet somehow (at our age!) very frightened of sex;we objectify men– and this is disgusting – yet, at the same time, we don’t understand bodies and prefer cake (or wine), which is also disgusting. We can’t abide other women because they remind us how shit we look, and can only tap into desire in a fantasy world that doesn’t have any of us in it. It’s a shame, because I would prefer to enjoy this exquisite love story without a side order of virulent misogyny, but maybe it’s refreshing when people say the quiet parts out loud.If you knew your way around romance as a genre, which I didn’t before, you would know that all those ideas were in the ether already. Jennifer Prokop, who hostsFated Mates, the most-listened-to romance podcast in the US told me that the show is incredibly faithful to the books. “In terms of the beat-for-beat pacing, at every point where a decision had to be made, to me, it was prioritising what a romance would do rather than what a TV show would do.” So there are long, aching periods during which Shane and Ilya don’t see each other, and their lives outside Their Thing are curiously undrawn, unperformed, empty. “Their love is the world; it’s almost like their lives don’t exist except when they’re with each other,” Prokop says.‘Thank you for tweeting about our butts!’: seven things you need to know about Heated Rivalry’s sudden superstarsRead moreRomance is a strict formula: there must be obstacles, and it has to end happily ever after. It’s written off as something fluffy and unserious, a weird thing that women like, whereas in fact it’s often deeply serious and hegemonically challenging, which are the real-life weird things that women like. “The thing that keeps them from being together is the strong arm of the patriarchy,” says Prokop. “They can’t be together for the same exact reasons that people in Florida that are queer can’t get access to the medicine that they need.”If the story kicks against a homophobia that has anew grip on politics, the sex is also radically countercultural. “Hollywood is the tastemaker when it comes to what’s out there,” says Prokop , “and the kind of sex that Hollywood is comfortable showing is violent misogyny and rape. There’s nothing violent about the sex in this show.”Dowomen love Heated Rivalrybecause it’s hot, because it’s original, or because it will smash the patriarchy? Hard to say; we don’t all think the same thing. But could we, as a holding position, agree that we love it not because we’re worms, but because it’s good?Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTelevisionOpinionWomenLGBTQ+ rightscommentShareReuse this content"

But it's complicated by lots of dos and don'tsMon 19 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 11.48 ESTShare‘Idon’t believe in an interventionist God,”sings Nick Cavein the opening line of his 1997 song, Into My Arms. But Jim Sharma, a football fan who is a devotee of Wolverhampton Wanderers FC, very much does – and who can blame him?For the detached, the uninformed and nonsports fans, the issue here is that Wolves had a terrible start to the season and, until the other day, looked set to beat Derby County’s unenviable record as theworst-performing teamin Premier League history. Then they played my team, West Ham, and had their first taste of victory since April. Wolves 3 West Ham 0.How did that happen? I was watching that game – with my Wolves-supporting father-in-law – and I think we were both equally shocked by the result. But maybe Wolves had help. Sharma believes that it happenedbecause the pope himself had promised to pray for him– and his team – when he presented the pontiff with a special Wolves shirt (with “Pope” and the number one on the back) when they met in Turkey a few weeks previously.It’s arguable. Wolves played another seven games (of which they lost six and drew one) between then and when they finally managed to win one. Why the delay? Surely the pope’s prayers would be answered quicker than that? On Saturday, when relegation threatened and West Ham beat Tottenham with a goal at the very end – the first win in 10 games – it seemed like a miracle to us. Was it via the pope again, or lots of prayers conveyed direct from east London? Neither you might say. But then, God/mysterious ways …This question of divine intervention – does it exist? When is it appropriate to seek it? Who is listened to, who isn’t quite so much? Who should be? It all deserves some attention.I am a vicar. I believe in the power of prayer (obviously!), but still I feel it’s problematic to assume that the almighty micromanages human affairs to that extent. Take the weather: when farmers and gardeners are praying for rain, but brides want a nice, fine day for their wedding, what is God supposed to do? Whom should He disappoint?This divine dilemma was powerfully illustrated in the surprisingly theologically sophisticated2003 comedy Bruce Almighty. Jim Carrey’s Bruce – who has temporarily been given all of God’s powers while the “Big Man” (Morgan Freeman) is on holiday – is overwhelmed by the sheer number of requests. So he simply answers “yes” to all of them. The result is chaos: hurricanes and rioting in the streets – because while everyone won the lottery that week, that also meant they received only $1 each.But the implications of this “slot-machine” view of divine intervention can be even more troubling than that. I always wince when I hear a fellow believer testifying that they prayed for a parking space and “the Lord provided one”. Really? I know I’m only a humble employee, not the boss – but does the boss really adjudicate parking spaces? Isn’t His time better spent addressing child poverty or the conflict in the Middle East?View image in fullscreenMorgan Freeman as God and and Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan in Tom Shadyac’s Bruce Almighty (2003).Photograph: Universal/AllstarAnd, of course, the belief that “God is on our side” has been the cause of many of the problems in the world throughout history. Not all of them, as some atheists like to claim, but enough to be deeply embarrassing for religious people such as me.Fortunately, most of us have moved on from that tribalistic understanding of God.As the novelist Anne Lamott once said: “You can safely assume that you have created God in your own image when it turns out that He hates all the same people you do.”God – if She exists – must be the God ofallpeople, not justmypeople.It’s complicated. Several years ago, looking for my first senior post as a priest, I found myself shortlisted for a parish that seemed just right for me. I prayed earnestly that I would get the job. I also asked God to bless the other candidates with something equally perfect for them – to show Him that I wasn’t completely selfish. However, on reflection, I realised that there was a further flaw in my thinking: again, what was I asking God to do? If the decision-makers preferred one of my rivals – which is, in fact, what happened – did I want Him to supernaturally change their hearts and minds and pick me instead? Wouldn’t that be tantamount to mind control? Hardly compatible with either free will or a truly loving God.As it happens, if I had got that job, I wouldn’t have ended up in Wye, where I’ve now been for 16 happy years. So, it seems that mydeeperprayer – that God would provide the right post at the right time – was answered.Does it really work like that? Would any deity be more concerned at any one time with the theological employment status of one West Ham fan in Kent than the health and welfare of millions of other people around the world? I can’t answer that, other than to quote Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury (who, coincidentally,has helped Caveto latterly feel more sympathetic to the idea of an interventionist God),who said thatwhile it might be “intellectually frustrating” to suggest that prayer can “tilt the outcome of a situation in a particular way”, that is, nonetheless, the only way “to do justice to the somewhat chaotic Christian experience of intercession and unexpected outcomes (miracles, if you must)”.So one can believe on the basis that nothing else makes much sense. That helps me. But I still won’t be praying that West Ham will rally and somehow avoid relegation this season – for all the ethical, moral and theological reasons that I’ve mentioned above – and because I simply haven’t got that much faith.Ravi Holy is the vicar of Wye in Kent and a standup comedianExplore more on these topicsReligionOpinionChristianitycommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s why they’re silent about the biggest of them allIngrid RobeynsEconomic inequality is at the heart of all humanity’s major problems, but the wealthiest refuse to confront a system that benefits themMon 19 Jan 2026 08.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 14.34 ESTShareThis week, hundreds of government leaders, heads of state, and business executives are gathering at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) inDavos. They will be discussing solutions to the world’s biggest risks and problems.But everything suggests that, once more, what will not be addressed at their meeting is the biggest threat to humanity and the planet: neoliberal capitalism.All forms of capitalism are characterised by extensive private ownership of companies as well as the primacy of the profit motive. But the specific neoliberal form of capitalism that has risen to dominance from the late 1970s onwards has additional features: the privatisation of companies previously in public ownership; a shift in power from workers to capital owners; and reduced taxes on entrepreneurs and the richest.The transition from mixed economies under social democracies to neoliberal capitalism has led to a notable increase of wealth concentration at the top, which is now eroding (and in some places even destroying) our democracies. The absence of a sustained discussion of neoliberal capitalism in elite circles is illogical, since it is the main cause of the other problems that will be discussed at Davos.Last week, the WEF launched its 2026 Global Risks Report, in preparation for the Davos meeting. Experts were asked to pick from a provided list the risks that they consider to be the biggest for the world. Geo-economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation and social polarisation are regarded as the top three risks for the next two years. Over a period of 10 years, the top three are extreme weather conditions, biodiversity loss and ecosystems collapse and critical changes to Earth systems.Inequality in income and wealth comes in seventh place. The analysis in the report presents it as the factor that is most central, as it connects most other risks. That is certainly a valid observation. However, the commentary in the report does not provide a good understanding of what the precise problem with inequality is. The WEF reduces inequality to the feelings of citizens who perceive themselves to be excluded and who are unhappy with their limited opportunities for social mobility.Yet at its core, economic inequality is about much more fundamental issues. It is about who gets what share of what we produce together.Neoliberal ideology, with its focus on individuals and the efficiency gains of competition, makes us inclined to think that we can attribute wealth-holding to individual efforts. But this is a myth.The economy is a complicated ecosystem of interlinked processes, in which the areas where the largest profits are made are reliant on other fields that provide the conditions for this to be possible. Without people working in the public sector for the common good, such as (often poorly paid) childcare workers, teachers and NHS doctors and nurses, there would be no productive workforce to co-create the profits of the business owners.In recent decades the divide has widened, making capital owners even richer and workers even poorer. Taxes have also shifted from capital to labour, and the possibilities for the very richest people to pay hardly any taxes have amplified. That is what citizens are also angry about – and rightly so.As I documented in detail in my book Limitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth,economic inequality is also about the increase in social, ecological and political damage caused by billionaires and centimillionaires (one whose wealth is estimated at $100m or more). But to see that, we need a system-level analysis of the fundamentals of our political economy. And unfortunately, we have no reason to believe that this will happen in Davos. As long as we dodge the question of whether neoliberal capitalism delivers what we want, and fail to take seriously the question of whether there are better systems, the world’s key problems cannot be properly understood, let alone solved.We now also know very well what to expect if the increase in extreme wealth concentration is not tackled. In his book As Gods Among Men, the economic historian Guido Alfani writes that extreme wealth has historically been tolerated because the richest people have come to the aid of society at crucial moments, whereas now we are seeing mainly the opposite. Luke Kemp, who analyses 5,000 years of the rise and fall of civilisations in his book Goliath’s Curse, sees the same trend towards collapse emerging for global capitalism. According to Kemp, there are two paths for our future: either we will witness global societal collapse, or we will radically change the way we organise our societies. Kemp also detects economic inequality as a crucial factor in predicting societal collapse.And it’s all happening while we stand by and watch, simply because political and economic elites are not willing to engage in an honest debate about what economic system we need.At the root of all our problems stands one travesty: politicians’ surrender to the super-rich | George MonbiotRead moreIf meetings such as the one in Davos do not even talk about capitalism, how can our leaders start to even question it? The Global Risks Report contains precisely zero references to capitalism (let alone socialism or social democracy or other relevant terms). It says nothing about the extensive knowledge that exists in academic scholarship (and beyond) about the disadvantages of capitalism and the possibilities of alternative economic systems.The elite gathering in Davos seem to forget that the economic system, including companies, financial institutions and other economic actors, does not exist for its own sake. Economic activity exists to ensure that all people can live a good and meaningful life, in a just society, and within the ecological limits of the planet. Neoliberal capitalism does not deliver that for us. So why are we not discussing whether there is a better alternative?The answer to that question is that the elites meeting in Davos benefit from neoliberal capitalism, and they have been able to spread a false ideology that maintains that it is the best possible system for all of us. They have a very strong interest in maintaining the system that gives them wealth, status and power. An increasing proportion of the wealth created under neoliberal capitalism goes to the richest 1%. The remaining wealth-holders among the richest 10% are also rewarded for working full-time to protect the money at the top of the wealth pyramid. They do so by working in what scholars have come to call “the wealth defence industry”.That is what we need to know about increased economic inequality. And it remains largely unmentioned in elite circles. Because if it were mentioned, people in the economic elite would then have no choice but to look at their assets and portfolios and ask themselves an uncomfortable question: am I part of the problem?Ingrid Robeyns is an economist and philosopher, and holds the chair in ethics of institutions at Utrecht University.

But thekilling of Renee Goodearlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, as well as the regular, often violent confrontations that ICE stages on US streets, show so much that is unravelling in plain sight. The rule of law, the freedom to protest, and even the right to walk ordrivein the streets safely without being assaulted by the state, seems to exist no longer in the towns and cities where ICE has made its presence felt. The most disturbing aspect of all this is how quickly it has happened. But for a government agency such as ICE to become the powerful paramilitary force that it is, several factors need to be in play first. Only one of them is Donald Trump.ICE may look as if it came out of nowhere, but the sort of authoritarianism that results in these crackdowns never does. It takes shape slowly, in plain sight, in a way that is clearly traceable over time. First, there needs to be a merging of immigration and security concerns, both institutionally and in the political culture. Established in the wake of 9/11, ICE was part of a government restructuring under President George W Bush. It was granted a large budget, wide investigative powers and a partnership with the FBI’s joint terrorism taskforce. The work of enforcing immigration law became inextricably linked to the business of keeping Americans safe after the largest attack on US soil. That then extended into a wideremphasis, under Barack Obama, beyond those who posed national security threats, and on to immigrants apprehended at the border, gang members and non-citizens convicted of felonies or misdemeanours.The dragnet became wider, the budgets became bigger, and due processstarted to wither. Trump then grew ICE into the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, with a budgetsurpassingmost of the world’s militaries. And he imbued the agency with a supreme mandate of saving the US from existential threat, a sort of praetorian guard vested with his executive power.To get where the US is today, you also need an unhinged rightwing media to do the work of scaremongering and priming the public, relentlessly banging the drum on illegal immigration and the threat of demographicoverwhelm. And, relatedly, of course, the US immigration crackdowns are sustained by a culture of plain old racism. One that hides behind concerns for public safety, but is in fact a way to channel discontent about the reality of a country that is far less white than many would like.Next up is a long history and engrained culture of military supremacy. The scenes of ICE officers entering neighbourhoods, heavily armed, looked almost indistinguishable from scenes of US soldiers abroad. So much of the mythology of the American soldier, who has infinite mandate to use violence overseas in defence of freedom and American values, can be seen in thepropaganda around ICE. The merging of military and policing functions can be seen in the absurd arsenals of domestic police forces, with their drones, weapons, explosives, armoured personnel carriers and masked faces. And it can be seen in the personnel who move between overseas and domestic forces. The New York Times has reported that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good,servedin Iraq.I have been thinking about what it was about the ICE phenomenon that felt chillingly familiar to someone who grew up under repressive regimes. It wasn’t the deployment of huge numbers of forces, nor was it even the violence. It was the sense that anything could happen to anyone, not just those expressly identified as the legitimate targets of crackdown. The abiding experience of living with authoritarianism is the sense not of imminent assault, but of the constant possibility that suddenly, you could be in trouble. At a traffic incident where the officer didn’t like your tone, at a gathering that was deemed to violate a curfew and then forcibly dismantled, or even on social media where a mindless post could affect your ability to leave the country. It is a state of effacement of all civil rights, and a swelling of government into a volatile, capricious overlord, as safe or scary as the single enforcer in front of you who happens to be vested with its power.The US has passed through that veil. But there are warning signs in the UK. The relentless portrayal of immigrants as a threat to safety and social cohesion. The same glamorisation of the imagery of crackdown, now a feature of government propaganda asministers attendHome Office immigration raids. The same expansion of powers and discretion to the police to include ever wider definitions of what a public order infraction is, such as factoring in the “cumulative impact” of pro-Palestine rallies. The transformation of protest into dissidence. Theempowermentof the UK Border Force, which now has the right to seize someone’s mobile phone even when they are not under arrest. The swirl of nativism that underpins it all. Throw in one charismatic and mendacious political leader, and a rightwing press amplifying all the necessary fever dreams of a country in crisis, and you are on a path to passing through that veil. It can happen in Britain too, just with fewer guns.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpProtest (US)commentShareReuse this content"

Freedom of information requests by the Guardian have uncovered a sharp increase in the number of reported attacks in hospitals, with an average of 285 each day in 2024-25. Some ofthe detailsshared with our reporters were horrifying. One A&E nurse said that she sees weapons brandished on a monthly basis, and described two incidents in which male patients deliberately ejaculated on nurses while waiting for treatment. A consultant – now retired – said that he had been violently assaulted twice within a period of weeks.The increase inracist incidentsis also gravely concerning. Because the UK’s health workforce is so diverse, and interacts constantly with the public, its members are highly exposed to rising anti-migrant sentiment. In November the health secretary, Wes Streeting, expressed shock at the impact on the NHS ofresurgent “1970s-, 1980s-style racism”.But deeds as well as words will be needed if a disturbing pattern of aggression against frontline workers – which is alsoaffecting teachersand others – is to be turned back. Existing duties on employers to prevent sexual harassment, including by their own staff, are being strengthened in theEmployment Rights Act. But tackling abuse and violence in healthcare is a difficult task, with managers facing tough decisions about whether to treat people who threaten or insult. Such incidents harm institutions as well as individuals. Whole departments face consequences when victims need time off to recover, or when a ward is closed to provide a secure environment for a violent patient.Last yearpatient satisfaction fell to a record low, with 59% of people questioned describing themselves as dissatisfied. But while frustration at an overstretched health system may be understandable, and some allowances can be made for patients who are mentally unwell, the current levels of hostility and violence are a disgrace. A workforce that becomes inured to such behaviour is likely to experience falling morale and provide a worse overall service. Already there is alarming evidence of recruitment being affected. Between April and September last year there was asharp dropin the number of nurses and midwives from abroad joining UK registers, compared with the year before. There are also growing fears that theNHS sexual safety charter, which was supposed to improve recording of sexual misconduct, is not being followed.Even if it were possible, a return to old‑fashioned deference towards doctors and other senior professionals would not be desirable. Rigid hierarchies and dynamics whereby members of the public and junior workers are infantilised and dominated cause terrible problems, with profound costs for patients. But a situation in which people feel entitled toabuse service providers, or bully their way to the front of A&E queues, is also highly damaging.While the NHS is a particularly challenging setting in which to confront such behaviour, these problems are not unique to the health service.Reduced trust in institutionsand heightened suspicion of experts are widely observed societal trends that many public-facing organisations are grappling with. Mr Streeting must empower staff to uphold standards and boundaries. Police also have a role in ensuring that violent offenders are dealt with. The social contract of which the NHS is such a powerful symbol is stretched and frayed, but it can be mended.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This monthPoems on the Undergroundcelebrates its40th anniversary.Inspired by a reading of As You Like It,Judith Chernaik, an American writer living in London, conceived a plan to scatter poetry across the underground as the love-sick Orlando hangs sonnets through the Forest of Arden. Her simple idea took root below the sewers and spread to cities across the world.Poetry in Motionlaunched in New York in 1992, and today poems can be found on public transport in Dublin, Paris, Beijing, Shanghai, Warsaw and Moscow.Ms Chernaik, now 91, is still the editor, joined by poetsImtiaz DharkerandGeorge Szirtes. Six poems, spanning history and geography, are chosen three times a year. A selection of winter poems will launch on 9 February, with work from contemporary British poets Rachel Boast and Blake Morrison and a haiku by the 18th-century Japanese poet Kobayashi Issa.The anonymous 15th-century poemI Have a Gentil Cockruffled feathers in 1990 and there were calls to ban Jo Shapcott’sQuarkfor the word “bollocks” in 1999. But nothing could derail the scheme’s success. During lockdown a website was set up to ensure that commuters got their poetry fix, and hopeful new poems greeted them when they returned to work. In 2024, Poems on the Underground was given anarchiveat Cambridge University.From the earliestEdwardian postersand those by Paul Nash and Man Ray in the 1930s, toHarry Beck’s iconic mapandDavid Gentleman’s 1979 Charing Cross station mural, Transport for London has a long tradition of art and design. Poetry and art bring humanity underground. They allow nature and imagination into this subterranean labyrinth of civil engineering.The tube is a liminal place, one of physical proximity and anonymity. We sit in rows or cling to straps, staring at our phones or ads, closer to our fellow humans perhaps than at any time in the day, yet determined to ignore each other. The poems appear in commercial spaces, but aren’t trying to sell us anything. They reach millions of travellers each day – free of charge.Some might argue that Shakespeare and Wordsworth are debased by sitting cheek by jowl with adverts for vitamins and dating apps, that poetry’s rhythms jar with the screech of brakes, its lyricism crushed by rush hour. And not all poetry can please everyone.As Seamus Heaneywrote, “no lyric ever stopped a tank”, but it can stop us in our tracks. In less than a minute, a poem can transport us out of our own lives. Studies haveshownthat a daily microdose of art can boost our wellbeing. Heaneysummed it up in a cardto Ms Chernaik in 1999: the project has contributed “tothe life‑worth of poetry for many people”.Poems on the Underground is as much a part of the contemporary UK cultural landscape as Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth or the Angel of the North. It is a credit toTransportfor London, the Arts Council and the British Council that they have enabled the project to flourish. Deep below the capital’s streets, this is public art at its highest. The poems are tiny lights in a dark tunnel.Explore more on these topicsPoetryOpinionLondon UndergroundTfLLondonRail transportArts Council EnglandBritish LibraryeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Victim-survivors who disclose stalking and associated behaviours are rarely paranoid; they are often correctly identifying imminent danger.Extraordinary measures are taken by victim-survivors to stay safe: changing names, abandoning jobs or study, moving across the country, and fleeing into refuges or new areas to live anonymously. Yet even these steps can prove redundant if an unregulated investigator is paid to track them. In 2026, it is horrifying that those at the highest risk of serious injury and fatality, located in refuges for their safety, can be found because someone with no licence, oversight or training was willing to take a perpetrator’s money. That 64% of such investigators are former police officers, trained to protect victims of crime, reveals the problem is not primarily a lack of expertise but of accountability: people trained to safeguard victims are now able to use those same skills to assist perpetrators in evading the law.A statutory bar on investigators taking on cases involving physical surveillance of a partner or ex-partner, and a duty to decline instructions showing the hallmarks of domestic abuse or stalking, must be implemented. Reforms must also include mandatory training in domestic abuse, stalking and harmful practices, such as forced marriage, and “honour”-based abuse as a condition of practice.Noor Da SilvaDeputy safeguarding lead, University of NorthamptonExplore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsPolicePrivacyWomenlettersShareReuse this content"

Certainly in this country it is now possible to go for a walk in the countryside or in towns without having to watch your step.However, quite often a footpath or bridleway is made impassable due to large dumps of horse manure. Dog owners have taken on their duty to clear up after their pets, always armed with dog-poo bags. Why are horse owners and riders allowed to make much larger, smellier and long-lasting heaps of horse excrement? I can imagine that it would be inconvenient for a horse rider to dismount so as to clear up the poo, but I don’t see why the riding stables should not have this duty. I look forward to the day when walkers can enjoy the environment free of dog and horse-made hazards.Ros WardDurhamAdrian Chiles is right about the “seismic cultural shift” in dog-poo etiquette, but as a Dutchman housesitting across rural England, I’ve noticed that the revolution stopped at the stirrups.​Recently, while I was performing the civic duty of scooping a modest deposit from the dog I was looking after, a rider trotted past. Her horse promptly left a steaming mountain of manure directly in the centre of the track. With a polite nod, she moved on, leaving me – bag in hand – contemplating the Great British poo divide.​It seems that if your beast has paws, you’re a social pariah for a missed scoop. If it has hooves, the carefree “leave-it-where-it-lands” era of the 1950s lives on. Until I see an equestrian dismount with a shovel, I’ll assume the status of the “doo” depends entirely on the owner’s place in the class system.Jan VeenstraTerherne, the NetherlandsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I completely understand their reasoning. Of course it lacks nuance to use visible accessories to represent a hidden disability. Of course one doll cannot show the breadth, richness and even pain of the autistic experience.I read one critic ask how sheshows burnout. I’d imagine that’s down to the kids to convey, which is my point: most critics are not reviewing this as it’s intended – a child’s toy. The strongest opinions, for the most part, are from those who would not buy Barbie anyway. To them, I say she’s just Barbie.Dr Erin BeestonUrmston, Greater ManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For a moment he seemed baffled by the question, then he explained that those moments are what he lives for. Where others feel pressure, he sees opportunity.What, you wonder, did Brahim Díaz seeduring the Afcon finalon Sunday? When his shoulder was tugged by El Hadji Malick Diouf and he collapsed, did he consider the consequences? When he howled in the face of the Democratic Republic of the Congo referee Jean-Jacques NdalaNgambo as he waited for the verdict of the video assistant referee, did it occur to him he would take the penalty if it were given? He had scored one against Mali in the group stage, but that was with Achraf Hakimi, a very fine penalty taker, off the pitch.Senegal face sanctions for Afcon final walk-off as organisers criticise ‘unacceptable’ conductRead morePerhaps if Díaz had taken it immediately, after Ngambo had reviewed the incident on the screen and pointed to the spot, adrenaline would have carried him through. But instead he had to wait 15 minutes asSenegal left the pitch in protestbefore Sadio Mané persuaded them to return.What went through his head then? Against Mali, he had sidefooted his penalty low to his left, as the goalkeeper, Djigui Diarra, went the other way. Did it occur to him that Édouard Mendy, the Senegal keeper, would have seen that? What game of bluff and counter-bluff played out in his mind as he waited, not knowing when – or even if – Senegal would return.At some point, he decided on a Panenka. There have been those who have criticised him for opting for such a high-risk penalty at such a crucial moment. But then, the original, taken by Antonin Panenka to win the shootout for Czechoslovakia against West Germany in the final of the 1976 European Championship was at just such a crucial moment.2:36'It was Hitchcockian': Morocco and Senegal react to Afcon final and walk-off chaos – videoPanenka’s logic was that a high-pressure moment was the perfect time to try it because the goalkeeper would never expect it. That was 50 years ago, three months after Morocco won their first, and only, Cup of Nations. The world is more familiar with dinked penalties. Was Díaz trying to win the competition with a flourish? Or did he simply think that was the best way to score, that Mendy would dive one way or the other?He kissed the ball, placed it on the spot. He walked back. Looking at the replay, he perhaps seems to be blinking more than usual, but that may be an observation shaped by knowledge of what was to come guiding the perception. He blew out his cheeks, approached the ball … and slowed down.Panenka insisted the deceleration should come at the last, not in the run-up, but in the strike. Díaz duffed the kick.View image in fullscreenÉdouard Mendy catches Brahim Díaz’s Panenka penalty 15 minutes after it was awarded.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesIt wasn’t even a good Panenka. Even if Mendy had been fooled, there is a chance he might have been able to save it with an outstretched leg.But he was not fooled. Five years ago, Mendysaved a Panenka from Sergio Agüeroin a league game for Chelsea against Manchester City. He did it again, catching the ball so easily many wondered whether Díaz missed on purpose, whether some deal had been done to get Senegal back on the pitch. There was a strange calm as the ball dollied into Mendy’s grasp. Nobody celebrated. But the forward’s evident devastation told its own story.“Do you really believe that with one minute left, when a country has been waiting for this for 50 years … do you think we would agree on something?” Mendy said. “He wanted to score, I get the credit for stopping it, that’s all. Let’s put an end to this. Díaz tried to score, and I just did my job. I stayed calm facing that Panenka and managed to save it. It’s time to close this debate.”Poor Díaz must now live with that. He was the tournament golden boot winner, scoring five times, but it was the sixth he did not score that will be for ever remembered, his award now a dread reminder of failure.His coach, Walid Regragui, was unsympathetic. “We stopped the match in the eyes of the world for 10 minutes,” he said. “That didn’t help Brahim. That doesn’t excuse Brahim for the way he hit the penalty. He hit it like that and we have to accept it.”View image in fullscreenA desolate Brahim Díaz (left) poses with the golden boot alongside Sadio Mané, who won player of the tournament and Yassine Bounou, who won best goalkeeper.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesDíaz was in tears as he left the pitch and reports suggest he was inconsolable in the dressing room.Moroccan newspapers were united in their criticism. Al Mountakhab said he had taken the kick “very badly” and Al-Alam spoke of “inexplicable carelessness”. While Al-Massae preferred to condemn Regragui’s “tactical approach” it made clear the scale of the defeat, describing the “tears of regret of millions of Moroccans”.As Regragui observed, football is often a cruel game. For seven games, Díaz excelled, but his tournament will be defined by one incident 23 minutes after the scheduled final whistle. His task is to ensure it does not also define his career.Explore more on these topicsMorocco football teamAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Senegal football teamAfrica Cup of NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A touch on his chest bought time to set himself, before a wonderful bicycle kick sent the Amex Stadium wild.‘We are getting closer’: Gabriel Jesus targets trophies and staying at ArsenalRead moreIt meant the spoils were shared and ensured the game was not decided by the belated award of a first-half penalty that had sent anyone of a Brighton disposition into a fury. The spot-kick had not initially been given – the referee, Paul Tierney, instead punishing Amine Adli for what he deemed to be a dive. He then changed his mind and pointed to the spot after viewing the pitchside monitor and identifying that the Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen’s leg had touched the Moroccan as he tumbled to the ground. How much contact is too much contact? Does anyone even know any more?Marcus Tavernier duly converted and, for so long, it looked likely to be the game’s only goal. But Kostoulas’s late acrobatics denied Bournemouth a first away win since August.“For me it’s not a penalty,” said Fabian Hürzeler, who also expressed his anger at what he deemed was Bournemouth time-wasting late on. “But we have to accept that people make mistakes. In this situation, it’s contact a little bit, but it’s not a foul.”Asked whose errors were to blame, he replied: “Everyone who was involved in this situation. I’m very surprised. It doesn’t make sense. The whole process doesn’t make sense.“A touch and a contact is not enough, and that is what the referees said to us before the start of the season. And in certain moments they don’t do it – that’s just the truth, and we’ve got to accept it.”View image in fullscreenAmine Adli goes down after contact with Bart Verbruggen, leading to a Bournemouth penalty.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty ImagesThat Bournemouth could not quite hold on to their lead – visibly wilting as the match wore on – was perhaps no surprise given their current player predicament. Injuries and departures have robbed Andoni Iraola of his squad depth, meaning he had four academy players on the substitutes’ bench and precious few attacking options to call upon.The goalscorer Tavernier also departed in the second half with what Iraola suggested was a hamstring injury. The Bournemouth manager confirmed that the club are expected to finalise a deal for the Ferencvaros midfielder Alex Toth on Tuesday, but he called for more signings to be made this month. “We are in a very delicate situation,” Iraola said.“You could see today. We are demanding the same players to play every game, every minute. The players are giving us everything. We definitely need help – it’s very clear. The club is working on signing new players. Everyone understands.”Although Bournemouth’s goal arrived in controversial fashion, it was reward for their first-half dominance that answered Iraola’s demands to start quickly, given the likelihood that his players would tire as the match progressed.For all that Brighton enjoyed the lion’s share of possession, the hosts had nothing like the threat of their opponents whenever they ventured into the final third – the forward quartet of Tavernier, Eli Junior Kroupi, Adli and Evanilson repeatedly exhibiting their ability to cause problems for opposition defenders in Bournemouth’s post-Antoine Semenyo era.The home crowd made their sentiments abundantly clear when booing the referee both off the pitch at the end of the first period and back on to it after the break. Their fury was exacerbated by Tierney ignoring Brighton’s own penalty appeals, and it was frequently piqued when Bournemouth players attempted to wind the clock down through various methods as it ticked towards 90 minutes.View image in fullscreenMarcus Tavernier’s converts from the spot to give Bournemouth a first-half lead.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty ImagesBy that point, Kostoulas had replaced Danny Welbeck up front for Brighton. With Bournemouth sitting ever deeper, the hosts threatened with increasing frequency until the Greek teenager struck in memorable fashion.“That was unbelievable,” the Brighton captain, Lewis Dunk, said of Kostoulas’s goal. “He’s a special talent. You’ve seen glimpses, and there will be many more things to come from him.”Of most importance was Brighton’s failure to win. Hürzeler’s side have now been victorious just once in nine league games as they struggle to launch a bid for European qualification. “Our performance wasn’t good enough,” the manager said. “We have to take responsibility.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Spurs support were so incensed by the result and the continuation of the team’s terrible Premier League form – they have won twice in their past 13 league matches – that they demanded Frank be “sacked in the morning”.It’s so toxic at Spurs even West Ham were shocked: Frank’s race looks run | Jacob SteinbergRead moreFrank has survived, for now, and will be in the dugout for the Champions League tie at home against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. It remains to be seen whether it proves to be merely a stay of execution. Frank has a selection crisis for the Dortmund clash, with only 11 available outfield players – three of whom he said would struggle to complete the 90 minutes. His back is firmly against the wall.However, Frank came out fighting on Monday and took it as a positive that he was able to have a friendly lunch with three of the club’s main powerbrokers. They were the chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, the sporting director, Johan Lange, and Nick Beucher, the son-in-law of one of the owners, Vivienne Lewis.“I’ve just been feeling the trust,” Frank said. “I’ve said that at every press meeting … that there is backing and support. I had lunch with Nick and Vinai and Johan today, so all good. I know it’s part of the media circus. The only focus I have is to do everything I can for us to win against Dortmund.“We had a good conversation about life and football, the future of the club, everything normal. Of course, there’s a little bit of stormy weather out there. I just think it’s an extremely good sign because normally people are running away if there’s bad news or bad weather coming. They’re normally not coming in and being friendly for lunch.”Frank knows it will be a tall order against Dortmund, especially with such depleted resources. The German club are second in the Bundesliga, having lost once in the competition all season. They have been beaten only once in the Champions League, too. Frank was asked whether the Spurs executives had given him any assurances in the event of another defeat.“It’s a nice question,” he said. “I haven’t heard any situation like that in football where they say: ‘Hey, mate, if you win tomorrow, no problem. If you lose tomorrow, no problem.’”View image in fullscreenFrank presides over training in preparation for the game against Dortmund.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersFrank’s continued employment can be seen as an extraordinary show of faith by a board who have not wanted to jettison him; they are mindful of the problems he has faced, not all of which have been of his own making. On the other hand, the questions continue to come thick and fast. Has Frank remained in the job because of the absence of a suitable and available interim alternative? Would it have been prudent to bring someone else in for such a difficult game and with the squad situation as it is?Frank sought to radiate positivity. When he walked out for training on Monday afternoon, he was asked how he was. “I’m fine,” he replied. “The sun is shining. We are playing football.” Which was a nice answer, albeit one that overlooked the fact the skies were grey.Frank said fine margins had gone against his team in the West Ham game – and others of late, includingthe defeat at Bournemouth. The players, he stressed, were still running and giving their all. “If your back is against the wall, you fight,” he said. “And that’s what I do.”Yet the team news was worryingly bleak. Just before training, the club announced that Ben Davies was to undergo surgery to repair the ankle fracture sustained against West Ham. Then João Palhinha did not emerge for the session, with the rest of a group bulked up by young players. He remains out. “When it rains, it pours,” Frank said.Xavi Simons did not train either, having damaged an ankle against West Ham when he was on the end of a tackle from behind by Jarrod Bowen. Simons, though, is poised to play against Dortmund. Frank will miss 13 players, including the suspended Micky van de Ven. Spurs’ new signing, Conor Gallagher, is ineligible.“It was a bad tackle from Bowen, not that Bowen is a bad guy and would do anything intentional,” Frank said. “Xavi has a swollen ankle but, because he’s so strong mentally, he will play through pain. While we are there, I can’t understand why that isn’t a red card [for Bowen] when a red card is when Xavi accidentally put his foot on Virgil van Dijk [and was sent off against Liverpool].View image in fullscreenXavi Simons sprawls on the turf clutching his ankle after being tackled by Jarrod Bowen.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPA“We have 11 [outfield] players available and we maybe have three that need to push massively to get through 90 minutes physically. That’s why we need everyone to support us from minute one. Especially the players, especially if it’s not going too well. If we do get that support, everything can happen. Magic can happen.”Frank has chosen to reinstate the fit-again Dominic Solanke into his Champions League squad at the expense of Mathys Tel, who drops out for the second time this season. Frank had recalled Tel before Spurs’ sixth league phase game against Slavia Prague to replace Solanke, who had been injured for more than 60 days. The rules allowed Frank to reverse that decision and he has taken up the option.Tel is understood to be extremely surprised, having started the past four matches. Frank’s decision to substitute Tel and send on Solanke against West Ham was booed by the Spurs support.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s a rundown of the issues that will shape the tournament as it comes to North AmericaAlexander Abnosin New YorkMon 19 Jan 2026 09.09 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 09.16 ESTShareWe’re only six months from the biggest single sporting occasion in the world. On 19 July in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the men’s World Cup final will kick off and a champion will be crowned (although it will be hard to topthe last one).The final will be more than a coronation (or confirmation, if Argentina repeat as champions). It will also be a culmination of six weeks of near non-stop soccer played across three countries, four time zones, and 16 cities. It’s likely that conclusions will already be drawn at that point on how the whole tournament fared. But for now, at this semi-convenient milestone, it’s worth taking stock of where we are six months out.TicketsShort version:They’re expensive. Longer version: They’re expensive, and seemingly very popular, and those things are connected. Fifa boasted in a recent release that more than 500 million requests for tickets had been made in the recent phase, the third overall but the first to take placesince the draw was madeon 5 December. That follows claims of 2m tickets sold in the second phase, and 1m in the first phase.In a first for a World Cup, Fifa isusing a dynamic pricing modelfor tickets – a practice that adjusts prices according to demand. That means tickets for this World Cup have been, by and large, incredibly expensive.A Guardian analysis from Decemberfound that tickets for the final shot up in price by up to nine times compared with the 2022 edition, adjusted for inflation. What’s more, the steepest increases came at the cheapest price points. Fifa has also moved to control the resale market by operating its own platform, on which both sellers and buyers are charged with a 15% processing fee. In Mexico, fans are only allowed to sell their tickets for what they paid for them and below, thanks to local laws against scalping.Growing sense of embarrassment at Fifa over Donald Trump peace prizeRead moreFifa has claimed that these policies have been instituted to align with common practices in North America, and also to generate the maximum amount of revenue for its member associations. Fifa says this revenue can then be used to fund the development of soccer around the world. But even if you assume the most noble intentions from Fifa, there’s no question that it is pricing out a significant portion of fans.The outcry has spilled into mainstream politics. New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani submitted a petition to Fifa to lower prices, making it a part of his successful election campaign. Several individual supporters’ groups have decried the fact that prices for the most dedicated fans are the same as those for the general public. To quell these protests, Fifaannounced in Decemberthat a portion of tickets for each game will remain at the $60 price floor – an offering representing 1.6% of sellable tickets for the games.There have also been reports of some fan groups cancelling their tickets due to the United States’ domestic and foreign policy (more on that later), but there’s little evidence that has actually happened in significant numbers.The next ticketing window is called the “last minute” phase. Fifa has yet to announce when it will open.View image in fullscreenMetLife Stadium will host the World Cup final.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersTravelWorld Cup travel tends to fall into three categories: Getting to the host country, getting between the host cities, and getting around the cities themselves. All of those categories will present numerous hurdles for those coming from outside North America. The primary ones being cost, availability, immigration issues, and infrastructure. Fans from other countries may also be surprised at the relative lack of public transport to stadiums in the United States in particular compared to previous hosts.Getting into two of the three host countries is fairly straightforward. Citizens of many World Cup nations won’t need a visa to enter Canada for the tournament, but they may need an electronic travel authorization (there’s afull list of who needs what here). A similar arrangement goes for Mexico, where fans from several World Cup-qualified countries are among the list (here) who do not need a visa for tourism. The immigration policies of both countries are not expected to change dramatically between now and kick-off.That is, uh, not the case for the United States, where a new immigration-related policy seems to arrive every week. Last week’s move by the US state department tosuspend visa processing for 75 countries, which includes 14 countries who have already qualified for the World Cup, was thought to be one such wrinkle, but it only applied to visas for people who intend to stay in the country permanently.Donald Trump’s recent travel bans specifically target people arriving from four qualified countries: Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire. There are exceptions for athletes and officials in each country’s World Cup delegation, but fans may run into difficulties acquiring visas to enter the US. Other countries who are not subject to the travel bans but who do need visas will have to apply for the new World Cup fast-track system in order to have realistic hope of making an interview appointment with enough time to spare – US secretary of state Marco Rubio promised the system will get fans appointments within six to eight weeks. However, fans could still be denied entry to the US, and should expect stringent questioning at immigration. Fans from countries who don’t need a visa to visit the US may still be made to provide their social media history and other personal information upon entry – a move supporters’ groupshave called“profoundly unacceptable.”Flights from various World Cup countries to the US, Mexico, and Canada have surged in price, as is to be expected at any World Cup. Likewise, hotel prices in host cities have risen considerably, especially as Fifa has taken thousands of rooms off the market to house players, officials and media. US secretary of transportation Sean Duffy last year encouraged visitors to take a road trip to travel between games – something that won’t realistically be possible for a lot of fans (unless they’re OK with missing out on a bunch of games in order to drive). For example, the winner of Uefa Playoff A (Italy, Northern Ireland, North Macedonia or Bosnia and Herzegovina) will log the most travel in the group stage: More than 3,100 miles, starting in Toronto, then Los Angeles before finishing in Seattle. Group I, where every team will play in either New York/New Jersey, Boston, or Philadelphia, will be far more palatable.The 2026 World Cup final is in … New Jersey? A brief guide to the MetLife StadiumRead moreThe tournament itselfAlready, there is a sense that this World Cup’s expanded 48-team format will have a markedly different feel than in the past, with two-thirds of teams making it out of the group stage. The pressure often felt from the very start is bound to be lower this time around, resulting in a tournament that may need a couple of weeks to really get going. Still, the extra knockout round may make up for that – those win-or-go-home games often throw out some of the best drama the sport has to offer.For the tournament’s vast middle class – countries not as good as the big powers and not as unfancied as the minnows – making it out of the group stage is going to mean far less than it has before. For proof, look no further than one of this year’s co-hosts. For generations of US men’s players, winning a World Cup knockout game was the holy grail. This time around, winning one knockout round game will get the Americans to the round of 16 – the same place where they exited the last two World Cups they’ve played in. Is that success? Expect similar sorts of debates to surround a number of countries.TrumpThe US president has instituted the travel bans mentioned above. He has already received and kept one World Cup trophy, and looks in line for another one. He made himself the center of attention ina moment of sporting glory. He isthe apple of Gianni Infantino’s eye. When asked if he would move to take World Cup games away from “blue” cities,he said yes(he has no unilateral authority to do so). And, oh yes,he won the Fifa Peace Prize.Mere weeks after winning that prize, Trump unilaterally sent troops into Venezuela to capture their leader, Nicolás Maduro. He has deployed masked, armed forces to American cities to round up people who vaguely, possibly may be criminals, immigrants, or both (and who are often neither). He has referred to many of the competing nations at the World Cup as “shithole countries.” And he hasraised tension with several European countriesover the future of Greenland.Will the US president impact the fan experience and other aspects of the World Cup? Take a guess. The only real question at this point is how he’ll do so.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One source described the wages offered to coaches and analysts for the first five years of the competition, when their salaries were funded by the England and WalesCricketBoard, as embarrassing.Spirit are hoping to benefit from the combination of a massive funding boost afterthe sale of 49% of the teamfor £145m to a consortium of entrepreneurs unofficially known as the Tech Titans in last year’s team auction and the pull of life in the English capital to hire staff of sufficient calibre to transform their fortunes. It is understood that their spending on support staff will be trebled.Sussex CCC placed in special measures over alleged financial mismanagementRead moreWhile thewomen’s side won the tournament in 2024and reached the eliminator last year, the men have finished last or second-last in four of its five seasons.“We’ll be resourcing our support staff in a way that far exceeds ­previous years,” said Mo Bobat, London Spirit’s director of cricket. “The onus is now on teams to pay their coaches – and their science and medicine staff or their analysts – whatever they want to pay them. We’ve had a good level of backing from the board and we’ve been able to recruit and attract really good ­people because of that.“Our job is to get high-quality people in. We’ve got excellent coaches, we’ve started to build really strong support staff teams and we want to try to make sure that our systems and processes allow success to become inevitable. That doesn’t just happen overnight, but we’re trying to do that as quickly as we can.”Bobat is also director of cricket at Royal Challengers Bengaluru, whowon the Indian Premier League for the first time in 2025, and has recruited several of their support staff, including their head coach, Andy Flower, as well as the team analyst, Freddie Wilde, and the physio, James Pipe. The women’s team will be coached by Jon Lewis, with Heather Knight taking on the role of general manager.On Monday, Spirit announced eight directly signed players, including the South Africans Marizanne Kapp – player of the match when she wonthe 2022 final with Oval Invincibles– and Dewald Brevis, the Australian spinner Adam Zampa, Englishmen Jamie Overton and Liam Livingstone and the 19-year-old English seamer Mahika Gaur.They also unveiled a new logo – an austere effort compared with some of their rivals, composed of the letters L and S, with the L slanted in a nod to the slope at Lord’s – and an official colour palette that focuses on blue, but also reflects MCC tradition by including “bacon” (a shade previously better known as red) and “egg” (yellow).With local rivals Oval Invinciblesrebranded as MI Londonit means the capital’s two Hundred franchises will both wear blue and have London in their names. “Ideally they might have been different colours, but it’s not something I’ve spent too much time thinking about,” Bobat said.“There’s plenty of teams that wear blue in the IPL and there’s no shortage of rivalry there.”Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Will the tide turn at the 2026 Cheltenham festival?The next three weekends of relentless action will put us within touching distance of a definitive answerGreg WoodMon 19 Jan 2026 12.23 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 12.54 ESTShareCheltenham opens its doors for the final time before the festival meeting for an eight-race Trials Day card on Saturday, marking the start of a frenetic 15-day period of action during which, according to recent figures as least, trainers will apply the finishing touches to at least half of the runners and about 60% of the winners over the four days in March.And this year it will do so amid a refreshed sense of optimism, both at the track and in British jumping as a whole, that things are (finally) on the up.World Sports Photography Awards 2026 winners revealed – in picturesRead moreRecent meetings at Cheltenham have attracted record crowds – the New Year’s Day fixture pulled in an astonishing 44,000, more than the second day of last year’s festival – and while it remains to be seen if that translates to a turnaround in festival attendance, there are currently five ante-post favourites for one of the 13 Grade One events stabled in a British yard.That figure does, admittedly, require a double-count of Paul Nicholls’srecent Challow Hurdle winner,No Drama This End, who heads the betting for both the Turners Novice Hurdle on the Wednesday and the Albert Bartlett 48 hours later, so perhaps it should be four-and-a-half. But that still feels a good deal more positive for the home team than looking down the barrel of a festival pummelling from the Irish from as early as mid-January, which has been a painfully familiar position for much of the last decade.A resurgent Nicky Henderson, who has endured some tough festivals in recent seasons, is responsible for the other three, all due to run on the festival’s opening day. Old Park Star was a deeply impressive winner at Haydock on Saturday and it will take something special from an Irish-trained runner to shift him from at least a share of favouritism for the Supreme Novice Hurdle. Lulamba is 6-4 for the Arkle Trophy, and Sir Gino is 5-4 for the Champion Hurdle.Better yet, there is significant cause for British optimism in the betting for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, a race that was last won by a British-trained runner in 2018.In seven runnings since, the combined might of British jumping – including all-time greats like Henderson and Paul Nicholls, and their obvious successor in Dan Skelton – has struggled to come up with a halfway-credible contender. While 41 of the 84 Gold Cup runners since 2019 been trained in Britain, just six set off at a single-figure price, and the last two renewals have been a wholesale embarrassment for the home side. The three British-trained runners in 2025’s nine-strong field went off at 28-1, 28-1 and 80-1.As things stand, however, four of the first seven in the Gold Cup betting are trained in Britain, and while Willie Mullins’s Galopin Des Champs, the winner in 2023 and 2024, is a narrow favourite at 6-1, Henderson’s Jango Baie,fourth home in a memorable blanket finishto the King George, is hot on his heels at 7-1.Last year’s winner, Inothewayurthinkin, looks distinctly unconvincing at the same price after two sub-par runs this season, while the King George winner, Ben Pauling’s The Jukebox Man, is 8-1 to give Harry Redknapp the biggest win of his ownership career.The hulking Haiti Couleurs (14-1),the Welsh National winner under a huge weightin December, has also been committed to the fray by Rebecca Curtis, his trainer, and will attempt to give Wales a first Gold Cup win since Norton’s Coin in 1990. And the splendid Grey Dawning, the Betfair Chase winner in November, will be among the star attractions on Saturday, when he is expected to line up for the Grade Two Cotswold Chase.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowNewcastle12.43 Prince Achille 1.13 Superior Council 1.43 Starryfield 2.13 Little Ted 2.43 Silky Wilkie (nap) 3.13 Spartan Fighter (nb) 3.43 Eco Power Boy 4.13 DigitalLeicester1.32 Ubatuba 2.02 No Tackle 2.32 Seaview Rock 3.02 Tigers Moon 3.32 Hall Lane 4.02 Take A HikeSouthwell5.00 Overlooked 5.30 Hunky Dory 6.00 Itaca 6.30 How’s The Guvnor 7.00 Dollar’s Dream 7.30 Stintino Sunset 8.00 Dust Cover 8.30 Shalaa AskerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.You need to be an optimist to be involved with jumping, of course, and there have been moments in the past when it was possible to imagine a turning of the Irish tide, only for subsequent events to show that it’s always the hope that kills you. The home team were 4-3 up after the first day 12 months ago … and 20-8 down three days later. The Dublin Racing festival in two weekends’ time could easily throw up a serious rival for any or all of Britain’s big hopes.But for the moment at least, the only way is up, and to spice things up further still, Saturday’s Cheltenham card could also see a head-to-head between Sir Gino and Skelton’s The New Lion, the second-favourite for the Champion Hurdle, in the International Hurdle.Yet another improving Henderson-trained runner, Impose Toi, is among the entries for the Cleeve Hurdle and third-favourite for the Stayers’ in March, and the card’s handicaps too can easily highlight a festival winner, as Jagwar, the subsequent (British-trained) Plate winner, showed 12 months ago.Will it be a bounce-back Cheltenham for British jumping or is this another false dawn? The next three weekends of relentless action, at Cheltenham, Doncaster, Leopardstown, Newbury, Warwick and more, will put us within touching distance of a definitive answer.Explore more on these topicsCheltenham festivalTalking HorsesHorse racingHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year’s competition kicked off in December, but there is collective support from coaches and clubs to commence their campaigns before the packed November Test window.The existing structure and calendar slots are technically in place until 2030, but there is growing recognition that a change could be helpful. Among other benefits, clubs would have a better chance of having their best players fit and firing before the autumn internationals which, in turn, could encourage more early season interest.Champions Cup roundup: Saracens face last-16 tie at Bath after defeat against GlasgowRead moreThis could take the form of a single weekend apiece in October and December rather than two consecutive October weekends but, either way, European Professional Club Rugby insists that interest in the tournament is rising despite criticism of the 24-team, four-pool structure.EPCR officials say television audiences have doubled in the past six years and that aggregate stadium attendances have also risen by 50%, to about 1.5 million, over the same period.While the tournament’s image has suffered from clubs picking weakened teams for high-profile pool games away from home, complex travel logistics to and from South Africa and Leicester and Bulls making the last 16 despite winning one of their four pool games, EPCR’s chief executive, Jacques Raynaud, claims the formula is bearing fruit.“The format is delivering when you look at how few dead-rubber games there are,” Raynaud said. “We have a compelling tournament with a stable format that is delivering what we wanted: jeopardy, increasing audiences, increasing fan engagement.“It does tick a number of boxes when you look at the data and the number of people coming to the stadiums. We’ve got the best attendances in the Champions Cup since Covid and we have also had a 50% increase in digital fan engagement so I’m not just sugar-coating it.Quick GuidePioneering female referee retires from Test gameShowThe sport's first professional female referee, Sara Cox, has stepped down from refereeing international games but will continue to be involved in club rugby. Cox was centrally contracted by the Rugby Football Union in 2016 and has gone on to oversee 51 Tests, including at last year's Women's World Cup.\"I feel very privileged to have officiated at the highest level of the global game for over a decade,\" Cox said. \"Rugby has given me amazing experiences but after the high of a home World Cup, now feels like the right time to hang up my international boots and spend some time on other interests while continuing to give my all to the club game.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Andrew Dowling/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I know there are opinions out there that it could be more elite, but it’s still delivering fantastic rugby on superb stages. The knockout stages are box office, the numbers are great. There’s constant work to refine the format [but] it’s been stabilised and people understand it. Remember our job is not only to provide cheese and dessert. We have to lay on a great compelling tournament from a sporting fan side and also have a financial formula that is liked by TV, sponsors and host cities so we can maximise the money we’re generating for the club game.”Raynaud does concede, though, that an earlier start would help, as would a bigger gap between the last 16 and quarter-finals to allow more time to sell tickets and assist travelling fans.“It is likely we will go back to an October start,” Raynaud said. “That’s not confirmed, but it’s a desire. A lot of people liked it because it corresponded more to the narrative around the start of the club rugby season. Coaches like it because it builds into the Test matches.“The question is do we do blocks of two weekends or one, one and two. The other thing is that we don’t want to confuse people by starting in October one year and not another because of the World Cup. We’re just fine-tuning that, but it is a request from the leagues and from many clubs.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

He said she also recognised family members’ voices and hurried to meet them when they called.“I was naturally amazed by her extraordinary intelligence and thought how much we could learn from animals: patience, calmness, contentment, and gentleness,” he said.Word soon got around and before long a video clip of the cow’s behaviour reached biologists in Vienna who specialise in animal intelligence. They immediately grasped the importance of the footage. “It was a cow using an actual tool,” said Dr Antonio Osuna Mascaró at the city’s University of Veterinary Medicine. “We got everything ready and jumped in the car to visit.”Veronika’s home town, Nötsch im Gailtal, is “straight out of the Sound of Music” with green forests, blue lakes, mountains and a church and school near Veronika’s meadow, Osuna Mascaró said, adding: “It’s the most idyllic place imaginable for an Austrian cow.”Armed with a deck brush, Osuna Mascaró and his colleague Alice Auersperg set about testing Veronika’s skills. Through a series of field trials, the brown Swiss proved she could not only pick up the broom, but wield it according to the job at hand. If the broom was at an awkward angle, Veronika used her tongue to reposition it before clamping it in place with her teeth.Veronika the cow scratches her backVeronika the cow scratches her back.Veronika favoured the bristled end of the broom to scratch the tough skin on her back. But she switched to the smooth handle and scratched more gently when the itch was on more delicate, lower body areas such as her udders and belly, according to the study inCurrent Biology.“At the beginning I thought this was the result of a mistake. Perhaps Veronika was not careful enough when selecting her tool for self-scratching,” Osuna Mascaró said. “But after a while we started to observe a pattern: Veronika indeed had a preference for using the broom end, but when she used the handle end she was doing so in a meaningful way.”Tool use is well known in chimps, crows, dolphins and even octopuses. The latter have been filmedthrowing shells at one another. But livestock have never been considered the sharpest of animals. Gary Larson’s 1982 Far Side cartoon,Cow Tools, shows a cow standing behind a table of oddly shaped objects. It confused scores of readers, including Larson’s mother, prompting him toexplain: “While I have never met a cow who could make tools, I felt sure that if I did, they (the tools) would lack something in sophistication and resemble the sorry specimens shown.”Veronika is far from making even misshapen tools, but her prowess in using them has impressed nonetheless. Over seven sessions of 10 trials, the researchers witnessed 76 instances of tool use as she grabbed the broom to scratch otherwise unreachable regions. Using both ends of the brush counts as multi-purpose tool use, the scientists say, which is extraordinarily rare. Beyond humans, it has only been shown convincingly in chimpanzees.It is unclear how Veronika acquired her skills, but circumstances have been in her favour. Few cows reach her age of 13 years old, or live in such a stimulating environment. That said, the researchers believe cattle may simply be smarter than people have previously realised. Since the study, Osuna Mascaró said other clever cows have come to light. “We don’t believe that Veronika is the Einstein of cows,” he said.“What this tells us is that cows have the potential to innovate tool use, and we have ignored this fact for thousands of years,” he added. “It’s shocking that we’re only discovering this now.”There is no suggestion that Veronika’s skills are evidence of the evolution of an ominous new species of super-cow. As the scientists write in the study: “She did not fashion tools like the cow in Gary Larson’s cartoon, but she selected, adjusted and used one with notable dexterity and flexibility. Perhaps the real absurdity lies not in imagining a tool-using cow, but in assuming such a thing could never exist.”Explore more on these topicsAnimal behaviourAnimalsAustriaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Central to the disagreement is how duty of candour in the public authority (accountability) bill would apply to serving intelligence officers.The law –designed to stop official cover-ups– would mean those in public office who lie or evade would face prosecution. The government has agreed the law should cover the security services, but wants to give agency chiefs the final say over when individual officers can give evidence, a power the families say is unacceptable and could lead to future cover-ups.On Friday, the government laid down its own amendments to the bill, which put further obligations on the security services – but still did not go far enough to gain agreement.A Labour source said there was now no option but to delay the bill until a compromise could be reached that was acceptable to the families and did not affect national security. Families, along with the barrister Pete Weatherby, the architect of the law, met the ministers Alex Davies-Jones and Nick Thomas-Symonds in the Ministry of Justice on Monday, but left without agreement.Speaking at a press conference earlier on Monday, Starmer said he was determined to find a solution. “I care hugely that we get this right, that we right the wrongs for very many families who have been let down and ensure a better future for families,” he said.“In relation to the duty of candour, we’ve been clear that that matters. What we’re now trying to do is make sure we get the balance right when it comes to the application of any principle to the security and intelligence agencies.“Obviously, I have to focus on the national interest – my primary duty as prime minister, which is to keep this country safe and secure. That is the duty I hold above all other duties, and I take it really seriously, which is why we’re taking time to make sure that we get that balance absolutely right.”MPs said they were relieved the government had pulled the bill from Commons business – but it may now not return for many weeks. About 20 Labour MPs had signed an amendment from theLiverpoolWest Derby MP, Ian Byrne, which was in line with the families’ demands.The bill will need to return to the Commons for the report stage and third reading, as well as go through the Lords.A government source said they were “not putting a deadline” on the talks and that agreement would be needed with the families, the intelligence agencies, the Home Office and Foreign Office, and the intelligence and security committee. Starmer is likely to be involved personally at the later stages of the talks.Byrne had said he would not be able to support the legislation with the government’s amendments included. The Liverpool city region mayor, Steve Rotheram and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham,said on Saturdaythat the government amendment “risks undermining the spirit of the legislation” and “creates too broad an opt-out” for the security services.The campaign group Hillsborough Law Now said it welcomed the government “listening to the campaign, families, MPs and supporters by withdrawing their security services amendment”.Davies-Jones, parliamentary undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Justice, said on Monday night there was “no arbitrary deadline” on when MPs will next debate and vote on the bill, because the families of the victims have asked her not to set one.“They want us to get it right, and we’re committed to doing that and to getting this policy correct,” she told MPs in the Commons. “As soon as we have more information, I will bring that forward to the house.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLabourKeir StarmerLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

The government said this would “give stability to investors”.The Guardian understands the white paper, which will be published on Tuesday and was not made available to journalists in advance, will include provisions for the regulator to step in and “manage” fines so a company does not collapse. This could include deferring penalties, or letting the company off certain payments. A source at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the “aim is for every water company to eventually pay their fines”.Creditors have asked for Thames Water to be let off future fines as thecompany staves off financial collapse. In May 2025,it was fined over £120m for environmental breachesinvolving sewage spills, after failing to operate and manage its treatment works and wastewater networks effectively.“We are fixing the problems and getting the companies to a stance where customers are not paying for their failures,” a Defra source said.Thames Water ranked worst supplier in England as firms’ ratings hit record lowRead moreRichard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “If a company is fined because it’s done something wrong. It should either make restitution or the polluter should pay.”He added: “It sounds like a desperate play to be off the hook at the last minute, and companies should think about that when they are engaging in unlawful actions and failing in their public environmental interest duties. If a business hasn’t managed itself well enough to deal with the consequences of its shortcomings then it needs to deal with those consequences.”Industry sources said the possibility of a turnaround regime would be welcome, although they acknowledged that companies would have to accept restrictions on payouts to executives and investors if fines were reduced or deferred.A new “MOT for water companies” will be announced as part of the measures, which ministers say will force the firms to disclose the state of their infrastructure.This would prevent water outages such as those recentlyfaced by tens of thousands of people in Kent and Sussex, government sources said. This is because old pipes and a badly maintained water treatment centre were blamed for the shortages.View image in fullscreenThousands of homes in south-east England were recently affected by water outages.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe UK’s pipes arelargely Victorian, no major reservoir has been built for more than 30 years. Many water treatment centres were built decades ago andhave not been updated.Other changes include:Dedicated supervisory teams for each water company.“No notice” inspection powers for the new regulator.A new chief engineer inside Ofwat to oversee hands-on checks to water infrastructure.The overhaul, due to be enshrined in law in the water reform bill, is part of the government’s response to a wide-rangingreport on the water sectorby Jon Cunliffe, a former Bank of England official. He made 88 recommendations to improve the sector, some of which – such as the supervisory model – have been accepted.There will be no change to the ownership structures of water companies, and Cunliffe was banned by the government from considering nationalising the industry in his report.Englandand Wales are the only countries in the world with a fully privatised water system.Feargal Sharkey, the water campaigner and former singer of the Undertones, said: “This is just a rearrangement of the deckchairs. After 35 years of privatisations we have two hospitals, a kidney treatment centre, 15 schools, 19 care homes and 29 nurseries in Tunbridge Wells left without water for two weeks. The government is terrified of dealing with privatisation and has sacrificed water quality on the altar of shareholders and private equity.“No 10 is operating under paralysis of doing anything which might slightly spook the bond markets. Ministers have failed to grasp the underlying issue which is corporate greed. The only people who will be paying for this are customers and billpayers.”View image in fullscreenFeargal Sharkey has likened the government’s changes to a ‘rearrangement of the deckchairs’.Photograph: Krisztián Elek/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockThe government previously announced it wouldabolish Ofwat, as recommended by Cunliffe, and combine its powers with those of other water watchdogs under a new “super-regulator”. It remains unclear whether the new regulator will be in place in time to oversee the next price review in 2029, which will set household bills and company spending plans until 2035. The government is expected to set out its timeline for the new regulator in March.Cunliffe recommended allowing companies to be let off the hook for fines under a turnaround regime.In his report, he said: “A turnaround regime could provide the water regulator with additional discretion over enforcement in defined circumstances, allowing them to defer or waive fines and penalties where it is in the broader interest of customers. This may include, for example, circumstances where additional fines are likely to hinder the ability of the company to invest in infrastructure improvement.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWater industryThames WaterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This was a nine-year record and up 21% from 2016, Guardian analysis found. Adjusting for inflation, it was the highest amount since 2019.Bill Gates, the tech billionaire and founder of Microsoft, was ranked by Forbes as the world’s wealthiest man for most of the years between 1995 and 2017. In 2000, he and his then wife, Melinda, set up the Gates Foundation, which is now the third largest charitable foundation in the world. It uses its resources for a range of causes including public health, poverty reduction, education and climate adaptation.Divestment first became an issue for Gates in 2015. At the time, a global campaign by religious figures, climate activists, students and other charities called for large foundations to divest from fossil fuels.In March 2015 the Guardianlaunched a campaigncalled Keep It in the Ground, which called for the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation Trust to “delegitimise the business models of companies that are using investors’ money to search for yet more coal, oil and gas that can’t safely be burned”.Graph showing Gates Foundation investment in fossil fuel companies over the past decadeIn the years leading up to the campaign, the trust was heavily invested in fossil fuels, to the tune of $1.4bn in 2013. “I understood why the Guardian had singled out our foundation and me. I also admired the activists’ passion,” Gates later wrote in his 2021 book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster. But he was sceptical of divestment and did not see how “divesting alone would stop climate change or help people in poor countries”.Despite this, the trust shifted its position andsold a great dealof its fossil fuel stocks and bonds, including most of its $187m stock holding in BP and a $824m holding in ExxonMobil. Its holdings in fossil fuel extractors reduced from $1.4bn in 2013 to $260m in 2015, Guardian analysis found.In a2015 paper, Gates called for more government investment in carbon-free energy sources, arguing that it was not right to “simply let the market guide [investment]” because it searched for shorter-term, guaranteed wins, namely fossil fuel companies.Al Gore wonders if ‘bullying’ Trump prompted Bill Gates to backtrack on climateRead moreBut since 2015, the value of the trust’s investments in several fossil fuel companies has increased. Its Glencore holdings increased from $5.7m in 2015 to $14.1m in 2024, its BP holdings increased from $8.7m to $24.2m, and its Occidental Petroleum holdings rose from $23,529 to $7.9m, among others.Some of this growth can be accounted for by an increase in stock price rather than active investment.In his 2021 book on climate, Gates looked back at 2019 and said he felt a personal, rather than financial, desire not to own stocks in fossil fuel companies. “I don’t want to profit if their stock prices go up because we don’t develop zero-carbon alternatives,” he wrote. “I’d feel bad if I benefited from a delay in getting to zero. So in 2019 I divested all my direct holdings in oil and gas companies, as did the trust that manages the Gates Foundation’s endowment.”By the end of 2020 the trust’s investments in those companies had fallen to $133m. But in the following years the direction of travel reversed, with new investment in producers such as Inpex, which benefited from a $139m holding in 2024, a sevenfold increase from $20m in 2020.Other than Inpex, the trust has millions invested in BP and Equinor, which both facedshareholder rebellionsin 2025 due to allegations of greenwashing. Millions more are invested in Occidental Petroleum, which bragged about captured carbon dioxide only topump it into oilfieldsto enhance their output.How Bill Gates funds green energy but invests in fossil fuels – videoIn 2023, the companies in which the Gates trust had invested were responsible for more emissions collectively than Russia, Japan and Germany combined.And in the most recent year of financial results, which goes to the end of 2024, the trust reached a 10-year record, at the same time as Gates’most recent public statementssupported a “strategic pivot” away from focusing on cutting emissions and towards preventing poverty and suffering.The Gates Foundation was approached for comment.The Guardian analysis usedpublicly available990-PF forms provided by the Gates Foundation and only included direct fossil fuel extractors, excluding millions of dollars invested in companies that provide drilling equipment, technological services, or own pipelines and refineries.This is a strict definition of “upstream” fossil fuel producers, which also excludes large conglomerates that own subsidiaries that extract, such as Centrica plc or Alfa SAB de CV, whose primary business is not fossil fuel extraction.We also excluded mutual funds that themselves hold investments in fossil fuel companies, though we included financing arms specifically devoted to raising capital for extractors, such as Shell Finance or Petrobras Global Finance.Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsBill and Melinda Gates FoundationFossil fuel divestmentEnergyBill GatesnewsShareReuse this content"

Other blooms include a ring around the Chatham Islands off New Zealand,captured by Nasathis month, or“the red tide”that surfaced off the coast of Florida, which have been monitoredby the state.The scientists used artificial intelligence to scan 1.2m satellite pictures of the oceans taken between 2003 and 2022. A deep-learning model was employed to detect signals of floating algae – a process that took several months.The team, who say their study provides the first global picture of algae floating in the world’s oceans, found that seaweed blooms increased in area by 13.4% a year over the period examined. Blooms of microalgae, such as phytoplankton, also increased but at a relatively more modest 1% a year.“What is noteworthy is that most increases in both floating macroalgae and microalgae scums occurred in the recent decade, in line with the accelerated global ocean warming since 2010,” the authors wrote. They identified tipping points in 2008, 2011 and 2012 for three types of seaweed in different oceans.However, while seaweed such as sargassum had thrived in some regions, phytoplankton have not shown similar responses to the changing environment, suggesting their growth may be more sensitive to shifts in temperature andeutrophication.“If this is the case, we believe that a regime shift in oceanographic conditions has already occurred to favour macroalgae, which will have profound impacts on radiative forcing in the atmosphere and light availability in the ocean, as well as on carbon sequestration, ocean biogeochemistry and upper ocean stability,” the researchers wrote.The findings are published in Nature Communications.Explore more on these topicsOceansMarine lifeClimate crisisWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

But increasingly, research shows us that this fascination runs both ways. From high above, these birds are watching us too.Thanks to the development of tinyGPStracking devices attached to their bodies, researchers are getting millions of data points on the day-to-day lives of these apex predators of the skies, giving us greater insight into where they hunt and rest, and how they die.The data shows human activity has hidden consequences across entire landscapes, and is more significant than previously thought.One phenomenon the data has revealed is the “weekend and holiday effect” on days where more people tend to go to wilderness areas – such as the beach, or forest for hiking. Researchers found eagles expand their range on public holidays, an indication that they travel further to find food.View image in fullscreenDr Pascual López-López records the measurements of a female golden eagle, while technician Cristina Navarro Pérez safely restrains it in Castellón, Spain. It took 18 attempts between 2024 and 2025 to capture the bird“We thought before that eagles would just ignore people in the forest,” says Dr Pascual López-López from the University of Valencia, but GPS tracking reveals the opposite.Birdswill abandon breeding if there is too much human disturbance, and it makes it difficult for them to hunt prey (as prey species are often scared too) so they have to travel further to find food.Researchers say better regulation is needed in protected areas to ensure that people are not climbing or hiking during the breeding season. “It’s not a matter of prohibition, but of regulation,” says López-López.Our growing knowledge of raptor movements also reveals when they suddenly stop – indicating that they have been killed. From 2015,GPS technology revealed an alarming patternof human-linked deaths among the endangered Bonelli’s eagles in the Valencia region of Spain. Collision and electrocution with overhead power lines was a leading cause of death. “We weren’t aware of the magnitude of the problem prior to this research,” says López-López.View image in fullscreenThe golden eagle is one of the most iconic birds of prey on the Iberian peninsulaView image in fullscreenA Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata) chick is measured and prepared to be fitted with a GPS tagThe story unfolding with this single species in one region of Spain is being repeated nationally, and potentially around the world. It is not just eagles that are affected: storks, bustards and flamingos are also killed when they collide with power lines or use them to rest in lieu of trees. In Spain, at least33,000 raptors die each yearfrom electrocution on power lines, which now crisscross much of the planet.The GPS tracking study also shows that despite legal protections, Bonelli’s eagles are still being shot and poisoned by hunters, farmers and people who keep racing pigeons.As early as the 1800s, naturalists observed how eagle and hawk populations declined as their habitats were cleared and cities expanded. Deforestation is causing population declines in thelargest number of speciesglobally, as most raptors are forest-dependent – if they lose their habitats it is harder to survive. But it is not all negative.Barn owls, for example, thrive in agricultural landscapes, whileperegrine falconpopulations are rising in urban areas.View image in fullscreenLópez-López releases a golden eagle in Castellón. Its GPS transmitter provides unique data that will help shape future strategies for the species’ conservationNow, a new form of human development is emerging as a threat – the huge growth in renewable energy.Researchpublished in Decemberfound that renewable energy expansion can undermine species reintroductions, with 9,000 griffon vultures dying from turbines in Spain in the past two decades (the country installed its first windfarm in 2005). “They change landscapes,” says López-López. “I’m in favour of renewable energy, and the energy transition is necessary. But the problem is the cost of these developments – we need better planning to think about which areas we should be doing them in.”Globally, 18% of species facing threat of extinction are negatively affected by utilities and service lines (mainly electrocution), while 11% are negatively affected by wind facilities,research shows. Lead researcher, Christopher O’Bryan from the System Earth Science Research Institute at Maastricht University, says: “This is a complex problem and there is not necessarily going to be a silver-bullet solution. We have to accept trade-offs.”View image in fullscreenA common buzzard (Buteo buteo) on an electricity pylon near Valencia. As humans push further into wild habitats, power lines pose an increasing threat to birdsBut GPS tracking helps us understand what those compromises can be. For example, a 10-year research projecttracking red kitesfound that a 25-metre (82-ft) increase in rotor diameter resulted in a five-fold increase in mortality. The researchers could give exact recommendations on how the blades should be built to reduce excess mortality. “It’s about finding win-wins,” says O’Bryan.Something gnawed your oak tree? Sink hole in your road? How Zurich’s beaver hotline is reassuring residentsRead moreElsewhere, short-toed eagles, Montagu’s harriers, booted eagles, bearded vultures, griffon vultures and Egyptian vultures are all being GPS tagged, and scientists are finding that “the causes of mortality are the same”, says López-López. Electrocution is a leading problem. “Even a modest reduction in adult mortality could prevent regional extinction.”In some regions, conservationists are working with power companies to retrofit pylons. In Doñana national park, Spain, electrocutions of the Spanish imperial eagle havebeen reduced by 97%thanks to retrofitting pylons.In the US, Duncan Eccleston, a researcher from EDM International which provides wildlife consulting services to electric utilities, estimates that approximately 15% of pylons in golden eagle habitat in the US would be considered “high risk” to eagles, with up to eight times greaterlikelihood of electrocutionthan the remaining pylons. “If we focus on fixing 15% of poles in golden eagle habitat, we’re really taking control of a vast proportion of the problem,” he says.View image in fullscreenBruna, a female Bonelli’s eagle that died from electrocution on power lines. Her death was discovered via her GPS transmitter, which enabled researchers to identify the pylon, leading to it being modified to help prevent other birds from dyingElectricity companies are motivated to solve this problem, because these interactions are not good for utilities, says Eccleston. “If you have an electrocution, there is a good chance they are knocking the power out.”Many companies are now only building avian-friendly pylons, says Eccleston. “There is a lot of work right now to renew this system, and this is worldwide. There is an opportunity to do things differently and do things better.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionWildlifeAnimalsDeforestationConservationGPSEndangered speciesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His assistant of 16 years, Linda Brunning, 66, is accused of helping him abuse children at the home and indecently assaulting one boy herself.A trial for Brunning, and a trial of facts for Phillips, who has been deemed unfit to stand trial, opened on Monday at Bradford crown court.Michelle Colborne KC, prosecuting, said Phillips was the manager from when Skircoat Lodge opened in 1976 as a residential temporary home for children who were the subject of care orders. She said children at the home were vulnerable, many having suffered previous physical or sexual abuse. Some, she told jurors, were “simply unwanted, marked as troublemakers in the system”.Jurors heard how female complainants, who were told to wear nighties for bed, described Phillips coming into their bedrooms at night and indecently assaulting them. She said Phillips lived in a flat leading to the girls’ bedrooms, which gave him “unfettered access”.Colborne told jurors: “During the course of almost two decades Malcolm Phillips used his power to isolate specific children to use for his sexual gratification, and he wasn’t the only one.”The court heard Brunning was also “adept at isolating and manipulating children”.Colborne said Brunning was a “large and domineering woman who took pleasure in humiliating children” and “facilitated sexual assaults by Malcolm Phillips on a small, defenceless child”.The prosecutor said the children “were chosen carefully by the defendants”, who had access to their files and “knew which children could be manipulated”. “They chose them carefully, they told them no one cared about them, they told them no one would believe them,” Colborne said.Jurors heard Phillips and Brunning would threaten to withhold the children’s pocket money, or told them their family visits would be taken away.Colborne said: “If they ran away from Skircoat Lodge they were taken straight back by police, accused of being troublemakers.”The court heard one complainant, who was sent to Skircoat Lodge as a teenager in the late 1970s, remembered that girls were told to “wear nighties to bed”. “While in bed, while the lights were out, she would hear Phillips enter the bedroom, he would approach her bed and touch her under her nightie,” Colborne said.She said a second complainant, who was 10 years old at the time, accused Phillips of sexually assaulting her on at least 10 occasions while she was in bed. The court heard Phillips “seemed to have taken her under his wing and referred to her as one of his special girls”.Phillips, of Tyseley, Birmingham, is charged with three counts of indecent assault, two counts of indecency with a child, three counts of indecent assault on a male person, two counts of buggery and two counts of rape.Brunning, of Sowerby Bridge, near Halifax, is charged with one count of indecent assault on a male person, two counts of aiding and abetting indecent assault and two counts of aiding and abetting buggery.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsWest YorkshireChild protectionSocial careChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

The threat was “greatly exaggerated”, leaving a safety committee that relied on the police intelligence “with little or no option” but to ban the fans, the report said.The West Midlands police and crime commissioner, Simon Foster, has asked the Independent Office forPoliceConduct to investigate Guildford for potential misconduct.Foster said: “These matters have had a significant impact on public confidence, and the confidence of particular communities in the West Midlands. This is unacceptable. The force know that I expect them to comply with the very highest standards of conduct at all times.“I will therefore today make a voluntary referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct regarding any conduct matters by the former chief constable in relation to these events.”A source said the grounds for asking the IOPC to investigate was the potentially misleading nature of intelligence given to Birmingham’s safety advisory group. Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were banned from attending the Europa League game based on the police intelligence.The IOPC has also been asked to review Guildford’s testimony to MPs on the home affairs select committee when he appeared before them in December and January, and whether his answers were misleading. In the first hearing, Guildford admitted part of a force dossier contained a reference to a Maccabi game against West Ham that never happened, and it had been gathered erroneously using artificial intelligence.The referral from the commissioner is just about the former chief constable. The watchdog has been studying the official report that condemned West Midlands police’s actions.The IOPC later confirmed it had called in the matter and would investigate whether any officer had a case to answer for misconduct. The watchdog’s director general, Rachel Watson, said: “There are many unanswered questions and it’s right for accountability and public confidence for us to independently investigate.“We will now undertake a full assessment of the evidence, and gather more where necessary, to establish if any of the officers may have breached police professional standards in relation to duties and responsibilities.”Central to West Midlands police’s defence as they planned for the game in Birmingham was information from Dutch police. The force said this intelligence led it to believe Maccabi fans had been perpetrators of violence during a match against Ajax in Amsterdam in November 2024.But Dutch police disputed this claim, saying the cause of trouble before the Amsterdam game was much more mixed, with Israeli fans and pro-Palestinian supporters provoking one another.Police intelligence emerged showing Guildford’s force had been told some local people might arm themselves if Israeli fans turned up, which led to claims the ban amounted to caving in to antisemitism. This emerged a fortnight after a terrorist attack left two dead at a synagogue in Manchester.Scott Green, West Midlands police’s deputy chief constable, has stepped up as chief constable temporarily.The IOPC said: “We have decided to use our ‘power of initiative’ to call in the matter and independently investigate to determine if any officer or staff member may have a case to answer for misconduct. We have examined a wealth of evidence relating to the force’s planning for the match atAston Villaon November 6 last year.“As questions remain about individual roles, duties and planning for the game, we have determined an independent investigation is warranted.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceWest MidlandsBirminghamAston VillaMaccabi Tel AvivnewsShareReuse this content"

This is a serious misreading of the situation,” she said.“These defections are not about policy differences or ideology; they are about character. We are THE party of the right and must remain so.”Badenoch was again scathing about Jenrick’s decision to stay as a Tory MP and shadow minister for months while he was secretly in talks with Farage. “Robert had resolved to leave some time ago, though he continued to attend meetings, sit around the table, and present himself as part of a collective effort,” she wrote.“Trust and teamwork are not optional in a serious political party that is looking to get into government. While I am sad at the outcome and though it was necessary to have spent the last few days dealing with the immediate aftermath, it is now time to move on.”Rosindell’s stated reasons for leaving – that Badenoch’s Tories had not sufficiently opposed the Chagos plan – “do not stand up to scrutiny”, she said, adding: “We all know he had his difficulties.”The acquisition of such MPs, she predicted, would bring trouble for Farage. “Reform now has more internal contradiction and ideological incoherence. They are not a centre-right party. They are a populist party with one or two rightwing ideas overshadowed by a desire for big state solutions we simply cannot afford.Robert Jenrick boasts that Reform is for the workers, but it’s a class war trap – and Labour shouldn’t fall for it | Polly ToynbeeRead more“Taking on more defectors with similarly incoherent outlooks will create problems for them soon enough. We cannot be distracted by this.”While polling for theConservativesremains largely abysmal, with national ratings struggling to reach even 20%, Badenoch is seen in the party as having rallied in recent months, and colleagues praised her decisiveness in sacking Jenrick and stripping him of the party whip.Plotting would not be tolerated, she told her MPs: “Differences of opinion are part of a healthy party. But there is a clear line between disagreement and trying to damage the party from within.“Those who cannot be part of a Conservative party that is changing in this way are free to make other choices. Those who want to undermine or destroy the party will be dealt with firmly and fairly.”Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochConservativesRobert JenrickReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.Death of man at ICE camp could be investigated as homicide after examiner’s reportRead moreDiaz was detained on 6 January during theTrump administration’s controversial deportationblitzin Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole. On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him.The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso.Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, thehighest numberof fatalities in two decades. At leastfive peoplehave reportedly died in ICE custody this year.Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba,diedin the same detention camp on 3 January. ICEsaidCampos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him.His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide. The local medical examiner determined the preliminary cause of death was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”, according to reports. ICE said he experienced a medical emergency after being “disruptive while in line for medication”.Santos Jesus Flores, who was detained with him,toldthe Washington Post that he saw five guards choking him, and that he heard Lunas Campos repeatedly say in Spanish that he couldn’t breathe.Officers at Texas immigration detention facility accused of beatings and sexual abuseRead more“He said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ After that, we don’t hear his voice anymore and that’s it,” the publication quoted Flores as saying.After reports that Lunas Campos’ death might be investigated as a potential homicide, the Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Guardian that he had tried to kill himself and “violently resisted” officers who were trying to help him.Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, also told the Washington Post after it published its article that Lunas Campos was trying to take his own life. The allegation was not part of ICE’sinitial statement.Another Camp East Montana inmate,Francisco Gaspar-Andres,diedat a nearby hospital on 3 December.

The Russian president has repeatedly rejected proposals of ceasefire along the current frontlines.The Kremlin also said on Monday thatPutin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitrievwould be attending the World Economic Forum in Davos this week and would meet members of the US delegation there. It is unclear whether those meetings will involve discussions of the Gaza board.The invitation to Putin, which has yet to be confirmed by Washington, raises more questions about the intended agenda for the board. It was originally part of Trump’s ceasefire proposals for the Gaza war, and was supposed to oversee the transition to a lasting peace in the territory and supervise the work of a committee of Palestinian experts, also announced last week, who would take care of the day-to-day running of Gaza. The vaguely described scheme was endorsed in aUN security council resolutionin November.View image in fullscreenTony Blair was among the first appointments to the board to be announced.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersThefirst appointments to the board, announced on Friday, included Trump himself as chair, with a “founding executive board” that included the former British prime minister Tony Blair and the current US secretary of state, Marco Rubio. Also appointed were Trump’s troubleshooting envoy, the property developer Steve Witkoff, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and the president of the World Bank, Ajay Banga.It has emerged over the weekend that Trump had also sent invitations to the leaders of states including Argentina, Paraguay, Turkey, Egypt, Canada and Thailand. Belarus announced that its leader, Alexander Lukashenko, had been invited and that he welcomed the invitation.The world is listening to Russia again. From the ruins of Ukraine, it makes me want to scream | Oleksandr MykhedRead moreThe UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, wasreportedly approached with an offerof membership last week, although he was awaiting a formal invitation.The invitation letters included a “charter” saying the board would seek to “solidify peace in the Middle East”, and at the same time “embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict”.Each national leader would serve a maximum of three years on the board, unless their governments paid a $1bn (£745m) fee to become a permanent member, in an echo of Trump’s elite membership structure for his Mar-a-Lago estate and his golf clubs. It is unclear who would be the recipient of such membership payments and how they would be used.The charter states: “The board of peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.” It adds that the board should have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”, likely to be a swipe at the UN.News agencies quoted French officials on Monday as saying that France would decline the offer of membership, because of the board’s broader aspirations. Earlier in the day the French foreign ministry had said it was reviewing an invitation to join the new body “whose project extends beyond the situation in Gaza”. The ministry statement “reiterates its attachment to the United Nations charter, [which] remains the cornerstone of effective multilateralism”.The French press agency AFP also quoted a Canadian official as saying the country would not pay for membership, nor had it been asked for payment, but it was not clear whether Ottawa would also reject the invitation outright.As of Monday evening, two countries had confirmed acceptance of the invitation: Hungary, and Vietnam in the person of the general secretary of the Vietnamese communist party, Tô Lâm).The inclusion of Putin in a global body supposed to oversee peace around the world would add considerable weight to longstanding suspicions that Trump leans heavily in the Russian president’s favour in his approach to the Ukraine conflict.At the same time as he was apparently inviting friendly leaders to join the board of peace, Trump also sent a letter to Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, over the weekend, telling him that “considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace”.Trump has been escalating pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe toaccept his plans to take over Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, and has imposed punitive measures on European countries who have objected most strenuously to his plan.The UK is one of the targeted countries, and Starmer denounced the tariffs as “completely wrong” on Monday, restating that “any decision on Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and Denmark alone”. However, Starmer did not commit to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs against the US, and downplayed the prospect of Trump using force in Greenland.Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, meanwhile suggested that a US takeover of Greenland would cement Trump’s place in the history books. “Here, perhaps, it is possible to abstract from whether this is good or bad, whether it will comply with the parameters of international law or not,” Peskov said, but he added it would “certainly go down in history”.The ceasefire in Gaza, which the board of peace was originally meant to oversee, remains in limbo. Last week, the US declared the beginning of a second phase in which the handpicked Palestinian technocratic committee was supposed to take over governance and an international stabilisation force was due to take over security.With the territory still coming under regular Israeli bombardment, there is no immediate prospect of either development and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, restated his government’s opposition to any troops from Turkey or Qatar, two key regional backers of the plan, taking part in the stabilisation force.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinGazaRussiaUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They said in this same letter that justice department staff had identified “more than 2 million documents potentially responsive to the Act that are in various phases of review”.That these DoJ’s disclosures apparently comprise a drop in the bucket – and have done little to shed light on how Epsteinoperated with apparent impunityfor years – has roiled survivors’ advocates and lawmakers. They include attorney Spencer Kuvin, who has represented dozens of Epstein’s survivors.Epstein survivors say financier lured them with promise of college educationRead more“Congress did not create a discretionary timeline – it created a legal obligation. Every day these records remain withheld sends a message to victims that transparency is optional when powerful interests are involved,” Kuvin said. “For survivors of Epstein’s abuse, this delay is not procedural – it is personal.“These files are not abstract government records; they are evidence of how institutions failed children. Continued secrecy retraumatises victims and undermines public confidence in the justice system,” he said.Some are now calling for judicial intervention, asking a judge to implement a special master who could facilitate the release of these documents.Democrat Ro Khanna and Republican Thomas Massie, the congressmen who co-sponsored the act,askedManhattan federal court judge Paul Engelmayer to appoint a special master and independent monitor “to compel the Department of Justice (DOJ) to make mandatory production under the Act”.“We have urgent and grave concerns about DOJ’sfailure to complywith the Act as well as the Department’s violations of this Court’s order,” they said in an 8 Januaryletterto Engelmayer. “On December 19, 2025, the Department of Justice released only a portion of responsive materials. That release, however, did not comply with the statute as written.View image in fullscreenRo Khanna, left, and Thomas Massie, right, speak during a press conference on the Epstein Files Transparency Act at the US Capitol in Washington DC on 18 November 2025.Photograph: Daniel Heuer/AFP/Getty Images“The Department failed to meet the Act’s requirements in multiple respects, including missing the statutory deadline, asserting common-law privileges that the Act does not permit, and applying extensive redactions that appear inconsistent with the Act’s expressed prohibition on withholding or redacting records to protect politically exposed persons.”They note that the Department of Justice has also flouted another requirement of this act, which requires that the attorney general provide a report identifying “categories of records released and withheld and summarizing all redactions and their legal bases” within 15 days of their disclosure deadline.“To date, no such report has been provided. Without it, there is no authoritative accounting of what records exist, what has been withheld, or why, making effective oversight and judicial review far more difficult,” they wrote. “Put simply, the DOJ cannot be trusted with making mandatory disclosures under the Act.”The congressmen said that they think “criminal violations have taken place and must be addressed, the most urgent need now is for the DOJ to produce all the documents and electronically stored information required by the Act”. They are asking Engelmayer to appoint a special master or independent monitor “for the purpose of ensuring all the documents and electronically stored information are immediately made public to be in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act”.Bill and Hillary Clinton refuse to testify in House Epstein investigationRead moreThey also suggested that this monitor have the authority to make reports “about the true nature and extent of the document production and if improper redactions or other improper conduct is taking place”. The DoJ in a court filing last week asked Engelmayer to reject Khanna and Massie’s bid for a special master.Others believe that a special master could help release these files. News website Radar Online, whichfileda civil suit more than eight years ago after the FBI failed to release Epstein files under the website’s April 2017 public records request, said: “We agree a Special Master is needed to ensure transparency.”“That is something we will push for in our own case, which remains the best chance the public has to get the Epstein files,” a Radar spokesperson said. “A special master is not a DOJ employee and therefore will not make political decisions about what to release and when, and can report to the court on compliance issues.”Roy Gutterman, director of the Newhouse School’s Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University, also said a special master could potentially foster the release of these files.“A special master might help relieve the court and the DOJ from sifting through thousands upon thousands of documents,” he said. “Special masters tend to be appointed in serious complex litigation, cases with many parties involving massive amounts data or potential damages.”Kuvin voiced similar sentiments. “A special master could help impose structure and accountability on a process that has clearly stalled. While a special master cannot invent authority that doesn’t exist, theycanforce clarity – what is being withheld, why it’s being withheld and whether those justifications actually withstand legal scrutiny,” he said.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold signs during a news conference on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the US Capitol on 18 November 18 2025.Photograph: Mehmet Eser/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockEven if a special master were appointed, however, that doesn’t mean this would result in expedient release of these documents. David Weinstein, a partner at Jones Walker, explained there are multiple legal steps between possible appointment of a special master and the release of files, potentially involving multiple courts.Engelmayer’s involvement in the disclosure of documents relates to Epstein accompliceGhislaine Maxwell’s criminal case, so it’s unclear how much authority he would have related to the filings overall.While Khanna and Massie’s request could spur the release of files “if the judge finds that he has the ability to enforce what they’re asking them to do as it relates to the motion that they filed”, Weinstein said, Engelmayer is clearly considering this specific issue.Indeed, in asking for the government’s response to Khanna and Massie’s request, Engelmayer asked justice department lawyers to explain their view on whether “he has the authority to rule upon (or take action to bring about) DOJ’s compliance with the Act”. Should Engelmayer decide he doesn’t have authority to act on this issue, that sets the stage for more litigation.US justice department has released less than 1% of Epstein files, filing revealsRead more“If it doesn’t work out the way they want inNew York, then they’ll file it in DC as a standalone lawsuit on their behalf, where they’re the plaintiffs and the Department of Justice is the defendant,” Weinstein said.As for Khanna and Massie’s mention of potential criminal violations, Weinstein pointed out the difficulty of pursuing such allegations. If they made a referral to the justice department for prosecution, this referral would involve allegations of criminality about the DoJ’s actions.“They’d have to have a special prosecutor appointed who has no connection to the DOJ.”For Kuvin, a special master could help but would not be a “cure-all” – and pointed to what he said were needed changes to the law.“If the government is intent on delay or over-redaction, meaningful disclosure will ultimately require judicial enforcement. Congress should amend the law to provide for enforcement mechanisms by either the victims,” he said. “Congress can escalate oversight and enforcement. What cannot happen – legally or ethically – is indefinite delay under the guise of ‘review’. The law already exists. What’s missing is enforcement.“Transparency doesn’t fail because statutes are unclear – it fails when institutions choose protection over accountability,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS CongressUS justice systemTrump administrationUS politicsUS crimeLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

The GMB is one of Labour’s biggest donors, with more than 550,000 members, including Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.It has recently faced internal claims of bullying, which it denies, and has for years been working to improve its culture after being found by an independent report in 2020 to be“institutionally sexist”.In a meeting in September, Eslamdoust said a senior GMB official caused significant stress to her and her assistant general secretary Maria Fawcett by “shouting at me, shouting at my assistant general secretary, wagging his finger in our faces, and threatening to damage our reputation if we didn’t comply with his demands”. She has now banned the official from entering the TSSA.After making a formal complaint about the official, she said GMB’s London regional secretary, Warren Kenny, sent what she described as an “appalling” email questioning her decision to raise a complaint.The email added: “I am not in possession of all the ‘facts’ surrounding your ‘complaint’ but once I am, I will of course send you a more formal response. Until then, it may be more productive for you and your management team to focus on resolving the many outstanding concerns which have been raised by your staff and our members at TSSA … I would suggest this direction would be a more effective way of engaging with GMB colleagues than to seek to raise ‘complaints’ regarding alleged conduct.”Eslamdoust said she believed she had paid a high personal cost in relation to stress in the workplace. She said: “I’m starting to experience the stress and the constant interference in my work that the GMB has put me through. The personal cost of the bullying is profound.“It has caused lasting harm. I routinely work from eight in the morning to 11 o’clock at night, if not longer, and that’s just simply to manage the union, protect my union’s reputation and defend myself from constant interference and aggression by the GMB.”She also questioned whether Gary Smith, the GMB general secretary, was fit to lead the union. He will battle to be re-elected this year, with the nominations process under way.“I believe that he’s tacitly condoning the behaviours on the ground because GMB officials would not act with such impunity unless they believed they were protected by the senior leadership,” she said.Eslamdoust, a former head of equalities at the Labour party, has been in post since 2023 when she took over after thedismissal of Manuel Cortesfor gross misconduct.She added: “I don’t see GMB behaving this way towards unions where the general secretary is a man. There was no comparable hostility with the TSSA when it was led by a male general secretary and when those cultural issues were happening.”She also questioned why the GMB was accusing her of overseeing a “toxic” culture when she had been implementing a lawyer-led review of the culture under her predecessor, although she acknowledged morale among staff was low.Eslamdoust said GMB had “no moral authority on those issues” given it had not fully implemented its own Monaghan report recommendations about misogyny.A GMB spokesperson said: “Workers at the TSSA have been mistreated for years.“A recent staff survey revealed horrifying levels of stress and anxiety, with almost 90% describing TSSA as a ‘psychologically unsafe’ place to work. Meanwhile, a GMB representative is currently suspended for trade union activities.“GMB is duty bound to protect members from this kind of workplace environment – no matter who the employer is.”They added that the GMB had previously decided not to merge with the TSSA, saying: “The GMB union was approached by the TSSA’s own members to explore the possibility of merging.“When this was explored more by GMB members, due diligence revealed serious issues. Members then voted unanimously to stop the merger process.”Explore more on these topicsGMB unionTrade unionsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

But this first look inside the completed 9m-diameter tunnels – their ventilation shafts the final piece in the jigsaw – shows what civil engineers with a clear remit can do.This, ironically, was one of the first areas of dispute and redesign of the railway’s route. Uproar over the potential disruption – in Conservative marginals, no less – saw extended tunnelling agreed before HS2 was anywhere near the statute books.While politicians continued to mull the final route, and scrapped designs for Euston, construction work here took off at the start of the pandemic. The compound housing HS2 Ltd’s main works contractor for this section of the line, Align JV – a joint venture between Bouygues, McAlpine and VolkerFitzpatrick – grew to about 1,800 people at its peak.The compound also served as the base to build the stunning Colne Valley viaduct, a 2.2-mile rail bridge skimming the nearby reservoirs. A concrete production plant was set up on site for the viaduct and then the 112,000 tunnel segments required. Two tunnelling machines brought in from Germany worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, staffed in 12-hour shifts over a period of 33 months from the first launch in 2021.View image in fullscreenThe stunning HS2 Colne Valley viaduct.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesMain tunnelling was completed last year, and with the final shafts the construction phase is now officially finished. Mark Clapp, HS2 Ltd’s head of civil engineering for the tunnel, says those who delivered a project of this scale and complexity on schedule should “feel certain that their hard work will stand the test of time”.But building infrastructure is far from popular with local people, and Clapp is quick to reel off the mitigations, including rerouting work traffic, as well as installing a slurry treatment plant on site for the millions of tonnes of excavated earth. “We took the chalk out of the spoil and reused it to landscape the area to create more calcareous grassland – it’s a rare and declining habitat, and we’ve added to it.”The ventilation shafts – required to be large enough for emergency and maintenance access – were also designed with local impact in mind. At ground level, the headhouses, by the village of Chalfont St Peter, resemble small agricultural buildings – masking a cavernous basement big enough to house giant fans and machinery, that might have stood several storeys above ground.The design also allowed the shafts’ volume to be minimised, according to chief engineer for HS2, Mark Howard: “A lot of the conversation was about the disruption, as well as what the headhouses look like. The more you excavate, the more you bring out – and double the amount of spoil means double the amount of lorries on the road.”The tunnel portals hold further innovation: a funnelled opening designed to stop the sonic boom that high-speed trains could otherwise produce when entering at 200mph. Japanese bullet trains have a tapered 18 metre-long nose to avoid the boom when emerging from tunnels, but for physical and economic reasons, the UK could not do the same: “That protruding piece would just smack into the old Network Rail infrastructure. And it takes up the space of about 40 seats,” says Howard.View image in fullscreenThe HS2 section under the Chilterns.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianLab testing ensued to understand micro pressure waves, which involved shooting miniature trains on elastic bands through tubes – resulting in the construction of 200m-long perforated concrete funnels to stop the boom.Eventually, from these portals, trains should emerge in just three minutes about 10 miles north of here. But that three-minute ride could take another decade to start. Next comes the installation of mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment. Rail systems, including track and overhead electrical equipment to power trains, will follow. Years of testing will follow that.And first, the reset of the entire HS2 build awaits. The progress on the Chiltern tunnels makes them outliers, even in what was once just phase 1, from London to Birmingham. The original £32.7bn budget, then including the Leeds and Manchester lines, is expected to be revised to beyond £80bn at current prices.A spokesperson for HS2 Ltd said: “Our chief executive, Mark Wild, has been clear that overall delivery of HS2 has been unacceptable, and he’s committed to ending the project’s cycle of cost increases and delays.“Over the last year he has led a comprehensive review, which has scrutinised every part of HS2 – creating a framework to build the railway efficiently and for the lowest reasonable cost. This means putting the construction programme back into the right sequence, transforming HS2 Ltd into a leaner delivery company, rebooting our relationship with the supply chain and driving significant improvements in productivity.”With more than a year having elapsed since Wild took over as chief executive in December 2024, the promised reset itself appears tardy. But after the wholesale changes made by previous governments, culminating in the overnight axing of phase 2 to Manchester, ministers have pledged to give Wild time to produce what they hope will be a decisive plan.View image in fullscreenThe finished tunnel.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianWild’s initial assessment, sent to the transport secretary last March, was that hopes that HS2 would be up and running by 2033 were unachievable. Since then, Wild and the Department forTransporthave been working on what can be done when, and at what cost.The leadership team has been revamped, including the hiring of ex-London Transport commissioner, Mike Brown, as chair. But hundreds of other corporate roles have been axed in favour of frontline civil delivery jobs. Meanwhile, commercial renegotiation with the supply chain, to hammer out contracts that do not simply load ballooning costs back on to the taxpayer, is continuing this year.Last week, ministers said a line from Birmingham to Manchester to link with Northern Powerhouse Rail was still “an intention” – even if they stressed it would absolutely not be another part of HS2.Wild, whose last job was to steer Crossrail to open the Elizabeth line on a reconfigured budget and schedule, may have a tougher task to restore the progress and reputation of Britain’s high-speed railway. But when it opens, there may again be plenty to marvel at.Explore more on these topicsInfrastructureHS2Rail transportTransportInvestingEngineeringRail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, is expected to hold meetings in Davos amid international efforts to dial down tensions with Washington.In an update of its WEO report published in October, the IMF said the powerful headwinds from global trade tensions in 2025 had been offset by surging investment in technology – including artificial intelligence – in the US and Europe.It said global growth was projected to remain resilient at 3.3% in 2026 and 3.2% in 2027: rates similar to an estimated 3.3% growth rate in 2025 after surging investment in AI helped the world economy offset the impact from trade tensions.However, the IMF forecasts were finalised in December, before an explosion in geopolitical tensions at the start of 2026, notably theUS seizure of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, the eruption ofprotests in Iranand Trump’s threats to seize Greenland.View image in fullscreenThe IMF said global tensions and tariffs could blow its forecasts off course.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersThe IMF said its forecasts were based on a fall in US tariff rates in 2026 and 2027, after a year in which the world economy managed to avoid the worst of the fallout from Washington’s trade war – helped by AI investment.Gourinchas said the shock of a tit-for-tat trade war could lead to a “repricing” by financial markets. Global markets have reached record highs amid a massive influx of cash into the US technology sector.A trade war could lead investors to “look at the situation and have to reassess what the value of financial markets is,” he said. “This volatility is bad for business decisions; it’s bad for investment, it’s bad for consumption, it leads to uncertainty,” Gourinchas added.Reflecting the technology boom and limited impact on US consumers from the president’s trade wars so far, the IMF issued a sharp upgrade for US growth to 2.4% this year, up from its prediction in October for growth of 2.1%. It suggested there were also signs that “technology-related investment had contributed to activity” in Spain and the UK, although not at the same scale as in the US.The fund left its forecasts for the UK unchanged for 2026 and 2027, predicting growth of 1.3% this year and 1.5% the year after. However, it also issued a modest upgrade for its prediction for 2025, up from 1.3% to 1.4%.‘Brazen’ political influence of rich laid bare as wealth of billionaires reaches $18.3tn, says OxfamRead moreThe UK’s growth projection for next year puts it behind only the US and Canada of its G7 counterparts. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said the forecasts showed 2026 was “the year the country turns a corner”. “The IMF has upgraded our growth for the third time in a row since April 2025, putting us on course to be the fastest growing European G7 economy this year and next,” she said.However, rising geopolitical tensions and a full-blown trade war would blow the IMF forecasts off course. “Going forward this is a major risk, this is something that could materially impact growth if we have higher levels of tariffs; if we have higher levels of geopolitical tension. That is something we are monitoring carefully,” Gourinchas said.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)International tradeTariffsTrump tariffsEconomicsEconomic growth (GDP)newsShareReuse this content"

It came out the same year as Barnes’s debut novel proper, Metroland, but where that took seven years to write, this took 10 days. Not that it shows: this “refreshingly nasty” (as Barnes’s friend Martin Amis put it) crime caper is beguilingly well written, with passages that display all of Barnes’s perception and wit. The plot of reverse blackmail and the shocking climax only add to the fun.Sample line“Two in the morning is when sounds travel for ever, when a sticky window makes a soft squeak and three Panda cars hear it from miles away.”View image in fullscreen9The Porcupine (1992)Barnes’s shortest novel is a satire of the personalities in a collapsed European communist regime. Former leader Petkanov is to have a televised trial. He believes he did nothing wrong – “They loved me” – and despises Gorbachev’s western-friendliness, “sucking Reagan’s dick and then sucking Bush’s”. His crimes (“He corrupted everything he touched … He lied all the time, as a reflex”) sound ever familiar. This funny, savage novel reminds us that when the old order passes, it doesn’t die; it just waits.Sample line“If you beat someone with a stick and order them to say they love you, sooner or later they will tell you what you want to hear.”View image in fullscreen8The Lemon Table (2004)The second of Barnes’s three story collections is infused with ageing, but full of energy. There’s a musical comedy spirit to A Short History of Hairdressing, in which a man measures his life in haircuts, from youth through marriage (“the only adventure open to the cowardly,” he says, quoting Voltaire) to the “mattressy eyebrow hairs” of old age. Hygiene explores the death of sex, while The Silence focuses on Jean Sibelius, with Barnes wearing his knowledge lightly. In Knowing French he ranks one of his own books, telling an imaginary reader not to bother with his second novel, Before She Met Me (1982). We’re saying nothing.Sample line“When the heart breaks, he thought, it splits like timber, down the full length of the plank.”View image in fullscreen7The Sense of an Ending (2011)Twenty-four years after hecoinedthe term “posh bingo” to describe the Booker prize, Barnes finally won, on his fourth shortlisting. He is in his comfort zone here – middle-class England, memory, sex – but the proximity of death sharpens things. When narrator Tony feels the end is approaching, he looks the other way: to youth, the time before bumptious confidence gave way to the agnosticism of middle age. His quiet life is suddenly overturned by remorse about an ex-girlfriend. And once the mind starts turning, it’s hard to stop.Sample line“Remorse, etymologically, is the act of biting again. That’s what the feeling does to you.”View image in fullscreen6Staring at the Sun (1986)This extravagantly imaginative novel looks back too: but from the future of – ready to feel old? – the year 2020. Barnes predicts online books and a form of AI, but the heart of the story is Jean Serjeant, approaching her 100th birthday and wondering “How do you tell a good life from a bad life, a wasted life?” Her reluctance with sex (“it was like someone being sick all over you”) and her childhood are among the aspects worked through with Barnes’s usual blend of fun and essayistic insight.Sample line“When she thought of Michael and sex she imagined an over-filling water-tank which occasionally had to be drained.”5Arthur & George (2005)Barnes, who was always doing something different, did something different again with this fat historical novel inspired by a real miscarriage of justice, and featuring Arthur Conan Doyle. The story switches between Conan Doyle’s viewpoint and that of the wronged man, George Edalji. It raises questions of truth, Englishness and fame. As arguably Barnes’s most straightforward novel, Arthur & George was rightly predicted by his publishers to win him “an entirely new audience”. “I sort of feel awkward about that,”Barnes said, “because I liked my old audience.”Sample line“He is quite clear about the writer’s responsibilities: they are, firstly, to be intelligible, secondly, to be interesting, and thirdly, to be clever.”4TalkingIt Over (1991)Barnes’s ability to bring a fresh eye to the oldest subjects is seen here, as a love triangle is narrated by the participants in turn, each appealing to the reader: “The three of us are in here until it’s resolved.You’rein here too.” Staid Stuart, flashy Oliver and pragmatic Gillian battle it out, where accounts of the same events differ and there is no objective truth. A sequel, Love, Etc, followed in 2000. Barnes did consider making it a trilogy, but – alas for fans – has now announced that his new book, Departure(s), will be his last.Sample line“Of course,youknow if they’re really fucking, don’t you? Go on, tell me.”View image in fullscreen3The Noise of Time (2016)This novel – Barnes’s best of the 21st century – is a spiritual cousin to The Porcupine, but more grounded and personal. In 1930s Russia, Dmitri Shostakovich has fallen foul of the Soviet authorities: his music is too elitist, insufficiently “authentic, popular and melodious”. But for Shostakovich, music is art, and “art is the whisper of history, heard above the noise of time”. With analytical delicacy and his own popular touch, Barnes untangles the questions of how we submit to power and whether we can look ourselves in the mirror afterwards.Sample line“To be a hero, you only had to be brave for a moment […] but to be a coward was to embark on a career that lasted a lifetime.”2A History of the World in 101/2Chapters (1989)If the storyteller and the experimenter have always been competing impulses in Barnes, here is where they work most beautifully together. It’s a novel in stories, running from biblical times to a futuristic heaven, loosely linked by Noah’s Ark. This is an exceptionally wide-ranging, ambitious book, taking in animals on trial, art criticism and jungle exploration, all in multiple narrative forms. And throughout, it’s as diverting as it is stimulating.Sample line“When I say ‘I’ you will want to know within a paragraph or two whether I meanJulian Barnesor someone invented.”1Flaubert’s Parrot (1984)“I wish he’dshut upabout Flaubert,”said Kingsley Amisof Barnes – but the arch-Francophile was just getting started with this breakthrough book. Following two traditional novels, this felt like a great release: Barnes finally doing what he really wanted to. It tells stories, it plays around, it ducks and feints around the narrator Geoffrey Braithwaite and his, well, Barnesian interest in Flaubert. Incorporating biographers’ professional rivalry, a widower’s grief, opposing chronologies of Flaubert’s life and even an exam paper near the end, this is delicious, nutritious entertainment.Sample line“Whatever else happens, we shall remain stupid.” (Said by Gustave Flaubert, of course.)Explore more on these topicsBooksRankedJulian BarnesFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We pick a city, descend on it and then leave 48 hours later, often a little worse for wear. I would say about 60% of all communication on these trips is quotes fromMichael Mann’s 1995 heist thriller,Heat. Screaming likeAl Pacino’scoked-upLos Angeles police detective Vincent Hanna or calmly saying “I have a woman” likeRobert De Niro’s robotic master thief Neil McCauley if any of my friends ask me about my wife.The comedian and film-maker Stanley Sieversdid a skitabout a guy whose life is destroyed because hiswhole personalityis the film Heat. I laughed along with that awkwardly, while considering just how many times I said “the action is the juice” the last time I met up with my friends.‘A celebration of the carefree’: why Ferris Bueller’s Day Off is my feelgood movieRead moreMy social media algorithms know me well enough to feed me Heat content: a bumper sticker that reads “honk if you’ve seen Michael Mann’s critically acclaimed masterpiece Heat”, a comedian doing an impression of De Niro auditioning for Heat 2 by laughing maniacally, 30-year-old casting polaroids, action figures of the horrendous villainWaingro. It’s never-ending and it’s also never enough. I could watch this slop for hours.So why do I spend so much time rewatching snippets of a film I’ve seen at least 50 times? Why is aneo-noirheist moviemy feelgood film?There’s the obvious: it’s arguably Mann’s most accomplished project. The central performances are electric. Pacino and De Niro play driven obsessives drawn to and repulsed by each other in equal measure. It looks incredible, as Mann turns Los Angeles into a world of cold austere chrome and glass or, as Mark Fisher put it,“endlessly repeating vistas of replicating franchises”. The film slots into a cinematic tradition: yes, Christopher Nolan borrowed heavily from Heat when he made The Dark Knight, but Mann used theclimax of BullittandMonte Hellmann’s The Shooting for his deadly finale at LAX.Weirdly, this cat-and-mouse tale of high stakes and heists is my cinematic comfort food. Every single time the opening highway robbery begins I lock in. It’s a masterful set piece: an ultra-violence chess match played out on the Los Angeles asphalt that’s often overshadowed by thethunderous shootouttoward the end of the film. In between those two book ends are double crosses, domestic blowups, and ahomoerotic bromancethat makes Trump and Putin look likeBaldwin v Buckley.In a contemporary world which seems to be in constant flux, Heat is a steady state universe. It never disappoints and harks back to a world in the mid-1990s, which, despite being another era when American interventionist policieswent dramatically awry, feels quaint compared to today. There’s a moral code that often is mercilessly harsh but remains consistent.I’m hardly the only Heat obsessive out there. The Prince Charles Cinema in London is in the middle of amonths-long runof showing the film; The Ringer’s Rewatchables podcast has deep dived into Heatthree times; while theOne Heat Minutepodcast dissects the film on a granular level. French critic Jean-Baptiste Thoret’s excellentMichael Mann: A Contemporary Retrospectivebook, which was translated into English for the first time last year, also gives Heaters even more to consider.Despite so much being said about the film, I love the fact that there is always something new to focus on. For example, taking time to marvel atVal Kilmer, who delivers one of his best turns, including what the New York Times called “the movie’s most mesmerizing moment” – which turns out to be a “microscene” where he watches a clerk verify that his fake license is real. That sounds dull, but when you see the moment in question it is utterly compelling and in most other films wouldn’t be anywhere near as good. But Heat seems to operate on a different level.‘I find it all a bit comforting’: why Zodiac is my feelgood movieRead moreEvery bit part overdelivers: Henry Rollins as a meathead henchman, Hank Azaria as a horny mark, Tom Noonan scouring the pre-internet for scores, Jon Voight as anunflappable fixer in a bolo tie, Natalie Portman as a jilted teenager waiting for herJungian archetype of a dad. Each one of these performances leaves you wanting more and hints at interior worlds we only see fragments of.Perhaps that’s why it’s my feelgood film – the stories Mann creates linger so long after viewing, none more so than the tragic arc of Donald Breedan, the ex-con played by Dennis Haysbert who is trying to turn a clean slate but ends up working for the prickish restaurant owner (played to perfection by Bud Cort). When McCauley turns up in his cafe looking for a getaway driver, we all know he can’t turn him down.His downfall isinevitable and brutal.The scene sums up what Heat is for me: a story about sliding doors and second chances, about red lines that we draw for ourselves and then cross, futures we build and simultaneously destroy. Obsessions and their consequences, domesticity and the underworld, cops and robbers. Things that can’t coexist without conflict.Heat 2’srumoured cast listof Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Al Pacino, Austin Butler, Adam Driver, Ana de Armas, Jeremy Allen White, Bradley Cooper and Channing Tatum looks great on paper. But I have my reservations about going back to what is an almost-perfect film universe. You can have an equally starry cast and a director with half a dozen more films under his belt, but will that special alchemy happen again? If it doesn’t, I’m sure I’ll survive – there will always bethe memes.Heat is available on Hulu and Paramount+ in the US and Netflix and Disney+ in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsMichael MannMy feelgood movieRobert De NiroAl PacinoVal KilmerThrillersCrime filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This film-making family multitasks above and beyond, serving not just asco-directors, co-writers, producers and stars, but also operating the camera and making the costumes. The results are genuinely striking, professional and effective (especially in terms of scare-generation). And if the scripts are often a smidge pretentious, they are never less than interesting and always original.Their previous offerings includeHellbender, Halfway to Zen and Rumblestrips, tales that often revolve around families or familial units, although John Adams doesn’t always play the dad character and Poser isn’t always the mother. In their latest, Poser has cracked open the indigo pot and spun up some wool to make a witchy, cerulean outfit to play weird woman Solveig, a figure with strong maternal feelings, not least towards the many bluebottles that follow her everywhere; she isn’t, however, technically a mother to the protagonist, college student Mickey (Zelda Adams). The economical dialogue eventually reveals that Mickey survived cancer some years ago which resulted in a hysterectomy, but a new inoperable tumour the size of an apple (very biblical) has recently grown in her abdomen and she has maybe six months to live.Willing to try anything that might help, Mickey answers a mysterious summons to visit Solveig in a remote, dank forest house, accompanied by her widowed father, Jake (John Adams). The accommodation looks like an ornate Victorian house mated with a baobab tree, producing a structure made of mostly gnarled roots and limbs covered with moss. Jake isn’t thrilled with the foraged mushroom and leaf diet, or the lack of en suite bathrooms, but he is game for anything that might help his daughter. Mickey is more open to Solveig’s bizarre hospitality, pointedly antiquated circumlocution and tendency to microdose her guests with psychedelics. No doubt some viewers would rate this experience highly if it were offered on Airbnb.The film-makers build up a thick miasma of atmosphere over the first 45 minutes as the visuals switch between Mickey and Jake’s puzzled normie points of view and the more outlandish visions and memories connected to Solveig. The latter come drenched in fake blood, populated by rotting corpses with huge screaming mouths, and stillborn babies chucked unceremoniously into buckets while assorted supporting players – many of whom, if you check the credits, have the surname Adams, funnily enough – stand around looking solemn and menacing.The effect is unnerving and fecund with menace, but there are a few too many sequences padding out the action where we hear Solveig intoning what sounds like bad Emily Dickinson parodies – stuff like “The truth won’t hide in dreams/It lies still/Seen”, the rhythms sprung like a battered mattresses. Overall, this is better and glossier than some of the Adams-Poser posse’s earlier efforts, but perhaps not quite enough of an evolution to take their vision to the next level.Mother of Flies is on Shudder and AMC+ from 23 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

That, and the amusing cameo at the end from Keith David as the Simulator, AKA God, who explains to the awestruck mortals that God is an entirely free creator, rather like a self-published novelist, then grows irritated when the mortals think that being self-published is lame: “It’s not my fault if you don’t understand the industry!”This is an exhausting indie romp on the subject of time travel, and sometimes plays like a funnier version ofShane Carruth’s time-travel classic Primer– well, slightly funnier. Samuel Dunning plays Tim Travers, a goateed scientist who has stolen nuclear materials from a terrorist group to power the time machine he has invented. He sends himself back one minute into the past with a gun to kill his younger self to investigate the time-traveller’s paradox: if he eliminates his one-minute younger self, then won’t he also disappear at that moment, popping like a soap bubble, because it means he can’t exist in the future? But given that he has to exist in the future to have set all this in motion, doesn’t it mean that this time-travelled self has to survive?Well, apparently it’s the latter, and Tim keeps going repeatedly back, creating many different selves who at one stage indulge in a bizarre off-camera orgy. A hitman, working for that furious terrorist group from which Tim stole, has the unhappy task of whacking all these space-time clones.This is a film that drones on and on, though it does have a nice walk-on from Danny Trejo and there’s the unintended side-effect of making you appreciateDouglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy which did all this and more with a much lighter touch.Tim Travers and the Time Traveler’s Paradox is on digital platforms from 26 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsComedy filmsDanny TrejoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Non-athletes can finish marathons in less time; even the apocalypticfinal instalment of Wagner’s Ring cycleis shorter. Yet the most striking thing about the work is its economy. An opening sequence of four pitches played by three musicians provides the musical material that is transformed, transposed, stretched and compressed throughout. Notes and motifs are repeated and multiply, echoing across the ever-sparse texture. The tempo is consistently slow, the dynamic consistently quiet. Rhythms are complex, but subtly so, making the instances of absolute synchrony into passing miracles. Time is the only resource with which Feldman is profligate.Challenged on the work’s scale, Feldman once quipped, “it’s a short four hours!” I’m not sure all attending this rare performance inKings Place’s Memory Unwrapped serieswould have agreed. Seats creaked constantly as people wriggled, late arrivals crept in and others trickled out. Coughs were half stifled. Phones buzzed. Someone near me went through an inexplicable, maddening phase of humming along.Yet after a brief wave of low-level panic in the first hour when the obsessive repetitions felt airless rather than expansive, I gradually acclimatised. Notes from Taylor MacLennan’s flutes seemed to materialise from nowhere, with no discernible articulation and no vibrato – sometimes approaching the disembodied quality of synthesised sound, sometimes sinking into the feather-down timbre of the alto flute’s lowest register. Siwan Rhys and George Barton ofGBSR Duoswitched, respectively, between piano and celeste and vibraphone, glockenspiel, marimba and tubular bells. Those shifts appeared increasingly revelatory, as did the texture’s occasional sheering away to a solo instrumental line.Theabstract expressionistPhilip Gustonwas Feldman’s closest friend until, as the composer put it, “we broke up because of style” when the artist re-embraced figurative painting. This work was dedicated to Guston after his death in 1980. A live performance in its full, fidgety duration inevitably demonstrates the impossibility of complete abstraction in music. But the intense concentration of these performers and the delicately immersive sound world they created were utterly unforgettable.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Art is for troubledhearts. For my whole life, Hamlet has beena bridge between. Hamlet’s ‘Now, mother,what’s the matter?’ is life on earth. Somethingis always the matter, and not just for mothers.(As I write this, the Angelus rings.) Everycharacter in Hamlet is troubled, there areno monsters in it. I render unto Caesarthe things that are Caesar’s — everything istroubled there and, if I am lucky, Caesaris troubled. I render unto God the thingsthat are God’s and feel — want to feel? Do feel —that God is troubled. I also render unto art.But I have no idea what art is. WhatEdward Thomas’s ‘Adlestrop’ is. Whatthe luminous chaos of The Portrait ofa Lady is. What The Pilgrim’s Progress is.My feet knew the way before I openedthe book: that just before the gate to heavenis yet another hole to hell.Richard W Halperin was born in Chicago to an Irish mother, and an American father with Russian ancestry. Early in his childhood the family moved to New York. He taught for a short period at Hunter College, and subsequently made a career in education administration, latterly with Unesco in Paris, where he currently lives.Now, Mother, What’s the Matter? is from the New Poems section of All the Tattered Stars: Selected and New Poems published by SalmonPoetryin 2023 to celebrate Halperin’s 80th birthday.The New York School’s influence is audible in his work’s refreshing lightness of texture. Halperin is deeply serious, though, about the function and power of art, cinema and the literary arts in particular. Considering the impact of a poem sequence by an unnamed writer, he says of their portrayal of daughterhood, “None of this is my experience, / All of it is my experience. / Don’t tell me I cannot be daughter.”Hamlet’s address to his mother, Gertrude, which forms the current poem’s title, is freighted with his still-to-be-spoken accusation – of lechery and adultery with his uncle, Claudius, if not direct connivance in the murder of his father, King Hamlet. Halperin, abandoning quote marks or footnotes, cleverly escapes Shakespeare at the same time, and allows himself a little dry fun with the ideal of universality. The unanchored question inevitably sheds some of its specific complexity, and starts to look like a sentence a contemporary son or daughter might utter to a mother who is entirely innocent of the dangerous “matter” associated with Gertrude. Perhaps, as the child’s emphatic “Now” might suggest, this mother is overdoing some small complaint, and the words are uttered with mockery or exasperation rather than complete earnestness (though the latter isn’t impossible). Halperin’s artfully expanded context demonstrates the subjectivity of artistic interpretation.His speaker goes on to renew, lightly, the seriousness associated with the original context. The near-euphemism “troubled hearts” suggests a complex perspective from which to read Hamlet’s mother and the play’s other characters – in fact, mothers and “others” in general. Hamlet, the play, has always been the speaker’s bridge between “life” and “art”, he says, since both are “for troubled hearts”. “Hamlet’s ‘Now, mother, / what’s the matter?’ is life on earth. Something / is always the matter, and not just for mothers.” Art permits self-recognition: it brings “troubled hearts” into an encounter with themselves.This “matter” is gracefully expressed, with the interrupting comment from the Angelus bell pertinently timed. TheAngelusmarks the incarnation of Christ announced when the Angel Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary. It’s now that Halperin’s denial of there being any “monsters” in Hamlet makes a sharpened point. Art offers a route out of the judgmental “monsters v angels” binaries of religion, though not, of course, a route out of the problems of morality.In the agreed obligation to Caesar, referencing Christ’s words fromMatthew 22:21, Halperin projects himself into that imperial political scene and updates it: “I render unto Caesar / the things that are Caesar’s — everything is / troubled there and, if I am lucky, Caesar / is troubled. I render unto God the things / that are God’s and feel — want to feel? — do feel / that God is troubled. I also render unto art.”Being “troubled” might be less of a guarantee of compassion than hoped. But the cleverly nervous enjambment that sustains a biblical and colloquial mix of register encourages tentative optimism.As the speaker disarmingly confesses, he has “no idea what art is”. Art seems more demanding than any Caesar. The intransitive form of “render” in “I also render unto art” suggests more than self-giving service – the possibility of psychic “rending”, for example.The three literary texts the speaker cites later seem random, but may have a common theme of pilgrimage, one that might stretch to include both the heroine of The Portrait of a Lady, Isabel Archer, and the poet Edward Thomas. The concept admits Halperin’s persona, too: “My feet knew the way before I opened / the book”. The mind is pre-patterned with the traditional techniques of storytelling. What the speaker unquestioningly knows is “that just before the gate to heaven / is yet another hole to hell.” That conclusion is surprising and suggests the unilluminable: then we remember the poet Dante, who illuminated the hell holes, too. Without irony, Halperin reveals the magnitude of the literary pilgrimage.Drama and fiction, poetry and allegory, are consolidated by the last three lines; “troubled hearts” and “holes to hell” are always integral. To travel these worlds, without rejecting the human-ness of the misnamed demons and monsters, may be another foundational characteristic of literary art.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bird is a Harris hawk, a feathered killing machine who hunts the rich Dorset fields on the edge of the New Forest. She can take down a rabbit but much prefers cock pheasants. Recently she has been eyeing up the peacocks that the Meyricks keep on their estate.Meyrick’s starting point in this puzzling book is that Bird has a rich interior life that we flightless clod-hoppers would do well to emulate. What follows are 20 brief “life lessons” inspired by the hawk’s assumed musings. So, for instance, the fact that Bird prefers to hunt her own dinner rather than accept substitute snacks from Meyrick is used to urge the reader to “stay true to your higher self”. Likewise, her ability to keep cool under threat from a pair of thuggish buzzards becomes an exhortation to “hold your ground, you’re stronger than you think”. Other maxims include “Stay humble. Keep working at it” and the truly head-scratching “Just show up; and when you can’t, don’t”.The pity of all this speculative anthropomorphising is the way it edges out the genuinely gripping existence of Bird’s bodily life. Such as the fact that, as a female, she is a third of a size bigger than any male. That her mother could bring down a roe deer. That the Harris hawk is more equable than the goshawk which tends to be “psycho” and is likewise steadier than the peregrine which may be too speedy for a child to handle (Bird was originally bought for Meyrick’s young son).Bird’s physical life is as tightly calibrated as any elite athlete’s. Her ideal hunting weight is 2lb 4.2oz. If she creeps up to 2lb 6.5oz, then she is apt to become “fed up” and may take off for the wild, convinced that she can manage on her own (and, strictly speaking, she could, although she probably wouldn’t last the 25 years of a captive hawk). If her weight dips too low, to 2lb 2oz, then she will likely become sluggish and wait for Meyrick to toss her some bloody snacks, at which point, presumably, she has failed to follow her own advice to “stay true to your higher self”.Then there is the moult. Between the spring and autumn equinox when hunting by hawk is illegal, Bird lies low and grows a new coat. Meyrick, though, cannot resist heaping on the metaphysics: “Everything bad she takes into the moult – all the crappy feathers, grudges, grievances, mess, broken bits – she sheds … she emerges whittled down, left with new plumage and most herself.”This might be inspirational if you are a human and after a New Year’s pep talk rather than a Harris hawk gearing up to get the better of a scrumptious peacock. Ironically, it is at these moments of hyperbole that Meyrick seems to realise that she is overreaching and begins to berate herself for missing the mark. She frets that “Bird’s revelations elude me. I grasp at them, hating the rising phrases, pretentious, unwieldy – not what I mean at all.” But that doesn’t stop her from piling on those “rising phrases” to the point where they totter and collapse in on themselves. When Meyrick declares “memory, the gift of memory, is celestial, airborne, just like Bird”, I honestly can’t work out what she means.Meyrick’s decision to build her book around these avian “life lessons” may arise from a desire to put several ploughed fields between herself and Helen Macdonald, whoseH Is for Hawkcovered similar ground in 2014 and has just beenreleased as a filmstarring Claire Foy. Then there isRaising Hare, Chloe Dalton’s 2024 memoir about saving her lockdown sanity by rescuing an orphaned leveret. Whether or not Meyrick is consciously cashing in on the popularity of this subgenre of nature writing, she has written a book that feels contrived and ploddingly earthbound. Exactly the sort of thing about which Sophia Houdini White Wing might surely have something stern but uplifting to say.Be More Bird: Life Lessons from a Hawk by Candida Meyrick is published by William Collins (£16.99).

Fortunately, Joseph Phibbs’s cello concerto, written for Guy Johnston and here receiving its world premiere, brought its own musical cohesion, distinguishing itself in an otherwise uneven programme.Scrupulously crafted, its five contrasting movements basked in a warm tonality and boasted a multihued orchestration with rich, fluent string writing and imaginative effects in wind, brass and percussion. Emerging from gentle double bass pizzicatos and cushioned cellos, Johnston’s solo line, pensive and unshowy throughout, was neatly framed thanks to Clemens Schuldt’s mindful control over hisBBC Symphony Orchestraforces.The shimmering, shuddering Aubade, brimming with light and dancing counterpoint, gave way to the mournful Elegy, a long cello threnody stretched out over a pulsing orchestral heartbeat. An eerie Nocturne, tense and agitated, was haunted by the cries of night-birds and perhaps something more sinister, before the wistful Vocalise brought this attractive new concerto to a radiant conclusion.View image in fullscreenPensive … Guy Johnston performs Joseph Phibbs’s cello concerto.Photograph: Mark AllanElsewhere matters were less consistent. Tchaikovsky’s Hamlet, a prolix tone poem complete with stentorian ghost, Russian-accented Ophelia and a brusque military intervention, got a kick up the backside from Schuldt whose clipped, brittle reading was undoubtedly exciting, if low on warmth. At just five minutes, Mel Bonis’s Ophélie, one of the late-Romantic composer’s enthralling series of musical sketches of iconic women, proved that less is often more. Rippling harp, sweeping strings and melancholy oboe cocooned the hapless heroine as she drifted to her watery grave. The performance, though, was on the loud side.The German conductor was more in his element with the anonymously cobbled together suite from Richard Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier. His interpretation was idiomatic, with the waltz sequences nicely swung, but a tendency to micromanage robbed the music of some of its flow. No amount of arm waving could paper over the cracks in this Frankenstein’s monster of a score, however, as the music lurched from one bleeding chunk to another. Schuldt’s tendency to ramp up the volume only added to a sense of misguided bluster. A shame, as the orchestral playing, once again, was excellent.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanBBC Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

AI evangelist Mikey Shulman says he’s making pop, not slopEamonn FordeWorth a staggering $2.45bn, Suno is an AI music company that can create a track with just a few prompts. Why is its CEO happy to see it called ‘the Ozempic of the music industry’?Mon 19 Jan 2026 11.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 14.04 ESTShare‘The format of the future,” says Mikey Shulman, “is music you playwith, not just play.” As the CEO and co-founder of the generative AI music company Suno, Shulman currently finds himself in the exhilarating if perhaps unenviable position of being simultaneously regarded as the architect of music’s future – and its executioner.Suno, which was founded just over two years ago, allows users to create entire songs with just a few text prompts. At the moment, you can’t prompt it with the name of a specific pop star, but asking for “stadium-level confessional pop-country” that “references past relationships” or “public rivalries” might get you a Taylor Swift-style song or thereabouts.In June 2024, Suno becamethe target of litigationby record company trade body the RIAA on behalf of major labels in the US, while German collection society GEMA, representing songwriters, filed its own lawsuit the following January. Both claimed the service was training its systems on their copyrights without authorisation or licences.View image in fullscreenEffortless … Suno’s user interfacePhotograph: SunoGen AI music services have triggered an existential crisis in the music industry. The utopian reading is that they will democratise creativity. The dystopian one is that art will be smothered by AI slop, as humans making music become surplus to requirements. (And many musicians already struggle to make a living from streaming revenues.) Dave Stewart of Eurythmics called them an “unstoppable force”and saidmusicians should, begrudgingly or enthusiastically, embrace them. Catherine Anne Davies, AKA the Anchoress,told me recentlyshe believes it to be “dystopian”. Music lawyer Gregor Pryor has argued it is already killing off background music work.Suno is now valued at $2.45bn – yet it only has 1 million paying subscribers“I like to think of us as trying to make the next format for recorded music,” says Shulman. “The format of the future will be interactive.” What does he mean? “It should be social, meaning you’re doing it with other people. What we are doing is building the best digital version of that.”Investors were clearly not scared off. In November, Suno raised $250m (£187m) in funding, taking its valuation to $2.45bn (£1.83bn). Gen AI is the hottest thing in Silicon Valley, with a Stanford University report saying it drew $34bn (£25bn) in private investment in 2024. But there are fears, notably at theBank of England, that this brilliant boom can only be followed by a bitter bust. For now, however, investors believe gen AI is too big to fail. The stakes for Suno’s success are astonishingly high, especially given the recent leaking of aninvestor presentationsuggesting the company only had 1 million paying subscribers. The standard monthly plan costs £8.25 ($10).“The thing that investors needed help realising,” says Shulman, “is how important music is in the world. Once you show them, their minds are changed and they realise that much, much more is possible.”When a new outside technology imposes itself on the music industry, the response typically runs from apoplexy to legal action, then negotiation and ultimately licensing. The three biggest names in gen AI music are at different stages along this trajectory. Klay got dealswith all three majorsbefore launching or training its technology on music, making it a rarity in this “Launch first, license later” world. Udio signed deals with Universal Music Group (UMG) and Warner Music Group (WMG). Suno, however, only has a deal with WMG, and legal action from the other majors is still live.Listen to Into the Blue by Sienna Rose – a viral Top 10 hit on Spotify, widely suspected to be AI-generatedShulman, now 39, was a failing musician, which provided a catalyst for Suno. “I played in a lot of bands in high school and college,” he says, speaking by video from his home in the US, pointing to the bass hanging on the wall behind him. “I was OK, not great, and I was not going to be able to make a great career out of it.” He’s cautious and thoughtful when speaking, without the tang of arrogance you sometimes get from heavily hyped start-up founders.A career swerve into a physics PhD led him to Suno’s other co-founders. They wanted to build something different to heavyweight AI companies such as OpenAI, as those deal with “reasoning and automation to solve very specific problems. Music isn’t like that. There’s not a right or a wrong answer. It’s not a problem to solve.”I made a really funny song with my four-year-old yesterday. I would sound like ‘AI slop’ to you – but I love itThere remains debate about where exactly Suno sourced the music to train its systems – essentially breaking music into data strands for cataloguing – before its licensing deals were in place. “We train our models on medium- and high-quality music we can find on the open internet,” wrote Shulman in a2024 blogpost. Suno’s initial legal defence was that this constituted fair use, and the music it drew on did not require prior permission. The record industry thought differently. “Fair use,”countered the RIAA, does not apply “when the output seeks to ‘substitute’ for the work copied.”I ask Shulman what he means by the “open internet”. There is a clear distinction between what is copyrighted (recordings are typically protected for 70 years) and what is in the public domain. “Copyright is a different thing,” he says. “I can’t get into too many specifics because there is active legal stuff going on, and also some of it is trade secrets.”Could Suno’s philosophy of “democratising” music-making be inherently anti-art? What once sprang from extraordinary human creativity now becomes ordinary. Shulman insists that, as with digital recording or sampling, this is just another example of how technology “pushes music forward”, how “new people get discovered” and “new genres get invented”.The issue of so-called AI slop is wholly subjective, he says. “I made a really funny song with my four-year-old yesterday morning. That is ‘slop’ to you – you don’t care about it – but I love it. It’s fantastic.” He is keen to stress, meanwhile, that music generated by Suno can be extremely high quality.And AI-powered music is flooding streaming services: Deezer says more than a third of music delivered to it each day is AI (equal to 50,000 tracks), and 70% of streams of AI music on Deezer are fraudulent (scammers get cheaply made AI tracks on to such services, then use bots tomanipulate streamsat scale in order to get royalty payments, although services areincreasingly wiseto this). The company has startedtagging AI tracksto alert users.Bandcamprecently announced that it won’t platform music “generated wholly or in substantial part by AI”.View image in fullscreen‘A bit of a goof’ … the 70s rock-style AI-generated band Velvet Sundown.Illustration: thevelvetsundownbandShould others follow? Shulman will say only that he doesn’t want to be “the arbiter of what happens on other platforms. There’s maybe some line to draw, but I don’t know where.”Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI “act”, released their debut album and a follow-up last summer. The 70s-styled rock band generated millions of streams, but it was a short-lived phenomenon. “I don’t know exactly what their strategy was,” Shulman says of Velvet Sundown. “It was all a bit of a goof. I think that’s why it was a flash in the pan.”Some AI-powered tracks have staying power, though. Following allegations it used Suno to cloneJorja Smith’s voice, I Run, by Haven, was excluded from the UK charts, but a version re-recorded by Kaitlin Aragon, a human singer, was chart-eligible and went Top 10. Into the Blue bySienna Rose, who is widely suspected to be an AI act, recently made the Top 10 on Spotify’s Viral 50 Global chart. And the track Jag Vet, Du Är Inte Min is one of the biggest of the year so far in Sweden, although it has beenbooted out of the country’s chartsfor being “mainly AI-generated”.AI, bot farms and innocent indie victims: how music streaming became a hotbed of fraud and fakeryRead moreMore concerning was Suno being used last year to create tracks that theAnti-Defamation Leaguesaid glorified Adolf Hitler, deployed racist slurs and talked of “white power”. Shulman says: “It was three songs that had a combined 10 plays. It was a very small thing. Unfortunately, drawing attention to it made it worse.” He says Suno has developed more rigorous safeguards to stop similar things happening in the future.Suno is keen for its deal with WMG to be seen as proof that gen AI companies can partner in mutually beneficial ways. Did the$1.5bn (£1.1bn) that AI company Anthropicpaid to the book industry in September to settle claims its AI was trained on pirated copies spook Suno to get deals done swiftly? “We didn’t pay all that much attention to that,” says Shulman. “There’s a lot more to do together than fighting one another. And we intend, with this Warner partnership, to show that very strongly.”But questions do persist about the WMG deal. Did the label insist on changes to the service? Were payments made to cover past use of its music in Suno’s training? Did WMG get equity in Suno? Shulman won’t reply, saying only that it is “a little early” to share such information, possibly fearful of compromising pending licensing deals.View image in fullscreenJorja Smith, whose vocal style may have been imitated by an AI to generate I Run by Haven.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/ShutterstockAgreements with the majors are one thing, but wooing artists is another. The majors insist they will only have their music used if they opt into deals. But if only a tiny percentage do – never mind their name, image and likeness rights – this will surely compromise results.In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell popularised “the 10,000-hour rule”, suggesting that this is the amount of practise time an artist needs to achieve any sort of mastery. Will the likes of Suno change this? “I think people will [still] have to spend 10,000 hours,” says Shulman. “They may be doing different things and practising different skills, but they will certainly need to spend 10,000 hours to make the best music in the world.”Musicians are deeply concerned about AI. So why are the major labels embracing it?Read moreAs part of its charm offensive, Suno signed up US producerTimbalandas a strategic advisor, but he had to make a public apology after he took a track by producerK Freshwithout permission and,Fresh alleged, “uploaded it into Suno’s AI platform, and released an unauthorised AI remix”.Nevertheless, Shulman says the musicians he talks to about Suno see it as an important new creative tool and songwriting aid. He had previously told the 20VC podcast: “I think the majority of people don’t enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.” This does not mean musicians hate the creative processin toto, but they are appreciative of tools that can remove at least some of the grunt work.They just see it as a dirty secret, he suggests now. “When you get people one-on-one, they’re just more comfortable admitting it. It was described to me that we’re the Ozempic of the music industry – everybody is on it and nobody wants to talk about it.”The fear, of course, is that by putting music on Ozempic, it wastes away to nothing.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockAI (artificial intelligence)Music industryComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So while I was still at Harvard, I’d make music videos in my head. One day, while listening toBad Boy/Having a Party by Luther Vandross, I thought: “This could be a great music video or movie.” And I sat down that night and wrote a script for a short film that ended up not only being made but shown at festivals and becoming a big hit in the world of student films. Spike Lee’sShe’s Gotta Have Ithad piqued interest in up-and-coming black film-makers. New Line Cinema saw my short and brought me in for a meeting. I pitched an expanded version of my idea and they said: “Let’s do it.”The studio wanted Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. Instead, I asked Kid ’n Play – AKA Christopher “Kid” Reid and Christopher “Play” Martin – to star. I loved their music videos, their style, their look. But I still had to convince New Line. They said: “Who are these guys?” I said: “They’ve got platinum records.” I had no idea if they did!The VP ran upstairs and said: 'We need to grab these guys'The movie – about a kid who’s been grounded but can’t bear to miss the party of the year – kept everything from the student film. It was just a matter of building on the world and the characters. It was exhilarating. I remember thinking: “It seems to be going great, but how do I know what going great feels like?”A lot of movies have clearly been inspired by House Party. That’s great. And I was inspired by Risky Business, National Lampoon and Animal House. I watched Lovers Rock,one of the movies Steve McQueen madeabout black British life. It wasn’t a comedy, but I thought: “This really captures the same spirit as House Party.”House Party is the only film to capture a very specific period of hip-hop, just before gangsta rap. It also talked about safe sex, a burgeoning issue at the time. I thought: “We’re gonna hide this” – like when you have to give your dog a pill so wrap it in bacon. We won an award from a health clinic in New Jersey that said: “Kids come in, ask for condoms and reference your film.” That was one of the things I’ve carried with me: make fun movies, but there’s nothing wrong with a little protein in there.Christopher ‘Play’ MartinKid and I had worked very hard for what felt like for ever to sign a deal with Select Records. Our first album, 2 Hype, came out in 1988. The reason Reggie wanted us from the giddy-up was because of our music videos. We were very animated. I guess you could say the camera loved us.I didn’t want to do the movie. Run–DMC’s Tougher Than Leather didn’t do well at all and I thought: “If Run–DMC can’t pull off a hit movie, how the heck will Kid ’n Play?” We were making more legal money than I’d ever seen. It was a gamble to ruin the momentum. But I was outvoted by Kid and our producer, Hurby Luv Bug. It was the best outvoted experience I’ve ever had.Kings From Queens: The Run-DMC Story review – incredibly honest and raw TVRead moreWe went to a meeting at New Line in the heart of Manhattan, in a suite on the 19th or 20th floor. We were given some scenes to improv, but it was horrible. I thought: “Well, we ain’t getting this movie.” This VP from New Line escorted us out on his way to a late lunch, but it was 3pm, just when all the high schools were letting out, and all these kids who recognised us swarmed us like we were the Beatles or the Jackson Five. This VP went back upstairs and told his business partners: “We need to grab these guys.”Making the movie felt like work, nine to five. There’s a part where I’m pushing equipment into the trunk of the car, scraping up speakers. The trunk came slamming down on my hand, so hard it bent my ring. Reggie went: “All right, next take.” I was like: “Dude, really?”House Party is probably the most excellent representation of that era. Even though Kid and I were musically successful, our characters still represented any other wannabe rapper. The clever thing is that the film never says what city or state we’re in, which means anyone can think it took place in their hood.House Party is available on 4K UHD from 2 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeComedy filmsHip-hopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For a man of 86, he has impressive lung capacity. He lets it go and watches it take a satisfyingly theatrical trajectory, rising to a height, then plummeting. “Free the spirit,” he says, in character as Ed, an elderly gay man searching for release.There was a lot of spirit-freeing over the weekend atPitlochry Festival theatre. In a bold pre-season move bynew artistic director Alan Cumming, the UK’s most idyllic venue launched its first LGBTQ+ festival in an atmosphere of exuberance. Programmed by Lewis Hetherington, Out in the Hills was a three-day compendium of talks, scratch performances and workshops that turned a sedate theatre into a buzzy social hive.I arrived as the audience for Coinneach MacLeod, AKAthe Hebridean Baker, was spilling out. A large and colourful group were posing for a picture in the foyer, while queues squeezed past for the bar. Many were on a high after the previous night’s Queer As Folk! ceilidh, led by theMalin Lewis Trio. Others were anticipating Sunday afternoon’s conversation between trans playwright Jo Clifford and her daughter Catriona Innes. I failed to find anyone who had done Finlay Wilson’s Kilted Yoga, but it was a thing.View image in fullscreenFree spirits … Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming and Graham Norton.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanMcKellen was there for a rehearsed reading of Equinox, a new monologue by Laurie Slade, the playwright drawing on his professional skills as a psychotherapist to mix in reflections on Freud and the Oedipus complex. Written in a tone of spiky regret, it was about Ed’s abandonment of his family and attraction to a domineering younger man. Under the direction of Sean Mathias, McKellen grabbed the mic from the table in front of him and held it close, the better to spit out the plosives of an irascible man struggling to find the right words at the bitter end of his life.“Be slow to judgment,” Ed pleaded as he recalled an estranged daughter, a neglected wife and the desperate patient he failed to help. The relationship with the “midnight man” he picked up in a gay bar seemed no less humiliating.McKellen got a second round of applause simply for sitting in the audience of the next event, a suitably frothy conversation between Cumming andGraham Nortonabout the TV host’s career.View image in fullscreenAn irascible man struggling to find the right words … Ian McKellen performing in Equinox.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanWith Cumming sporting the legend “Ae fond pish” on his black shirt and wearing a pair of ankle boots he got from the set ofThe Traitors US, the tone was frivolous and funny, even as he gently edged into questions about homophobia, representation and rights.‘I’m not just putting on nice plays’: Hollywood star Alan Cumming’s plan to reignite theatre in the Scottish HighlandsRead more“I love that there’s this big gay thing in the middle ofScotland,” said Norton, delighted to be part of such a happy event.

What about a Bovril crisp, cooked up to celebrate the release of Back to the Future? Then there’s hedgehog flavour – and even a Wallace and Gromit corn snack designed to capture the unique taste of moon cheese, which the duo rocketed off to collect in A Grand Day Out.All these salty, crunchy and perhaps even tasty snacks are celebrated in UK Crisp Packets 1970-2000, a 140-page compendium that delves into the colourful, often strange and occasionally wild world of crisp packet design. The book will come as a heavy hit of nostalgia for many people, featuring various childhood favourites – Chipsticks, Frazzles, Snaps – along with the lesser known and the rare.I was like: ‘Wow, I forgot how good these graphics are’You’ll find Dennis the Menace bacon and baked bean flavour alongside Golden Wonder roast turkey and stuffing and Sonic the Hedgehog salt and vinegar. There are long-gone regional brands from Penryn, Blackpool and Wigan, along with a whole heap of TV and film special editions, including the Spice Girls, Thunderbirds, Zig and Zag, Dr Who, The Mask and Jurassic Park.The book is by a 43-year-old artist going by the name of Chris Packet, who has amassed quite an archive. It is nothing if not eclectic, the designs it showcases ranging from straightforward to inspired to bizarre. There’s union jack-clad cheese and onion to commemorate the 1981 royal wedding and even innuendo-laden comic strips that recall smutty seaside postcards. The Dandy’s Beryl the Peril fronts a bag of sausage and tomato.View image in fullscreenAs alluring as a record sleeve? … 1991 KP Discos.Photograph: Chris PacketEqually fascinating, though, is the sheer range of lettering, illustrations, cartoons and styles that always feel playful and are sometimes even cool. An early packet of Discos – all wavy lines, 3D lettering and sharp design – is as alluring as a record sleeve. Odduns, a cheeseburger flavour potato snack, is graced with a complex triangular shape that is geometrically impossible. There’s a definite air of Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon cover.The story of this collection began in 2018, when Packet was exploring a disused train tunnel in London. “I’d heard stories about raves happening in it back in the 90s,” he recalls. “There was still rave logo graffiti on the walls.”Then something else caught his eye. On the ground, he saw a tatty item. Underneath the dirt, he could make out sharp blues and vivid greens, as well as an Alien-like figure firing a laser gun. It was a decades-old pickled onion Space Raiders packet, marked 10p. “Usually litter doesn’t last that long,” Packet says. “But it had settled in the tunnel and was protected from rain, sunlight, litter-pickers and everything else.”One pal found Chris a packet in a second world war bunker in Devon – it had been there since the 1980sHe found another, then another, and soon his haul had grown to include a classic Smiths Salt’n’Shake bag, tomato flavour Quavers from 1996, and a bag of Monster Munch bearing a best before date of July 1989. “They brought back strong memories from my childhood,” recalls Packet. “I was also like, ‘Wow, I forgot how good these graphics are.’ I realised they were actually unique pieces of history.”Packet, who is now based in Athens, began scouring the internet for more, buying bags from collectors. Friends would also keep an eye out, with one pal finding a packet in a second world war bunker in Dover that had been there since the 1980s.“My criteria is the artwork,” he says. “I’m from a graffiti and art background, so I’m interested in design. It’s about the lettering, the illustration, the cartoon characters.” He cites Space Raiders. “Compare the modern Space Raiders packet to the original by Brett Ewins.” Ewins was a comic book artist revered for his work on 2000AD strips like Judge Dredd. “It’s like they’ve forgotten about the art of design,” says Packet.View image in fullscreenCrunch time … the disused train tunnel where Chris Packet found his first bag.Photograph: Chris PacketHis book is intended to memorialise a golden era. “After 2000,” he says, “packets just lost something. Anything that looks like a 3D, computer-aided design model doesn’t appeal at all. Some of the designs were hand-drawn but when computers started coming in, I think a lot of these guys lost their trade. You obviously lose a lot of character and detail with that.”The book has a foreword by Annebella Pollen, professor of visual and material culture at the University of Brighton. “It’s cultural detritus,” she says. “But this very humble material – that’s really no more than litter – can tell an alternative history.” The professor’s introduction tackles everything from gender representation to the loss of regional independent companies, while looking at the fact that, as part of the fight against childhood obesity, crisps are now banned in schools. “This is children’s culture,” she says of the old packets. “There was a clear strategic attempt to move crisps beyond being bar snacks associated with adult men in pubs and into kids’ lunch boxes.”Crisp nostalgia, Pollen believes, hits people deeply for very nuanced reasons. “It’s reminding them of those moments as kids when they have a bit of autonomy,” she says. “Maybe it’s over what goes in their lunch box or their first 10p to spend in a tuck shop – those early choices that were your own. These may just be empty packets now, but we are filling them with memories.”● UK Crisp Packets 1970-2000 is published bySports Banger; @chris___packetExplore more on these topicsArtSnacksFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A retired engineer from Griffithstown in Wales, he cycled about 95 miles a week on his road bike. “Not bad for 78,” he says. On other days he’d be out on one of his restored motorbikes, as he was in June 2021, with a friend. They were riding at 10 miles an hour on a narrow road when his friend pulled out in front of him. “I had nowhere to go,” Price says. He remembers his head snapping back into his helmet before he blacked out.Price spent months in hospital. He had broken the fifth vertebra in his neck, resulting in compression of his spinal cord. He was told he wouldn’t walk again. “That was a bit of a downer, obviously,” he says. He was determined to prove the doctors wrong. “My mind told me I could get up and walk out. But when I tried, I collapsed.”Back home, a friend designed a wheeled lifting frame “on the back of a fag packet” to help him stand and walk, but Price fell often. “I don’t half go down. I must have a strong ticker because it seems to withstand it.”View image in fullscreenPrice with physiotherapist Sam Miggins at Morrello Clinic, Newport.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianIn 2022, while he and his wife were having work done to help make their house more accessible for Price, an engineer mentioned the Morrello Clinic, a physiotherapy centre. That’s how Price met physiotherapist Sam Miggins. After assessing the strength and movement in his legs, she turned to him and said, “I’ll get you to walk.”“You can imagine how I felt,” Price says. “After months of being told I couldn’t!”He began attending twice a week. He trains on an active-passive bike, with a motor that helps move his legs but still requires effort. There’s resistance training, stretching to aid movement in his hips and trunk, and walking using varying levels of support.Progress is slow. He finds it hard to keep up his determination. “I go to bed at night and sometimes I think I don’t want to wake up. Then in the morning I think, oh well, I’ll walk again. I’ve got to get better than this.’”It took six months to build up the strength to use an upright walker. The first time was “marvellous”, Price says – even though it hurt. Now, he and Miggins walk 400m up and down the road outside the clinic with a Zimmer. “If there are other patients there, we say, ‘Oh, you walking to the pub?’” he jokes. Afterwards, he’s exhausted. “But mentally I’m a lot better.”Now Price can walk short distances at home with his wife, using an upright walking frame. They no longer need care workers to help him dress or get into bed. At the clinic, he’s progressed to walking with a quad stick for stability and just one person supporting him. Before, he suffered severe spasms: “My legs would shoot up at right angles.” Now those have stopped.He goes back to hospital once a year for a review of his medication. He remembers the first time he returned after he’d learned to walk again. “The doctor said, ‘Well, Mr Price, you proved us wrong.’ I said, ‘It’s because of Sam’ and the doctor said, ‘It’s not down to Sam, it’s down to you.’”Harold Price goes to theMorrello Clinic.Explore more on these topicsBody imageChanged body, changed lifeHealth & wellbeingCyclingMental healthHealthDisabilityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I began sampling activities I’d previously dismissed – book clubs, line dancing, chess – and it became oddly addictiveAmy WildMon 19 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 06.13 ESTShareFor most of my life, I treated taste as fixed. There were things I liked and things I didn’t, and that was that.Hobbies, foods and even social situations were quietly written off with the certainty of personal preference. But sticking to that sentiment had left me in a bit of a rut.When I moved to London, I threw myself into work: long hours, commuting and networking. In the process, I stopped making time for hobbies or trying anything new.My housemates were endlessly creative, often heading to unusual theatre shows, dance classes or events I had never considered. Salsa lessons? No thanks. Interactive theatre? Not for me.But my automatic “no” to anything that “wasn’t my thing” only kept me trapped in the same routine of work, sleep, eating, and that left me feeling flat and a little empty.So, in an effort to break the monotony, I began to question whether my taste is fixed at all, or whether it might be something I could train. I had read that children need eight to 15 tries to accept a new food; why shouldn’t the same principle apply to social activities for adults?I started small. When a friend invited me to a book club, I resisted the instinct to dismiss it, despite my longstanding dislike of reading. Being dyslexic, reading always felt like a mental workout that left my brain exhausted.But I went anyway. I listened to the first book on audiobook and, to my surprise, enjoyed the discussion, the people and, naturally, the pints. By the next month, I challenged myself to read the physical book on my commute. Now, not only do I look vaguely literate on the tube, but I spend mornings reading instead of scrolling aimlessly.Then came music and performance: jazz clubs, spoken word nights, line dancing, contemporary performance – all things I had previously disregarded.At first it was awkward, and sometimes downright bewildering. One show featured an entire cast in morphsuits, and I spent the first 15 minutes convinced I had wandered into an avant-garde exercise class. By the end though, I was captivated and quite proud of myself for surviving the front-row seats my friends had insisted on.Stepping into unfamiliar experiences isn’t just good for your social life – it’s good for your brain tooTrying things you think you won’t enjoy, I found, becomes oddly addictive. I didn’t love everything straight away, but I stopped saying no before I had even begun.Runningclubs were intimidating, but the more I showed up – and actually spoke to people – the more I realised how much easier conversation becomes when you start from a shared activity.Most recently, I tried out my local library’s chess club. I was easily 30 years younger than everyone else, but that didn’t matter. Sitting opposite people with wildly different life stories made me realise how rarely I speak with people from other generations outside work or family. We talked about their past careers, local news, and I learned new chess moves. And honestly, there’s nothing quite like being wiped off the board by someone who’s been playing since before your parents met. It was comforting, if a little humbling, and I felt more of a connection with others there than at any organised twentysomethings social event I’ve attended.Research published last yearsuggests that engaging your curiosity in new activities can help protect against age-related cognitive decline and support long-term brain health. So stepping into unfamiliar experiences isn’t just good for your social life – it’s good for your brain, too.What surprised me most was how these new activities began to spill into one another: book club conversations led to theatre recommendations, theatre nights to art exhibitions, exhibitions to conversations I wouldn’t have had otherwise.That, in itself, became the reward – not just the hobbies, but the people who, without judgment, helped me find value in experiences I had long dismissed. Putting “try something new” in my diary once a week broke up the work-commute-collapse cycle I had accidentally built my life around.Getting out of my comfort zone now gives me a buzz. I simply count to five, approach the friendliest-looking person with a “hello”, and any initial awkwardness quickly fades.Next week? Who knows. Maybe magic lessons. Maybe life drawing. Maybe both.Explore more on these topicsHobbiesThe one change that workedChessRunningJazzTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They aren’t expensive and give a lift to everyone’s mood.” Or try daffodils, which are in season now. Similarly,Serenatold us: “My mother always said buy a red or pink brolly, which will give a glow to your face in the rain.” Meanwhile, the Filter’s ownEmily Goddardsuggests dopamine dressing, even if only on a small scale. “I have several colourful pairs of socks that add a pop of joy to the dark outfits I often find myself defaulting to during winter,” she says.Mindfulness and cosy candlesView image in fullscreenSome find bliss in walking on a crisp, frosty day.Photograph: Madeleine Deaton/Getty ImagesFrancesgives herself a boost by making the most of sunny spells. “I like to go out for walks on crisp winter days in the countryside. How lucky are we to have such beauty around us for microdosing mindfulness?”Nicolafinds spurts of productivity bring her calm. “I like to clear and wipe one work surface; maybe kitchen island or table (albeit shove some stuff in a drawer, in the bin and light a candle …) after a long day or start of the weekend. It makes me feel in control,” she says.Here on the Filter, we can’t resist a self-care moment to lift our spirits. “My January treat is an extra-long hot shower before bed – it makes my evening feel much cosier,” saysElla Jinadu. “Method’s Wind Down body washis my current favourite – it has a pleasingly sleepy scent.”Monica Horridgehas a top tip for tackling early sunsets. “I light a scented candle at the start of the evening, to make the most of the darkness. ThisM&S x Kelly Hoppen candleis a new favourite,” she says. And, I personally don’t think you can beat a comforting cup of tea and some chocolate at the end of a long, cold day.

Here they offer achievable alternativesMy week avoiding ultra-processed foodsGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailEmma JoyceMon 19 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 18.49 ESTShare“It’s not poor willpower,” says Mark Lawrence. The ecological nutrition professor from Deakin University is a global expert in ultra-processed foods, a beacon of knowledge in the proliferation of UPFs. “It’s really difficult to avoid them.”Australia, alongside the US and UK, has one of the world’shighest consumption ratesof ultra-processed foods which have been linked to “multiple diet-related chronic diseases”, according toa global reportof which Lawrence was a co-author.Dr Mathilde Touvier, another co-author, says UPFs have a “strong and consistent association with cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, depression and obesity”. So it’s “urgent” that consumers start eating less of them.Australia has some of highest consumption rates of ultra-processed foods, researchers sayRead moreSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning“It’s a bit of a battle,” says dietitian Dr Eden Barrett, as about 60% of packaged foods in Australia would be classified as UPF, according to the George Institute for Global Health, which assessed more than 40,000 products available in supermarkets.“For most people it doesn’t need to be an all-or-nothing approach,” says Barrett. “Identifying the easiest swaps rather than changing everything at once might make it a bit easier too.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailSo what makes a food UPF? They typically include “flavours, emulsifiers, colours, sweetness, thickeners”, says Barrett. Ingredients used for preservation purposes only, such as citric acid, don’t typically make something ultra-processed.Touvier recommends apps such as OpenFoodFacts to help identify foods classed as UPF in the Nova classification system, which popularised the term.“The definition is foods that are made using industrial processes and industrial ingredients that you wouldn’t normally find in a typical kitchen,” says dietitian and Associate Prof Evangeline Mantzioris from Adelaide University. But it’s important to look at the whole picture of a person’s diet, she says, and keep nationaldietary guidelinesin mind.Here, the experts offer some straightforward swaps for UPFs in day-to-day eating.Swap cereals for oats or multigrain varieties“Most breakfast cereals that have an extruded puffed shape, like Coco Pops, Rice Bubbles, Nutri-Grain, will be ultra-processed,” says Barrett. To know for sure, shoppers should examine the ingredients list. “Avoid ones with added sweeteners, such as stevia,” she says.Instead, buy multigrain cereals. “Pick ones that look as wholefood as possible,” says Mantzioris. “Your old favourite Australian Weet-Bix and Vita Brits are high in fibre, because they are wholegrain, so they’re good options.”View image in fullscreenExperts say oats are a healthier alternative to processed cereals.Photograph: Dougal Waters/Getty ImagesOats, made as porridge or overnight oats, “are a great food and very minimally processed,” says Barrett. “Add your own fruits and nuts, honey or maple syrup, or even something like peanut butter to get the flavours you want.”Choose an alternative milk with the best nutritional value“Plant-based milk can be a good part of the diet,” says Barrett.Many alternative milks are ultra-processed, but there are versions that aren’t made with oils, emulsifiers and sugars. For example, Oatly Organic Oat Milk contains only oats, water and salt. Nutty Bruce Unsweetened Activated Almond Milk is made of water, almonds, brown rice and salt. Home-brand organic plant milks similarly can have very few ingredients, however, most barista-styles served in cafes are UPFs.“Pick ones that are fortified with things like calcium,” says Barrett. “This can be really confusing, but being fortified with vitamins and minerals doesn’t make something ultra-processed.”Ditch soft drinks and sports drinks for milk, water or juiceWhether they’re full sugar or have artificial sweeteners, soft drinks are all ultra-processed. “This is an area to entirely avoid if you can,” says Barrett. If you can’t cut them, reduce your intake.Mantzioris adds sports drinks are just as bad. “There’s this illusion that it’s somewhat healthier because they have electrolytes [but] if you’re not an elite athlete, you probably don’t need the extra electrolytes.”Milk is a better hydrating fluid, she says.View image in fullscreenDitching soft drinks for juice helps to cut down on additives.Photograph: Posed by model; Westend61/Getty ImagesFor a swap, “start with something like 100% fruit juice diluted with three-quarters of water,” says Barrett. “Aim towards cutting back on that further and maybe infusing water with fruit, or push yourself towards just water, because these beverages really aren’t adding anything except sugar, calories and additives that you don’t need.”Head to the (supermarket) bakery for better breadSliced supermarket bread typically contains emulsifiers for preservation and texture. Go to the supermarkets’ in-house bakery, says Barrett, where you might be able to find ones that don’t. However, they “won’t have as long a shelf life”.View image in fullscreenBread from a bakery contains fewer emulsifiers.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianIf going to a bakery, or baking bread yourself, is impractical, Mantzioris says choose a sliced bread that’s wholegrain “so that you get more fibre, more grains, more nutrients”.Wholemeal bread from the supermarket can be part of a healthy diet, says Barrett, “regardless of being ultra-processed”. Used with an egg and salad sandwich, for example, “the whole meal won’t be particularly ultra-processed even though one ingredient is”.Swap ice-cream for plain yoghurtMost ice-creams are ultra-processed. Popular supermarket brands can contain vegetable oil, maltodextrin, emulsifiers, added flavours, vegetable gum and thickeners. Sorbet, also classed as UPF, usually has added gums, such as xanthan gum.My week avoiding ultra-processed foods: ‘Why is it this hard?’Read moreIt’s not a food these dieticians encourage, but Mantzioris has an ice-cream machine at home and makes her own. That way “it doesn’t have all those other added emulsifiers in it”.Otherwise, replace ice-cream with plain yoghurt, says Barrett. “Adding your own fruits and nuts, and even honey or maple syrup, could be a dessert that offers a lot of nutritional value.”Pick plain yoghurt over flavoured onesStrawberry, vanilla, mango or pots promoting extra protein – all flavoured yoghurts are UPFs because they contain thickeners, artificial flavours and in some cases rice starch.“In Australia we tend to use thickeners to get the texture, so even among plain yoghurts there might be some that still fall into that ultra-processed category,” says Barrett. Check the ingredients and opt for plain Greek-style. Add toppings “and you can get it to taste, in my opinion, just as good”.“Ones marketed towards children can be some of the worst,” says Barrett. Though Mantzioris says context is important. “If your child only eats fruit-flavoured yoghurt, doesn’t touch milk and doesn’t touch cheese, that’s going to be a good source of calcium.”Go for salted potato chips over flavoured onesUPFs are usually industrially processed, meaning you wouldn’t be able to replicate them at home. “Pringles, for example, have been pulverised to a powder, reshaped and then deep-fried,” says Mantzioris. “So you’ve lost what we call the food matrix, or the architecture, and nutrients may respond differently when they’re outside of their food structure.”View image in fullscreenPlain salted potato chips are a better choice than those with added flavours.Photograph: Kwangmoozaa/Getty Images/iStockphotoEven “healthier” options like lentil chips are ultra-processed. If you want to buy a bag of chips, “choose ones that have minimal additions to them, like the plain salt potato chips,” says Mantzioris. “But they are definitely just ‘sometimes foods’.”Choose minimally processed meat over sausagesUltra-processed foods: the 19 things everyone needs to knowRead more“Sausages are not only ultra-processed but they’re also typically quite high in saturated fat and sodium,” says Barrett, advising shoppers to limit or cut sausages from their diet altogether. For an alternative meat, opt for “any kind of lean meat that’s not pre-seasoned, they’re pretty much all minimally processed,” she says.Plant-based sausages may have a better nutritional profile, she says, but they too can be ultra-processed. For an alternative, “there are lentil patties that don’t contain many ingredients”.Look for crackers with the smallest ingredients listJatz and Ritz crackers are both UPFs as they contain vegetable oils, emulsifiers and flavours. But there are crackers that aren’t. Ryvita Original only contains flour and salt; Ceres Organic rice crackers are just rice and salt; and Real Foods Corn Thins are maize, vegetable oil and salt.“You’re really looking [to avoid] ingredients that are trying to enhance the flavour,” says Barrett, so barbecue or chicken-flavoured crackers, for example. “Go for the smallest ingredients list, that is generally your best bet,” says Barrett.Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkHealth & wellbeingAustralian lifestyleFoodDiets and dietingUltra-processed foodsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The cherry tomatoes provide a welcome fresh note, but otherwise it’s a happy cupboard raid.An old Nigel Slater recipefirst put me on to the idea of using yoghurt to finish a pasta dish, and it works brilliantly here to balance the harissa. Excellent for a work-from-home lunch, too.Harissa-spiked orzo with chickpeas and pine nutsPrep10 minCook15 minServes230g pine nutsFlaky sea salt200g orzo1tbsp olive oil2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated200g cherry tomatoes, halved400g tin chickpeas, drained and rinsed (see my reviewfor the best brands)2 heapedtbsp jarred roseharissa paste(I likeBelazu)Juice of½ lemon2 heapedtbspGreek yoghurt, to serveFreshflat-leaf parsley,chopped to finish (optional)Put a large frying pan on a medium heat, then add the pine nuts, turn down the heat and toast, stirring and watching constantly, for three to four minutes, until evenly golden brown all over – do not leave the pan unattended, because theywillburn. Tip the nuts on to a plate.Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, add the orzo and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.While the pasta is cooking, return the pine nut pan (don’t bother washing it) to a low heat, add the olive oil and garlic, and stir for 30 seconds. Add the halved cherry tomatoes and soften for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the chickpeas and harissa, and cook for a further three to four minutes, by which time the pasta should be ready.Drain the orzo, reserving a mugful of its cooking water. Tip the pasta in with the tomatoes, chickpeas and harissa, add the lemon juice, and mix well; if need be, add a splash or two of the reserved water to help the sauce emulsify.

I’ve always been drawn to dishes that celebrate simple, honest ingredients and local tradition, and these two recipes are inspired by that spirit, and by a childhood spent doing lots of fishing in Wales. The seafood cawl is a lighter, coastal take on the Welsh classic, while the rarebit is rich and nostalgic. Both are designed to be cooked slowly and shared generously, and an ode to home kitchens, good produce and quiet moments around the table.Cawl of the sea (smoked haddock, leeks and barley – pictured top)This is a fishy twist on the national dish of Wales, a hearty stew that’s traditionally made with meat and root vegetables.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes42 tbsp butter2 leeks, trimmed, finely sliced, washed and drained2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped1 celery stick, trimmed and finely dicedSea salt and black pepper150g pearl barley150ml dry cider1 litre fish stock, or vegetable stock400g undyed smoked haddock fillet100ml double cream1 tbsp wholegrain mustard1 tbsp chopped dill1 tbsp dill oil(optional, to serve; to make it, simply blitz 20g dill in 20g sunflower oil, leave to infuse, then fine-strain through muslin and store in a clean jar in the fridge for up to two months)Lemon wedges, to serveMelt the butter in a heavy-based pan on a medium heat, add the leeks, garlic, celery and a pinch of salt, and saute gently, stirring, for eight to 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Stir in the pearl barley, toast for a minute, then add the cider, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and leave to cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 30-35 minutes, until the barley is tender.Lay the haddock on top of the barley, cover the pan with a lid and leave the fish to poach gently in the steam for six to eight minutes, until it flakes easily. Lift out the fish, flake into large chunks, then fold these through the barley with the cream, mustard and chopped dill. Season generously, taste and adjust as needed.Ladle into warmed bowls, drizzle with a little dill oil, if using, and serve with lemon wedges for a touch of brightness.Black Bomber rarebit with onion marmaladeView image in fullscreenLuke Selby’s Black Bomber rarebit with onion marmalade.There are few more satisfying hot snacks or light lunches than Welsh rarebit, so it pays to give the classic some proper attention.Prep10 minCook45 minServes41 tbsp butter1 large onion, peeled and finely slicedSea salt and pepper1 tsp brown sugar1 tsp cider vinegar1 tsp Worcestershire sauce1 tsp English mustard100ml dark ale– I useMagic Dragon’s Border bitter200gSnowdonia Black Bomber cheddar, or other mature cheddar, grated1 egg yolk4 thick slices strong ale bread(about 250g), or sourdoughFirst make the onion marmalade. Melt the butter in a small pan over a low heat, then add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt, and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 25-30 minutes, until soft and golden. Stir in the sugar and vinegar, cook for another five minutes, until sticky, then take off the heat.While the marmalade is cooking, make the rarebit mixture. Put the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, ale and a pinch of pepper in a small pan, warm gently, stirring to combine, then gradually whisk in the cheese until it’s melted and the sauce is smooth. Take off the heat, stir in the egg yolk until well combined, then leave to cool slightly – as it cools, the rarebit mixture should thicken to a spreadable paste.Toast the bread lightly on both sides under a hot grill. Spread a spoonful of the onion marmalade over one side of each slice, then top generously with the rarebit mixture. Return the bread rarebit side up to the hot grill for two or three minutes, until the rarebit is bubbling and golden, then serve immediately with an extra spoon of marmalade on the side and a pint of ale, if you fancy it.Luke Selby is chef/partner ofPalé Hallin Llandderfel, Gwynedd, north WalesExplore more on these topicsFoodBritish food and drinkStarterSoupSeafoodWinter food and drinkSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

I always knew when he was about to do it, because he would stare at me intensely before launching himself towards the ceilingGary BasemanMon 19 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareMy animals play a big, crazy role in my life. I grew up with cats when I was a little kid but my love of black cats began when I moved from New York to LA in 1996 and found four feral black cats in my back yard. Almost immediately, two female cats got knocked up and had two litters at the same time. Suddenly, we had 13 black cats, the most I’d ever cared for at once.I’ve been an artist all my life and during the early 2000s my career really started to take off. I began creating a lot of merchandise toys and had my own TV series called Teacher’s Pet, which won five Emmys and a Bafta. My cat Blackie was the inspiration behind all my artwork at the time; he was a scholarly cat with a giant purr – I often drew him as my alter ego. When Blackie died from illness in 2020, I felt as though I’d lost a part of myself – he had been my companion for 15 years. It took me a year to grieve before I could finally consider another cat. That’s when Bosko came into my life.View image in fullscreenA Bosko-inspired picture by Gary.Photograph: Courtesy of Gary BasemanIn 2021, a fan of mine was fostering three black kittens she was looking to give away. We scheduled a visit and I had an instant connection with one cat in particular, so I brought him home. I think his name was Inkwell or Inkpot at the time but I decided to name him Bosko after the American brand of chocolate syrup (Bosco) that had a childhood nostalgia.Bosko was a playful cat, who had so much youth and energy and a tiny purr. The most peculiar thing about him was his athletic ability. Everywhere and anywhere he would leap up into the air and dart across the room, landing on my shoulders. He could jump up to 7ft in the air – it looked as if he was flying. I always knew when he was about to do it because he would stare at me intensely before launching himself towards the ceiling. He was like an athlete, agile and adventurous.My cats are my muses, they inspire narratives that help me understand the world and live a vibrant and fulfilling life. Before I had Bosko, my art was focused on grief and remembrance, particularly of my late parents who were Holocaust survivors. Bosko ignited the feeling of being alive again. His energy infused a lust for life and the thrill of play into my artwork. I drew him drinking a bottle of chocolate syrup like it was soda, or comedic sketches about his missing white whisker. We’d take selfies together, with him perched on top of my head; videos of his acrobatics garnered a mass following online.View image in fullscreen‘My cats are my muses.’Illustration: Courtesy of Gary BasemanIn January 2024, I came home from my sunrise hike and found Bosko lying lifeless on my bed. I ran outside, hysterically carrying his limp body in my arms. My neighbour drove me to a vet in Beverly Hills. I was desperately giving him mouth-to-mouth in the car. The vets did everything they could to revive him but nothing worked. He was gone. I sat in the back room cradling his body, completely overcome by shock. I wanted to savour the last moments we had together; I could have stayed there for eternity.Since then, I’ve adopted two more black cats, but I will always remember Bosko as the world’s greatest flying cat, who gave my creativity a new lease of life.As told to Sinéad CampbellExplore more on these topicsLife and styleThe pet I'll never forgetPetsCatsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She, too, died of cancer in 2024. At 26, I am now alone and struggling to deal with enormous, nonsensicalenergy bills fromE.ONNext.In 2022, Idiscoveredmy aunt had been payingmassively inflated bills for the flat I shared with her, so I had the account closed and a new oneset upin my name. AnE.ON agent took meter readings, a smart meter was installed, and a final bill sent showing the account was more than £6,000 in credit. E.ON wouldn’t let me have it in cash, so the credit was transferred to the new account and used to pay the bills for the next two years.Fast forward to 2024 and, after my aunt’s death, it deducted £3,360 from the credit for energy used since early 2022.I complained and, a month later, received a bill for £12,960 in the name of my late mother who had been the account holder before her death in 2015. This sum was for energy going back to May 2021. I contested this, and it sent debt collectors.The Energy Ombudsman intervened, got the £12,960 bill cancelled, and orderedE.ONto comply with back-billing regulations, but it has not repaid the £3,360.SA,LondonI have spent hours poring over the various bills and admit myself baffled. Charges are repeatedly reversed and reapplied. Balances wildly fluctuate. In October 2022, when the £6,000 credit was applied to your new account, the opening statement from E.ON estimated your annual gas and electricity cost to be £23,200. This fantasy figure may explain why your aunt was being charged up to £1,000 a month in the years before her death.Since the smart meter was installed in 2022, you have been using about £150 a month of energy, about right for a single person in a three-bedroom flat.The never-ending drama of dealing with errant energy companiesRead moreThe £3,360 arrears that E.ON conjured up in July 2024 also make no sense. Not only are energy companies forbidden to charge for unbilled consumption dating back more than 12 months, the smart meter was relaying readings back to the company for 20 of the months they then insisted were owing.E.ON’s responses to my questions, teased out over several weeks, are as mystifying as its bills. It claims that the £6,000 credit on your aunt’s account was based on incorrect estimated readings. That, says the company, is why it couldn’t be cashed in by you – yet due to human error, it was transferred to your new E.ON account.Your aunt’s credit balance was, it says, actually £2,633 in 2022. After that blunder, it admits it then incorrectly billed you for an outstanding balance accrued outside the back-billing deadline.Meanwhile, your new smart meter was malfunctioning, it claims, and you were being undercharged. That is apparently how the £3,360 debt arose in 2024, though no one thought to explain this to you.E.ON apologised for its “shortcomings” and told me it had since “enhanced” its bereavement policy. It says: “We have applied back-billing protection to both the old and new accounts, cleared all outstanding balances, removed any negative credit reference data and issued a goodwill payment.”Given the catalogue of blunders, it is impossible to know if the £3,360 deduction is correct. It certainly seems very high. You insist that money should not have been deducted.As you have already tried the Energy Ombudsman, I suggest you take the paperwork to Citizens Advice to see if you have a legal case. What is certain is that E.ON’s errors and insouciance would be appalling by any standards, but it is especially shocking when a bereaved young customer is at the receiving end.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

You can lose 40–45% of body heat from an unprotected head.” That’s the advice in a 1970sUS Army Survival Manual, which is probably where this myth originated, saysJohn Tregoning, a professor of vaccine immunology at Imperial College London.The reality is that there is nothing special about your head. When you go out in the cold, you lose more body heat from any area you leave exposed than from those parts protected by clothing. Out in a snowsuit but no hat? You’re going to lose heat quickly from your face and head, while the suit slows down the cooling of your body.“But if you went to the Arctic in a swimming costume, you’d lose more heat from your legs than your head because their surface area is bigger than your head’s,” says Tregoning.Because you’ve got less fat on your head than the rest of your body, it is slightly less naturally insulatedIs it true that … cold water plunges boost immunity?Read moreNevertheless, there remains some discussion about whether the head is more susceptible to heat loss. Tregoning points to aBritish Medical Journal articlefrom 2008 which suggests that because you’ve got less fat on your head than the rest of your body, it is slightly less naturally insulated. The article also argues that vasoconstriction – the narrowing of blood vessels to conserve heat – is less effective on the head.Overall, though, Tregoning says, “the head does lose heat, but it’s not uniquely heat-losing. There’s a study where researchersput peoples’ heads in cold water,and then looked at the speed of cooling down, and it wasn’t particularly faster than anywhere else.”Still, he says, if it’s very cold and you’re not wearing a hat, you are going to get cold – just as you would if you went out without a jumper on. “People probably need to cover their face as well, if they can. You lose quite a lot of heat through your face.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …Health & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the first Armani collection in which the late designer had no involvement.View image in fullscreenLeo Dell’Orco and his nephew Gianluca greet the press at Monday’s fashion show.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersIf Armani under Armani was known for its relaxed, deconstructed suiting and fluid folds in silk, velvet and cashmere, all in his signature shade of “greige”, Dell’Orco kept all but the colour palette, shifting focus away from the famous portmanteau towards jewel-like tones.Here, the everyday Armani uniform of relaxed velvet coordinates, brushed cashmere shackets and velvet polo shirts came in amethyst, sapphire and lapis blue hues Elsewhere, a 1980s sensibility came to the fore, with leather bomber and aviator-inspired jackets, jacquard knitwear and rakish suiting that was one-part Withnail, one part member of A-ha.The latter is a savvy move in many ways, tapping into the increased appetite for vintage Armani. In the days after Giorgio’s death, eBay reported a 192% spike in searches for the brand, while searches on Vinted were three times higher than normal.View image in fullscreenModels wait backstage at the Giorgio Armani show.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesThe general consensus from the menswear press in response to the show, which took place in the same basement room at Armani HQ that it has done in recent history, with many of the same models walking the runway, was positive.“It definitely felt like the brand wasn’t trying to reinvent itself after the passing of Mr Armani,” says Zak Maoui, the style director at Gentleman’s Journal. “Dell’Orco left his mark without distorting the lasting memory we have of, ultimately, the iconic brand that Armani built. That said, there was a mood shift and the music was more upbeat … it felt like a celebration of Armani.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘greige’ is largely out, but beige is still permitted.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesPaul Toner, the deputy editor at 10 Magazine, agrees. “After working with Mr Armani for so long, Leo Dell’Orco knows the codes of the house like the back of his hands and this had everything you expect from a great Armani show with some great additions that felt youthful, like those buttery soft leather jackets.”Since Giorgio’s death, there has been much speculation around the future creative direction of the fashion house’s biannual collections. As it stands, Dell’Orco has taken the reins of the menswear and Armani’s niece, Silvana, continues in her role as womenswear design director.Several names have been recently rumoured to be in the frame for the role, the most recurring of which is the former Celine and Dior Homme creative director Hedi Slimane.View image in fullscreenHats appear to be a core part of the new Armani menswear collection.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesWhile the brand itself hasn’t commented on any creative succession plan, the show notes made a point of saying “Dell’Orco’s vision emerges naturally after 40 years working alongside Giorgio Armani, and from a desire to make a personal mark on what stands as his debut” suggesting it may be less of an interim measure and a more long-term positioning of Dell’Orco, who took his bow alongside his nephew and head of the menswear style office, Gianluca Dell’Orco.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: pay your own tribute to Armani by perfecting his signature relaxed styleRead moreAs for the future of the group, a new board of directors that was appointed in November is said to be currently activating the posthumous wishes of Giorgio Armani whose will was striking for its specificity.Despite priding himself in remaining an independent brand during his lifetime, Armani instructed his heirs to sell a 15% stake in the business within 18 months, and an additional 30% to 54.9% to the same buyer within the next five years, name checking L’Oréal, EssilorLuxottica and LVMH. An announcement has yet to be made on the next steps.Explore more on these topicsArmaniMen's fashionMenMen's coats and jacketsMen's suitsMen's trousersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before I sit down to a platter of oysters atLa Cabane des Bons Vivants, one of the village’s canal-side restaurants, I stand and watch orange flames bellow up from a tangle of long, skinny pine needles inside a large, open oven. They are piled on top of a board of carefully arranged mussels and, by setting fire to the pine needles, the shellfish cook in their own juices.This is the curious tradition ofmoules à l’éclade, a novel way of cooking mussels developed by Marennes-Oléron oyster farmers along the River Seudre in the Charente-Maritime, halfway down France’s west coast. The short-lived flaming spectacle is a prelude to sliding apart the charred shells and finding juicy orange molluscs inside – and just one highlight of our evening along La Grève. The avenue that cuts between the oyster beds, lined by colourful, ramshackle huts and rustic pontoons is an alluring venue for a sunset meal by the canal, the atmosphere all the more lively and fascinating for it being in a working oyster-farming village.View image in fullscreenI’m with my family here in the Charente-Maritime, just north of where the Gironde estuary meets the Atlantic and around an hour south of the region’s more famous resorts of Île de Ré and La Rochelle. Our five days here will show us how a holiday rolls with the same alluring vibe as those settings farther north, but costs less and has more to explore (our base is a comfortable villa in the village of Étaules), with towns such as Royan on the itinerary.The first stop for any self-catering stay in France, though, is the market. Royan’s is out of this world. Completed in 1956, the Marché Central de Royan has a decidedly futuristic vibe; inside, the 50-metre-span dome is lit by a space-age pattern of skylights, suggesting this flying saucer might take off at any moment.View image in fullscreenMoules a l’éclade: mussels cooked with pine needles over a firePhotograph: Hemis/AlamyIts offerings are equally impressive, and we stock up on cheeses, including a creamy Brillat-Savarin and a fruity Comté; charcuterie, including the local terrine,legrilloncharentais, and saucisson; a big blousy lettuce, crunchy cucumber and a perfumed melon. It takes some resistance to say “C’est tout,merci” when each stallholder says “Avecceci?” (What else would you like?) after each choice, and we come away laden with bags of fresh, local goodies.When it comes to beaches we’re spoiled for choice. The children have brought bodyboards, so we head for the Atlantic wavesA short walk from the market is another mid-century marvel, theÉglise Notre-Dame de Royan. Like the market hall and much of the local housing, it was built as the town recovered from Allied bombing towards the end of the second world war and is extraordinary – especially when you catch sight of its concrete belltower and sharp angular structure above the roof-lines. Inside, it is even more impressive and is said to have provided inspiration for the audience hall in Dragonstone in the TV series Game of Thrones.A triangular stained-glass window is framed by V-shaped pillars that tower above, punctuated by thin windows of white glass. We explore its balconies and hidden features between the concrete alcoves, before coming outside into the bright sunlight. The beach is a few steps away, but we resolve to return, when our gastronomic treasures aren’t wilting in the car.When it comes to beaches here, we’re spoiled by choice. The children have brought bodyboards, so we head to Plage Le Vieux Phare for action on the Atlantic waves. It’s overlooked by a cartoon-like red-and-white painted lighthouse, thePhare de la Coubre. A queue is snaking from its entrance and the views from the top are said to be wonderful, but we choose to enjoy it from the beach instead – what with it being 35C.View image in fullscreenA street in Mornac-sur-Seudre, a few miles north of Royan.Photograph: Helene Alexandre/AlamyWe hike across the soft sand to the life-guarded area a short distance from the ruined old stone lighthouse. Soon we’re jumping and riding the ferocious waves and the sight of the beach, east and west, disappears in a haze of sea spray.The beach we visit the next day is more sedate; a day trip to the Île d’Oléron takes us to Plage de Boyardville at the north of the island. Our drive takes us through pine forests and deep woods that expand across the island, which is twice the breadth of the Île de Ré. We park beneath towering pine trees and follow the path to the beach, a picnic of our market spoils in the cool bag. The boardwalk leads to a perfect crescent and a shallow lagoon in which children tumble and splash.Saint-Pierre-d’Oléron is reminiscent of the Île de Ré, only a little scruffier, which adds to its charmTo my left, the silhouette ofFort Boyardlooms on the horizon. The concept behind this architectural curiosity dates from the mid-17th century but it was finally completed amid tensions between the French and English in 1857. The fort was intended to guard the coast but soon became obsolete and was used as a prison. From the beach it looks quite small, but distances can be deceptive: it is in fact 68 metres long and could house 250 soldiers with 74 cannons. Recounting my hazy memories of the 1990s Fort Boyard TV game show – a kind of Crystal Maze at sea only with tigers and Dirty Den (Leslie Grantham) – warrants a raised eyebrow from my 12-year-old son.After indulging in ice-cream sundaes atLe Café de la Plage, we head into Saint-Pierre-d’Oléron, the island’s main town. It’s late afternoon on a Sunday, so few shops are open but there’s a four-piece jazz group playing on the main street, which brings an upbeat lilt to the sleepy town. With hollyhocks swaying in the breeze, white-washed, green and grey-shuttered houses, and long early evening shadows, it is reminiscent of the Île de Ré, only a little scruffier, which adds to its charm. We browse the shops that are open and wander back to the car, feeling sleepy and sun-kissed.View image in fullscreenOyster shacks in La Tremblade.Photograph: Willy Mobilo/AlamyAs we drive over the bridge back to the mainland, the tide has come in under it, and several aluminium oyster-catching boats are speeding by beneath.The village of Mornac-sur-Seudre to the south is also reminiscent of the Île de Ré, with its white-washed houses, creeping wisteria and bright pink oleander bushes. We go early evening for a sundowner, next to its own waterway and oyster beds, and see more moules à l’éclade going up in flames outside the seafood restaurantLe Parc des Graves. We window-shop the gift shops and galleries, annoyed we didn’t get there earlier.La Tremblade is our favourite though, and so we return to La Grève for a final meal atLa Cabane de la Grand-Mère, which does its mussels differently –moules à la brasero. The recipe, borrowed from oyster-farming communities near the Mediterranean, sees them marinated with herbs, onions, white wine and olive oil and then cooked on a griddle over a fire. After swigging back a platter of briny oysters, we tuck into the steaming pots of mussels and agree these are the best we’ve ever eaten. I ask the owner how they are cooked and she tells me the recipe. “All the very best flavours!” she laughs. When I say how they’re even better than moules à l’éclade, she smiles and says: “Ah but, with the éclade, it’s a much bigger spectacle! The flames are amazing!” I can’t disagree.Transport from Portsmouth to Caen was provided byBrittany Ferries; return crossingfrom£224for a car and a family of four.

And, by extension, no poo.“I’ve been waiting 50 years for this,” one man carrying several shopping bags told me as he exited the shiny new building. “I couldn’t bring friends here from Europe to sit out there [at the old market] with the birds and the shit.”For whatever reason, the birdlife had missed the memo that the city’s famous fish market had upgraded to a new building, and were still milling at the old site, which – for the first time in decades – wasn’t operational.View image in fullscreenThe grand opening of the new Sydney Fish Market.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianStarting at 7am, hundreds filtered through the new building, eager to sample some morning seafood or take home the catch of the day.I was among them, bleary eyed from my punishingly early wake-up but excited to expand the typically limited horizons of my taste buds.The rebuild has been a long and, at times, tense process. Scheduled to open in late 2024, thetimeline blew outby more than a year amid construction delays and negotiations with grandfathered seafood vendors,who only signed new leases a few months ago.View image in fullscreenSix million visitors are expected to flood through the market each year.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianView image in fullscreenCarmelo Lombardo (right) says the opening of the new market is a ‘proud moment’.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianAnyone who has visited the market at the former site, which was established in 1966, will no doubt be awed by the scale of the new space.Almost all retailers from theold fish markethave signed on for the new facility, which has been expanded to include 40 venders, some decidedly un-fishy. Come for your salmon, stay for flowers, pizza, bánh mì or artisan cheese.General manager Carmelo Lombardo has worked at Get Fish for more than three decades out of the old market and describes Monday as a “proud moment”. “I didn’t know myself coming into a state-of-the-art building such as this … it’s just amazing,” he says. “People are so excited to be here.”The new fish market is massive, jutting out of Sydney’s harbour like a monolith, with a 20,000 square metre checkered roof blanketing the storefronts and outdoor mezzanine areas.View image in fullscreenThe NSW government will spend $70m on transport options, including a $30m commuter ferry wharf.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianView image in fullscreenBy lunchtime on its opening day, the new market was at capacity.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianThe NSW government has spent $836m on the project and says it will spend another$70m on transport options, including a $30m commuter ferry wharf and $40m for an accessibility upgrade to the Wentworth Park light rail stop.Six million visitors are expected to flood through the market each year, and by lunchtime on its opening day, it was at capacity, with visitors told to return in the evening or the following day.First impressions from punters I spoke to varied, from awe and excitement to frustration over the high prices and current lack of public transport access.View image in fullscreenA family enjoying some prawns.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianView image in fullscreen‘It’s cheaper in Adelaide,’ says one visitor.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianBob from Adelaide, who was digging into a platter of prawns, has been going to the former fish market for five decades and came to Sydney specifically for the opening with his partner and daughter.Standing in front of stalls selling live king crab for $279 a kilogram or one live lobster for $194.99, Bob lamented the prices.“It’s cheaper in Adelaide, I can’t believe the cost of the crabs here,” he says. “In Adelaide you can get them for 20 bucks, or walk out and catch 20 crabs in an hour.”View image in fullscreenCaitlin Cassidy’s fish and chips ($17).Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianFortunately, not everything was so expensive. I enjoyed a tuna and a salmon nigiri for just $7.60 at Peter’s, and fish and chips at Big Fish for $17 – which was yummy, if a little cold (neither the fish nor chips were made to order).The premier, Chris Minns, told the press pack on Monday morning that foodies would travel “far and wide” to visit the upgraded market. But he added it was “really important” that whether people were coming for “caviar or crab sticks … this place will have something for everybody”.The crab legs ($38 for one) were out of my budget, though they did look delicious.Getting into the spirit of “something for everybody”, I attempted barbecue octopus and an oyster – two things I haven’t eaten in approximately a decade because they scare me. I didn’t realise octopus was extremely sentient until after my purchase and then felt very guilty, but at $18.50 for a small bowl at Fish Market Cafe it felt a shame to waste anything. It was delicious – fresh, smoky and a little sweet.View image in fullscreen‘Six Sydney Rock oysters set me back $16.50,’ Caitlin Cassidy writes.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianThe six Sydney Rock oysters at NicholasSeafood, which set me back $16.50, did not go down as smoothly. For a moment I feared I would be sick but managed to steady my nerves and swallow one down. My colleagues informed me they were delicious. I wouldn’t know – their texture and appearance repulse me.Robert and Brigitte had a different attitude, and were enjoying a dozen oysters at 8am. They flew in to Sydney from Darwin on a redeye flight on Monday morning and had planned to visit the former Sydney Fish Market as an early morning activity.“It was all closed, we didn’t know what was going on,” Robert says. “Then we saw this place, walk in here, get all these freebies and find out it only opened an hour ago.“It’s pretty impressive, smells a lot cleaner than the other place but who knows how long that’ll last.”View image in fullscreenRobert and Brigitte enjoy oysters after landing in Sydney just hours ago.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianDespite the fun fairground atmosphere, I felt a pang of nostalgia for the former site. Perhaps it was just that everything was so fresh and clean that it lacked a certain warmth and atmosphere, or perhaps it was the fact that the old building sat alone and sad, awaiting its inevitable demolition.As I gazed across the harbour, pondering the old site’s grime-covered umbrellas, I thought about humankind’s endless march for progress, for expansion, for largesse. I thought about the live lobsters sitting in their tiny tanks in the glittery new space, waiting to be consumed.And then I went back inside, and got excited by taiyaki waffles: a custard pastry shaped like a fish that I hadn’t come across since a trip to Japan last year. Maybe it was best to just eat, and not overthink.Explore more on these topicsSydneyNew South WalesSeafoodFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(The pieces may be rotated or reflected.)SolutionView image in fullscreen3. Pizza partyBelow is one way to divide three pizzas among five people. Three people get a 3/5 slice, and two get a 2/5 and a 1/5 slice. Another way would be to divide each pizza into five equal slices, with each person getting three.View image in fullscreenWhat’s the smallest number of pieces so that each person gets exactly the same numbers and sizes of pieces?SolutionTen pieces.

But it was just the escape I neededAnita ChaudhuriMon 19 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareYe Olde Swiss Cottage, London (closed 2025)Early in my career, I was going through a difficult chapter in work and life. Having moved down toLondonfrom Glasgow, I felt socially untethered, unsure of where I belonged. I yearned to feel part of a gang like I’d done back home, but I had no clue about how to find one.A bruising experience of redundancy hadn’t helped matters. In desperation, I’d taken a job on a business magazine writing about textile-industry share prices. At the time I barely knew a PE ratio from a wheel of brie. And by the time I left the following year, I still didn’t, for reasons that will become apparent.Fortunately, the three other young women I joined on the news desk were equally disenchanted. On my first day, a bloke with a basket of sandwiches did the rounds. These were wolfed down at speed, al desko. I’d barely swallowed the last crust when the trio hustled me out of the building. We dashed across north London’s multilane Finchley Road to a faux Swiss chalet plonked in the middle of a roundabout.View image in fullscreen‘Surreal hostelry’ … Ye Olde Swiss Cottage sign.Photograph: Greg Balfour Evans/AlamyThis surreal hostelry was Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, a former coaching inn that dates back to the 1830s. Gin and tonics swiftly ordered, my new deskmates filled me in on the office politics – the dos and don’ts, the scurrilous rumours. Evidently non-business chat was strongly discouraged by the glamorous but chilly editor. An anaesthetic was required to get us through long afternoons of pretending to work.The pub was draughty, grotty and peculiar. Maybe if they had gone the whole hog and offered fondue and glühwein, it would have worked. But a jukebox blasting out 1970s bangers, a migraine-inducing carpet and leaded windows did little to create alpine ambience. The outdoor beer garden could have been nice – if it didn’t basically overlook a motorway. However, the booze was cheap and the staff were cheery. It became our sanctuary.Workplace friendships can be great but, depending on the culture, they often benefit from space offsite to flourish. I’m sure that the pub’s absurd decor was an extra ingredient that helped us all to bond. The kind and loyal friendship offered by my colleagues proved transformative. Finally I was part of a wonderful, supportive group. They patiently listened to my frustrations and we cheered one another on in our tentative escape plans. Some of us remain friends to this day.I yearned to cover lifestyle and culture, but it felt beyond my reach. But in a funny way, the pub was to inspire my next move. Reading about its history and looking at the old photos on its walls triggered in me a new interest in the history of London’s venues. I began to view the city in a different way, and when I left that job to go freelance, I started writing about it. Not long afterwards, I got my dream job on Time Out magazine.

I have always chosen the ocean, where beauty is bountiful. Under the sea are hundreds of mini-worlds unbothered by life on the surface.Which is one reason why my friend suggested I get my scuba diving licence. The other was that diving was on the itinerary for an upcoming holiday. I’d never thought about being a certified diver before, but I was excited to have the ability to explore the big blue.My rookie era: peer pressure brought me to bouldering, then I found calm in ‘the way of the wall’Read moreIn order to do this, I needed to pass a theory and practical exam. As an alumna of Zoom university, my eyes glazed over upon opening the e-learning platform. But the words “decompression sickness”, “oxygen poisoning” and “death” had me sitting up. Who knew breathing underwater would involve more than just swimming with a tank of air on my back? High on fear, I passed the theory exam with flying colours.Learning about the gear was one thing, putting it on was another. Although I struggled to keep myself upright on land, my first practice session in the pool helped me adjust to having 20kg of equipment strapped to myself in the water, and helped quell fears raised by the online exam. It also didn’t hurt that I naturally took to a lot of the skills that many new divers struggle with, such as achieving neutral buoyancy – staying in one place without sinking or rising.Woman in red wetsuit enters the water at a beach‘Being surrounded by water was a reminder of how unnatural this all was.’I was ready to make my debut in Sydney’s Gordons Bay, the site of my practical exam. But once I was in the ocean, I was flooded with fear. With no place for my feet to touch down, the endlessness of the water made escape feel impossible. I’m noTom Cruise.I failed the last part of the practical test, which involved removing my mask, swimming a distance without it and putting it back on – all while underwater. Although I was only five metres deep, as soon as water started filling up in my mask I stopped breathing through my mouth and nervously held my breath. Being surrounded by water was a reminder of how unnatural this all was. Who was I to defy the limits of our terrestrial form? With the gear on my back, I desperately clawed my way up from the depths, committing the cardinal sin of scuba diving: rapidly ascending to the surface.The shame of failing stuck to me like my wetsuit. Later, when recounting the events of my weekend, the panic of being unable to breathe caught in my throat.View image in fullscreen‘In time I became less embarrassed about having failed.’Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianIn time, my anxiety around the water dissipated and I became less embarrassed about having failed. It would have been dangerous if I continued learning to dive as I kept shooting up to the surface, risking aforementioned sickness and death. But I also wouldn’t have enjoyed it. Aside from the actual swimming part, every scuba skill I practised in the ocean filled me with dread.Hobbiesare supposed to be fun, after all.I think back to the unsuccessful end to my test, when we finished the dive with a group swim around the bay. This was set to the echoey whoosh of my breathing and the low rumblings of the ocean.In those last 20 minutes I came to understand the beauty of silence. But I’m happy seeing the depths from the surface.Explore more on these topicsHobbiesMy rookie eraAustralian lifestyleDivingOceansMarine lifeDiving holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I needn’t have worriedRachel DixonMon 19 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareAuberge, central LondonWhen I walked into Auberge, a pub near Waterloo station in London, on Thursday 21 October 2021, I didn’t know a soul. By kicking-out time, I had 50 new friends. I’ve been back almost every Thursday since.On that fateful autumn night, I was at a bit of a low ebb. Recently single, hurtling towards 40 … To get out of my rut, I had signed up for a taster session with London City Voices, a pop choir. I knew how uplifting singing could be – I’d been in another choir pre-Covid – but the real draw was LCV’s post-rehearsal pub singalongs.Still, I was a bit nervous about the pub part. What if I ended up on my own in the corner? Not a chance – I’d never met a friendlier bunch. I got chatting to a man clutching a whole bottle of red wine and a single glass. “I just buy a bottle to save going back to the bar all the time,” Arasan explained. I realised I had found my people.An hour later, I was belting out Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive, then getting a second bottle of red to share with Arasan and another choir member, Maddy. Our Thursday wine club is still going strong today, and has expanded to nights in, days out and holidays together.View image in fullscreenRachel and Maddy drinking red wine in Auberge in 2023Photograph: Courtesy of Rachel DixonA few weeks ago, I missed choir rehearsal to go ice-skating with my friend Ellen. Afterwards, I took her along to Auberge. It felt like taking her through the wardrobe to Narnia; this ordinary pub is transformed into a magical place full of friendship, laughter and song. Being there is the highlight of my week (even in boring old dry January, when I reluctantly swap the red wine for alcohol-free beer).Not every pub would welcome a rowdy bunch of singers, but the staff at Auberge have the patience of saints, despite having to switch on the brightest lights and force us out of the door at closing time every week. We have our own area to sing in, get a discount on drinks, and even have a couple of groupies among the regulars.Customers often film us singing, give us a round of applause or drunkenly join in. Sometimes, there are couples who look like they’re on dates. I always feel a bit guilty for interrupting their quiet drink with our rousing mega musicals mashup, but I guess it makes for a funny first-date story.Speaking of which, after a few months of drinking at Auberge, I started to notice a choir member called Neil. Actually, he was hard to miss, with his loud tenor voice, exuberant dress sense and propensity to hug everyone in the pub after one too many pints of Guinness.We’ve been going out for nearly four years now. Cheers, Auberge.Explore more on these topicsPubsThe pub that changed meHobbiesFriendshipRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as concern over large language models builds, he’s no longer the outsider he once wasMon 19 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 06.12 ESTShareIf some time in an entirely possible future they come to make a movie about “how the AI bubble burst”, Ed Zitron will doubtless be a main character. He’s the perfect outsider figure: the eccentric loner who saw all this coming and screamed from the sidelines that the sky was falling, but nobody would listen. Just as Christian Bale portrayedMichael Burry, the investor who predicted the 2008 financial crash, inThe Big Short, you can well imagine Robert Pattinson fighting Paul Mescal, say, to portray Zitron, the animated, colourfully obnoxious but doggedly detail-oriented Brit, who’s become one of big tech’s noisiest critics.This is not to say the AI bubblewillburst, necessarily, but against a tidal wave of AI boosterism, Zitron’s blunt, brash scepticism has made him something of a cult figure. His tech newsletter,Where’s Your Ed At, now has more than 80,000 subscribers; his weekly podcast,Better Offline, is well within the Top 20 on the tech charts; he’s a regular dissenting voice in the media; and hissubreddithas become a safe space for AI sceptics, including those within the tech industry itself – one user describes him as “a lighthouse in a storm of insane hypercapitalist bullshit”.Zitron first started looking into generative AI in 2023, a year after the industry-shaking launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “The more I looked, the more confused I became, because on top of the fact that large language models (LLMs) very clearly did not do the things that people were excited about, they didn’t have any path to doing them either,” he says. “Nothing I found made any suggestion that this was a real business at all, let alone something that would supposedly change the world.”He’s talking over videocall from his office in Las Vegas, dressed in a red hoodie, surrounded by framed pop-culture prints and American sports memorabilia. And boy can Zitron talk. As listeners to Better Offline will know, the 39-year-old is a prodigious speaker – adept at extended monologues, putting his point of view across in accessible, often cheeky language, peppered with facts, statistics, analogies and a fair few expletives, in a London accent that only accentuates his position as a Silicon Valley contrarian – someone who drops his Ts when he says “datacentres”.Explaining Zitron’s thesis about why generative AI is doomed to fail is not simple: last year he wrotea 19,000-word essay, laying it out. But you could break it down into two, interrelated parts. One is the actual efficacy of the technology; the other is the financial architecture of the AI boom. In Zitron’s view, the foundations are shaky in both cases.First, there’s the matter of generative AI doing what it’s promised to do. Over the past few years we have had escalating prophecies of the technology laying waste to work as we know it. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic – OpenAI’s closest rival –warned in May last yearthat AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, for example. “The current generation of AI large language models will not be doing that,” Zitron says confidently. “My evidence is they’re basically the same as they were a year ago. They have the same efficacy. And every attempt they make to try to turn these into something that can actually do things autonomously has failed.” LLMs hallucinate and give wrong answers, they give different answers every time, they cannot reallylearn, or create, or perform a lot of complex tasks, he argues. He questions even describing this technology as “intelligence”.“It’s intelligent in the same way a pair of dice are intelligent,” he says. “Large language models are transformer-based architecture that use large-scale probability to generate the next token. Now they do this at scale, so you might think, ‘Oh, it’s coming up with things.’ No, it has a large corpus of data, and so many parameters that it pulls from to generate an output. That is all that is. We would not credit an Excel formula with intelligence, and we should not credit generative AI as intelligent.”Obviously, many people disagree with Zitron, especially when it comes to AI replacing jobs. In industries from film-making to customer service to government agencies to tech itself, insiders say AI tools are enabling them to do the same things with fewer people. Even if it doesn’t replace 50% of jobs, its effect on the workplace is likely to be transformative. A survey last June found that entry-level jobs haddropped by nearly a thirdin the UK since the launch of ChatGPT.Zitron argues that “correlation does not equal causation” and points to reports that suggest the role of machine learning in job cuts is either unproven or overstated. Arecent MIT reportinto the “state of AI in business in 2025”, for example, found that 95% of companies attempting to integrate AI in their businesses were getting “zero return”. “Most GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time,” it said.That leads to the second part of Zitron’s argument: that the economics of the AI boom just don’t stack up. The amounts of money pouring into AI investment are unlike anything the world has ever seen. The “magnificent seven” – Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft (which owns 27% of OpenAI), Nvidia and Tesla – currently make up34% of the S&P 500, the US stock market index that represents about 50% of the global market. As the dominant manufacturer of GPUs (graphics processing units – the extremely powerful chips on which AI depends), Nvidia is practically “printing money”, says Zitron, but at this stage everyone else is borrowing and spending billions they may never recover.View image in fullscreenUS chip maker Nvidia’s office in BengaluruPhotograph: Idrees Mohammed/AFP/Getty ImagesThis is the way Silicon Valley startups have always operated, you could say: operate at an initial loss with a view to establishing market share and reaping profits further down the line. But the current disparity between supply and demand is worryingly huge. When it comes to AI, you need to build big and spend big. A typical datacentre requires tens of thousands of GPUs, with each GPU costing upwards of $50,000 (£37,000). Then you need the software and networking to knit them all together, a giant building on a vast plot of land to put it all in, and huge amounts of electricity and water to run it all. The cost of 1GW of AI datacentre capacity isestimated at $35bn (£26bn). As such, the major players in this business are the deep-pocketed “hyperscalers” like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle.When you look at the demand side, the picture is less rosy, and a lot more hazy. OpenAI alone has committed tospending $1.4tn (£1tn)on AI infrastructure over the next five years, for example, but its revenue for 2025 is expected to be about $20bn (£15.8bn). There seems to be a constant carousel of deals and agreements between AI companies, but when you look at it, says Zitron, much of the time these companies are essentially paying each other. Nvidia, for example,announced a $100bn investment in OpenAIlast September; in return, OpenAI will use the cash to buy Nvidia chips. Similar deals abound in this space, as Zitron has forensically detailed. Even with non-magnificent seven “neocloud” companies, like CoreWeave, Lambda and Nebius, which build datacentres then rent out their GPU capacity to others, the bulk of their business is coming from the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia, Zitron says. “When you remove the hyperscalers, there’s less than a billion dollars total in AI compute revenue in 2025.”As for the profitability, ChatGPT now has an estimated 800 million users, but the vast majority of them are paying nothing. Even for paying subscribers, “when you connect a user to an AI model like GPT, each thing the user does varies in expense vastly. A user could ask a very simple question, or they could ask a question that the model interprets as needing a complex answer,” Zitron says. There are no economies of scale here; each question requires “compute” – as in computer processing activity – at the supplier’s expense. “The more someone is a power user of these platforms, the more they’re going to cost you. This is almost the inverse of how the valley works.” And if the answer is not satisfactory and must be reformulated, as is often the case, “that’s more compute burned, making you no extra money”. AI models are getting cheaper and more sophisticated all the time, we are told, but only by using more compute. “It’s like the price of petrol going down a bit, but you have to drive another 250 miles to get somewhere. So this is really problematic – because it means that there is no profitability point.”View image in fullscreenA typical datacentre requires tens of thousands of GPUs.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APAgain, none of this means the great AI crash will happen, but “if I’m wrong, I don’t know how I’m wrong,” he says. “Every counter I’ve read to my work is mostly just wishcasting of ‘and then the AI gets better’.”Many have accused Zitron of having an axe to grind against big tech, but he refutes that: “I have an axe to grind against those who don’t want to talk about reality.” He certainly doesn’t shy away from attention, but that’s not why he got into this business, he explains. “I like writing. I like pulling things apart. I like solving puzzles. I guess I like being able to understand things. A lot of this is just me trying to explain it to myself, rather than an audience.” He had no formal training in economics or computer science and has never worked in tech. “I’ve learned basically everything from the ground up.”Zitron has, it seems, always been technological though. He has built 10 personal computers over his lifetime, he says. It started when his father bought him a PC card with a dial-up connection when he was 10. “So I was online from quite an early age. I immediately was just like, ‘This is the future. I adore this. I love that I can talk to people and game with people.’ I was quite a solitary child. I didn’t have a lot of friends, but I made a lot of friends online.”Growing up in Hammersmith, west London, his parents were loving and supportive, Zitron says. His father was a management consultant; his mother raised him and his three elder siblings. But “secondary school was very bad for me, and that’s about as much as I’ll go into.” He has dyspraxia – a coordination disability – and he was diagnosed with ADHD in his 20s. “I think I failed every language and every science, and I didn’t do brilliant at maths,” he says. “But I’ve always been an asshole over the details.”After studying media and communications at Aberystwyth University, he began writing for gaming magazines, but “I got to a point where I was miserable in London.” So he relocated to New York in 2008 and began working in tech PR. He can’t contemplate returning to the UK, he says. He doesn’t talk about his personal life beyond saying he has a son, which is why he lives in Las Vegas. He doesn’t mind it there: “Everyone’s weird so no one’s weird.” It has been reported that he is twice married and twice divorced.Zitron continues to work in tech PR, which seems jarringly at odds with his career as a tech agitator – either like biting the hand that feeds him or a conflict of interest. He doesn’t see it like that. He doesn’t have AI clients, or work with big tech, he says, and only has a few clients now. The work has given him a network of contacts in the industry, and possibly helped him to market himself (in 2013 he published a book titled This Is How You Pitch: How To Kick Ass in Your First Years of PR). He may not be doing the PR stuff much longer, though. The media side of things is “making up more of my income these days than I ever expected it to”. He’s writing a new book, due out next year, called Why Everything Stopped Working. “It’s kind of a dig into how the world got the way it did and technology is everything now.” Just one chapter is about AI, he adds.If Zitron does have an axe to grind, it’s against neoliberal capitalism in general: “I don’t think people have taken seriously enough how bad deregulation of financial markets, by Thatcher, by Reagan, was. I don’t think people take seriously enough how bad it was not putting people in prison for the great financial crisis … I don’t think people have taken seriously the threat of growth-focused capitalism and growth at all cost.”Rather than leading us to a utopian future, Zitron sees AI as the logical conclusion of neoliberalism. “The biggest thing we’ve learned from the large language model generation is how many people are excited to replace human beings, and how many people just don’t understand labour of any kind,” he says.Zitron is no longer quite so alone in his assessment. He’s on the same page as Cory Doctorow, for example, who has appeared on his podcast, and whose “enshittification” thesis also alleges that tech companies are now more motivated by profit than making more useful products. Meanwhile, other AI sceptics, such as cognitive scientist Gary Marcus,complainthey have been making the same arguments as Zitron “but in his narrative, I don’t exist”. Either way, the backlash to AI is building: local groups are opposing the construction of environmentally destructive datacentres; consumers are grating against the insertion of AI into every conceivable product; creators are taking legal action against the industry’s theft of their work; there is public outrage over social media harms, epitomised by Elon Musk’s Grok creatingnonconsensual borderline-deepfake porn.View image in fullscreenZitron on stage at the Web Summit 2024 in Lisbon.Photograph: Carlos Rodrigues/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, speculation about the AI bubble bursting continues to grow. Now everyone from theBank of EnglandtoMicrosoft boss Satya Nadellaare raising the alarm. Michael “Big Short” Burry says he isbetting against Nvidia, and recently the New York Times ran an op-ed speculating thatOpenAI will run out of moneywithin the next 18 months. It could be sooner than that, Zitron thinks: this month, the big tech companies start reporting their annual earnings for 2025. Most of them have been cagey about their revenues from AI specifically, he says. “Why would they do that? Well, because they’re not very big. So this whole thing is – to use a phrase I hate – it is avibe.” If something serious happens, like Nvidia missing its targets, it could prompt a rethink of the whole sector, and possibly a new global financial crisis. All those datacentres might well end up as empty shells. Ultimately, we could be witnessing “the largest laser-tag arena construction of all time,” he jokes.Zitron doesn’t actually enjoy being contrarian, he insists. “It isn’t fun being alone in an idea, which is actually why I think a lot of people are pro-AI, because it’s much easier to do that.”He doesn’t hate tech, or even AI, he says. “I love technology, but I hate what the tech industry is doing … If you can’t critique this stuff without it being claimed that you don’t support the world or innovation, I think you realise we’re in this weird peasant economy where even wealthy, well-to-do famous people have to kneel at the feet of these companies. And these companies have done very little to make our lives better, all while making so much more money than we will ever have.”He just wants to tell it like it is. “It’d be much easier to just write mythology and fan fiction about what AI could do. What I want to do is understand the truth.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)The big interviewComputinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

There is a hangman’s noose with a figure dangling next to the word “migrant” and, close by, another daubing: a Jewish Star of David painted in black surrounded by red swastikas.Utopia 56, a French group supporting migrants in northern France,postedthe image on X on Christmas Day with the comment: “This is what comes from normalising the extreme right’s rhetoric, a visible, unapologetic, unabashed hatred.”It is not known who was responsible for the graffiti. But one thing is clear: it comes after a period of growing activity on French soil byfar-right British activists, some of whom have harassed and intimidated asylum seekers in the places where they sleep, or boasted of slashing dinghies to prevent crossings. And to many of those who work to support asylum seekers in northern France, that activity has been hothoused by the rightward shift of mainstream British politics.“The reason why they’re coming out and doing this stuff is because they’re emboldened,” said Lachlan Macrae, of the groupCalaisFood Collective. He said his group had found water containers stabbed, or with soap poured in to render the water undrinkable. “They come with bulletproof vests and they go on to the beaches. They’ve been harassing people and streaming this content. As the ground is ceded to the far right, the far right has grown in response. Far-right groups in Calais are the norm now.”French groups supporting asylum seekers also say that water tanks, which they provide for asylum seekers who have difficulty accessing other sources of water, are being vandalised and damaged, making them unusable.Asylum seekers who have had unwelcome visits to their sleeping spaces by far-right activists have insisted that although they are fearful, they refuse to rise to the bait when the activists goad them.While hostility from far-right agitators in northernFrancewhere migrants are camped is not a new phenomenon, unwelcome visits from British anti-migrant campaigners have increased in the last 18 months.The first signs were in the summer of 2024, when Alan Leggett, who styles himself as Active Patriot, was pictured striding along French beaches calling for an end to Channel crossings.View image in fullscreenThe campaigns of intimidation have seemingly done little to deter people seeking to cross the Channel by small boat.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesHe was followed last summer by activists from the far-right UK Independence party (Ukip), including its leader, Nick Tenconi, who filmed themselves in Calais confronting mainly Sudanese asylum seekers living in a squatted warehouse and intimidating advocacy groups who defended the asylum seekers.In November last year, the phenomenon kicked up a gear. Raise the Colours, the Birmingham-based anti-migrant group that has draped union jack and England flags on lamp-posts and street furniture across Britain, launched Operation Overlord, a series of trips to France to “stop the boats” which Daniel Thomas, a key figure in the organisation at the time, said was “for our grandfathers, for our families and above all for our children”.In the last few days, Thomas and Raise the Colours have parted company. Thomas continues to organise around action to “stop the boats” using the title Operation Overlord, prompting Raise the Colours to rename its northern France activities Operation Stop the Boats. They do not appear to have parted on good terms.Named after the Normandy landings on D-day in 1944, Operation Overlord, when part of Raise the Colours, circulated appeals for stab-proof vests, plate carriers, high-powered torches, thermal cameras, drones and encrypted radios. Raise the Colours sought to recruit people online with an 11-page form described as a “volunteer pre-screen application”. One man who said he was ex-army posted a call on Facebook to “ex-squaddies” to go and patrol the French beaches 24/7.‘We can’t eat. We can’t sleep. It’s a disaster’: the small boat detainees waiting to be sent back to FranceRead moreRaise the Colours has livestreamed footage of activists harassing asylum seekers waiting to cross the Channel. It has also posted videos of activists holding up deflated dinghies that they claim to have slashed, thus directly preventing some Channel crossings. However, some French NGOs supporting asylum seekers in northern France say that the dinghies had already been abandoned in sand dunes when Raise the Colours found them. The anti-fascist media organisation Searchlightpostedvideo footage of some members of Raise the Colours running away in northern France, although it is not clear who they were running from.On Wednesday last week, France’s interior ministryissued a statement banning10 unnamed far-right activists associated with Raise the Colours for “having carried out actions on French soil”. But Raise the Colours says it has recruited 22,000 people to support stopping the boats in northern France. Even assuming the numbers willing to travel to northern France will be significantly smaller, it raises questions about how effective the French ban on 10 activists will be. The current ban does not apply to anyone else who might attempt the same thing.So far there is no indication that the ban has acted to deter the far right from harassing asylum seekers in northern France more broadly. Tenconi, as well as speedily rising through the ranks to lead Ukip, is chief operating officer at Turning Point, the UK offshoot of the US organisation founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last year.In parallel to Raise the Colours’ Operation Overlord, Ukip has set up a “border protection mission”. Under that banner, Tenconi was filmed on a visit to France last June wearing black boots and gloves and shouting “fuck you” to asylum seekers.During another visit last year, Tenconi and his associates shone torches in the faces of asylum seekers sleeping in the open air. They started chanting “you shall not pass”. Footage of the incident showed the asylum seekers looking startled and fearful.There is no evidence that these visits have deterred people from coming to the UK, with more than 41,000crossingthe Channel in 2025, the second highest annual figure since crossings began in 2018. Steve Smith, the CEO of Care4Calais, said: “The vile harassment and threatening behaviour of these far-right actors is appalling, but let’s be clear, they’re achieving nothing other than gathering social media views.”At the moment there is no absolute ban on far-right activists travelling to France to intimidate asylum seekers, and the UK Home Office has so far declined to comment on whether government or police in the UK are taking any action against those who have already done so.Instead A Home Office spokesperson said:“This government is bearing down on small boat crossings.We have stopped 40,000 crossing attempts since this Government came into office through our joint work with the French. We have detained and removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally. Our pilot deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.”So far in 2026, 520 people have crossed the Channel in nine boats, a significant number despite poor weather conditions that is likely to rise as the weather improves. And now that Thomas has split from Raise the Colours and is continuing Operation Overlord under different management, a new rivalry on the UK far right may only increase the headaches for the French government.Ukip’s crowdfunder for its “border protection force” is still receiving donations, while Thomas is promising to put small teams in France in various locations on 24 January. In a rambling video post, he states of the French government: “Clearly we have rattled them very very severely.” He adds: “We are going to send people into France by air, land and sea. They will be given information about where to go.”Raise the Colours’ rebranded operation in northern France, meanwhile, boasts of having military and data experts to assist it “to successfully assemble the biggest pushback ever seen by ordinary people”. The group adds: “This is an organised mission that will carry on until we have the final result of stopping the boats.”Explore more on these topicsThe far rightMigrationFranceCalaisEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since 2020, their collective wealth grew by 81%, or $8.2tn, which the charity claims would be enough to eradicate global poverty 26 times over.But the authors reported that most governments were failing ordinary people by capitulating to the increasingly blatant influence of the rich.Line graph showing rise in billionaires' wealth since 2014 – from about $8tn to $18tnThe past 12 months have seenyouth-led uprisingsagainst inequality across countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. But protests over corruption, austerity, unemployment and high living costs have routinely been ignored and instead harshly put down by governments, said Max Lawson, co-author of the report.“Governments worldwide are making the wrong choice; choosing to defend wealth, not freedom. Choosing the rule of the rich. Choosing to repress their people’s anger at how life is becoming unaffordable and unbearable, rather than redistributing wealth from the richest to the rest,” said Lawson.View image in fullscreenSocial justice activist Wanjira Wanjiru in Nairobi’s Mathare slum. ‘When people are oppressed, they always rebel.’Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images“The economically rich are becoming politically rich the world over, able to shape and influence politics, societies and economies,” he said. “In the past, rich people were perhaps more coy about pulling the levers of power, but it’s becoming more and more brazen, this kind of marriage between money and politics.”InKenya, the social activist Wanjira Wanjiru said the effects of inequality were most apparent where she worked in Mathare, a slum in Nairobi where many people lacked access to clean water and sanitation facilities but where an adjacent golf club had sprinklers constantly running to maintain the greens and fairways.Line graph showing billions of people living with moderate or severe food insecurity, rising from about 1.5bn in 2014 to 2.3bn in 2024She said the Kenyan government had capitulated to the wealthy in east Africa by imposingausterity measures on education and healthcare, while businesses received tax exemptions.But Wanjiru remained optimistic about there being a backlash against this trend, with younger people, especially those from developing countries, successfully rising up to challenge the influence of the rich over politics,as Kenyans have in protestslast year and in 2024.“I’m actually hopeful because the natural reaction will be to force systems to work for the people. We are getting to a point where we really can’t take it any more,” said Wanjiru. “When people are oppressed, they always rebel.”View image in fullscreenBusiness and politics mix as leading tech tycoons (from left) Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk attend Donald Trump’s inauguration.Photograph: GettyNepal saw just suchan uprising in September 2025, with several days of protests driven by anger over corruption leading to the unseating of the government.Among the targets of that anger was Binod Chaudhary, Nepal’s only billionaire and a member of parliament whosebusinesses and properties were burned down.What drove gen Z protests that brought down governments and called out corruption? Five activists explainRead morePradip Gyawali, a Nepali political consultant who took part in the protests, said: “There were so many cases of politicians taking money from businessmen to work in their favour. We protested against them because the ordinary people had to work so hard for little reward [while the rich benefited].“[Our protest] was a message that this is a new revolution, not only in our country but the whole world, that the youth should have their say and some power in politics.”Lawson and his co-author, Harry Bignell, said the rich were more open than ever about using wealth for political influence, in part through control over the media but also by taking office themselves or through donating to political campaigns.Their research estimated that billionaires were 4,000 times more likely than an ordinary person to hold political office, while more than half of the world’s media companies and nine of the top 10 social media platforms are owned by billionaires.According toOxfam, research from the US has shown that if the rich support a policy, it has a 45% chance of being adopted compared with an 18% chance if they oppose it.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentInequalityInequality and developmentOxfamProtestGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He had bloodstained clothing.Barrio 18 and its rival gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) are blamed for much of the drug trafficking and criminal violence that plagues the Central American country.Washington has declared both groups to beterrorist organisations.Since Saturday morning, inmates had been holding 45 guards and a psychiatrist hostage to protest against the transfer of gang leaders to a maximum-security prison.The police and the army also freed 28 hostages at the Fraijanes II prison and another nine at Preventivo, east of and on the outskirts of the Guatemalan capital, respectively.According to Arevalo, there had not been “a single casualty” during these operations.The defence minister, Henry Saenz, said the army would “remain on the streets” to continue “dismantling” criminal groups.Guatemala’s homicide rate in 2025 was 16.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than double the global average.Explore more on these topicsGuatemalaGangsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

This year, the governmentallocated90bn yuan (£9.65bn) for its first nationwide childcare subsidy programme, for children aged under three. There are also plans to expand national healthcare insurance to cover all childbirth related expenses, including IVF treatment.But young people still feel that it is too expensive to have children, especially in a time of high unemployment and slowing economic growth. “Given the current environment, it is a miracle that anyone is willing to have kids at all,” wrote one Weibo user.The average cost of raising a child in China until the age of 18 is 538,000 yuan – more than 6.3 times as high as its GDP per capita, compared with 4.11 times in the US or 4.26 times in Japan,according toa Chinese population research thinktank. The cost is even higher in Chinese cities.Decades of a one-child policy mean that the current generation of adults who are at child-bearing age are socially conditioned to favour single-child households. The effects of the policy, which was lifted in 2017, mean that the pool of people of child-bearing age is also shrinking, as China’s population rapidly ages.View image in fullscreenWomen push baby strollers through Beijing. The cost of childcare in urban centres is thought to be one factor in the declining fertility rate.Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesThis year, China alsoremoved condoms from the list of VAT-exempt items, meaning that they will be slapped with a 13% tax rate, raising concerns that the government is trying to make it harder to avoid pregnancy. Free contraceptives are still available through government-funded programmes. But many internet users in China predicted that the birthrate would continue to fall in future.China’s death rate of 8.04 for every 1,000 members of the population in 2025 was the highest since 1968.The population has been shrinking since 2022and is ageing rapidly, complicating Beijing’s plan to increase domestic consumption and rein in debt.Over-60s account for about 23% of the total population, according to NBS data. By 2035, the number of people older than 60 is predicted to reach 400 million – roughly equal to the populations of the US and Italy combined – meaning hundreds of millions of people are likely to leave the workforce at a time when pension budgets are already stretched.24:14Frozen in Time: the motherhood dilemma for single women in ChinaChina has already raised retirement ages, with men now expected to work until 63 rather than 60, and women until 58 rather than 55.Marriages in China plunged by a fifth in 2024, the steepest drop on record, with more than 6.1 million couples registering, down from 7.68 million in 2023. Marriages are typically a leading indicator for birthrates in China.Demographers say a decision in May 2025 to allow couples to marry anywhere in the country, rather than only their place of residence, is likely to lead to a temporary increase in births.Marriages rose 22.5% year on year to 1.61 million in the third quarter of 2025, putting China on course to halt an almost decade-long annual decline. Full data for 2025 will be released later this year.Authorities are also trying to promote “positive views on marriage and childbearing” as they seek to counter the long-term effects of the one-child policy, which was in force from 1980 to 2015 and helped reduce poverty but reshaped Chinese society.China’s economy hit growth target last year despite Trump trade war and property crisisRead morePopulation movement has compounded the demographic challenge, with large numbers of people moving from rural areas to cities, where raising children is more expensive. China’s urbanisation rate was 68% in 2025, up from about 43% in 2005.Policymakers have made population planning a significant part of the country’s economic strategy. This year, Beijing faces potential costs of about 180bn yuan ($25.8bn/£19.3bn) to increase births, according to Reuters estimates.Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of the nationalist tabloid the Global Times, wrote on Weibo that provincial leaders should be judged on the birthrates for their regions, as well as GDP performance. “Once this indicator is included, the attention transferred from the government to society will undergo a qualitative leap,” Hu wrote.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at about one birth for every woman, well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other east Asian countries including Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore have similarly low levels of fertility at about 1.1 births for every woman.China’s pool of women of reproductive age – defined by the UN as women aged from 15 to 49 – is forecast to shrink by more than two-thirds to fewer than 100 million by the end of the century.Additional research by Lillian Yang.

I want the people to decide directly whether they can entrust the management of the country to me.”The next lower house poll was not due until October 2028, but Takaichi appears confident she can use her personal popularity to reverse the Liberal Democratic party’s (LDP) recent run ofpoor election results.The LDP and its former junior coalition partner Komeito lost their majorities in the powerful lower house in October 2024 and in theupper houselast July, forcing Takaichi to forge a fragile partnership with the populistJapan Innovation party, which shares many of her conservative views, when she became prime minister in October.After making an encouraging start to her premiership during meetings withDonald Trumpand the Chinese leader,Xi Jinping, Takaichi later angered Beijing by suggesting Japan could becomemilitarily involvedin any conflict between China and Taiwan if its own security were threatened.View image in fullscreenTakaichi with Donald Trump during their visit to the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at a US base in Yokosuka, Japan.Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/APChina claims Taiwan as a province and has said it is preparing for possible annexation by force, with US intelligence assessments in recent years indicating Beijing aims to be capable of invasion by 2027.Takaichi’s refusal to withdraw the remark hasbolstered her supportamong voters, but despite strong approval ratings, her decision to call an early election carries significant risks.A prolonged dispute with China – which has urged its citizens not to travel toJapan, leading to cancelled meetings and events – could have negative repercussions for Japan’s export-led economy.This month, China banned exports to Japan’s military of so-called dual-use items, a move Takaichi has said violates international protocols. Dual-use items are goods, software or technologies with civilian and ‍military applications. Beijing has said its ban will apply only to Japanese military firms.Domestically, the LDP – which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the mid-1950s – faces scrutiny over a lingeringpolitical funding scandaland therising cost of living. A poll released by the public broadcaster NHK last week found 45% of respondents cited prices as their main concern, followed by diplomacy and national security at 16%.View image in fullscreenShoppers in Shibuya district, Tokyo. The coalition is weighing a two-year freeze on the 8% food consumption tax.Photograph: Aflo/ShutterstockIn response, the coalition is considering suspending the 8% consumption tax on food items for two years. Media reports have also suggested Takaichi may seek to ban on political fundraisers by ministers in an effort to ease public anger over the widespread use of slush funds by party MPs.An advocate of big spending to boost Asia’s second-biggest economy, Takaichi said at the weekend that she had instructed ministers to ensure the implementation of a supplementary budget for the fiscal year, which runs through March, and secure parliamentary approval for next year’s budget.The coalition’s razor-thin majority also faces a fresh challenge from a new party formed this month through a merger between the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party of Japan (CDPJ) and the LDP’s former coalition partner, Komeito.Speaking at the launch of the Centrist Reform Alliance on Monday, the CDPJ’s secretary general, Jun Azumi, said the new party would “reflect a centrist approach aimed at moving from divisive, confrontational politics to one of coexistence and inclusion”.A strong indication that Takaichi was preparing to seek her first public mandate as prime minister came earlier this month, when she wrote on X: “I made a fresh determination as a leader who must fulfil the heavy responsibility of leading Japan.”She noted that she had visited a memorial to her political mentor, the late prime minister Shinzo Abe, who wasassassinated in July 2022in Nara prefecture, where Takaichi has her constituency.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsJapanSanae TakaichiAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Household spending accounts for under 40% of annual economic output, unusual for a country of China’s income level and against a global average of 60%.As part of efforts to boost the economy, last year the Chinese government provided 300bn yuan ($43bn) in subsidies to households that traded in old appliances for new ones.While that scheme will be extended into this year, analysts at Moody’s Analytics said the start of 2026 “brings a sense of deja vu to China’s economic debate”.“Once again, officials are promising stronger support to lift confidence and stabilise growth. And once again, households and businesses are wondering whether action will match the rhetoric.”Trump has signalled he is intent on continuing the tariff war,threatening to impose additional tariffson eight European countries in an increasingly aggressive attempt to claim Greenland on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsChinese economyChinaAsia PacificGlobal economyInternational tradeEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

If it does, one group likely to be grateful is those who work in the British embassy’s dilapidated building in Beijing. The UK’s plans to redevelop its outpost in China’s capital have beenblocked for yearsby the Chinese government because of the London embassy row.The wrangling has “enabled Beijing to raise the embassy controversy to block whatever requests London has made that Beijing is not comfortable about,” said Steve Tsang, the director of the SoasChinaInstitute.Beijing has made the embassy issue apriority in the UK-China relationship. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, raised the matter directly with Keir Starmer in their first phone call, in August 2024.The process ending this week started in 2018 when China paid £255m for the site of the Royal Mint Court near the Tower of London, a prestigious piece of real estate, on which to build a sprawling diplomatic complex that would be its biggest in Europe. The deal was brokered by Eddie Lister, a close aide to Boris Johnson, at a time when Johnson was serving as foreign secretary. The Guardianrevealedlast year that Johnson wrote to Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat, to directly assure him the embassy plans would be approved.The plans ran into trouble when Tower Hamlets council refused planning permission. The government declined to intervene and the application expired. Officials in Beijing were gobsmacked that state-to-state relations could be impeded by a local authority, an outcome unimaginable in China.Tsang said: “The subsequent complications came to be seen as bad faith on the part of London. I doubt that [China] would have taken huge offence if the initial plan was rejected outright.”Prof Kerry Brown, the director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London, said China “felt they had an understanding that they bought this £250m place to use as an embassy … if there were going to be issues, they could have been told then.”Brown said the saga reflected a UK government that was “hot and cold on China”. “What was originally a relatively straightforward issue has become symbolically quite difficult,” he said.China reapplied for permission to build its embassy soon after Labour entered government. Ministers called in the decision, taking it out of the hands of the council, after Xi raised the matter directly with Starmer.View image in fullscreenThere have been regular protests outside the Royal Mint Court site.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe decision has been delayed several times, but the application iswidely expected to be approvedahead of a 20 January deadline. MPs from across the political spectrum have voiced their opposition to the application, although the security services believe they can handle therisks of espionagethat may stem from the enlarged site, which sits close to data cables that run to the City of London.The green light would smooth relations before Starmer’s visit to China, which is expected to take place at the end of January, but officials insist there has been no political input in the planning process.Still, British and Chinese officials have described the decision as the key that could unlock further relations.If Starmer goes to Beijing as expected, he will be the first UK prime minister to make the trip since 2018. On that trip, Theresa May signed new deals with China worth £9bn. A similar flurry would be a coup for Starmer after the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s trip to China last year, which was received with much fanfare but resulted in just £600m of agreements.Brown said that if the embassy application was rejected, many other aspects of the UK-China relationship, such as cooperation on AI, would be impeded. “China is a big player that has other options. Britain is more modest,” he said.There are still a host of other headaches in the UK-China relationship. The UK is reeling from an alleged spying scandal in which a case against two men accused of spying for China wasdropped at the last minute, prompting an outcry and galvanising the UK’s China hawks.China’s ambassador in the UK, Zheng Zeguang, is banned from parliament because of Chinese sanctions placed on MPs. The British citizen and pro-democracy activistJimmy Laihas been convicted on national security charges in Hong Kong in proceedings described by the UK as politically motivated. He faces spending the rest of his life in prison, with a sentence due to be announced in the coming weeks.Approving the embassy application will not be the end of the matter. Local residents are crowdfunding to raise money for legal fees to challenge any approval. Local people have partnered with members of the Chinese diaspora, including Hongkongers, Tibetans and Uyghurs, who say they feel threatened by an enlarged Chinese presence in London. There have been regular protests outside the Royal Mint Court site.Brown said the embassy would be a “perpetual sore” in UK-China relations. “It won’t go away. What you need is a consistent, robust government position on this that will get through that.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “It is a normal feature of diplomatic relations for countries to maintain embassies – we have embassies worldwide, including in Beijing. It goes without saying that national security has been a priority through this process. In terms of process, the decision will be made independently by the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, and the department have set out that a decision will be made on or by 20 January.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyForeign policyLondonChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

A long perimeter fence is lined with countless coils of razor wire, and in a layby, a police patrol car monitors visitors to the beach – one of the few locations with a clear view of the reactors, framed by a snowy Mount Yoneyama.When all seven of its reactors are working, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa generates 8.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power millions of households. Occupying 4.2 sq km of land in Niigata prefecture on theJapanSea coast, it is the biggest nuclear power plant in the world.Since 2012, however, the plant has not generated a single watt of electricity, after being shut down, along with dozens of other reactors, in the wake of the March 2011triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl.Located about 220km (136 miles) north-west of Tokyo, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is run by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the same utility in charge of the Fukushima facility when a powerful tsunami crashed through its defences, triggering a power outage that sent three of its reactors into meltdown and forcing 160,000 people to evacuate.View image in fullscreenThe Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianWeeks before the 15th anniversary of the accident, and the wider tsunami disaster that killed an estimated 20,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast, Tepco is set to defy local public opinion and restart one of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s seven reactors.On Monday, Tepco said it would delay the restart, originally scheduled for the following day, after an alarm malfunctioned during a test of equipment over the weekend, according to public broadcaster NHK. The reactor is now expected to go back online in the coming days, NHK added.Restarting reactor No 6, which could boost the electricity supply to the Tokyo area by about 2%, will be a milestone in Japan’s slow return to nuclear energy, a strategy its government says will help the country reach its emissions targets and strengthen its energy security.But for many of the 420,000 people living within a 30km (19-mile) radius of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa who would have to evacuate in the event of a Fukushima-style incident, Tepco’s imminent return to nuclear power generation is fraught with danger.View image in fullscreenRyusuke Yoshida: ‘The evacuation plans are obviously ineffective.’Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianThey include Ryusuke Yoshida, whose home is less than a mile and a half from the plant in the sleepy village of Kariwa. Asked what worries him most about the restart, the 76-year-old has a simple answer. “Everything,” he says, as waves crash on to the shore, the reactors looming in the background.“The evacuation plans are obviously ineffective,” adds Yoshida, a potter and member of an association of people living closest to the facility. “When it snows in winter the roads are blocked, and a lot of people who live here are old. What about them, and other people who can’t move freely? This is a human rights issue.”Location mapThe utility company says it has learned the lessons of the Fukushima Daiichi accident, and earlier this year pledged to invest 100 bn yen (£470m) into Niigata prefecture over the next 10 years in an attempt to win over residents.The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, whose 6,000 staff have remained on duty throughout the long shutdown, has seawalls and watertight doors to provide stronger protection against a tsunami, while mobile diesel-powered generators and a large fleet of fire engines are ready to provide water to cool reactors in an emergency. Upgraded filtering systems have been installed to control the spread of radioactive materials.“The core of the nuclear power business is ensuring safety above all else, and the understanding of local residents is a prerequisite,” says Tatsuya Matoba, a Tepco spokesperson.That is the one hurdle residents say Tepco has failed to overcome after local authorities ignored calls for a prefectural referendum to determine the plant’s future. In the absence of a vote, anti-restart campaigners point to surveys showing clear opposition to putting the reactor back online.View image in fullscreenA sign urges residents to evacuate to a nearby golf course or temple in the event of a tsunami.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianThey include a prefectural government poll conducted late last year in which more than 60% of people living within 30km of the plant said they did not believe the conditions for restarting the facility had been met.“We take the results of the prefectural opinion survey very seriously,” Matoba adds. “Gaining understanding and trust from local residents is an ongoing process with no end point, that requires sincerity and continuous effort.”Kazuyuki Takemoto, a member of the Kariwa village council, says seismic activity in this region of north-west Japan means it is impossible to guarantee the plant’s safety.“But there has been no proper discussion of that,” says Takemoto, 76. “They say that safety improvements have been made since the Fukushima disaster, but I don’t think there is any valid reason to restart the reactor. It’s beyond my comprehension.”View image in fullscreenKazuyuki Takemoto, a member of the Kariwa village council, opposes the reactor restart. ‘It used to be said that nuclear power was necessary, safe and cheap … We now know that was an illusion.’Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian‘The priority should be to protect people’s lives’Just weeks before the planned restart, the nuclear industry attracted fresh criticism after it emerged that Chubu Electric Power, a utility in central Japan, hadfabricated seismic risk dataduring a regulatory review, conducted before a possible restart, of two reactors at its idle Hamaoka plant.“When you look at what’s happened with Hamaoka, do you seriously think it’s possible to trust Japan’s nuclear industry?” Takemoto says. “It used to be said that nuclear power was necessary, safe and cheap … We now know that was an illusion.”Adding to local concerns are the presence of seismic faults in and around the site, which sustained damage during a 6.8-magnitude offshore earthquake in July 2007, including a fire that broke out in a transformer. Three reactors that were in operation at the time shut down automatically.The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa restart is a gamble for Japan’s government, which has put an ambitious return to nuclear power generation at the centre of its new energy policy as it struggles to reach its emissions targets and bolster its energy security.Before the Fukushima disaster, 54 reactors were in operation, supplying about 30% of the country’s power. Now, of 33 operable reactors, just 14 are in service, while attempts to restart others have faced strong local opposition.Now, 15 years after the Fukushima meltdown, criticism of the country’s “nuclear village” of operators, regulators and politicians has shifted to this snowy coastal town.Pointing out one of the many security cameras near the plant, Yoshida says the restart has been forced on residents by the nuclear industry and its political allies. “The local authorities have folded in the face of immense pressure from the central government,” he says.“The priority of any government should be to protect people’s lives, but we feel like we have been deceived. Japan’s nuclear village is alive and well. You only have to look at what’s happening here to know that.”Explore more on these topicsJapanNuclear powerNuclear wasteEnergy (Environment)Asia PacificEnergy (Technology)featuresShareReuse this content"

While the state environment minister said the new extension would contribute to NSW’s emissions reductions, climate advocates described it as a “disaster” for emissions targets.Inside Eraring, the giant coal-fired power station that escaped a 2025 death sentenceRead moreIn a statement on Tuesday morning, the environment minister, Penny Sharpe, confirmed Origin had notified the NSW government, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and the AustralianEnergyMarket Operator (Aemo) that it would operate Eraring until April 2029. All four units of the power station will continue to be used.“Origin’s decision gives certainty to workers, the market and energy consumers across the state, as well as contributing to NSW’s 2030 emissions reduction target,” said Sharpe.“My number one job is keeping the lights on and putting downward pressure on power prices. NSW is making real progress replacing ageing coal-fired power stations. Since the election, we have increased the amount of renewable energy capacity in operation by almost 70%. That’s equivalent to Eraring’s capacity.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe decision comes after Aemo’s Transition Plan for System Security, released last month, warned of energy grid “strength deficits across New South Wales” for 2027-28 under Eraring’s previous retirement date.Sharpe said current energy security projections showed NSW would have sufficient energy supply when Eraring closes in 2029, “thanks to new renewable generation and storage coming online”.Origin’s chief executive, Frank Calabria, said the decision to keep Eraring open would “provide more time for renewables, storage and transmission projects to be delivered, and reflects uncertainty regarding the reliability of Australia’s ageing coal and gas fleet”.“Good progress is being made on the delivery of new energy infrastructure including major transmission works and projects like our large-scale battery at Eraring, but it has become clear Eraring power station will need to run for longer to support secure and stable power supply,” he told the ASX on Tuesday.The NSW Greens said the move was a “disaster for NSW and Australia’s climate targets”. The party’s environment spokesperson, Abigail Boyd, said “keeping any coal power station open longer is a cost-of-living and human health disaster”.“Despite persistent warnings that NSW is already not on track to achieve our legislated climate targets, the NSW Labor government has been continuing on a business-as-usual trajectory.”Boyd claimed a further two years of full production “of 16TWh” at Eraring would “contribute to taking us upwards of 50% further away from our legislated emissions reduction targets each year of operation, or around 3.5% of our total emissions budget”.The state government has legislated emissions reductions targets of 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, 70% by 2035, and net zero by 2050.Jeff Angel, of the advocacy group the Total Environment Centre, acknowledged the difficulties of the energy transition and noted the government was not offering further finanical assistant to the plant, but said the “decision increases the urgency to act faster on the green energy future”.“How will the government do that?”The NSW opposition said the announcement “provides a reprieve for the state’s energy security” but claimed it showed a “broader failure” by the Minns government to secure the “social license” for the renewables transition.“We have seen project after project delayed, while regional communities are being ignored and steamrolled by a government that doesn’t listen.”Origin said the extension is not expected to affect its 2030 emissions reductions targets and 2050 net zero plans. The 2,880MW black coal plant on the shores of Lake Macquarie has been fully operational since 1984.About half of the national electricity grid is powered by black coal-fired power stations such as Eraring.– with AAPExplore more on these topicsEnergyNew South WalesNew South Wales politicsCoalFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

A member of highway patrol met an ambulance en route to the hospital to give the ambulance crew extra blood that was needed on the way.The man was given 13 units of blood while being transported.“This is something that doesn’t happen a lot, and that is going to be something that is going to give him the best chance of surviving,” Marks said. She noted a NSW ambulance doctor happened to be swimming at the beach during the attack and was part of the initial effort to treat the man.“Everything that the people have done together and the agencies that have worked together is the best chance of survival for this patient.”Beaches in the area remain closed on Tuesday morning.“All beaches on the northern beaches are closed until further notice, and this will be reviewed on an ongoing basis,” police had said on Monday.View image in fullscreenNSW ambulance officers treat a shark attack victim at Manly beach in Sydney on Monday.Photograph: Cristen BoormanIt comes after an 11-year-old surfer had his board bitten by a shark at Dee Why just a few kilometres away, and one day aftera 12-year-old boy was attackedwhile swimming in Sydney Harbour in the eastern suburbs.The 11-year-old was surfing at Dee Why beach on Monday morning when a shark bit his board several times, taking a chunk out of the mid-section.The surfer was unharmed and helped by others out of the water.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailNorthern Beaches council lifeguards immediately sounded the alarm, erected shark warning signs and dispatched a jetski to patrol the water.

The 13-year-old boy remained in hospital in a critical condition after surgery with injuries to both legs.Extra fresh water in the harbour after recent heavy rain, combined with the splashing effect from people jumping off a rock face, created a “perfect storm” for Sunday’s shark attack, Supt Joseph McNulty said.“I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,” he told reporters before the Dee Why incident was reported.Heavy swell had also prevented the operation of smart drumlines, which notify authorities of shark activity along most of the NSW coast since Sunday.View image in fullscreenA sign at Nielsen Park in Vaucluse on Monday tells people to swim inside the net enclosure.

The UK would prefer a “calm discussion” with allies, he added.However, Downing Street sources suggested Starmer was not yet at the stage of ruling out tariffs completely, and would assess the situation as it developed.The UK government is preparing for the possibility of a taxpayer-funded support package to try to shield British businesses in the event that the US pushes ahead with its threats next month.10:04Trump tariffs: why the UK won’t retaliate in Greenland row | The LatestAt an emergency press conference on Monday morning, Starmer told reporters: “Threatening tariffs on allies is the wrong thing to do, completely wrong … A tariff war isn’t in anybody’s interests.“Therefore what I want to do is to avoid a tariff war, because it will be businesses, workers and families across the country that will be hit by a trade war.”Asked directly whether he would impose tariffs in return, he added: “We have not got to that stage, and my focus therefore is making sure we don’t get to that stage.”Starmer said he was determined to find a “pragmatic, sensible and sustained” route through the row, adding: “I don’t want to lose sight of the central goal here, which is to avoid the seriousness that a trade war would bring.”The business secretary, Peter Kyle, told Channel 4 News he had already spoken to Jaguar Land Rover about the tariff threats. “I am always open to conversation about how we can support them – support them in their hour of need, support them when they have opportunities,” he said.Trump has shown no sign of backing down from his bombshell threats at the weekend tohit the UK and seven other European countrieswith a 10% levy on goods exports from 1 February, rising to 25% by June.Starmer’s calm diplomacy makes mistake of assuming Trump is a sentient being | John CraceRead moreIn a telephone interview with NBC on Monday, the US president declined to comment on whether he would rule out seizingGreenlandby force, insisting he would “100%” push ahead with his tariff plans.In an extraordinary text message sent on Sunday to the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, he suggestedhis threat was partly down to being snubbed for the Nobel peace prize.Despite Trump’s belligerent rhetoric, Starmer said he did not think the US president was genuinely considering taking military action in Greenland. “I think that this can be resolved, and should be resolved, through calm discussion,” he added.Answering questions after his brief speech, the prime minister repeatedly stressed what he said was the vital importance of US cooperation in areas such as intelligence and the nuclear deterrent, as well as on Ukraine.“The last thing that we should do is to simply throw all that away and pretend that it doesn’t matter any more. It does matter, but we don’t do that by pretending we haven’t got differences,” he said.No 10 is keeping a close eye on public opinion, recognising that many people would prefer the prime minister to move on from his serious, pragmatic approach towards Trump’s increasingly erratic outbursts.The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, urged the government to change course as Trump was acting like an “international gangster” over Greenland. Senior Conservative MP Simon Hoare said it was time for the government to “fight fire with fire”.Map showing which European countries have sent military personnel to Greenland in 2026AYouGov pollon Monday found that two-thirds of Britons would support placing tariffs on American goods imported to the UK if Trump delivers on his threat.Starmer defended his diplomatic approach to Trump, but suggested he did understand why Britons might see attempts to cooperate with Trump as pointless.“Alliances endure because they’re built on respect and partnership, not pressure,” he said. “Strong, respectful alliances require the maturity to say where we disagree, and on this we disagree, and I’ve been clear about that.“I completely understand why what President Trump said about tariffs over the weekend has been so badly received in this country.”Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, told MPs later the threat of tariffs against allies in this way was completely wrong. “It is unwarranted and it is counter-productive,” she added.“Instead of divisions that only aid our adversaries, we now need a serious and constructive dialogue about our Arctic security,” she said. “Both sides of the Atlantic should be working together on Arctic security, not moving apart.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerGreenlandUS foreign policyTrump tariffsDenmarkDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In the aftermath of the collision near Adamuz in Córdoba province, just one of them, a six-year-old child, had been accounted for.‘We had to remove the dead to get to the living’: train crash shocks Spanish townRead more“Now we’re searching for the four who are missing,” Barroso told reporters. “We’ve been all over. All of the hospitals in Jaén, Úbeda and in Córdoba.”Others used social media to post photos of their loved ones, pleading for people to get in touch. “If anyone in Adamuz recognises this man, he’s my father, please contact me,” read one message.Police said they had opened several offices where people could file reports and “provide DNA samples for the purpose of identification”.Speaking to reporters during a visit to the site, the country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, vowed that the investigation into the cause of the crash would be full and transparent.View image in fullscreenSpain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez (2-R), promised a thorough investigation.Photograph: Jorge Zapata/EPA“Spanish society, like all of us, is wondering what happened, how it happened, how this tragedy could have occurred,” he said on Monday as he declared three days of mourning starting at midnight . “And I’m convinced that time and the work of experts will provide us with those answers.”The collision occurred just before 8pm on Sunday night, when the rear part of the Madrid-bound traincame off the railsand into the path of an oncoming train.The impact knocked the first two carriages of the southbound train off the track, sending it plummeting down a 4-metre (13ft) slope, said Spain’s transport minister, Óscar Puente.Map of where the trains crashedWhile the cause of the accident had yet to be established, Puente described it as “really strange” that a derailment had happened on a straight stretch of track. This particular section had been renovated in May, he added.The train that derailed was less than four years old and had been inspected four days earlier, Iryo, the private company that operated the train, said in a statement on Monday.The president of the state rail company, Renfe, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said it was too early to talk about the cause. But he noted that the accident had taken place in “strange conditions”, telling the broadcaster Cadena Ser that “human error is practically ruled out”.A source told Reuters that technicians had identified a broken joint on the rails, which they said had created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track. The faulty joint could prove important in identifying the precise cause of the accident, the source added.Neither Adif, the state-owned rail infrastructure administrator, nor the Spanish commission tasked with investigating rail accidents replied to requests for comment.Since 2022, Adif has publicly flagged 10 infrastructure issues in the area where the collision occurred, from signalling failures to issues with overhead power lines. In August, the union representing train drivers said in a letter that increased rail traffic had led to severe wear and tear on the tracks, resulting in frequent breakdowns and train damage.On Monday the train drivers’ union called for caution in linking their earlier warning to the crash, stressing that the cause of the collision remained unknown.View image in fullscreenSome passengers managed to slip out of overturned carriages and twisted masses of steel on their own, using emergency hammers to break through windows.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APAs reports of the collision began circulating on Sunday evening, emergency officials rushed to the remote area where it took place.Grappling with darkness and largely limited by the single-track road that leads to and from the site, they worked through the night to pull people out of the wreckage. Some passengers managed to slip out of overturned carriages and twisted masses of steel on their own, using emergency hammers to break through windows.map of the high-speed rail lineThe mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, told Europa Press that he was among the first to arrive at the scene. “It was horrific,” he said. “It was a tremendously tough, sad night.”The small Andalucían town, which sits in the countryside a few kilometres from the crash site, was in shock on Monday.The town’s municipal hall had been turned into a hastily improvised response centre where many of the victims of the accident had been brought for first aid, food and warmth before being taken elsewhere.Officials warned the death toll was likely to rise. The head of the Andalucían government, Juanma Moreno, told the broadcaster Cope: “Some carriages are in a very deteriorated, very regrettable state. I’m told it’s a twisted wreck, which makes things very difficult. We have to use mechanical means and heavy machinery.”He said the search area had been widened beyond the crash site. “The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of metres away, which means that people were thrown through the windows.”Map of Spain's rail networkThe accident shook Spain, where the cutting-edge rail network has long been a source of pride. With almost 4,000km of track, Spain’s high-speed railway network is the largest in Europe and the second in the world after China, according to Adif.In 2024, Renfe said more than 25 million passengers had travelled on its high-speed trains.Explore more on these topicsSpainTrain crashesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Russian president has repeatedly rejected proposals of ceasefire along the current frontlines.The Kremlin also said on Monday thatPutin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitrievwould be attending the World Economic Forum in Davos this week and would meet members of the US delegation there. It is unclear whether those meetings will involve discussions of the Gaza board.The invitation to Putin, which has yet to be confirmed by Washington, raises more questions about the intended agenda for the board. It was originally part of Trump’s ceasefire proposals for the Gaza war, and was supposed to oversee the transition to a lasting peace in the territory and supervise the work of a committee of Palestinian experts, also announced last week, who would take care of the day-to-day running of Gaza. The vaguely described scheme was endorsed in aUN security council resolutionin November.View image in fullscreenTony Blair was among the first appointments to the board to be announced.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersThefirst appointments to the board, announced on Friday, included Trump himself as chair, with a “founding executive board” that included the former British prime minister Tony Blair and the current US secretary of state, Marco Rubio. Also appointed were Trump’s troubleshooting envoy, the property developer Steve Witkoff, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and the president of the World Bank, Ajay Banga.It has emerged over the weekend that Trump had also sent invitations to the leaders of states including Argentina, Paraguay, Turkey, Egypt, Canada and Thailand. Belarus announced that its leader, Alexander Lukashenko, had been invited and that he welcomed the invitation.The world is listening to Russia again. From the ruins of Ukraine, it makes me want to scream | Oleksandr MykhedRead moreThe UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, wasreportedly approached with an offerof membership last week, although he was awaiting a formal invitation.The invitation letters included a “charter” saying the board would seek to “solidify peace in the Middle East”, and at the same time “embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict”.Each national leader would serve a maximum of three years on the board, unless their governments paid a $1bn (£745m) fee to become a permanent member, in an echo of Trump’s elite membership structure for his Mar-a-Lago estate and his golf clubs. It is unclear who would be the recipient of such membership payments and how they would be used.The charter states: “The board of peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.” It adds that the board should have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”, likely to be a swipe at the UN.News agencies quoted French officials on Monday as saying that France would decline the offer of membership, because of the board’s broader aspirations. Earlier in the day the French foreign ministry had said it was reviewing an invitation to join the new body “whose project extends beyond the situation in Gaza”. The ministry statement “reiterates its attachment to the United Nations charter, [which] remains the cornerstone of effective multilateralism”.The French press agency AFP also quoted a Canadian official as saying the country would not pay for membership, nor had it been asked for payment, but it was not clear whether Ottawa would also reject the invitation outright.As of Monday evening, two countries had confirmed acceptance of the invitation: Hungary, and Vietnam in the person of the general secretary of the Vietnamese communist party, Tô Lâm).The inclusion of Putin in a global body supposed to oversee peace around the world would add considerable weight to longstanding suspicions that Trump leans heavily in the Russian president’s favour in his approach to the Ukraine conflict.At the same time as he was apparently inviting friendly leaders to join the board of peace, Trump also sent a letter to Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, over the weekend, telling him that “considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace”.Trump has been escalating pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe toaccept his plans to take over Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, and has imposed punitive measures on European countries who have objected most strenuously to his plan.The UK is one of the targeted countries, and Starmer denounced the tariffs as “completely wrong” on Monday, restating that “any decision on Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and Denmark alone”. However, Starmer did not commit to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs against the US, and downplayed the prospect of Trump using force in Greenland.Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, meanwhile suggested that a US takeover of Greenland would cement Trump’s place in the history books. “Here, perhaps, it is possible to abstract from whether this is good or bad, whether it will comply with the parameters of international law or not,” Peskov said, but he added it would “certainly go down in history”.The ceasefire in Gaza, which the board of peace was originally meant to oversee, remains in limbo. Last week, the US declared the beginning of a second phase in which the handpicked Palestinian technocratic committee was supposed to take over governance and an international stabilisation force was due to take over security.With the territory still coming under regular Israeli bombardment, there is no immediate prospect of either development and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, restated his government’s opposition to any troops from Turkey or Qatar, two key regional backers of the plan, taking part in the stabilisation force.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinGazaRussiaUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It said it had lost control of the building after an attack by government-affiliated fighters that killed or wounded dozens.The Syrian army confirmed the escape late on Monday and imposed a total curfew in Shaddadi, the state news agency Sana reported. But it denied attacking the jail and blamed the SDF for the escapes, saying it would comb the city in search of the militants.The clashes came less than 24 hours after Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, said his government had agreed aceasefire with the SDFand would move to dismantle the group’s decade-long control of the country’s north-east and dramatically consolidate his rule.The sudden defeat of the SDF in Syria’s north raises questions about its ability to retain control of prisons and camps housing tens of thousands of male and female supporters of IS.Fighting was also reported outside al-Aqtan prison in formerly SDF-held Raqqa, and two others in the city – Taameer and a juvenile detention centre – were said by Kurdish sources to have been emptied by local people. The Syrian army said it had arrived at al-Aqtan to secure it “despite the presence of SDF forces inside”.Many other IS detainees, originally from 70 countries including the UK, are held further to the north-east in Kurdish majority areas, where many have been detained since the territorial defeat of the terrorist group in 2019.The bulk of female detainees and their families are being held in al-Hawl, which holds an estimated 26,000 people, and the smaller Roj camp, where Shamima Begum is housed. About 4,500 men are held at the Panorama or Gweiran prison.Map of Syria, showing areas of controlIt remains unclear who freed the prisoners in Shaddadi. The SDF claimed the armed men involved were “Damascus factions” and that several of its fighters were beheaded.It said in a statement that the US-led anti-IS coalition did not respond despite repeated appeals for assistance to a nearby coalition base. The US military’s central command did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Kurdish-led forces backed by the US rounded up tens of thousands of people linked to IS after the group’s defeat. Washington later left responsibility for the camps to its Kurdish allies, but as US troops scale back, pressure is growing for Syria’s new authorities to take over.According to the text of the deal between the SDF and Damascus, the administration responsible for the IS prisoners and camps, as well as the forces securing them, is to be integrated with the Syrian government, which will assume “full legal and security responsibility” for these facilities.But the plan, also part of efforts to fold the Kurdish-led SDF into a reunified national military, is fraught with mistrust as manyKurdsfear the government, led by Islamist former rebels once linked to al-Qaida, could loosen controls on IS networks.Among the prisoners and detainees are an estimated 55 men, women and children from the UK, including Begum, many of whom have had their citizenship removed because of their IS links.Reprieve, a UK-based human rights campaign group, said the current situation was “a reality check” for Britain’s refusal to repatriate people held in Syria. Other countries, including the US, which has repatriated 28 people, have gradually brought back many of their citizens who were otherwise held in indefinite detention.Maya Foa, the chief executive of Reprieve, said “volatility of the current situation demands an urgent rethink”. Foa added: “The only safe thing to do is bring British nationals home and prosecute the adults where there is a case to answer.”Sharaa’s jihadist career was forged in post-invasion Iraq, where he was drawn into al-Qaida’s orbit through its Iraqi affiliate, a precursor of IS. Detained by the US in 2005, he deepened his militant ties and encountered Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who would later dispatch him to Syria to set up Jabhat al-Nusra.The group rose quickly but split from Baghdadi in 2013, prompting Sharaa to first align openly with al-Qaida before severing that link in 2016 to present a more locally rooted insurgency that would ultimately become Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.Sincetoppling Bashar al-Assadin December 2024, Syria’s new leaders have struggled to assert full authority over the country. An agreement was reached in March that was to have merged the SDF with Damascus, but it did not gain traction as both sides accused each other of violating the deal.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – long hostile to the SDF – on Monday hailed the Syrian army for what he called its “careful” offensive to take over Kurdish-held areas of the country’s north-east.“The Syrian army’s careful management of this sensitive operation … is commendable. Despite provocations, the Syrian army has passed a successful test, avoiding actions that would put them in the wrong when they are in the right,” he said.Turkey sees the SDF as an extension of the Kurdish militant PKK and a major threat along the 560-mile (900km ) border it shares with Syria.“The principle of one state, one army is indispensable for stability,” said Erdoğan, describing the ceasefire and the integration agreement as “a very important achievement for lasting peace and stability in Syria”.He urged that the deal be implemented as soon as possible, saying there was “no excuse for stalling or playing for time. The era of terror in our region is over. No one should miscalculate.”Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaIslamic StateKurdsnewsShareReuse this content"

They beat and applied pressure to the anal area with a baton through the clothing,” said Rebin Rahmani, of the KHRN, which has been in contact with sources close to the minor’s family.Due to the ongoing communication blackout in Iran, neither the rights group nor the Guardian have been able to get further information on the current conditions of the individuals.Rights groups have expressed fear about the treatment of more than 20,000 protesters estimated to have been arrested since the start of protests in late December.During nationwide protests in 2022, detainees reported rapes, beatings and torture by police, with one womantelling the Guardianshe had been blindfolded and sexually assaulted by her interrogators.Since the start of the current protests in late December, 3,766 people have been killed and 8,949 other reported deaths are under investigation, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.The Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw said Sholeh Sotoudeh, apregnant woman from Langarud, was killed along with her unborn child after forces opened fire on protesters in north-west Iran on 10 January.In the latest unrest, at least one protester, 40-year-old Soran Feyzizadeh, has died as a result of torture while being held in custody,accordingto Hengaw. It said Feyzizadeh was detained during protests on 7 January and that his family was informed of his death two days later.View image in fullscreenSoran Feyzizadeh, 40, died as a result of torture while being held in custody.Photograph: The Guardian“His body was barely recognisable due to the extent of injuries caused by repeated blows,” said Awyar Shekhi, of Hengaw, who added that the family had to “pay a heavy sum just to retrieve his body from the authorities”.‘The world needs to know what’s happening’: families of protesters killed in Iran tell of heartbreakRead moreIn a message to the Guardian, a close relative of Feyzizadeh said he had been prevented from returning home to attend the funeral. “The city [Saqqez in western Iran] was militarised and movement was completely restricted,” the relative said. “I wanted to be with my family during this time but they didn’t allow it. They didn’t allow anyone to be with our family. They killed him.

The SDF appeared to have largely retreated after initial clashes on a tense frontline area in eastern Aleppo province.Hours after the government announced the deal, SDF leader Mazloum Abdi confirmed it in a video statement, saying the group had accepted the agreement, which stipulates their withdrawal from Raqqa and Deir el-Zour provinces “to stop the bloodshed”.Syrian army surges into Kurdish-held towns in ‘betrayal’ shattering prospects of accordRead more“We will explain the terms of the agreement to our people in the coming days,” he said.Syria’s defence ministry said it ordered the fighting to halt on the frontlines after the agreement was announced.Map of SyriaSyria’s new leaders, since topplingBashar al-Assadin December 2024, have struggled to assert their full authority over the country. An agreement was reached in March that would merge the SDF with Damascus, but it didn’t gain traction as both sides accused each other of violating the deal.Since the push, the government has largely asserted control of the Deir el-Zour and Raqqa provinces, critical areas under the SDF that include oil and gas fields, river dams along the Euphrates, and border crossings.Syria’s state-run news agency Sana showed president Ahmad al-Sharaa signing and holding the agreement. Abdi, who was scheduled to meet with the president in Damascus, was not seen, though his signature appeared on the document. Al-Sharaa told journalists that Abdi could not travel due to bad weather and would visit Damascus on Monday.“It’s a victory for all Syrians of all backgrounds,” al-Sharaa told journalists in Damascus after signing the agreement. “Hopefully Syria will end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress.”The two warring sides are key allies of Washington. US envoy Tom Barrack met with al-Sharaa earlier on Sunday as government forces were sweeping into the city of Raqqa and across Deir el-Zour province. Abdi reportedly joined the meeting over the phone.View image in fullscreenSyrian defence ministry forces entering the Raqqa on Sunday, when the government announced a ceasefire agreement with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesBarrack praised the agreement, saying it would lead to “renewed dialogue and cooperation toward a unified Syria”, ahead of working on the details of implementing the integration.“This agreement and ceasefire represent a pivotal inflection point, where former adversaries embrace partnership over division,” Barrack said in a post on X.The agreement includes dismantling the SDF and having its forces join Syria’s military and security forces, while senior military and civilian officials would be given high-ranking positions in state institutions.The SDF would have to give up the Raqqa and Deir el-Zour provinces – both Arab-majority areas – to the Syrian military and government, as well as its border crossings and oil and gas fields.Hassakah province – the heartland of the Kurdish population – is only expected to give its civilian administration back to Damascus, while the Kurdish-led agencies that handled prisons and sprawling camps with thousands of detained Islamic State group fighters and families would be handed over to Damascus.There was no clear timeline on when and how the different elements of the agreement will take effect. Al-Sharaa told journalists that it would be gradually implemented, beginning with the cessation of hostilities.It appeared that tensions followingclashes in Aleppoearlier this month had calmed after Abdi announced that his troops would withdraw east of the Euphrates river, and al-Sharaa issued a presidential decree that would strengthen Kurdish rights in the country.Large military convoys swept into Raqqa city on Sunday evening and it appeared the SDF had withdrawn. Crowds in Raqqa celebrated in the streets late into evening, waving Syrian flags and setting off fireworks.Explore more on these topicsSyriaKurdsBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The government said this would “give stability to investors”.The Guardian understands the white paper, which will be published on Tuesday and was not made available to journalists in advance, will include provisions for the regulator to step in and “manage” fines so a company does not collapse. This could include deferring penalties, or letting the company off certain payments. A source at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the “aim is for every water company to eventually pay their fines”.Creditors have asked for Thames Water to be let off future fines as thecompany staves off financial collapse. In May 2025,it was fined over £120m for environmental breachesinvolving sewage spills, after failing to operate and manage its treatment works and wastewater networks effectively.“We are fixing the problems and getting the companies to a stance where customers are not paying for their failures,” a Defra source said.Thames Water ranked worst supplier in England as firms’ ratings hit record lowRead moreRichard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “If a company is fined because it’s done something wrong. It should either make restitution or the polluter should pay.”He added: “It sounds like a desperate play to be off the hook at the last minute, and companies should think about that when they are engaging in unlawful actions and failing in their public environmental interest duties. If a business hasn’t managed itself well enough to deal with the consequences of its shortcomings then it needs to deal with those consequences.”Industry sources said the possibility of a turnaround regime would be welcome, although they acknowledged that companies would have to accept restrictions on payouts to executives and investors if fines were reduced or deferred.A new “MOT for water companies” will be announced as part of the measures, which ministers say will force the firms to disclose the state of their infrastructure.This would prevent water outages such as those recentlyfaced by tens of thousands of people in Kent and Sussex, government sources said. This is because old pipes and a badly maintained water treatment centre were blamed for the shortages.View image in fullscreenThousands of homes in south-east England were recently affected by water outages.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe UK’s pipes arelargely Victorian, no major reservoir has been built for more than 30 years. Many water treatment centres were built decades ago andhave not been updated.Other changes include:Dedicated supervisory teams for each water company.“No notice” inspection powers for the new regulator.A new chief engineer inside Ofwat to oversee hands-on checks to water infrastructure.The overhaul, due to be enshrined in law in the water reform bill, is part of the government’s response to a wide-rangingreport on the water sectorby Jon Cunliffe, a former Bank of England official. He made 88 recommendations to improve the sector, some of which – such as the supervisory model – have been accepted.There will be no change to the ownership structures of water companies, and Cunliffe was banned by the government from considering nationalising the industry in his report.Englandand Wales are the only countries in the world with a fully privatised water system.Feargal Sharkey, the water campaigner and former singer of the Undertones, said: “This is just a rearrangement of the deckchairs. After 35 years of privatisations we have two hospitals, a kidney treatment centre, 15 schools, 19 care homes and 29 nurseries in Tunbridge Wells left without water for two weeks. The government is terrified of dealing with privatisation and has sacrificed water quality on the altar of shareholders and private equity.“No 10 is operating under paralysis of doing anything which might slightly spook the bond markets. Ministers have failed to grasp the underlying issue which is corporate greed. The only people who will be paying for this are customers and billpayers.”View image in fullscreenFeargal Sharkey has likened the government’s changes to a ‘rearrangement of the deckchairs’.Photograph: Krisztián Elek/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockThe government previously announced it wouldabolish Ofwat, as recommended by Cunliffe, and combine its powers with those of other water watchdogs under a new “super-regulator”. It remains unclear whether the new regulator will be in place in time to oversee the next price review in 2029, which will set household bills and company spending plans until 2035. The government is expected to set out its timeline for the new regulator in March.Cunliffe recommended allowing companies to be let off the hook for fines under a turnaround regime.In his report, he said: “A turnaround regime could provide the water regulator with additional discretion over enforcement in defined circumstances, allowing them to defer or waive fines and penalties where it is in the broader interest of customers. This may include, for example, circumstances where additional fines are likely to hinder the ability of the company to invest in infrastructure improvement.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWater industryThames WaterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.Death of man at ICE camp could be investigated as homicide after examiner’s reportRead moreDiaz was detained on 6 January during theTrump administration’s controversial deportationblitzin Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole. On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him.The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso.Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, thehighest numberof fatalities in two decades. At leastfive peoplehave reportedly died in ICE custody this year.Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba,diedin the same detention camp on 3 January. ICEsaidCampos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him.His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide. The local medical examiner determined the preliminary cause of death was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”, according to reports. ICE said he experienced a medical emergency after being “disruptive while in line for medication”.Santos Jesus Flores, who was detained with him,toldthe Washington Post that he saw five guards choking him, and that he heard Lunas Campos repeatedly say in Spanish that he couldn’t breathe.Officers at Texas immigration detention facility accused of beatings and sexual abuseRead more“He said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ After that, we don’t hear his voice anymore and that’s it,” the publication quoted Flores as saying.After reports that Lunas Campos’ death might be investigated as a potential homicide, the Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Guardian that he had tried to kill himself and “violently resisted” officers who were trying to help him.Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, also told the Washington Post after it published its article that Lunas Campos was trying to take his own life. The allegation was not part of ICE’sinitial statement.Another Camp East Montana inmate,Francisco Gaspar-Andres,diedat a nearby hospital on 3 December.

The dollar was down 0.3% against a basket of currencies.On Saturday, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland until the US was allowed to buyGreenland, marking an extraordinary escalation in the president’s campaign to claim the autonomous Danish territory.1:01Greenland prime minister joins protests over Trump threats – videoIn a lengthyposton Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff beginning on 1 February “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.Trump said the tariff would be “payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase ofGreenland”, rising to 25% on 1 June.Mohit Kumar, chief economist at Jefferies, said markets had become accustomed to factoring in the notion that “Trump always chickens out” – or Taco – when it came to tariffs.Kumar said: “Markets have become used to Taco from Trump, with a number of randomly imposed tariffs scaled back after negotiations. Our base case is that the 1 February deadline will get postponed as diplomatic talks will start between the EU and the US. However, we do not think that Trump will reverse his policy of these additional tariffs, as the matter of Greenland is not so easy to resolve.”Brzeski said businesses operating within the EU could end up exploiting a tariff loophole. “Of course, the EU is a single trade bloc with no tariff barriers within. This means that options for tariff evasion from the six countries mentioned by Trump are plentiful,” he said.“Take Belgium, for example, which is set to keep the 15% tariff but is positioned between the Netherlands and France, both of which will see tariffs rise to 25% as of 1 February. As a result, Belgian ports could become busier as they present a potential route for tariff evasion. This would ultimately make the tariff less effective than the previously announced levies,” Brzeski added.ING estimates that additional tariffs would probably shave 0.2 percentage points off European GDP growth. The UK could be harder hit, with CapitalEconomicsforecasting that new tariffs could reduce UK GDP by 0.3%-0.75% and trigger a recession in a worse-case scenario.“The long-term political and geopolitical consequences would be much greater,” said the Capital Economics chief UK economist, Paul Dales. “One could be that the UK is nudged closer to the EU, at least when it comes to trade in goods.”EU ambassadors are now preparing retaliatory measures should Trump follow through on the tariff threat.Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at the global financial services firm StoneX, said: “With Trump throwing tariffs into the mix, it is clear that his threat to Greenland is real. Geopolitical tensions have given the gold bulls yet another reason to push it to new highs.”Kathleen Brooks, a research director at the broker XTB, said: “This was a big week for markets, and it hinges on Donald Trump’s tone at Davos. If he increases pressure on Europe to let him have control of Greenland, then we do not think that the benign market environment and low volatility – which is still well below the 12-month average – can persist as we move through January.”Explore more on these topicsStock marketsCommoditiesGoldSilverTrump administrationTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kate Menendez found federal agents had used “chemical irritants” to punish protesters for exercising “protected first amendment rights to assemble and to observe and protest ICE operations”.Who is on the frontline of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown?Read moreNoem first denied the judge’s finding, but after being shown a video of chemical agents being used on four occasions, she backtracked and said her department “only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe”.Tensionscontinue to run high in Minneapolis, with the Pentagonorderingaround 1,500 active-duty soldiers stationed in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment, which Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has described as a “ridiculous” overreaction to largely peacefulprotestsagainst the violent behaviour of ICE agents.On Sunday the Department of Justice also declared it is investigating a group of protesters who disrupted services at a church where a local ICE official is reportedly a pastor. Footage livestreamed by Black Lives Matter Minnesota showed peopleinterrupting servicesat the Cities church in St Paul by chanting “ICE out” and “justice forRenee Good”, referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE agent.The assistant attorney general, Harmeet Dhillon,announced on social mediaan investigation into purported civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers”, adding: “A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!”Nekima Levy Armstrong of the Racial Justice Network was dismissive of the threat of an investigation. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts,” shetoldthe Associated Press.It is not clear whether David Easterwood, the pastor who also reportedly heads the local ICE field office, was present at the church. He has defended ICE tactics inMinnesotasuch as swapping out license plates and using pepper spray on protesters.Pentagon readies 1,500 troops for potential Minnesota deployment, officials sayRead moreThose tactics have inflamed an atmosphere that the Minneapolis parks and recreation department cited as the reason for canceling youth sports on Friday and Sunday “out of an abundance of caution”. Meanwhile, the newly installed Laotian American mayor of St Paul, Kaohly Her,saidshe had “received advice to carry my passport with me because they may try to target me based on what I look like as well”.Some protesters arrested during ICE operations in Minneapolis have been denied their right to see an attorney, according toABC News, citing four attorneys who said there were denied access to clients at the federal building in Minneapolis, the site of now daily protests.“ICE agents were physically restricting me from seeing them,” one immigration attorney who asked not to be identified told ABC. “I stood outside the attorney visitation room for about four hours on Thursday, trying to see one of my clients who had been there for multiple days. I kept saying, you got to let me see my client. And they just kept repeating, we don’t do attorney visitation.”A DHS spokesperson denied the claims, saying all detainees “have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers” and said “all detainees receive full due process”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMinneapolisKristi NoemMinnesota ICE shootingMinnesotaUS politicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

The EU devised the deterrent in response to such situations, but never imagined it might apply to the US.The instrument allows the EU to impose sweeping trade sanctions, such as excluding the aggressor’s companies from its internal market, imposing export controls or ending intellectual property protections. The countermeasures are meant to be proportionate to the economic harm inflicted, while minimising pain to Europe.In theory, the EU could take aim at anything from US tech and crypto companies, to aircraft makers or agricultural goods. But European consumers could balk at extra costs or restrictions on US companies, such as Apple or Netflix.Will the EU pull the trigger?France, long the bazooka’s biggest champion, has urged European allies to consider deploying it if Trump goes ahead with his Greenland tariffs. Germany’s finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, agreed with suggestions from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that the EU should “consider using these measures”.Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, however, struck a more conciliatory tone than his deputy, citing Germany’s heavier dependence on exports. He added that experience showed that Trump was open to persuasion.Countries with a strong emphasis on free trade, such as Ireland and the Netherlands, or those led by politicians with a close relationship to Trump, such as Italy, have been reluctant to consider such measures in the past. For now, most member states put the accent on dialogue with the US.A crisis meeting of EU senior diplomats on Sunday showed no majority for using the ACI now. Europeans are waiting to see whether this is another Taco moment, referring to the abbreviation for “Trump always chickens out” that describes how the US president U-turns on his tariff threats in response to market jitters.Brussels officials are also awaiting the US supreme court ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs, which could come as early as Tuesday. The EU, has always stressed it sees the ACI as a deterrent, will not take pre-emptive action until Trump’s tariffs become a reality.How rapidly would measures take effect?Firing the bazooka is neither quick nor easy and has never been done before, so no one knows how quick or effective it might be.The European Commission could spend up to four months judging whether coercion was taking place and member states would then have another eight to 10 weeks to endorse – or not endorse – the decision. Any retaliation would require a weighted majority of member states and a further round of last-ditch negotiations.View image in fullscreenThe EU could revive its plan for tariffs on €93bn of US goods including bourbon.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/EPAAlternatively the EU could opt for less drastic but speedier retaliation – reactivating levies on €93bn (£81bn) of US goods, including bourbon, aircraft and soya beans, that were drawn up in response to earlier tariff threats. These countermeasures were suspended afterlast summer’s EU-US trade deal, but that temporary pause lapses on 6 February, meaning tariffs would apply the following day.Who stands to lose most from any trade war?The combined value US imports from the nations Trump is targeting amounted to more than $365bn (£272bn) last year – equivalent to roughly half of the EU exports to the US. Germany sold the most, at more than $160bn, followed by the UK at $68bn, and France at $60bn.Goldman Sachs estimates that a 10% tariff would lower real GDP in the affected European countries by between 0.1% and 0.2% via lower exports. The biggest hit would be for Germany, worth up to 0.3% if implemented as a blanket tariff on all goods. For the eurozone as a whole, the implied hit would be worth about 0.1%, with a similar-sized blow to the UK.The US would not, however, escape consequences. Additional border taxes on US imports would be paid by US businesses and consumers – hitting activity and investment, and possibly stoking inflation.The International Monetary Fund chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, warned that a tit-for-tat trade war could drag down global output by about 0.3%. “We all know there are no winners in a trade war and that’s the thing to remember,” he said.Could a full-blown trade war be averted?Experts are hopeful that the supreme court rule will against Trump. His latest announcement would be void and he would be forced to seek alternative routes, which could take time. Or he may be persuaded by market pressure or threats of EU retaliation to once again Taco on his tariffs.The president is also not as popular domestically as a year ago, while most Americans care little about Greenland – witha CNN poll last Fridayfinding 75% of the population oppose annexation – raising hopes of the US Congress blocking his ambitions there.Still, Trump’s latest threats also go beyond the normal playbook in blackmailing traditional allies for political ends. “The risk is that Trump has backed himself into a corner,” said Kallum Pickering, the chief economist at Peel Hunt. “Having made clear he wants US ownership of Greenland, anything less than that could look like a loss for him.”How might the fallout be contained?Economists point out that last year’s trade battles overTrump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, announced on 2 April, had a relatively muted impact compared with the worst-case scenario outcomes. Despite the tensions, theIMF upgraded its forecasts on Mondayto anticipate global growth in 2025 and 2026 would be higher than it had estimated before Trump even came to power.Last year businesses adapted to the global trade war by front-loading their US shipments to US customers in a race to beat tariff deadlines. The IMF has suggested that companies cushioned some of the cost for consumers by taking a hit to profits.Trade volumes were also buoyed up by companies rerouting exports elsewhere around the world. The global investment boom in artificial intelligence also boosted exporters, as well as the US economy.However, that capacity will probably be diminished in 2026 because most of the adjustment mechanisms have already been deployed. Even before the latest escalation in tensions, the IMF said it forecast US inflation to rise in 2026 as a consequence.Economists warn the tensions could sap business investment, hit consumer confidence, and trigger a sell-off in financial markets. Amid record equity prices and fears ofAI mania fuelling a market bubble, a correction could rapidly turn into a crash.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsEuropean UnionEuropeexplainersShareReuse this content"

It included interviews with the same subjects, including Luis Muñoz Pinto, who described extremely harsh conditions at the prison, and Juan Pappier, Americas deputy director at Human Rights Watch.The segment also included a statement from the White House that was issued on 18 December, in time for its original air date, though it was not included in the original version of the segment.Alfonsi’s comments at the end of the segment were much longer in the new version – a length one CBS News staffer, not authorized to speak publicly, said was unusual.Weiss, a provocative opinion writer and editor with no experience working in broadcast television wasappointed to lead CBS Newsin October.David Ellison, who controls the network’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, and bought Weiss’ Substack-based publication the Free Press in a reported $150m deal, said at the time she would bring “a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum” – although staffersswiftly expressed concern.‘Blood in the water’: Bari Weiss’s chaotic first three months in charge of CBS NewsRead moreWhile CBS normally announces the program’s lineup at least a day in advance, it did not formally confirm that the segment would air until early Sunday evening.The network re-affirmed that it had always intended to air the segment. “CBS News leadership has always been committed to airing the 60 Minutes Cecot piece as soon as it was ready,” it said. “Tonight, viewers get to see it, along with other important stories, all of which speak to CBS News’ independence and the power of our storytelling.”While the episode was closely watched by media industry observers interested in seeing how it differed from the original version, it likely lost some viewers to NBC, which was airing a divisional playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears.“60 will not have the audience it normally does,” a second network staffer, also not authorized to speak publicly, predicted.Explore more on these topicsMediaCBSDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The problem isn’t your boss – it’s how you workGene MarksMany people use their vacation time each year. These people take ownership of their jobs, and make sure they get them doneMon 19 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 07.09 ESTShareArecent survey of more than 3,000 US workers for employment search siteFlexJobsfound that almost a quarter didn’t take a vacation day during the past year and – more concerning to the study’s authors – as many as 82% “avoid using” their accrued time off. Why?Kelsey Szamet, an employment lawyer, says the reason is a shift in mentality. “Many employees are concerned about the security of their jobs,” shetold Quartz. “The adoption of AI and automation technologies has allowed employees to actually consider their own replaceability before requesting a leave or a holiday, or any kind of time-off benefit.”Are you hesitant to take time off because of a slowing economy and the onset of AI? Don’t be. As a business owner with hundreds of business clients, and an employer myself, I know many people – successful people working at companies – who have no problem using their allotted vacation time each year.These people take ownership of their jobs, and make sure they get them done. My company offers unlimited paid time off (PTO) to our employees. I don’t track their vacation time. I don’t care where they are, and when they’re working. They’re hired to fulfill obligations and I leave it to them to do what they believe is right to meet those responsibilities. If that doesn’t happen because they’re taking “too much” vacation, well, that’s a matter to discuss when their performance reviews roll around.Good employers also understand that PTO is compensation. Discouraging an employee from taking vacation is like telling them to take a cut in pay. You’ve made the commitment in writing. You better not renege. This is not only good practice, but discouraging PTO is potential wage theft. If you’re working for someone who practices this kind of wage theft, my advice would be to find somewhere else to work.I once coached a Little League baseball team alongside a corporate operations specialist who made every game, every practice, even out-of-town tournaments. I once asked him how. He told me it was simple: “Whenever I have something to do, my first thought is, who on my team will be doing it for me?”Delegate. Share work. Be a team member. Build resources around you. Cover for your colleagues when they want to take some time off, and they’ll return the favor. Be smarter about how you work, so you can enjoy the days when you’re not working.Then there’s technology. So many employees are afraid that AI is going to take their jobs. You think a manager doesn’t have the same fears? The truth is that AI is so immature right now, it’s taking more time to review the slop that it generates than it’s saving. True, this will change. And the smartest employees will embrace it, and use it to do more of their jobs, so that they can be even more productive and valuable to their employers, and also take more time off because technology is able to cover for them.AI does not have to be a job killer. It can be a vacation-enabler. Start planning for this eventuality, and you’ll have a better work/life balance in the years to come.Also, PTO has changed. This is not 1980. There is the internet. There is your iPhone. You don’t need to go completely dark. Worst-case scenario: you’re catching up on work in a ski lodge. Or in a cafe in Rome. Or by the pool in Aruba. It’s still better than your workspace in the office.Are a record number of mom and pops going bankrupt? Kinda but not really | Gene MarksRead moreAbove all, communication is key. Maybe your boss is a jerk, and I realize that happens. But most managers aren’t jerks. They just don’t want any problems for themselves.So don’t create any. Take your time off, but try to understand if they need you. Check in with them regularly and quickly, even on vacation, just to make sure they’re cool. If they’re normal people, they’ll scold you for doing so, but will also be secretly grateful. Make sure they know your plans, when you’re gone, when you’ll be back and how to reach you if they need. The grand majority will leave you be.Maybe the FlexJobs survey is accurate. Maybe – like so many other surveys that get sent to me – they’ve got their own agenda, like attracting more job applicants to their site.But taking their results at face value, I think employees who are afraid to take time off are being overly fearful.Believe it or not, chances are that your boss wants you to take vacation. They want you not to be stressed. They care that you’re happy working at your job – and for their company.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessSmall businessUS economyMental healthWorkers' rightscommentShareReuse this content"

But that came after an incredible denouement to normal time with Morocco awarded a penalty when El Hadji MalickDiouf was penalised, following a video assistant referee review, for a pull on Brahim Díaz as he defended a corner.‘The dream will have to wait’: Moroccan media reacts to Afcon final heartacheRead moreThat led to the majority of Senegal’s players, upon instructions from their manager, Pape Thiaw, walking off in protest. They eventually returned and, soon after, Brahim Díaz took the hosts’ spot-kick, only to miss after failing with a horrendously executed Panenka. Gueye made the Real Madrid man pay for his inexplicable indiscretion.Díaz has apologised for his miss, describing it as a failure that had left his soul hurting and would be difficult to recover from. But there is clearly a feeling within Morocco that the 26-year-old’s head had been scrambled by Senegal’s actions and that the events on Sunday cannot be allowed to rest.“The Royal Moroccan Football Federation announces that it will pursue legal action with the Confederation of African Football [Caf] and Fifa to rule on the walk-off of the Senegalese national team from the field during the final against the Moroccan national team, as well as on the events surrounding this decision, following the referee’s awarding of a penalty that was deemed correct by all experts,” a statement read. “This situation had a significant impact on the normal course of the match and on the players’ performance.”1:44Senegal capital Dakar erupts in celebration after Afcon final victory – videoMorocco’s head coach,Walid Regragui, criticised Thiawfor leading Senegal’s walk-off, saying: “The image we’ve given of Africa is shameful.” Thiaw later apologised after the game. “After reflecting on it, I made them come back – you can react in the heat of the moment,” he told beIN Sports. “We accept the errors of the referee. We shouldn’t have done it but it’s done and now we present our apologies to football.”That is likely to be little comfort to Díaz. “My soul hurts,” he said on Monday. “I dreamed of this title thanks to all the love you all gave me, every message, every show of support that made me feel I wasn’t alone. I fought with everything I had, with my heart above all else.Quick GuideAfcon final attracts 1.7m to E4ShowLive coverage of the controversial Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal on Sunday drew an audience of 1.7 million people to E4. The figure represents E4's highest daily share in more than 20 years, with the 19% share of the audience aged between 16 and 34 up by 614% on the average for the same slot on the same channel for the same demographic.The figures are perhaps not a huge surprise given how the contest unfolded, with Senegal's players storming off the pitch at Stade Prince Moulay Abdellah in Rabat following the awarding of what they deemed to be a hugely unfair  penalty to Morocco two minutes into second-half injury time. They returned some 15 minutes later, at which point Brahim Diaz missed the spot-kick via a shockingly bad Panenka attempt. Senegal then went on to triumph – and secured their second Afcon title – via a 94th-minute goal from Papa Gueye.The audience size also represents vindication of Channel Four's decision to make Afcon free-to-air in the UK for a very first time.Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Yesterday I failed and I take full responsibility.

Not for myself, but for everyone who believed in me and for everyone who suffered with me. I will keep going forward until one day I can give you all this love back and become a source of pride for my Moroccan people.”In a statement Caf made clear its objection to Senegal’s walk-off, describing it as “unacceptable” and “inappropriate” and saying it would be “reviewing all footage and will refer the matter to competent bodies for appropriate action to be taken against those found guilty”.Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, said: “We strongly condemn the behaviour of some ‘supporters’ as well as some Senegalese players and technical staff members. It is unacceptable to leave the field of play in this manner, and equally, violence cannot be tolerated in our sport, it is simply not right. We must always respect the decisions taken by the match officials.”Footage also showed ballboys trying to wrestle a towel from the Senegal reserve goalkeeper Yehvan Diouf that he was trying to give to Édouard Mendy in wet conditions.

The hope wouldn’t last longOliver ConnollyMon 19 Jan 2026 03.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 13.35 ESTShareAplayoff game often pivots on a single moment. The Bears thought they had theirs. Down a score, driving to keep the game alive, the Bears had the ball on the Rams’ 14-yard line. Fourth down. Four yards to pick up a fresh set of downs. A play to keep their season alive. The ball in Caleb Williams’s hands.And then it happened.It may be the throw of the century. Williams gathered the snap, surveyed the landscape. His receivers were covered, the pocket collapsing. As the pressure arrived, he turned his back to the line of scrimmage and sprinted a full 10 yards in the wrong direction before turning around and unleashing a throw almost blind. The ball looped over the head of Rams corner Cobie Durant and into the hands of tight end Cole Kmet.A week after authoring one of theall-time greatest postseason playsagainst the Packers, Williams topped it. He threw the ball from 26 yards behind the line of scrimmage, the ball travelling 51 yards in the air. There are maybe two or three humans on Earth who could even attempt the throw, let alone complete it.The camerascut to Rams coach Sean McVayon the sideline, who stood frozen for five seconds. Williams had done it again; the Cardiac Bears had done it again, coming from behind to tie up a game late. In that moment, the Team of Destiny stuff feltreal.But it wasn’t enough. The Bears, like the Bills, cannot have nice things. Even greatness has to be wrapped in misery. What should have beenthemoment, the knockout blow to push the Bears to the NFC title game, was not enough. Eventually, the live-on-the-edge luck ran out.The Williams touchdown tied the game up at 17-17, forcing overtime. After the Bears stuffed the Rams on their opening overtime possession, Williams spun more magic to keep Chicago on the field, before spraying a throw into the hands of Rams safety Cam Curl. It was his third interception of the day and a costly mistake too many.It was time for Matthew Stafford’s moment, a holy bleep throw of his own: drilling a pass to Davante Adams into a tight window along the sidelines. In a grubby, disheveled performance for the veteran, Stafford was finally at his best. He raised his game on a must-have-it drive, dictating things from the line of scrimmage and marching the Rams into field-goal range, where a man knows as the Thiccer Kicker would boot the game-winning score.It was a cruel ending for Chicago. Their much-maligned defense came alive against the league’s No 1 offense, disorienting Stafford with a battery of blitzes and clamping down the Rams’ star receivers. But the Bears left too many plays on the field. On Williams’ final interception, DJ Moore ramped down his route,loafing on the team’s biggest play of the seasonand guiding the Rams’ safety to Williams’ throw. They dropped too many balls, struggled to convert in short-yardage and picked up three of six fourth-down efforts.McVay will know he got away with one. It was one of the most befuddling games of his coaching career. McVay had little feel for the flow of the game or a grasp of its snowy conditions. Late in the fourth quarter, the Rams had 34 pass dropbacks to 10 runs against one of the league’s worst run defenses in a driving snowstorm. It smacked of a coach overthinking things, going down with his gameplan rather than assessing the situation.Still, the Rams found a way. No matter how gnarly the performance, they are a win away from the Super Bowl. It will be a slog against the Seahawks. The Bears showed fresh ways to stifle the Rams’ passing game, and they were forced to play a fifth quarter in overtime on Sunday, while the Seahawks had their feet up after three quarters against the Niners on Saturday.The Bears will look back with regret. They got the magical moment from the magical player. They’ve ridden close game luck all season. There’s no guarantee they’ll stick around at this level next season – and championship windows are never as long as teams think. But they head into the offseason with one certainty: they have one of the league’s best quarterbacks. And they haven’t been able to say that since the 1940s.View image in fullscreenMilton Williams made CJ Stroud’s life a misery on Sunday.Photograph: Mark Stockwell/APMVP of the weekMilton Williams, DL, New England Patriots.You could hand this to any member of the Patriots’ defense. They blasted the Texans in an ugly, turnover-filled28-16 win. The game will be remembered for CJ Stroud, who threw four interceptions and could have given up three or four more. Not since Donovan McNabb –allegedly– gagged in the huddle during a Super Bowl has a quarterback had such a clear meltdown in a playoff game – and for the second game in a row. He missed receivers high; he missed them wide. Stroud finished with a passer rating of 28.0. Throwing the ball into the floor on every play would have given him a passer rating of 39.6.Stroud’s disasterclass was not all of his own making. The Patriots’ defense made life uncomfortable, crushing the pocket and playing sticky coverage on the back-end. Williams led the way, stuffing the run and teeing off against the pass. He finished the game with two pressures and effectively forced an interception when he forced Stroud’s target to fall over by knocking a lineman into his feet. It was the brilliance of Williams inside that allowed the Patriots’ edge-rushers to feast. And they needed that pass-rush to show up to offset a dismal performance from their offense, which finished with three turnovers and a 30% success rate, the lowest in a Drake Maye start.Stat of the weekThe Bills are the first team to win a playoff game insix straight seasonsandnotclaim a Super Bowl.It wasa heartbreaker for the Billsin Denver, probably the most painful postseason defeat since “13 seconds”. They lost 33-30 to the Broncos in overtime in a game that will be remembered for a controversial catch-interception call (more on that later). But pinning the loss on the officials absolves Buffalo of blame. They lacked receivers who could win one-on-one. The defense lacked game-breakers at all three levels, struggling to manufacture a pass-rush unless they blitzed. For some of Saturday, they were able to conceal some of those faults. Sean McDermott, who wasreportedly fired on Monday, schemed up enough to get his defense off the field for five straight drives. But the Bills’ offense could not stop turning the ball over, coughing it up five times. Bo Nix only had to rip three deep shots down the field and draw a pair of pass interference penalties to inch the Broncos over the line.Plenty of blame for the defeat will fall on Josh Allen. He struggled to hit on throws down the field, finishing 0 for 9 on attempts over 20 yards (with two interceptions), according to Next Gen Stats. He made plenty of hero plays to keep the game close and force overtime, but also made crucial errors. A fumble with seconds left in the first half set the Broncos up in field goal range. He missed an open shot to Dawson Knox late in the game, which would have been a walk-in touchdown. He also buried a screen pass to Khalil Shakir, which almost certainly wiped another touchdown off the board and forced the Bills to kick a field goal. “I feel like I let my teammates down tonight,” Allen said. “[I’m] extremely sorry.”Change will come in Buffalo but they may never get a better opportunity than this season. For as weak as this roster was compared to previous years, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow failed to make the playoffs, and the Bills would have had a good chance at beating the Patriots in the AFC championship game.Video of the weekMany deadline trades don’t work out. Then there’s the Seahawks’ trade for Rashid Shaheed.pic.twitter.com/G9YYko9MrH— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero)January 18, 2026It felt like 49ers-Seahawks was over 13 seconds into the game. Rashid Shaheed, picked up by Seattle at the trade deadline, returned the opening kickoff to the house. Seattle roared. The stadium shook – and the Niners never recovered. Think about this: the Seahawks put up a 40 burger despite only finishing with 106 net yards passing as Sam Darnold dealt with an oblique injury. By the fourth quarter, Drew Lock was in at quarterback to guide home the 41-6 blowout.No team is as complete as the Seahawks. They have a swarming defense, a game-tilting special teams unit, a mastermind at head coach and they’ve found their run game over the last month. If Darnold doesn’t turn the ball over, they are the favorites to win it all.Elsewhere around the leagueSean Payton has already announced that Jarrett Stidham will be Denver’s starting quarterback in the AFC title game afterBo Nix fractured his ankleagainst the Bills. Stidham is a solid backup but he hasn’t taken a regular-season snap in two years. Given that, would Payton beat alltempted to give his friend Drew Brees a call? We saw the Coltstry the experiment with Philip Rivers. Why not ask Brees to join for a week as an insurance policy if Stidham struggles? If Brees isn’t up for it, you can start rattling down the list: Peyton Manning? Ryan Tannehill? Cam Newton? Andrew Luck? Colin Kaepernick?Let’s talk officiating. Given the rules, the ending of Bills-Broncos wascorrectlyofficiated. Brandin Cooks’ catch was not in fact a catch, as he didn’t survive the ground. Given that the ball never hit the deck, there was no other ruling that could be made than an interception to the Broncos. The other controversial calls – two DPIs on the Broncos’ final drive – shouldn’t even be controversial: the first and closest was offset by the Bills roughing the passer; the second was as blatant as it gets. Yet the fact that the public has so little faith in the process is in itself a problem. After all, this is a league that screwed up its ownkickoff rules in aplayoffgame, and after Bills tackle Spencer Brownadmitted, “I was holding the piss out of some people today, and they didn’t call it.” The referees swallowed their whistles until they were forced to intervene in overtime. Heck, they could have ended the game with a holding call on the Bills that would have given the Broncos awalk-off safety. Whether it’s slimming down the rules, adding extra officials or involving more technology, the NFL needs to find a way to up its standards and restore some confidence in officiating.Matt Ryan has made his first move as the Falcons’ football czar. Atlanta announced thehiring of former Browns head coachKevin Stefanski on Saturday, beating the Titans and Ravens to the two-time Coach of the Year. Stefanski is a good coach, but his fit with the Falcons is no slam-dunk. He is walking into another clouded quarterback situation without a ton of resources to overhaul the roster. But he will be taking over a team with enough talent playing in a winnable division.After protracted negotiations on the terms of his contract, John Harbaugh has finally signed on to bethe new Giants head coach. “I expect and want to make the playoffs next year,” Harbaugh told The Athletic after signing his deal, worth $20m a year.Last up on the coaching carousel: Matt LaFleur reached an agreement on a long-term extension with the Packers. There were persistent rumors that Green Bay could move on from LaFleur, whether by firing him or trading him away. Keeping LaFleur was always the logical move, though. He is one of the best offensive schemers in the league. Without costly injuries to Micah Parsons and Tucker Kraft, the Packers may have gone deeper in the playoffs. And if the Packers had let him go, LaFleur would have immediately vaulted to the top of the list of available candidates. In a murky coaching market without a ton of sure things, LaFleur is as close as it gets. Moving on from him in those circumstances would have been lunacy.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsChicago BearsLos Angeles RamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the fate of LeBron James’ record streak of All-Star selections will now be decided by coaches, or perhaps even Commissioner Adam Silver.Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Denver’s Nikola Jokić, the Los Angeles Lakers’ Luka Dončić and San Antonio’s Victor Wembanyama were among those announced Monday as starters – an inexact term this year – for next month’s All-Star Game at the Los Angeles Clippers’ home arena in Inglewood, California. They’re likely heading to the World team, which will take on two teams of US players as part of yet another new format for the midseason showcase.‘Leave Greenland alone!’: US anthem heckler at NBA London game draws cheersRead moreTheNBAannounced 10 starters, five from each conference. Golden State’s Stephen Curry, New York’s Jalen Brunson, Detroit’s Cade Cunningham, Philadelphia’s Tyrese Maxey and Boston’s Jaylen Brown all are presumably headed to the US squads that will play in the three-team, round-robin tournament on 15 February – all 12-minute mini-games, with the top two teams advancing to a 12-minute championship game.But James, for the first time in 22 years, wasn’t among the group selected as a starter. His record run of 20 consecutive All-Star Game appearances – not selections, that streak continued – ended last season when he bowed out citing foot and ankle injuries. He could still be named an All-Star reserve, with those 14 spots to be decided by a polling of NBA head coaches. And he also could get an invite as an injury replacement if one is needed, with Silver picking those players when necessary.James was not named an All-Star in his rookie NBA season.James is in his record-setting 23rd season. His record streak of 1,297 consecutive regular-season games with at least 10 points ended in December, and he has already missed 17 games – meaning he’ll probably have to play in every Lakers game for the rest of the season to be eligible for most postseason awards like All-NBA honors. James has been an All-NBA selection in 21 of his first 22 seasons, including a second-teamer last season.“It’s still as special as the first one was, honestly,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of his All-Star nod. “I grew up watching All-Star games as a kid, dreaming about playing in them. To be able to play in them will always have that same feeling. All the players that I looked up to, that I imitated my game after, played in those games, played on that stage. And for me to be able do so, it’s a blessing and an honor.”Starters were selected through a weighted formula, with fan voting counting for 50% of a player’s ranking, the votes of a 100-member panel of broadcasters and reporters counting for 25% and voting by NBA players themselves counting for the remaining 25%.The US v the World concept was talked about for years before finally becoming a reality this season. The NBA and the NationalBasketballPlayers Association unveiled the long-awaited plan earlier this season, after trying yet again to figure out the latest way to spark renewed interest in the game.Explore more on these topicsLeBron JamesNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Buffalo have reached the playoffs in all but one of the seasons since McDermott took over in 2017, when he helped the Bills reach the postseason for the first time in 17 years. However, they have failed to reach the Super Bowl in that time despite the presence of Josh Allen, one of the best quarterbacks of his generation. Under McDermott, the Bills became the first team to win a playoff game in six straight seasons and not claim a Super Bowl.“Sean helped change the mindset of this organization and was instrumental in the Bills becoming a perennial playoff team,” Bills owner Terry Pegula said in a statement on Monday. “But I feel we are in need of a new structure within our leadership to give this organization the best opportunity to take our team to the next level.”As part of the new structure, Pegula announced he is promoting general manager Brandon Beane to president of football operations. Beane, who also is completing his ninth season in Buffalo, will oversee the coaching search.The pass of the century then brutal reality: the football gods won’t let the Bears have nice thingsRead more“Brandon will oversee all facets of our football operation,” Pegula said. “I have full faith in and have witnessed Brandon’s outstanding leadership style and have confidence in his abilities to lead our organization.”McDermott compiled a 98-50 record in his nine seasons in Buffalo, transforming a team who had languished at the bottom of the AFC East for long periods. But he owned an 8-8 record in the playoffs, and the team have decided they need a fresh approach. The Bills will hope his successor can push Allen and his teammates over the edge and into a Super Bowl.McDermott is one of a number of high-profile coaches recently to end their tenure after struggling in the playoffs. The Ravens fired John Harbaugh, who failed to make the Super Bowl during his time with Lamar Jackson, a quarterback on the same level as Allen. Meanwhile, Mike Tomlin stepped down as Steelers head coach after a streak of postseason losses.McDermott may not be out of a job for long. The Dolphins, Titans, Ravens, Steelers, Raiders, Cardinals and Raiders all have head coaching vacancies.The Bills became a model of stability under McDermott and Beane, who arrived in May 2017. And now they undergo their first coaching search since McDermott took over for Rex Ryan, who was fired after two seasons in Buffalo.McDermott was hired after spending six seasons as the Carolina Panthers’ defensive coordinator. Before that, he broke into theNFLin 1999 as a member of Andy Reid’s first staff in Philadelphia. McDermott worked his way up the ranks to become the Eagles’ defensive coordinator before being fired in 2010.With Allen turning 30 in May, the Bills are expected to target an offensive-minded coach to spur an offense in which the quarterback was too often asked to carry the load. The NFL’s 2024 MVP’s production dropped this season. He finished with 3,668 yards and 25 touchdowns passing, his lowest output since his second season in 2019.The defense struggled in part this season because of a transition to youth and a rash of injuries. Though Buffalo’s defense finished ranked seventh in the NFL in 2025, the unit had difficulty stopping the run. It’s in the playoffs where the defense was criticized for collapsing too often. Buffalo allowed 30 or more points in four of their playoff losses under McDermott.Explore more on these topicsBuffalo BillsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s a rundown of the issues that will shape the tournament as it comes to North AmericaAlexander Abnosin New YorkMon 19 Jan 2026 09.09 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 09.16 ESTShareWe’re only six months from the biggest single sporting occasion in the world. On 19 July in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the men’s World Cup final will kick off and a champion will be crowned (although it will be hard to topthe last one).The final will be more than a coronation (or confirmation, if Argentina repeat as champions). It will also be a culmination of six weeks of near non-stop soccer played across three countries, four time zones, and 16 cities. It’s likely that conclusions will already be drawn at that point on how the whole tournament fared. But for now, at this semi-convenient milestone, it’s worth taking stock of where we are six months out.TicketsShort version:They’re expensive. Longer version: They’re expensive, and seemingly very popular, and those things are connected. Fifa boasted in a recent release that more than 500 million requests for tickets had been made in the recent phase, the third overall but the first to take placesince the draw was madeon 5 December. That follows claims of 2m tickets sold in the second phase, and 1m in the first phase.In a first for a World Cup, Fifa isusing a dynamic pricing modelfor tickets – a practice that adjusts prices according to demand. That means tickets for this World Cup have been, by and large, incredibly expensive.A Guardian analysis from Decemberfound that tickets for the final shot up in price by up to nine times compared with the 2022 edition, adjusted for inflation. What’s more, the steepest increases came at the cheapest price points. Fifa has also moved to control the resale market by operating its own platform, on which both sellers and buyers are charged with a 15% processing fee. In Mexico, fans are only allowed to sell their tickets for what they paid for them and below, thanks to local laws against scalping.Growing sense of embarrassment at Fifa over Donald Trump peace prizeRead moreFifa has claimed that these policies have been instituted to align with common practices in North America, and also to generate the maximum amount of revenue for its member associations. Fifa says this revenue can then be used to fund the development of soccer around the world. But even if you assume the most noble intentions from Fifa, there’s no question that it is pricing out a significant portion of fans.The outcry has spilled into mainstream politics. New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani submitted a petition to Fifa to lower prices, making it a part of his successful election campaign. Several individual supporters’ groups have decried the fact that prices for the most dedicated fans are the same as those for the general public. To quell these protests, Fifaannounced in Decemberthat a portion of tickets for each game will remain at the $60 price floor – an offering representing 1.6% of sellable tickets for the games.There have also been reports of some fan groups cancelling their tickets due to the United States’ domestic and foreign policy (more on that later), but there’s little evidence that has actually happened in significant numbers.The next ticketing window is called the “last minute” phase. Fifa has yet to announce when it will open.View image in fullscreenMetLife Stadium will host the World Cup final.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersTravelWorld Cup travel tends to fall into three categories: Getting to the host country, getting between the host cities, and getting around the cities themselves. All of those categories will present numerous hurdles for those coming from outside North America. The primary ones being cost, availability, immigration issues, and infrastructure. Fans from other countries may also be surprised at the relative lack of public transport to stadiums in the United States in particular compared to previous hosts.Getting into two of the three host countries is fairly straightforward. Citizens of many World Cup nations won’t need a visa to enter Canada for the tournament, but they may need an electronic travel authorization (there’s afull list of who needs what here). A similar arrangement goes for Mexico, where fans from several World Cup-qualified countries are among the list (here) who do not need a visa for tourism. The immigration policies of both countries are not expected to change dramatically between now and kick-off.That is, uh, not the case for the United States, where a new immigration-related policy seems to arrive every week. Last week’s move by the US state department tosuspend visa processing for 75 countries, which includes 14 countries who have already qualified for the World Cup, was thought to be one such wrinkle, but it only applied to visas for people who intend to stay in the country permanently.Donald Trump’s recent travel bans specifically target people arriving from four qualified countries: Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire. There are exceptions for athletes and officials in each country’s World Cup delegation, but fans may run into difficulties acquiring visas to enter the US. Other countries who are not subject to the travel bans but who do need visas will have to apply for the new World Cup fast-track system in order to have realistic hope of making an interview appointment with enough time to spare – US secretary of state Marco Rubio promised the system will get fans appointments within six to eight weeks. However, fans could still be denied entry to the US, and should expect stringent questioning at immigration. Fans from countries who don’t need a visa to visit the US may still be made to provide their social media history and other personal information upon entry – a move supporters’ groupshave called“profoundly unacceptable.”Flights from various World Cup countries to the US, Mexico, and Canada have surged in price, as is to be expected at any World Cup. Likewise, hotel prices in host cities have risen considerably, especially as Fifa has taken thousands of rooms off the market to house players, officials and media. US secretary of transportation Sean Duffy last year encouraged visitors to take a road trip to travel between games – something that won’t realistically be possible for a lot of fans (unless they’re OK with missing out on a bunch of games in order to drive). For example, the winner of Uefa Playoff A (Italy, Northern Ireland, North Macedonia or Bosnia and Herzegovina) will log the most travel in the group stage: More than 3,100 miles, starting in Toronto, then Los Angeles before finishing in Seattle. Group I, where every team will play in either New York/New Jersey, Boston, or Philadelphia, will be far more palatable.The 2026 World Cup final is in … New Jersey? A brief guide to the MetLife StadiumRead moreThe tournament itselfAlready, there is a sense that this World Cup’s expanded 48-team format will have a markedly different feel than in the past, with two-thirds of teams making it out of the group stage. The pressure often felt from the very start is bound to be lower this time around, resulting in a tournament that may need a couple of weeks to really get going. Still, the extra knockout round may make up for that – those win-or-go-home games often throw out some of the best drama the sport has to offer.For the tournament’s vast middle class – countries not as good as the big powers and not as unfancied as the minnows – making it out of the group stage is going to mean far less than it has before. For proof, look no further than one of this year’s co-hosts. For generations of US men’s players, winning a World Cup knockout game was the holy grail. This time around, winning one knockout round game will get the Americans to the round of 16 – the same place where they exited the last two World Cups they’ve played in. Is that success? Expect similar sorts of debates to surround a number of countries.TrumpThe US president has instituted the travel bans mentioned above. He has already received and kept one World Cup trophy, and looks in line for another one. He made himself the center of attention ina moment of sporting glory. He isthe apple of Gianni Infantino’s eye. When asked if he would move to take World Cup games away from “blue” cities,he said yes(he has no unilateral authority to do so). And, oh yes,he won the Fifa Peace Prize.Mere weeks after winning that prize, Trump unilaterally sent troops into Venezuela to capture their leader, Nicolás Maduro. He has deployed masked, armed forces to American cities to round up people who vaguely, possibly may be criminals, immigrants, or both (and who are often neither). He has referred to many of the competing nations at the World Cup as “shithole countries.” And he hasraised tension with several European countriesover the future of Greenland.Will the US president impact the fan experience and other aspects of the World Cup? Take a guess. The only real question at this point is how he’ll do so.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Djokovic started his first match of hisAustralian Opencampaign, also his opening match of the season, by working his way through a breathless 17-stroke rally and then punctuating the exchange with a perfectly timed forehand winner. He could not help but chuckle at his own genius.That blazing start set the tone for a straightforward night inside Rod Laver Arena as Djokovic began his 22nd grand slam season with an effortless 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 win against Spain’s Pedro Martínez. It was the Serb’s 100th win at the Australian Open, a feat he has also achieved at Wimbledon and Roland Garros.Australian Open 2026: Djokovic wins 100th Melbourne match, Swiatek survives scare – as it happenedRead moreDjokovic seems to create history every time he steps on to a tennis court these days, and this occasion was no different. By simply lining up to the baseline against Martínez, Djokovic tied Roger Federer’s record of most main-draw appearances at the Australian Open (21), a tournament he has won a record 10 times, and Federer’s and Feliciano López’s record of most grand slam appearances (81).At 38 years old, Djokovic again finds himself attempting to achieve the borderline impossible by becoming the oldest men’s grand slam title winner in the history of tennis.The odds were always against this being a close match. Martínez is ranked No 71 and most comfortable on clay courts and the ATP Challenger tour. He is a quintessential grinder who simply does not possess the firepower to seriously trouble a player of Djokovic’s calibre most of the time.Still, Djokovic’s performance was a supreme demonstration of his enduring quality. His serving was precise and he tore apart Martínez’s defence with his forehand. Most notably, at his age Djokovic’s movement is still astounding, still narrowing the court with his defence and anticipation while several steps ahead of his opponents.Even now, after so many years and miles in his legs, there is little reason to doubt that Djokovic is still capable of playing top-level tennis. The question is whether he can do so across the best of five sets and particularly five or six matches into the event. Last year, he could not. He reached the semi-finals of all four grand slam tournaments, an immense achievement, but on each occasion he was too worn down exactly when he needed his very best tennis against the top players in the world. Afterretiring from his Australian Open semi-final, he was flattened in his subsequent semi- finalsby Jannik SinnerandCarlos Alcaraz.View image in fullscreenDespite having a tumultuous relationship with fans throughout his career, Novak Djokovic was well supported during his first-round win.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockFor so long Djokovic was, to many, the unwanted third man who had stepped in and ruined the duopoly between Federer and Rafael Nadal, and the mixed reception he has received from certain crowds has been a continuous topic throughout his career. Those days are long gone.In this latter part of his career, with the finishing line drawing ever closer, Djokovic’s status as the tour’s elder statesman has endeared him even to many of his detractors.While past crowds would have cheered fiercely for his challenger, on Monday, Rod Laver Arena was united in its support and adulation. A seven-minute on-court interview followed, a spectacle that was usually reserved for Federer. Djokovic had his audience in the palm of his hand as he spoke gleefully about his longevity.“I was very fortunate early on in my career to encounter some people that taught me and guided me to play the long shot in my career – not to burn out too quickly, take care of my body, of my mind and try to have as long a career as possible,” he said.View image in fullscreenStan Wawrinka became the second oldest man to win a singles match at the Australian Open after his first-round win.Photograph: Shi Tang/Getty ImagesFew athletes attract drama like Djokovic, but this year he took the decision to remove himself from a particularly dramatic situation. He opted tostep away from the PTPA, the purported player association he co-founded, which filed a class‑action lawsuit against the ATP, WTA, ITF and the four grand slam tournaments last year. This week the organisation confirmed it had come to a settlement with Tennis Australia while the conflict continues. Djokovic, however, is focused entirely on extracting the most out of his career for however long he has left on the court.Monday was a positive day for veteran champions. Earlier, Stan Wawrinka became the second-oldest man to win a singles match at the Australian Open as he recovered from a set down to edge past Laslo Djere of Serbia 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) and reached the second round. Wawrinka, now 40, will retire at the end of the season after a supreme career that includes three grand slam titles at the Australian, French and US Open.“I know I’m not as good as I was before,” Wawrinka said. “I know I’m not physical and tennis-wise as I was before. That’s normal. I’m getting old. But I’m still happy with what I’m doing, always trying to push my own limit, always trying to be better. I’m happy that I had the chance to win match in slams here.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Novak DjokovicAustralian OpenTennisAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Notably, the shortlist does not include Lee Corso, a garrulous showman who went on to become a much-belovedmascot head weareron ESPN’s College GameDay set; or Sam Wyche, who managed just three wins in 1983 before bolting weeks after a season-ending loss to Purdue (the middle child in the state’s three-way college football rivalry) for the NFL.But in a twist some may be tempted to describe as miraculous, the Hoosiers will face 10th-seeded Miami at Hard Rock Stadium (the Hurricanes’ home field) for the chance to win their first national title in school history – not because the selection committee felt sorry for them or because the number of eligible teams was tripled or because of a Donald Trump penstroke. No, the Hoosiers actuallybelong.They who were last are now first – in the AP poll, in the playoff seedings, in football nightmare fuel. Some say this season’s Hoosiers could go down as college football’s best-ever team, eclipsing Joe Burrow’s2019 LSU Tigers.Fernando Mendoza, Indiana’spious starting quarterback, recently recalled the urgency and intensity that his defensive teammates brought to their first practices together back in the summer; hethought to himself,This is either the best defense in the country, or I’m not as good as I thought I was.The Hoosiers enter Monday’s championship game having won all 15 of their games by a nation-leading 31.1 points and having beaten the five top-10 ranked opponents on their schedule by an average of more than two touchdowns. They reached this stage after knocking out defending national champion Ohio State in November’s Big Ten title game,dispensing with 18-time national champion Alabamain the playoff quarter-final, andthrashing conference rival Oregonin the semi-final.All the while Hoosiers fans have followed every step of this postseason demolition march, overrunning the playoff’s neutral venues with crimson and cream garb and ear-splitting support. At the end of the game against Alabama, as falling rose petals fell to punctuate the Hoosiers’ triumph, Cole stood inside the Rose Bowl – still three-quarters full with Indiana supporters – and thought,There are more fans here than can fit in our home stadium. “This whole season has been a daydream,” he says. “The reality is just beyond me.”View image in fullscreenIndiana fans have been enjoying the best football season in their school’s history.Photograph: Thomas J Russo/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockIfNotre Dame’s Rudywas a charming underdog story, Indiana’s rise is sci-fi stuff. The timeline skip happened when the Hoosiers hired Curt Cignetti, the black sheep of Nick Saban’saugust coaching tree. Part of Saban’s inaugural Alabama staff from 2007 through 2010, Cignetti coached receivers and handled recruiting for the Crimson Tide, helping the team to a national championship with a star-studded class that included Heisman Trophy-winning tailback Mark Ingram II and future NFL All-Pro receiver Julio Jones.But while fellow assistants Jim McElwain and Kirby Smart swiftly parlayed their successes under Saban into coveted head coaching posts at Florida and Georgia, respectively, Cignetti’s only head coaching shots came in the lower tiers – and he slogged there for 11 seasons before Indiana hired the 64-year-old in late 2023 from James Madison, where he’d lay the foundation for theirsimilarly improbableplayoff debut this year. In 2024 Cignetti guided the Hoosiers to an 11-2 mark and a surprise playoff matchup with Notre Dame, the eventual runners-up.Despite the dramatic turnaround, the media remained skeptical of Cignetti’s ability to sustain the momentum. The doubt wasn’t entirely without merit given that 2024 marked Indiana’s first double-digit win season in history and just the fourth above-.500 finish since Dan Quayle, another proud Hoosier, was vice-president. And yet Cignetti, an unblinking grudge holder in the Knight mould who has never endured a losing season as a head coach, takes extreme offense whenever Indiana’s sudden arrival is dismissed as a fluke.View image in fullscreenCurt Cignetti, a former assistant to legendary Alabama coach Nick Saban, has led a remarkable turnaround at Indiana.Photograph: Mike Zarrilli/UPI/Shutterstock“A lot of that negative stuff in the media fueled the guys returning from this team,” Cignetti said in a news conference before the semi-final win over Oregon. “We added some real key pieces, and the main one’s sitting right here on my left.”He was nodding at Mendoza, a Miami nativeand productive starter at Cal before he joined up with Cignetti’s juggernaut this year and became theonly Heisman Trophy winner in Hoosiers historyand the first ever Cuban-American recipient of the award. While the established powers hoover up highly regarded young recruits in hopes of winning with raw talent, Cignetti fills his rosters with mercenary “super seniors” who win with solid fundamentals and sound execution. Not surprisingly, Indiana’s new way of doing business in the pay-to-play era of college sports has given rise tojealous whispersand cheating allegations. In this rogue reality, that reads as a compliment.Ultimately, the protests just provided extra motivation. It isn’t lost on Alabama fans that Saban’s black sheep assistant beat this year’s team and Oregon’s hotshot coach Dan Lanning (a former Alabama grad assistant) to set up a showdown with Miami – another program that has been reborn under a former Alabama assistant, Mario Cristobal.Longtime college football observers may feel a nostalgic temptation to frame this championship game as a battle between the converts in the heartland and “convicts” on the coast. But as the American government’s role in higher education has pivoted from instructor to hall monitor, the reality on the ground is stark. At Indiana, pro-Palestinian protests drew state policewith rifles on rooftops, while coverage of the university’s poor free speech ranking precededa short-lived funding cutto its 158-year-old student paper’s print edition.40 years on, did Proposition 48 protect US college sports – or punish Black athletes?Read moreMeanwhile, at Miami – aka Marco Rubio’slaw school alma mater– a respected neurology professor who shared a critical tweet about Charlie Kirk wasforced to resign amid conservative outcry, while the university rushed to comply with a 2025 executive ordertargeting race and gender studies(among other decrees against “wokeness”), scrubbing DEI websites and renaming affinity organizations as students called out the school for betraying its much touted “culture of belonging”.Indiana and Miami illustrate higher education’s retreat amid conservative pressure during the second Trump era, a notion that was unthinkable years ago. It wouldn’t be a surprise to see Trump himself crash Monday night’s game, givenhis habit of stealing the spotlightfrom major US sporting events and Hard Rock’s relative proximity to Mar-a-Lago. (It’s a rare home game for him.)“This is the great American story in a lot of ways, a walking, talking contradiction,” says Cole, the UCLA professor and author of The Campus Color Line, a history of the role college presidents played in shaping 20th-century civil rights reforms on and off campus. “On the one hand, you’ve got great teams to root for. And then on the other, beyond questionable decisions happening on campuses.”Since its inception, college football has asked fans to compartmentalize – how much can you love the team without fully embracing the institution behind it? In these topsy-turvy times, Indiana’s stunning rise makes the old logic feel like a sudden inversion.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsIndianaUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jones had been battling hard on court 15 at Melbourne Park, chasing her first grand slam main-draw win at the fifth attempt, when she slipped and fell. She instantly felt a tear in her glute muscle. Jones soon had no choice but to retire from herAustralian Openfirst-round match while trailing 6-2, 3-2 against Linda Klimovicova, a 21-year-old Polish qualifier.“I’m at a career high,” Jones said. “I’m probably in the main draws of the Masters, and then you are thinking: ‘Should I continue, do I fight because it’s a slam?’ There’s money, there’s points on the line. Equally with my history, it’s probably not the smartest thing to keep pushing. I’m just having that internal debate.”Australian Open 2026: Swiatek, Djokovic and Andreeva in action on day two – liveRead moreA dramatic second day in Melbourne underlined the physical challenges of competing at the highest level as numerous players retired from their first-round matches because of injuries. Félix Auger‑Aliassime,the men’s seventh seed and one of the most in-form players in the world, bowed out meekly in his opening match against Nuno Borges of Portugal, retiring with cramp on John Cain Arena while trailing 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.It was a similarly miserable day for Auger-Aliassime’s compatriot Marina Stakusic, a talented 21-year-old player from Canada. Stakusic began to experience severe cramps in both legs in her match against the local wildcard Priscilla Hon and, while trailing 1-6, 6-4, 5-3, she collapsed. Aided by Hon, Stakusic left the court in a wheelchair. Conditions were hardly extreme, the forecast reading 29C (84.2F) with 29% humidity. The Australian Open heat‑stress scale peaked at 1.9 out of 5, signalling temperate playing conditions.Auger-Aliassime had arrived playing some of the best tennis of his career, rising into the top five. A quarter-finalist in 2022, he had hopes of following up his US Open semi-final appearance with another deep run before his tournament quickly unravelled. “I just knew it wasn’t heading in the right direction,” he said. “I don’t like to be on the court that way. I want to be on the court winning. I want to be on the court competing with my opponent. I don’t want to be just standing there like a punching bag.”View image in fullscreenFélix Auger-Aliassime was at a loss to find a reason for his body letting him down after the first set in Melbourne.Photograph: Fred Lee/Getty ImagesThis defeat was particularly painful for Auger-Aliassime because he felt he had prepared well and everything was in place before the first grand slam tournament of the year. Now he has to figure out why his body let him down. “I don’t have all the answers now,” he said. “I’m trying to be very professional at everything I do, prepare well. I love this sport, and I love to play. So I try to do everything I can in my control to get ready.“It hurts even more, because if I was self-aware and I was, like, ‘Well, I wasn’t really ready or I wasn’t doing everything,’ then you have to be honest with yourself. But even with being honest with myself, I’m not totally finding the reasons why this is happening. It wasn’t happening in the past, so I’ll have to figure it out.”Jones’s circumstances, meanwhile, are unique. She has ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia, a rare genetic syndrome that has resulted in her having three fingers and a thumb on each hand along with several other physical issues. Jones has struggled badly with injuries throughout her career but she insists they are not a direct consequence of her condition.“I don’t relate to any of the retirements directly to what could be referred to as ‘kid with a syndrome’. I don’t relate to any of that. I think what I relate it to … is that I don’t think I had a team in place and the expertise that I needed from a younger age. So my age might say 25, but my physical journey, I’m still quite early in. I think that’s where my tennis level is so much higher than my physical journey, and I’m trying to match those up every year and every time.”Jones, who sits at a career high ranking of No 69 after the best season of her life, has now retired in three of her five main draw and qualifying matches at the Australian Open. Through frustration and tears she was resolute. “It hurts a lot,” she said. “But if I was someone that didn’t know how to pick myself up quickly, [I] would be effed. I don’t know what the better way to say that is; I’d have no capacity to be where I am right now.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For this to happen at all was embarrassing, for it to happen in the final of the confederation’s showpiece would have been a humiliation – not least because many may have felt that Senegal had a point. Refereeing has been a topic of discussion in this tournament in a way it should never be.Senegal face sanctions for Afcon final walk-off as organisers criticise ‘unacceptable’ conductRead moreTanzania, Cameroon and Nigeria had complained in the previous knockout rounds that Morocco had received preferential treatment from referees and, here, critics of the hosts would have found vindication. In the 92nd minute, Senegal had a goal ruled out for innocuous contact between Abdoulaye Seck and Achraf Hakimi as they tussled for a header at the back post, the referee’s whistle blowing before Ismaïla Sarr had turned the ball over the line, meaning VAR could not intervene. Four minutes later, at the other end, VAR penalised El Hadji Malick Diouf for slight contact on Brahim Díaz as the two contested a corner.Senegal already felt aggrieved. They had lodged an official protest about what they claimed were attempts by the local organising committee to undermine them.They protestedabout a lack of security at Rabat-Agdal train station when they arrived from Tangier, about the accommodation they were initially offered, about the provision of training facilities and about the lack of tickets available for Senegalese fans.There were repeated attempts, by ballboys, Morocco subs and flagbearers to steal the goalkeeper Édouard Mendy’s towel, as had happened to Nigeria’s Stanley Nwabali in the semi-final. In the final, Senegal’s players, encouraged by their coach Pape Thiaw, walked off.Mané, though, lingered by the touchline. He sought advice from Claude Le Roy, the 77-year-old Frenchman who has coached a string of African teams, including Senegal. The former Senegal, Bolton and Liverpool forward El Hadji Diouf was involved as well. Mané ran down the tunnel and persuaded his teammates to return.“Not the best things can happen in football because football is something special and the world is watching,” he said in a breathless post-match interview. “The world loves football. I think football is just a pleasure so I think we just need to give a special, a great, great image of football.“I think we would be crazy not to play this game because the referee gave a penalty and so we go out of the game. I think this was going to be the worst thing in, especially, African football, for me this cannot … I would rather lose than this kind of thing happen to our football. I think it’s really, really bad. Football should not ever stop to come back for 10 minutes, but what can I do? What can we do? I think we just have to accept … and deal with it. I thought good things would happen if we came back and played the game and that’s what happened.”Díaz’s penalty was saved, but that wasn’t the end of Mané’s involvement. When the penalty had been awarded, Senegal fans at the other end of the ground had reacted furiously. Chairs were thrown, advertising hoardings fell down and there appeared to be an attempt to invade the pitch before riot police intervened. Before extra time began, Mané approached those fans and appealed, successfully, for calm.The 33-year-old has a profound sense of responsibility on and off pitch. He has built a hospital and a school in his home town of Bambali, providing free education and healthcare, while also funding electricity and wifi for the inhabitants. When the squad captain Kalidou Koulibaly, who was suspended, went up to collect the trophy, he insisted Mané join him. Without his leadership, there might not have been a final to win (and there will, still, surely be sanctions for Senegal).Senegal have won two Cups of Nations and Mané has been integral to both. Nobody who isn’t Egyptian has won more Cups of Nations than him, and he joins Roger Milla and Ahmed Hassan in a very select club to have been named best player at a Cup of Nations twice.But Sunday was about more than that; it was about understanding his responsibility to Senegal, to Africa and to football.Trivia questionManchester Uniteddefeated Manchester City 2-0at Old Trafford on Saturday, further denting City’s efforts at challenging Arsenal for the Premier League title.

How many of those games have Manchester United won?a)Oneb)Fourc)Nined)13On this day …These days, questions about amateur status always seem, at best, vaguely quaint and, at worst, stories of exploitation, but there was a time when they were taken very seriously indeed. The Football Association was founded in 1863 by former university men with a profound belief that it was somehow unseemly to be paid for playing sport, which was fine for the southern clubs made up of wealthy former public schoolboys. To the clubs from the northern industrial cities, though, whose players tended to be factory workers, miners and shipbuilders, it seemed wrong that when people paid to watch games, the players shouldn’t benefit.Crisis point was reached on 19 January 1884 when Upton Park drew 1-1 at Preston in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Upton Park, proudly amateur, complained that Preston had been paying their players – which they didn’t deny, insisting compensation for work missed while training and playing was only fair. Preston were disqualified, but that provoked a backlash from the northern clubs and threats of a breakaway professional football association. Recognising the direction of travel, the FA relented, and on 20 July 1885 professionalism was legalised. Three years later, the Football League was founded to offer regular fixtures for professional clubs.Elsewhere on the GuardianPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionZohran Mamdani’s Afcon watch party brings African football to a New York landmarkGrowing sense of embarrassment at Fifa over Donald Trump peace prizeUS watchIt was a quiet weekend for most Americans abroad, with two notable exceptions in the English Championship.Haji Wrightcame on as a substitute and scored a late winner for Coventry City against Leicester City.

For a moment he seemed baffled by the question, then he explained that those moments are what he lives for. Where others feel pressure, he sees opportunity.What, you wonder, did Brahim Díaz seeduring the Afcon finalon Sunday? When his shoulder was tugged by El Hadji Malick Diouf and he collapsed, did he consider the consequences? When he howled in the face of the Democratic Republic of the Congo referee Jean-Jacques NdalaNgambo as he waited for the verdict of the video assistant referee, did it occur to him he would take the penalty if it were given? He had scored one against Mali in the group stage, but that was with Achraf Hakimi, a very fine penalty taker, off the pitch.Senegal face sanctions for Afcon final walk-off as organisers criticise ‘unacceptable’ conductRead morePerhaps if Díaz had taken it immediately, after Ngambo had reviewed the incident on the screen and pointed to the spot, adrenaline would have carried him through. But instead he had to wait 15 minutes asSenegal left the pitch in protestbefore Sadio Mané persuaded them to return.What went through his head then? Against Mali, he had sidefooted his penalty low to his left, as the goalkeeper, Djigui Diarra, went the other way. Did it occur to him that Édouard Mendy, the Senegal keeper, would have seen that? What game of bluff and counter-bluff played out in his mind as he waited, not knowing when – or even if – Senegal would return.At some point, he decided on a Panenka. There have been those who have criticised him for opting for such a high-risk penalty at such a crucial moment. But then, the original, taken by Antonin Panenka to win the shootout for Czechoslovakia against West Germany in the final of the 1976 European Championship was at just such a crucial moment.2:36'It was Hitchcockian': Morocco and Senegal react to Afcon final and walk-off chaos – videoPanenka’s logic was that a high-pressure moment was the perfect time to try it because the goalkeeper would never expect it. That was 50 years ago, three months after Morocco won their first, and only, Cup of Nations. The world is more familiar with dinked penalties. Was Díaz trying to win the competition with a flourish? Or did he simply think that was the best way to score, that Mendy would dive one way or the other?He kissed the ball, placed it on the spot. He walked back. Looking at the replay, he perhaps seems to be blinking more than usual, but that may be an observation shaped by knowledge of what was to come guiding the perception. He blew out his cheeks, approached the ball … and slowed down.Panenka insisted the deceleration should come at the last, not in the run-up, but in the strike. Díaz duffed the kick.View image in fullscreenÉdouard Mendy catches Brahim Díaz’s Panenka penalty 15 minutes after it was awarded.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesIt wasn’t even a good Panenka. Even if Mendy had been fooled, there is a chance he might have been able to save it with an outstretched leg.But he was not fooled. Five years ago, Mendysaved a Panenka from Sergio Agüeroin a league game for Chelsea against Manchester City. He did it again, catching the ball so easily many wondered whether Díaz missed on purpose, whether some deal had been done to get Senegal back on the pitch. There was a strange calm as the ball dollied into Mendy’s grasp. Nobody celebrated. But the forward’s evident devastation told its own story.“Do you really believe that with one minute left, when a country has been waiting for this for 50 years … do you think we would agree on something?” Mendy said. “He wanted to score, I get the credit for stopping it, that’s all. Let’s put an end to this. Díaz tried to score, and I just did my job. I stayed calm facing that Panenka and managed to save it. It’s time to close this debate.”Poor Díaz must now live with that. He was the tournament golden boot winner, scoring five times, but it was the sixth he did not score that will be for ever remembered, his award now a dread reminder of failure.His coach, Walid Regragui, was unsympathetic. “We stopped the match in the eyes of the world for 10 minutes,” he said. “That didn’t help Brahim. That doesn’t excuse Brahim for the way he hit the penalty. He hit it like that and we have to accept it.”View image in fullscreenA desolate Brahim Díaz (left) poses with the golden boot alongside Sadio Mané, who won player of the tournament and Yassine Bounou, who won best goalkeeper.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesDíaz was in tears as he left the pitch and reports suggest he was inconsolable in the dressing room.Moroccan newspapers were united in their criticism. Al Mountakhab said he had taken the kick “very badly” and Al-Alam spoke of “inexplicable carelessness”. While Al-Massae preferred to condemn Regragui’s “tactical approach” it made clear the scale of the defeat, describing the “tears of regret of millions of Moroccans”.As Regragui observed, football is often a cruel game. For seven games, Díaz excelled, but his tournament will be defined by one incident 23 minutes after the scheduled final whistle. His task is to ensure it does not also define his career.Explore more on these topicsMorocco football teamAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Senegal football teamAfrica Cup of NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Spurs support were so incensed by the result and the continuation of the team’s terrible Premier League form – they have won twice in their past 13 league matches – that they demanded Frank be “sacked in the morning”.It’s so toxic at Spurs even West Ham were shocked: Frank’s race looks run | Jacob SteinbergRead moreFrank has survived, for now, and will be in the dugout for the Champions League tie at home against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. It remains to be seen whether it proves to be merely a stay of execution. Frank has a selection crisis for the Dortmund clash, with only 11 available outfield players – three of whom he said would struggle to complete the 90 minutes. His back is firmly against the wall.However, Frank came out fighting on Monday and took it as a positive that he was able to have a friendly lunch with three of the club’s main powerbrokers. They were the chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, the sporting director, Johan Lange, and Nick Beucher, the son-in-law of one of the owners, Vivienne Lewis.“I’ve just been feeling the trust,” Frank said. “I’ve said that at every press meeting … that there is backing and support. I had lunch with Nick and Vinai and Johan today, so all good. I know it’s part of the media circus. The only focus I have is to do everything I can for us to win against Dortmund.“We had a good conversation about life and football, the future of the club, everything normal. Of course, there’s a little bit of stormy weather out there. I just think it’s an extremely good sign because normally people are running away if there’s bad news or bad weather coming. They’re normally not coming in and being friendly for lunch.”Frank knows it will be a tall order against Dortmund, especially with such depleted resources. The German club are second in the Bundesliga, having lost once in the competition all season. They have been beaten only once in the Champions League, too. Frank was asked whether the Spurs executives had given him any assurances in the event of another defeat.“It’s a nice question,” he said. “I haven’t heard any situation like that in football where they say: ‘Hey, mate, if you win tomorrow, no problem. If you lose tomorrow, no problem.’”View image in fullscreenFrank presides over training in preparation for the game against Dortmund.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersFrank’s continued employment can be seen as an extraordinary show of faith by a board who have not wanted to jettison him; they are mindful of the problems he has faced, not all of which have been of his own making. On the other hand, the questions continue to come thick and fast. Has Frank remained in the job because of the absence of a suitable and available interim alternative? Would it have been prudent to bring someone else in for such a difficult game and with the squad situation as it is?Frank sought to radiate positivity. When he walked out for training on Monday afternoon, he was asked how he was. “I’m fine,” he replied. “The sun is shining. We are playing football.” Which was a nice answer, albeit one that overlooked the fact the skies were grey.Frank said fine margins had gone against his team in the West Ham game – and others of late, includingthe defeat at Bournemouth. The players, he stressed, were still running and giving their all. “If your back is against the wall, you fight,” he said. “And that’s what I do.”Yet the team news was worryingly bleak. Just before training, the club announced that Ben Davies was to undergo surgery to repair the ankle fracture sustained against West Ham. Then João Palhinha did not emerge for the session, with the rest of a group bulked up by young players. He remains out. “When it rains, it pours,” Frank said.Xavi Simons did not train either, having damaged an ankle against West Ham when he was on the end of a tackle from behind by Jarrod Bowen. Simons, though, is poised to play against Dortmund. Frank will miss 13 players, including the suspended Micky van de Ven. Spurs’ new signing, Conor Gallagher, is ineligible.“It was a bad tackle from Bowen, not that Bowen is a bad guy and would do anything intentional,” Frank said. “Xavi has a swollen ankle but, because he’s so strong mentally, he will play through pain. While we are there, I can’t understand why that isn’t a red card [for Bowen] when a red card is when Xavi accidentally put his foot on Virgil van Dijk [and was sent off against Liverpool].View image in fullscreenXavi Simons sprawls on the turf clutching his ankle after being tackled by Jarrod Bowen.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPA“We have 11 [outfield] players available and we maybe have three that need to push massively to get through 90 minutes physically. That’s why we need everyone to support us from minute one. Especially the players, especially if it’s not going too well. If we do get that support, everything can happen. Magic can happen.”Frank has chosen to reinstate the fit-again Dominic Solanke into his Champions League squad at the expense of Mathys Tel, who drops out for the second time this season. Frank had recalled Tel before Spurs’ sixth league phase game against Slavia Prague to replace Solanke, who had been injured for more than 60 days. The rules allowed Frank to reverse that decision and he has taken up the option.Tel is understood to be extremely surprised, having started the past four matches. Frank’s decision to substitute Tel and send on Solanke against West Ham was booed by the Spurs support.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

Jesus is the only member of Arsenal’s squad who has won the title having picked up four winners’ medals during his time at Manchester City.Thomas Frank insists ‘everything normal’ despite turmoil at TottenhamRead moreThe Brazil striker is out of contract at the end of next season and admitted he has yet to hold talks over extending his deal. But Jesus, who has just returned from almost a year out with a knee injury, insisted he wants to remain at Arsenal because he has unfinished business in north London.“My first target is to be healthy,” he said. “This is my fourth season at Arsenal and hopefully I play maybe one and a half, two and then the rest with injuries. So, I just try to be fit. My wish is to stay at Arsenal – I want to extend my contract. I want to stay. I want to win trophies with Arsenal because I come here with a purpose and that’s it. But obviously, the reality is different.”Asked whether Arsenal now have the mentality to win trophies after coming so close in recent seasons, Jesus said: “We are getting closer. Unfortunately, the last three seasons since I’m here at Arsenal, we finished in second. But we are in good shape – we are happy we are in the position that we are winning games. I do believe we can win.”Arsenal need only a point to ensure their progression to the Champions League knockout stages as they prepare to face an Inter side thatbeat them 1-0 in San Siroin the competition last season. The Serie A leaders are now managed by Cristian Chivu.It will be a fourth away game in succession in different competitions for Arteta’s side – the first time an English top‑flight team has faced that scenario – and the Arsenal manager was keen to stress the importance of avoiding adding to their schedule with two extra games in the playoff round.“That’s massive, we know that,” Arteta said. “If we win we know that’s going to be the case so let’s make it happen.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

A touch on his chest bought time to set himself, before a wonderful bicycle kick sent the Amex Stadium wild.‘We are getting closer’: Gabriel Jesus targets trophies and staying at ArsenalRead moreIt meant the spoils were shared and ensured the game was not decided by the belated award of a first-half penalty that had sent anyone of a Brighton disposition into a fury. The spot-kick had not initially been given – the referee, Paul Tierney, instead punishing Amine Adli for what he deemed to be a dive. He then changed his mind and pointed to the spot after viewing the pitchside monitor and identifying that the Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen’s leg had touched the Moroccan as he tumbled to the ground. How much contact is too much contact? Does anyone even know any more?Marcus Tavernier duly converted and, for so long, it looked likely to be the game’s only goal. But Kostoulas’s late acrobatics denied Bournemouth a first away win since August.“For me it’s not a penalty,” said Fabian Hürzeler, who also expressed his anger at what he deemed was Bournemouth time-wasting late on. “But we have to accept that people make mistakes. In this situation, it’s contact a little bit, but it’s not a foul.”Asked whose errors were to blame, he replied: “Everyone who was involved in this situation. I’m very surprised. It doesn’t make sense. The whole process doesn’t make sense.“A touch and a contact is not enough, and that is what the referees said to us before the start of the season. And in certain moments they don’t do it – that’s just the truth, and we’ve got to accept it.”View image in fullscreenAmine Adli goes down after contact with Bart Verbruggen, leading to a Bournemouth penalty.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty ImagesThat Bournemouth could not quite hold on to their lead – visibly wilting as the match wore on – was perhaps no surprise given their current player predicament. Injuries and departures have robbed Andoni Iraola of his squad depth, meaning he had four academy players on the substitutes’ bench and precious few attacking options to call upon.The goalscorer Tavernier also departed in the second half with what Iraola suggested was a hamstring injury. The Bournemouth manager confirmed that the club are expected to finalise a deal for the Ferencvaros midfielder Alex Toth on Tuesday, but he called for more signings to be made this month. “We are in a very delicate situation,” Iraola said.“You could see today. We are demanding the same players to play every game, every minute. The players are giving us everything. We definitely need help – it’s very clear. The club is working on signing new players. Everyone understands.”Although Bournemouth’s goal arrived in controversial fashion, it was reward for their first-half dominance that answered Iraola’s demands to start quickly, given the likelihood that his players would tire as the match progressed.For all that Brighton enjoyed the lion’s share of possession, the hosts had nothing like the threat of their opponents whenever they ventured into the final third – the forward quartet of Tavernier, Eli Junior Kroupi, Adli and Evanilson repeatedly exhibiting their ability to cause problems for opposition defenders in Bournemouth’s post-Antoine Semenyo era.The home crowd made their sentiments abundantly clear when booing the referee both off the pitch at the end of the first period and back on to it after the break. Their fury was exacerbated by Tierney ignoring Brighton’s own penalty appeals, and it was frequently piqued when Bournemouth players attempted to wind the clock down through various methods as it ticked towards 90 minutes.View image in fullscreenMarcus Tavernier’s converts from the spot to give Bournemouth a first-half lead.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty ImagesBy that point, Kostoulas had replaced Danny Welbeck up front for Brighton. With Bournemouth sitting ever deeper, the hosts threatened with increasing frequency until the Greek teenager struck in memorable fashion.“That was unbelievable,” the Brighton captain, Lewis Dunk, said of Kostoulas’s goal. “He’s a special talent. You’ve seen glimpses, and there will be many more things to come from him.”Of most importance was Brighton’s failure to win. Hürzeler’s side have now been victorious just once in nine league games as they struggle to launch a bid for European qualification. “Our performance wasn’t good enough,” the manager said. “We have to take responsibility.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Thanks to the club for bringing him here. He [is] the perfect age, [can play] for many years and can play [on the] right, left.”With the frontline defenders Rúben Dias, John Stones and Josko Gvardiol injured, Guéhi’s arrival is timely. “I know how he wanted to choose us and help with the problems that we have in the back in the next few months so it’s really important he’s here,” Guardiola said.Guéhi said: “This move feels like the culmination of all the hard work I have put into my career. I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad of players.”The defender’s former club Chelsea are due to receive 20% of the fee, as part of the package that took him to Palace in 2021.City travel to Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday night, sitting in fourth place in the table, one point ahead of Liverpool in ninth. They conclude the league stage at home against Galatasaray next week.The top eight will go straight in to the last-16 phase and, with that in mind, Guardiola held a workout for the squad on the artificial pitch at the Norwegian club’s Aspmyra Stadion on Monday night. It was a departure from his usual practice of training the day before a European match. He is clear the pitch does not offer an excuse. “Life is never a red carpet,” he said.“The quicker you adapt to uncomfortable situations the closer you are to success. If I start to cry because of this, we don’t achieve what we did in the past. Of course it is different – that’s why we train the night before when we have never done that before. We have to see how the ball bounces, how the short passes and long passes [play].”Guardiola was questioned aboutthe 2-0 derby defeat at Manchester Unitedon Saturday. “Tomorrow is another game, another competition and I look forward,” he said.“The schedule is so demanding. Carlos Alcaraz is one of the best tennis players in history and I read an interview with him before the Australian Open that said what I cannot imagine for me: he had nine weeks resting. We don’t have that. We have mental fatigue, we don’t have time to train, while Carlos Alcaraz is changing a bit of his serve.”Guardiola was asked whether the Norwegian winger Oscar Bobb would be at City when the window closes. “I don’t have an idea. He says he’s not fit so he’s not fit at the moment.”Bodø’s location within the Arctic Circle means the aurora borealis can often be seen. Guardiola said: “I was in Oslo and Lofoten one year ago and it is top. I’m not a scientist to analyse why it appears in the sky. Now I just admire it. With a glass of red wine it is even better. I will be in the hotel tonight with big windows and will enjoy it.

Central to the disagreement is how duty of candour in the public authority (accountability) bill would apply to serving intelligence officers.The law –designed to stop official cover-ups– would mean those in public office who lie or evade would face prosecution. The government has agreed the law should cover the security services, but wants to give agency chiefs the final say over when individual officers can give evidence, a power the families say is unacceptable and could lead to future cover-ups.On Friday, the government laid down its own amendments to the bill, which put further obligations on the security services – but still did not go far enough to gain agreement.A Labour source said there was now no option but to delay the bill until a compromise could be reached that was acceptable to the families and did not affect national security. Families, along with the barrister Pete Weatherby, the architect of the law, met the ministers Alex Davies-Jones and Nick Thomas-Symonds in the Ministry of Justice on Monday, but left without agreement.Speaking at a press conference earlier on Monday, Starmer said he was determined to find a solution. “I care hugely that we get this right, that we right the wrongs for very many families who have been let down and ensure a better future for families,” he said.“In relation to the duty of candour, we’ve been clear that that matters. What we’re now trying to do is make sure we get the balance right when it comes to the application of any principle to the security and intelligence agencies.“Obviously, I have to focus on the national interest – my primary duty as prime minister, which is to keep this country safe and secure. That is the duty I hold above all other duties, and I take it really seriously, which is why we’re taking time to make sure that we get that balance absolutely right.”MPs said they were relieved the government had pulled the bill from Commons business – but it may now not return for many weeks. About 20 Labour MPs had signed an amendment from theLiverpoolWest Derby MP, Ian Byrne, which was in line with the families’ demands.The bill will need to return to the Commons for the report stage and third reading, as well as go through the Lords.A government source said they were “not putting a deadline” on the talks and that agreement would be needed with the families, the intelligence agencies, the Home Office and Foreign Office, and the intelligence and security committee. Starmer is likely to be involved personally at the later stages of the talks.Byrne had said he would not be able to support the legislation with the government’s amendments included. The Liverpool city region mayor, Steve Rotheram and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham,said on Saturdaythat the government amendment “risks undermining the spirit of the legislation” and “creates too broad an opt-out” for the security services.The campaign group Hillsborough Law Now said it welcomed the government “listening to the campaign, families, MPs and supporters by withdrawing their security services amendment”.Davies-Jones, parliamentary undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Justice, said on Monday night there was “no arbitrary deadline” on when MPs will next debate and vote on the bill, because the families of the victims have asked her not to set one.“They want us to get it right, and we’re committed to doing that and to getting this policy correct,” she told MPs in the Commons. “As soon as we have more information, I will bring that forward to the house.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLabourKeir StarmerLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Real Sociedad’s new coach could feel it; he could hear it too, the sound of drums beating on every street of the city he has embraced and into the stadium that has embraced him back already. When he and his players arrived at Anoeta on Sunday evening, they entered through a guard of honour, a band of soldiers and chefs lined up in the rain, hammering out the club anthem and hoping. By the time they departed around midnight, following 35,346 supporters out into San Sebastián, it had actually happened.La Realhad beaten Barcelona 2-1. Celebrations, his captain Mikel Oyarzabal said, had come a day early.This week istamborrada, the San Sebastián festival where, at midnight on 20 January, the city flag is raised and marching bands parade through its streets in Napoleonic uniforms and cooks’ costumes grasping sticks, batons and giant cutlery, routes mapped out in loving detail and special supplements. Initially it was a popular pastiche of a military procession, a prelude to carnival, practice runs echoing round in the days before, kids go first, adults next. An expression of civic pride, they sing of “spreading joy,” being “always happy,” and God knows they were happy now. What better way to begin it all than this? What better way to become one of them?It had started with the first bands setting off towards the ground at 7pm, the guard of honour, and a 300-strong orchestra on the pitch for kick-off, the tenor and the festival’s “golden drum” winner Xabier Anduaga belting out the anthems, a 300-strong city symphonic accompanying him. It began too with Oyarzabal, “golden drum” in 2024, appearing to score the opening goal after 24 seconds, the place exploding. And although that goal was ruled out, Oyarzabal got another on 31 minutes, volleying past Joan García, and it ended withla Realending Barcelona’s 11-game winning run. “This was a special night,” Matarazzo said.View image in fullscreenPellegrino Matarazzo issues tactical instructions to his Real Sociedad players.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockIt was also pretty silly. Barcelona had won their last 11 games, their best run in a decade. In none of them did they play better this. “There’s no scientific reason forla Realleading at half-time,” El Diario Vasco reported and the second began with Dani Olmo hitting the post twice inside 97 seconds. When Marcus Rashford equalised on 69 minutes, the shot count read 20-3, xG said 3.07-0.20, and it felt like logic had been imposed at last, a first step towards another, inevitable victory; instead, 59 seconds laterla Realled again, through Gonçalo Guedes. After the qualities that saw Sociedad win were reeled off to Oyarzabal afterwards, he replied: “And luck, lots and lots of luck. We have to say that too.”“Let’s be honest: Barcelona were very dominant; all in all, it was a bit lucky,” Matarazzo admitted. “We played a great game,” Hansi Flick said, and but for the 15 minutes after the Guedes goal whenla Realcould have extended the lead, he was right. “Sometimes football has these games: once a season it might happen,” Frenkie De Jong said, and it wasn’t easy to explain. Or perhaps it was: in the hat-trick that Olmo could have had, in the chance Pedri should have taken, in the two goals and one penalty Barcelona had given and taken away again by the VAR – Hansi Flick said afterwards that he didn’t want to “waste time talking about this guy”. Thefiveposts. And theeightsaves from Álex Remiro.“There are some things that we cannot explain …” Matarazzo said, looking up to the sky, “… or we explain them with other things. The quality of the goalkeeper is not luck. Being sharp is not luck. To throw yourself in front of the ball: that’s awareness. We had to withstand a lot of opportunities, but we played with a lot of heart and if there is a game when we were lucky, then it is only today. We have to do everything we can to raise the probability of winning the game.”Well, if anyone knows probability it is the man with a degree in applied mathematics from Columbia University One local paper admitted “to win like this approaches mysticism,” while another called this a “miracle that even the greatest believers can’t assimilate”. Beyond Barcelona there is something shifting.When he was little, Matarazzo would watch Diego Maradona play for Napoli on the small television in his parents’ room. Raised in New Jersey, the son of an Italian mechanic and the first American to coach aLa Ligaclub, he built his career in Germany, first as a player then a coach at Hoffenheim – where Flick was manager – and Stuttgart, who he brought up to the Bundesliga. Methodical, idealistic and ambitious, there is a depth and a calm conviction in the way he talks, a willingness to discuss his tactical ideas. When he took over from Sergio Francisco, Real Sociedad had 16 points in 16 games. Since then there has been a penalty shootout win against Osasuna in the Copa del Rey, a 1-1 draw with Atlético Madrid, a 2-1 win at Getafe, now a victory over Barcelona.Asked if he could imagine a better start than seven points from nine, Matarazzo replied: “Yes, nine.” But no one expected this, an intensity and adaptability, a personality, about them that wasn’t there before. This was more than just three points too, because of who it was against and when, something Matarazzo had embraced. “One of the most important days of the year is coming up,” he said. “We felt it: we connected very well to each other, to the fans. What a night, what a result.”View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford scored Barça’s equaliser in the unlikely defeat by Real Sociedad.Photograph: Miguel Oses/APEvery paper ran with some variation on thetamborrada, lyrics taken from the marching song. “Bakarra munduan”, unique in the world, cheered the cover of Diario Vasco. “Saint Sebastian came a day early.” El Mundo Deportivo led onBagera: roughly, “may we be”, and this is what they want to be. Although he replied “no, no, no,” when it was put to him that he’s an idol already, he has, in his captain’s words, landed on his feet, built a connection, sought empathy. For all the drums, one Donosti paper called likened him to the Pied Piper.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowEspanyol 0-2 Girona, Real Betis 2-0 Villarreal, Osasuna 3-2 Real Oviedo, Mallorca 3-2 Athletic Club, Real Madrid 2-0 Levante, Real Sociedad 2-1 Barcelona, Celta Vigo 3-0 Rayo Vallecano, Atlético Madrid 1-0 Alavés, Getafe 0-1 ValenciaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Since we have been with Rino things have changed,” Remiro said, and it wasn’t even what the goalkeeper said that stayed with you: it was the way he said it, a kind of light in his eye, something almost reverential in his tone. “We believe more in ourselves, no one shirks any effort now, we’re playing with more confidence. The last three games? Brutal, truly. Brutal. Shake the tree and see what falls. Everyone is committed, everyone goes in the same direction. He’s clearer, we’re working more and better. The dressing room is tuned in, committed: the whole team. He’s very clear despite the language [barrier] and we believe in him. The first day he prepared a speech in Spanish, he always tries to use Spanish words, he’s very smart. He speaks English slowly and he does his talks with subtitles in every language. He makes everything easy for us.”“It’s all at once [the tactical and emotional],” Matarazzo explained. “You begin with the first tactical steps, first principles, not just on the pitch but off it: talking about values, who do we want to be, what our character is and you grow one step at a time. If we didn’t have a team that was open, ready for this input, it would not happen. It is a lot about the players’ mentality. The team is very, very special. I am enjoying this club: the players, the staff. Good characters, great values that I can identify myself with and the city is beautiful too; it’s not a bad place to be right now.”“The first day he came in, the first impression was a bit scary: he’s 6ft 2in and frightening,” Oyarzabal said. “But he has brought good energy, intensity. We’re on the right path now. He has embraced Donostia,la Real, the Basque Country from here; coming from the outside, that’s important.”“I’ve already seen how important thetamborradais and that could be an advantage,” Matarazzo had said on Saturday, a smile stretching across his face as he passed the chefs and soldiers the following evening. Now, somehow, they had beaten Barcelona, carried by some energy, thefiestabrought forward. His players departed the stadium with blue neckerchiefs on, happy and looking forward to the two days off he had given them. They had earned it, he understood. As for him, he was going to enjoy it too, an expression of his new home. First, though, he had something to do. “I’m going to watch the game, probably tonight,” Materazzo said. “And then I can look forward to a special day in San Sebastián. I love rhythm, I love drums, so it’s very fitting.”PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona2032492Real Madrid2026483Villarreal1918414Atletico Madrid2018415Espanyol201346Real Betis208327Celta Vigo208328Real Sociedad20-2249Athletic Bilbao20-92410Girona20-142411Elche1912312Osasuna20-32213Rayo Vallecano20-92214Mallorca20-62115Getafe20-112116Sevilla19-62017Valencia20-122018Alaves20-91919Levante19-111420Oviedo20-2013Explore more on these topicsLa LigaReal SociedadBarcelonaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her most recent club was the NWSL side San Diego Wave, with whom she parted ways on Sunday by mutual agreement, having wanted to move back closer to home.Arsenal overtake Chelsea at the top of WSL-dominated football rich listRead moreCascarino scored seven times in 34 games for San Diego after joining in the summer of 2024, and helped them to win the second edition of the World Sevens Football tournament in December – but it is her time with OL Lyonnes that built her reputation. She was also one of France’s top performers at the European Championship in Switzerland last summer and has 86 caps.“London City is the only independent women’s club in the WSL, which excites me,” Cascarino told the club’s website. “England – for men and women – is the country of football. It’s always been a goal of mine to play in this league. I want to play in the Champions League here at London City and win many trophies.”Daniëlle van de Donk said she had “never been more proud of myself” having recovering from a prolonged knee injury to make her long-awaited debut for London City at the weekend, seven months after signing.Van de Donk had not played since starting her country’s final group match against France at Euro 2025 in July, a month after agreeing to join London City, newly promoted to the WSL, from OL Lyonnes. The 34-year-old former Arsenal player came on as a second-half substitute in London City’s 1-0 win at Sunderland in the Women’s FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, allowing her to finally put months of frustration behind her.“I’ve never been more proud of myself,” Van de Donk said. “No one really knows what happened because that was my choice, but I had many setbacks and it wasn’t easy at all. But I’m even more proud and happy to be back.“I really want to be on the pitch. Before [signing for the club] I was very much in debate if I could continue playing football and then this opportunity came around the corner and I was like: ‘OK, well, I can go 100% for that but it’s going to be very hard with my body to be able to do anything.’ But yes, I don’t know, it’s just like resilience or something.”View image in fullscreenDaniëlle van de Donk takes a selfie with fans after London City’s win against Sunderland.Photograph: Molly Darlington/The FA/Getty ImagesVictory at the Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground was London City’s first under their new head coach, Eder Maestre. Speaking about Van de Donk’s return, he said: “I like seeing her enjoying playing football again. She is very talented with lots of experience and this [her debut] is like another win.”The midfielder was playing in the FA Cup nearly 10 years after winning the competition with Arsenal and five years after leaving the club in order to move to France, where she went on to win the Champions League in 2022. “It [her London City debut] was super special,” Van de Donk said. “As soon as [I was] on the pitch, I’m just so happy.”London City are seventh in the WSL after a goalless draw at Liverpool in Maestre’s first game in charge this month. Asked about her hopes for the second half of the campaign, Van de Donk said: “I feel like we’re part of a building team, and especially now we’re rebuilding again with a new coach, so we’re trying to adapt to his playing style and trying to learn from that. We just want to continue with what we’ve shown today and get better and better each game.”Explore more on these topicsLondon City LionessesWomen's footballTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

This year’s competition kicked off in December, but there is collective support from coaches and clubs to commence their campaigns before the packed November Test window.The existing structure and calendar slots are technically in place until 2030, but there is growing recognition that a change could be helpful. Among other benefits, clubs would have a better chance of having their best players fit and firing before the autumn internationals which, in turn, could encourage more early season interest.Champions Cup roundup: Saracens face last-16 tie at Bath after defeat against GlasgowRead moreThis could take the form of a single weekend apiece in October and December rather than two consecutive October weekends but, either way, European Professional Club Rugby insists that interest in the tournament is rising despite criticism of the 24-team, four-pool structure.EPCR officials say television audiences have doubled in the past six years and that aggregate stadium attendances have also risen by 50%, to about 1.5 million, over the same period.While the tournament’s image has suffered from clubs picking weakened teams for high-profile pool games away from home, complex travel logistics to and from South Africa and Leicester and Bulls making the last 16 despite winning one of their four pool games, EPCR’s chief executive, Jacques Raynaud, claims the formula is bearing fruit.“The format is delivering when you look at how few dead-rubber games there are,” Raynaud said. “We have a compelling tournament with a stable format that is delivering what we wanted: jeopardy, increasing audiences, increasing fan engagement.“It does tick a number of boxes when you look at the data and the number of people coming to the stadiums. We’ve got the best attendances in the Champions Cup since Covid and we have also had a 50% increase in digital fan engagement so I’m not just sugar-coating it.Quick GuidePioneering female referee retires from Test gameShowThe sport's first professional female referee, Sara Cox, has stepped down from refereeing international games but will continue to be involved in club rugby. Cox was centrally contracted by the Rugby Football Union in 2016 and has gone on to oversee 51 Tests, including at last year's Women's World Cup.\"I feel very privileged to have officiated at the highest level of the global game for over a decade,\" Cox said. \"Rugby has given me amazing experiences but after the high of a home World Cup, now feels like the right time to hang up my international boots and spend some time on other interests while continuing to give my all to the club game.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Andrew Dowling/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I know there are opinions out there that it could be more elite, but it’s still delivering fantastic rugby on superb stages. The knockout stages are box office, the numbers are great. There’s constant work to refine the format [but] it’s been stabilised and people understand it. Remember our job is not only to provide cheese and dessert. We have to lay on a great compelling tournament from a sporting fan side and also have a financial formula that is liked by TV, sponsors and host cities so we can maximise the money we’re generating for the club game.”Raynaud does concede, though, that an earlier start would help, as would a bigger gap between the last 16 and quarter-finals to allow more time to sell tickets and assist travelling fans.“It is likely we will go back to an October start,” Raynaud said. “That’s not confirmed, but it’s a desire. A lot of people liked it because it corresponded more to the narrative around the start of the club rugby season. Coaches like it because it builds into the Test matches.“The question is do we do blocks of two weekends or one, one and two. The other thing is that we don’t want to confuse people by starting in October one year and not another because of the World Cup. We’re just fine-tuning that, but it is a request from the leagues and from many clubs.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Although officially a 14-yard pass, the ball traveled 51.2 yards in the air, according to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats.“It was crazy,” Stafford said. “It was back and forth.

But as concern over large language models builds, he’s no longer the outsider he once wasMon 19 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 06.12 ESTShareIf some time in an entirely possible future they come to make a movie about “how the AI bubble burst”, Ed Zitron will doubtless be a main character. He’s the perfect outsider figure: the eccentric loner who saw all this coming and screamed from the sidelines that the sky was falling, but nobody would listen. Just as Christian Bale portrayedMichael Burry, the investor who predicted the 2008 financial crash, inThe Big Short, you can well imagine Robert Pattinson fighting Paul Mescal, say, to portray Zitron, the animated, colourfully obnoxious but doggedly detail-oriented Brit, who’s become one of big tech’s noisiest critics.This is not to say the AI bubblewillburst, necessarily, but against a tidal wave of AI boosterism, Zitron’s blunt, brash scepticism has made him something of a cult figure. His tech newsletter,Where’s Your Ed At, now has more than 80,000 subscribers; his weekly podcast,Better Offline, is well within the Top 20 on the tech charts; he’s a regular dissenting voice in the media; and hissubreddithas become a safe space for AI sceptics, including those within the tech industry itself – one user describes him as “a lighthouse in a storm of insane hypercapitalist bullshit”.Zitron first started looking into generative AI in 2023, a year after the industry-shaking launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “The more I looked, the more confused I became, because on top of the fact that large language models (LLMs) very clearly did not do the things that people were excited about, they didn’t have any path to doing them either,” he says. “Nothing I found made any suggestion that this was a real business at all, let alone something that would supposedly change the world.”He’s talking over videocall from his office in Las Vegas, dressed in a red hoodie, surrounded by framed pop-culture prints and American sports memorabilia. And boy can Zitron talk. As listeners to Better Offline will know, the 39-year-old is a prodigious speaker – adept at extended monologues, putting his point of view across in accessible, often cheeky language, peppered with facts, statistics, analogies and a fair few expletives, in a London accent that only accentuates his position as a Silicon Valley contrarian – someone who drops his Ts when he says “datacentres”.Explaining Zitron’s thesis about why generative AI is doomed to fail is not simple: last year he wrotea 19,000-word essay, laying it out. But you could break it down into two, interrelated parts. One is the actual efficacy of the technology; the other is the financial architecture of the AI boom. In Zitron’s view, the foundations are shaky in both cases.First, there’s the matter of generative AI doing what it’s promised to do. Over the past few years we have had escalating prophecies of the technology laying waste to work as we know it. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic – OpenAI’s closest rival –warned in May last yearthat AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, for example. “The current generation of AI large language models will not be doing that,” Zitron says confidently. “My evidence is they’re basically the same as they were a year ago. They have the same efficacy. And every attempt they make to try to turn these into something that can actually do things autonomously has failed.” LLMs hallucinate and give wrong answers, they give different answers every time, they cannot reallylearn, or create, or perform a lot of complex tasks, he argues. He questions even describing this technology as “intelligence”.“It’s intelligent in the same way a pair of dice are intelligent,” he says. “Large language models are transformer-based architecture that use large-scale probability to generate the next token. Now they do this at scale, so you might think, ‘Oh, it’s coming up with things.’ No, it has a large corpus of data, and so many parameters that it pulls from to generate an output. That is all that is. We would not credit an Excel formula with intelligence, and we should not credit generative AI as intelligent.”Obviously, many people disagree with Zitron, especially when it comes to AI replacing jobs. In industries from film-making to customer service to government agencies to tech itself, insiders say AI tools are enabling them to do the same things with fewer people. Even if it doesn’t replace 50% of jobs, its effect on the workplace is likely to be transformative. A survey last June found that entry-level jobs haddropped by nearly a thirdin the UK since the launch of ChatGPT.Zitron argues that “correlation does not equal causation” and points to reports that suggest the role of machine learning in job cuts is either unproven or overstated. Arecent MIT reportinto the “state of AI in business in 2025”, for example, found that 95% of companies attempting to integrate AI in their businesses were getting “zero return”. “Most GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time,” it said.That leads to the second part of Zitron’s argument: that the economics of the AI boom just don’t stack up. The amounts of money pouring into AI investment are unlike anything the world has ever seen. The “magnificent seven” – Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft (which owns 27% of OpenAI), Nvidia and Tesla – currently make up34% of the S&P 500, the US stock market index that represents about 50% of the global market. As the dominant manufacturer of GPUs (graphics processing units – the extremely powerful chips on which AI depends), Nvidia is practically “printing money”, says Zitron, but at this stage everyone else is borrowing and spending billions they may never recover.View image in fullscreenUS chip maker Nvidia’s office in BengaluruPhotograph: Idrees Mohammed/AFP/Getty ImagesThis is the way Silicon Valley startups have always operated, you could say: operate at an initial loss with a view to establishing market share and reaping profits further down the line. But the current disparity between supply and demand is worryingly huge. When it comes to AI, you need to build big and spend big. A typical datacentre requires tens of thousands of GPUs, with each GPU costing upwards of $50,000 (£37,000). Then you need the software and networking to knit them all together, a giant building on a vast plot of land to put it all in, and huge amounts of electricity and water to run it all. The cost of 1GW of AI datacentre capacity isestimated at $35bn (£26bn). As such, the major players in this business are the deep-pocketed “hyperscalers” like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle.When you look at the demand side, the picture is less rosy, and a lot more hazy. OpenAI alone has committed tospending $1.4tn (£1tn)on AI infrastructure over the next five years, for example, but its revenue for 2025 is expected to be about $20bn (£15.8bn). There seems to be a constant carousel of deals and agreements between AI companies, but when you look at it, says Zitron, much of the time these companies are essentially paying each other. Nvidia, for example,announced a $100bn investment in OpenAIlast September; in return, OpenAI will use the cash to buy Nvidia chips. Similar deals abound in this space, as Zitron has forensically detailed. Even with non-magnificent seven “neocloud” companies, like CoreWeave, Lambda and Nebius, which build datacentres then rent out their GPU capacity to others, the bulk of their business is coming from the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia, Zitron says. “When you remove the hyperscalers, there’s less than a billion dollars total in AI compute revenue in 2025.”As for the profitability, ChatGPT now has an estimated 800 million users, but the vast majority of them are paying nothing. Even for paying subscribers, “when you connect a user to an AI model like GPT, each thing the user does varies in expense vastly. A user could ask a very simple question, or they could ask a question that the model interprets as needing a complex answer,” Zitron says. There are no economies of scale here; each question requires “compute” – as in computer processing activity – at the supplier’s expense. “The more someone is a power user of these platforms, the more they’re going to cost you. This is almost the inverse of how the valley works.” And if the answer is not satisfactory and must be reformulated, as is often the case, “that’s more compute burned, making you no extra money”. AI models are getting cheaper and more sophisticated all the time, we are told, but only by using more compute. “It’s like the price of petrol going down a bit, but you have to drive another 250 miles to get somewhere. So this is really problematic – because it means that there is no profitability point.”View image in fullscreenA typical datacentre requires tens of thousands of GPUs.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APAgain, none of this means the great AI crash will happen, but “if I’m wrong, I don’t know how I’m wrong,” he says. “Every counter I’ve read to my work is mostly just wishcasting of ‘and then the AI gets better’.”Many have accused Zitron of having an axe to grind against big tech, but he refutes that: “I have an axe to grind against those who don’t want to talk about reality.” He certainly doesn’t shy away from attention, but that’s not why he got into this business, he explains. “I like writing. I like pulling things apart. I like solving puzzles. I guess I like being able to understand things. A lot of this is just me trying to explain it to myself, rather than an audience.” He had no formal training in economics or computer science and has never worked in tech. “I’ve learned basically everything from the ground up.”Zitron has, it seems, always been technological though. He has built 10 personal computers over his lifetime, he says. It started when his father bought him a PC card with a dial-up connection when he was 10. “So I was online from quite an early age. I immediately was just like, ‘This is the future. I adore this. I love that I can talk to people and game with people.’ I was quite a solitary child. I didn’t have a lot of friends, but I made a lot of friends online.”Growing up in Hammersmith, west London, his parents were loving and supportive, Zitron says. His father was a management consultant; his mother raised him and his three elder siblings. But “secondary school was very bad for me, and that’s about as much as I’ll go into.” He has dyspraxia – a coordination disability – and he was diagnosed with ADHD in his 20s. “I think I failed every language and every science, and I didn’t do brilliant at maths,” he says. “But I’ve always been an asshole over the details.”After studying media and communications at Aberystwyth University, he began writing for gaming magazines, but “I got to a point where I was miserable in London.” So he relocated to New York in 2008 and began working in tech PR. He can’t contemplate returning to the UK, he says. He doesn’t talk about his personal life beyond saying he has a son, which is why he lives in Las Vegas. He doesn’t mind it there: “Everyone’s weird so no one’s weird.” It has been reported that he is twice married and twice divorced.Zitron continues to work in tech PR, which seems jarringly at odds with his career as a tech agitator – either like biting the hand that feeds him or a conflict of interest. He doesn’t see it like that. He doesn’t have AI clients, or work with big tech, he says, and only has a few clients now. The work has given him a network of contacts in the industry, and possibly helped him to market himself (in 2013 he published a book titled This Is How You Pitch: How To Kick Ass in Your First Years of PR). He may not be doing the PR stuff much longer, though. The media side of things is “making up more of my income these days than I ever expected it to”. He’s writing a new book, due out next year, called Why Everything Stopped Working. “It’s kind of a dig into how the world got the way it did and technology is everything now.” Just one chapter is about AI, he adds.If Zitron does have an axe to grind, it’s against neoliberal capitalism in general: “I don’t think people have taken seriously enough how bad deregulation of financial markets, by Thatcher, by Reagan, was. I don’t think people take seriously enough how bad it was not putting people in prison for the great financial crisis … I don’t think people have taken seriously the threat of growth-focused capitalism and growth at all cost.”Rather than leading us to a utopian future, Zitron sees AI as the logical conclusion of neoliberalism. “The biggest thing we’ve learned from the large language model generation is how many people are excited to replace human beings, and how many people just don’t understand labour of any kind,” he says.Zitron is no longer quite so alone in his assessment. He’s on the same page as Cory Doctorow, for example, who has appeared on his podcast, and whose “enshittification” thesis also alleges that tech companies are now more motivated by profit than making more useful products. Meanwhile, other AI sceptics, such as cognitive scientist Gary Marcus,complainthey have been making the same arguments as Zitron “but in his narrative, I don’t exist”. Either way, the backlash to AI is building: local groups are opposing the construction of environmentally destructive datacentres; consumers are grating against the insertion of AI into every conceivable product; creators are taking legal action against the industry’s theft of their work; there is public outrage over social media harms, epitomised by Elon Musk’s Grok creatingnonconsensual borderline-deepfake porn.View image in fullscreenZitron on stage at the Web Summit 2024 in Lisbon.Photograph: Carlos Rodrigues/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, speculation about the AI bubble bursting continues to grow. Now everyone from theBank of EnglandtoMicrosoft boss Satya Nadellaare raising the alarm. Michael “Big Short” Burry says he isbetting against Nvidia, and recently the New York Times ran an op-ed speculating thatOpenAI will run out of moneywithin the next 18 months. It could be sooner than that, Zitron thinks: this month, the big tech companies start reporting their annual earnings for 2025. Most of them have been cagey about their revenues from AI specifically, he says. “Why would they do that? Well, because they’re not very big. So this whole thing is – to use a phrase I hate – it is avibe.” If something serious happens, like Nvidia missing its targets, it could prompt a rethink of the whole sector, and possibly a new global financial crisis. All those datacentres might well end up as empty shells. Ultimately, we could be witnessing “the largest laser-tag arena construction of all time,” he jokes.Zitron doesn’t actually enjoy being contrarian, he insists. “It isn’t fun being alone in an idea, which is actually why I think a lot of people are pro-AI, because it’s much easier to do that.”He doesn’t hate tech, or even AI, he says. “I love technology, but I hate what the tech industry is doing … If you can’t critique this stuff without it being claimed that you don’t support the world or innovation, I think you realise we’re in this weird peasant economy where even wealthy, well-to-do famous people have to kneel at the feet of these companies. And these companies have done very little to make our lives better, all while making so much more money than we will ever have.”He just wants to tell it like it is. “It’d be much easier to just write mythology and fan fiction about what AI could do. What I want to do is understand the truth.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)The big interviewComputinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

And today’s pizza-making gear is more capable and approachable than you might think.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The price range for at-home pizza gear is as wide as the topping choices. On the simple, affordable end, there is the humble carbon-steel slab that slides into the oven you already own – it’s like a basic cheese pie.At the other extreme is pure splurge: a hulking hybrid oven that burns propane or wood and becomes the centerpiece of your outdoor cooking setup. Think of it as a pizza topped with Italianwhite truffles.The five best induction cookware sets in the US, thoroughly tested and cooked inRead moreSitting between those extremes is the dedicated electric countertop oven that performs far better than any fancy toaster oven. (Though if you’re looking to reheat leftover pizza in a jiffy,toaster ovens come in handy.)What’s more, with each category, home pizza gear isn’t a one-trick pony.Pizzasteels are fantastic for baking crusty bread. Newer electric ovens let you precisely control temperature, so you can bake cookies, broil veggies or toast a bagel. And modern outdoor pizza ovens can roast a chicken or sear a steak in cast iron as well as they can blister a New York-style pie.So which gives you the biggest bang for your buck?If you’re new to making pizza, should you start with the basic baking steel or splurge on an oven that does it all for you? To find out, I spent weeks making pies at home to compare and contrast the best gear at every price tier.The best pizza makers at a glanceBest budget pizza maker:Baking Steel’s Baking Steel Original$129 at AmazonBest mid-range pizza maker:Ooni Volt 2 Indoor Electric Pizza Oven$699 at OoniBest splurge pizza maker:Gozney Dome XL Propane Pizza Oven$2,799.99 at BBQGuysWhy you should trust meAs equipment editor at Serious Eats and then senior editor at Men’s Journal, I reviewed kitchen gear for years. As a freelance journalist, I have also reviewed cooking appliances for the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Food & Wine. I have tested everything from grills to coolers toknifesharpeners to uncover the best tools for home cooks.In college, I also worked in my dad’s pizzeria in Queens, New York, and later in a German bakery.What you get as you move up in priceView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sal Vaglica/The Guardian$129:For the budget option, I chose apizza steelover a cheaper pizza stone for several reasons. Made from carbon steel – similar to many restaurant pans but much thicker – a pizza steel is virtually indestructible, conducts heat far better than a stone and excels at producing a crisp, charred crust. Steels are essentially maintenance-free and will last a lifetime. The main drawback: it preheats slowly. To get a properly charred crust, a steel generally requires about an hour at 500F (260C).$700:A step up from a pizza steel is adedicated countertop electric pizza oven. Unlike a pizza steel, a good electric oven can reach temperatures around 800F in just minutes, allowing for a Neapolitan-style pizza almost as soon as you crave one. The tradeoff is price: these ovens can cost as much as $700, but they offer speed, convenience and consistent results that a pizza steel can’t.$2,800:At the top end of home pizza makers is theoutdoor pizza oven, usually fueled by gas, though some models burn wood chunks or pellets. These ovens can reach temperatures well above 800F, and many have room for between one and three 12in pizzas at a time, making them ideal forentertainingor cooking multiple pies in succession. They can provide a restaurant-quality pizza experience that surpasses what is possible indoors – while also cooking meats, roasted vegetables and other baked dishes.How I tested at-home pizza makersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sal Vaglica/The GuardianThe 10 best toaster ovens in the US – tested and reviewedRead moreUsing standard supermarket bread flour, canned tomatoes, olive oil and mozzarella, I prepared batch after batch of the same pizza dough. Once portioned using a digital scale, the dough balls fermented slowly in the refrigerator. Each pizza was consistently sized at about 12 to 13in, and I carefully measured the sauce and cheese on the scale to ensure every pie received the same amount of toppings.Over several days, I baked three pies per oven and monitored their temperatures throughout the preheating and cooking process with an infrared temperature gun. I timed how long it took each pizza to reach my preferred doneness – which leans toward the well-done side – and also took notes on ease of use, handling and cleanup.Best budget pizza maker:Baking Steel The Baking Steel OriginalView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sal Vaglica/The Guardian$129 at Baking Steel$129 at AmazonWhat you’re paying for:Low maintenance, near-indestructability and excellent pizza crustWhy we love itAs you might expect from a rectangular slab of metal, the Baking Steel Original is very straightforward to use. It arrives lightly seasoned with a thin coat of oil, so it’s ready to use right out of the box. And with 45 to 60 minutes of preheating at 500F, it produces excellent pizza with minimal fuss. In my tests, the crust wasn’t quite as crisp as what I get from an electric pizza oven, but the pies were still very good.The instructions suggest keeping the steel about 6in from the broiler to preheat it. Once you launch (insert, in pizza-speak) the pie, it should bake in seven to eight minutes. You can switch on the broiler for the final four minutes to help melt the cheese. After eight minutes of baking them in the oven, I pulled the pies. Both the cheese and crust browned evenly without needing the broiler. The steel retained enough heat for two pies back to back, each baking consistently. If you’re making more than two, just keep an eye on the bottoms so they don’t burn before the tops are fully melted.Once cooled, simply hand-wash it with soap and dry it with a towel. Remove any burnt-on bits with apumice stone. As with a carbon steel pan, occasional reseasoning with oil on both sides will help prevent rust.View image in fullscreenA split view of the top and bottom of a pizza pie baked on the Baking Steel Original.Photograph: Sal Vaglica/The GuardianPro tip:Don’t let the long preheat time worry you – if you store your dough balls in the refrigerator, stretching them straight out of the fridge is nearly impossible while they’re cold (around 40F). It often leads to frustration and tears (in the dough, but potentially from you, too). As the pizza steel takes time to preheat, you can let the dough sit at room temperature so the gluten can relax, making the pies easier to stretch.It’s a shame that… If I had one minor complaint, it’s that the steel’s position near the broiler makes taller users squat to get the right angle when launching a pie.If you’re new to pizza making, try building your 14in pizza on a piece of parchment paper, then slide the paper and pie off the peel into the oven. With a bit of practice, you’ll be able to launch pies directly using just flour. A clean oven window with a working bulb is also helpful for monitoring the toppings, especially when using the broiler.Is it worth the price?Yes, for almost anyone starting out. For $129, nothing else comes close in crust evenness and quality. You give up speed, but the value is clear.Price:$129Dimensions:16in W x 14in D x 0.25in HWeight:15lbsMaterial:Solid, pre-seasoned carbon steelWarranty:LifetimeBest mid-range pizza maker:Ooni Volt 2 Indoor Electric Pizza OvenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sal Vaglica/The Guardian$698.95 at Amazon$699 at OoniWhat you’re paying for:Speed and convenience, thanks to fast preheating, easy countertop access and preset pizza modesWhy we love itTheOoni Volt 2’s biggest advantage is its fast preheating. The electric element under its cordierite pizza stone reached an average of 683F in just 20 minutes using the high-temperature Neapolitan mode. The real-time display is a helpful guide for knowing when the oven is ready.I tried 17 rice cookers to find the best model in the US: here are my favoritesRead moreThe pies,launchedat 630F and done in eight minutes, came out crispy and perfectly melted with minimal effort. The heat was also consistent from front to back and left to right – no need to pull or rotate the pizza during cooking. Plus, the large window and bright interior light made it easy to keep an eye on my cook without opening the door.This latest generation of the Ooni oven is more versatile than earlier models. It offers three pizza settings – Neapolitan, thin and crispy, and pan pizza – each with its own preprogrammed temperature range that you can adjust. A crisping feature fires the top element to melt cheese and toppings, and each pizza mode has a preset for it. The oven also includes proofing, broiling and standard oven modes. Two programmable preset buttons let you save your favorite temperatures, similar to a car stereo.The Ooni also comes with an oven shelf if you want to broil or bake, but you will probably need to buy aneighth-sheet panto use those functions. (Ooni does sell amatching pan and wire rackfor $45.) And if you plan to make deep-dish pizza, you’ll want a pan about 2.5in tall.View image in fullscreenA split view of the top and bottom of a pizza pie baked in a Ooni Volt 2 Indoor Electric Pizza Oven.Photograph: Sal Vaglica/The GuardianIt’s a shame that… The Volt 2 has a compact footprint. That said, Ooni recommends 4in of clearance on the sides and 6in above, so you’ll want to check the fit on your counter if you have upper cabinets. The door folds flatter than most toaster ovens, but to get it fully flat – and make launching pies easier – you will need to slide the oven to the countertop edge. At over 38lbs with the stone installed, it’s not extremely heavy, but moving it in and out of storage can be awkward.The controls aren’t the most intuitive. While you’ll get the hang of the oven with use, it helps to keep the user manual handy. And finally: the dial works well, but flour-covered hands can make using the sleek touchscreen tricky.Is it worth the price?If pizza night is a weekly tradition at your house, an indoor electric pizza oven could get enough use to justify the investment. It’s expensive for a countertop appliance, but it meaningfully outperforms a steel in speed and ease.Price:$700Dimensions:21.5in W x 17.4in D x 10.4in HWeight:Just under 39lbsPizza stone material:0.39in (10mm) thick cordieriteWarranty:One year standard; three years if you registerBest splurge pizza oven:Gozney Dome XL Propane Pizza OvenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sal Vaglica/The Guardian$2,799.99 at BBQGuys$2,799.99 at Home DepotWhat you’re paying for:Large capacity, extreme heat and the closest thing to restaurant pizza at homeWhy we love itFor anyone who wants to cook for a crowd, theGozney Dome XLis a large, capable outdoor oven that can handle far more than just pizza. It requires a bit more attention, since you’ll need to rotate the pie for an even bake, but its intense heat can deliver beautiful char and restaurant-style pies. Plus, it can be fun to show off the rotating while entertaining.You can comfortably fit three 10in pizzas in the XL, which offers over twice as much room as the Ooni Volt 2. It also ships with a propane burner, but you can also cook with wood or charcoal out of the box. (If you do, Gozney sells a$200 wood-fire control kit.)Despite its size, the oven is easy to use. I tested it outdoors in the winter using propane, and its two thick cordierite stone panels warmed from an average of 36F to about 520F in 20 minutes. When I launched pies at roughly 760F, each one finished in about four minutes with a gorgeous char and classic leopard spotting underneath.The height inside the oven is also helpful. The internal chamber is about 9.5in tall, so you can use that full interior height to finish the cheese or toppings without burning the crust. Just lift the pie up and hold it below the oven’s ceiling to take advantage of the convection and radiant heat. And even with a smallish door opening of 5in, the oven is still tall enough to handle a spatchcocked chicken or turkey in a roasting pan or cast-iron skillet, as well as tall loaves of bread.While the Gozney is solidly built – with a robust exterior and excellent insulation – it also has useful tech to help you monitor temperatures. The controller, which runs on a rechargeable battery (the oven itself uses an AAA battery for ignition), displays both the air temperature inside the oven and the temperature of the stone. You can toggle between them to make the one you care about more appear larger. Although you still control heat using the dial that adjusts propane flow, the digital readout makes it much easier to understand what’s happening inside the oven.View image in fullscreenA split view of the top and bottom of a pizza pie baked in a Gozney Dome XL Propane Pizza Oven.Photograph: Sal Vaglica/The GuardianPro tip:Because the burner sits on the left side of the oven, I expected that side of the floor to run hotter – and it did. After an hour of preheating (empty), the left side measured just over 900F. Interestingly, the coolest area was the center, landing at about 730F. Even though the oven is well-insulated and vents efficiently through the chimney, that cooler center spot can be helpful when juggling multiple pizzas to avoid scorching.It’s a shame that… The oven’s biggest drawback for most people is the price. It’s also heavy enough that you’ll need help moving it into place, and if you don’t purchase theaccessory stand, you’ll have to set it on a sturdy, non-combustible surface. I prioritized cooking with propane for this test, as it has the shortest learning curve. If you want to cook with wood or charcoal, the steel tray that holds it does eat into the floor space a bit.Is it worth the price?For many home cooks, the gains over a mid-range oven won’t justify the huge jump in cost. But if you can use its full capacity, the performance is exceptional.Price:$2,800Dimensions:37.2in W x 27.4in D x 39.3in HWeight:Just under 161lbsPizza stone material:1.2in (30mm) thick cordieriteWarranty:One year standard; five years if you registerSal Vaglica is a freelance writer with more than a decade of experience covering tools, tech, culinary gear and home improvement productsExplore more on these topicsPizzaThe Filter USFoodGadgetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will it capture you too?Keith StuartMon 19 Jan 2026 10.35 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 19.12 ESTShareReleased last October Arc Raiders has swiftly become one of the most successful online shooters in the world, shifting 12m copies in barely three months and attracting as many players as established mega hits such as Counter-Strike 2 and Apex Legends. So what is it about this sci-fi blaster that’s captured so many people – and how can you get involved?So what is Arc Raiders?Created by Swedish developer Embark Studios, Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter: an online multiplayer game that drops you into a world with other people to search for valuable weapons and items before attempting to escape with all your spoils. You can play alone or with up to two friends in a squad. Most extraction shooters feature two types of gameplay: Player vs Environment (PvE), which means exploring the world and fighting computer controlled enemies, and Player vs Player (PvP), which means fighting any other players you come across on your travels and then stealing their stuff. In Arc Raiders, you don’t have to fight everyone you meet: in fact human raiders often choose to ignore each other or band together instead of shooting on sight. The game gives you a few stock phrases to shout such as “don’t shoot!”, or you can plug in a mic, chat to strangers you meet and form alliances.What’s the story?Arc Raiders is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth in the distant future. The planet has suffered an ecological disaster that has wiped out most of the population and most technology. Now, a robotic alien invasion force named Arc has arrived to plunder all the remaining natural resources and kill off humanity, forcing everyone to flee underground, where a vast subterranean city named Toledo has been built. Now Earth is patrolled by a menagerie of deadly android guards.What do you do?You play as a raider making daring trips topside to scavenge ruined towns and facilities. As you go on more raids, your character earns experience points, which can be spent on improving their survival, looting and movement abilities, and finds blueprints that enable them to make more stuff. You can also carry out missions for traders, who will reward you with useful items. Traders also sell you things that you haven’t yet learned to craft yourself.Why is it so popular?There are a lot of extraction shooters out there, from dystopian survival thriller Escape from Tarkov to the southern gothic horror of Hunt: Showdown 1896. What Arc Raiders brings is a strong retro-futuristic sense of style, with interesting environments, excellent music and audio, compelling lore and engrossing set-piece battles with the giant robots. Some enemies, such as the vast mecha-spider-like Matriarch, are absolutely huge and require lots of players to join forces in ad-hoc battles. These thrilling encounters have been widely shared on Twitch, TikTok and Instagram – as have comic moments where players fall off buildings, or accidentally kill themselves with guided missiles. The enemies, from the drone-like Wasps and Hornets to the lumbering land-based Bombardiers, are powered by machine-learning and AI that make them fun and unpredictable combatants.How should I start?Just jump in! Arc Raiders is available onPC, Xbox and PS5 and I’d recommend getting a gaming headset so you can chat to other players, if you haven’t got one. Also, listening to the world through headphones gives you a better understanding of where threats are coming from. Once you customise your character, you can start going on raids. In the beginning you can only access one map, the Dam Battlegrounds, but others such as the wrecked urban landscape of Buried City and the deadly industrial complex Stella Montis open up later. I’d advise sticking to the Dam until you have many hours of experience, as the other places are swarming with enemies and other players tend to be more aggressive. For your first few raids, just explore the map, get to grips with the different enemies and pop into buildings to search cabinets, lockers and desks for items.Collect absolutelyeverythingat first – useful resources such as wires and springs will let you craft items later, while rare goods such as toasters and radios can be sold or recycled for scrap. You’ll begin with a very basic weapon and accessories but as you go you’ll find new guns, grenades and healing items, which you can store in your room or sell. With the money you earn, you can buy better kit from traders. It’s important to become self-sufficient as soon as possible, so concentrate on upgrading your workstations (where you craft new items). Whenever you find a blueprint, which teaches you a new item to craft, put it in your inventory’s safe pocket – this lets you keep it even if you’re killed during a raid. Blueprints are more likely to be found in high value areas (marked on your map in red) or during daily special events such as night raids and electromagnetic storms – but these are more risky and competitive.These player guides byGames Radar,IGNandRock Paper Shotgunare extremely useful.Any last tips?View image in fullscreenJust jump in! … Arc Raiders.Photograph: Embark StudiosThe game’s skill tree has three branches – Conditioning, Mobility and Survival. You won’t be able to unlock everything, so think about how you’re going to play. I’d prioritise Mobility skills that focus on stamina at first as you’re going to be doing a LOT of running away. After this, it depends on you: if you’re going to fight other players, prioritise Conditioning skills: if you just want to loot and get outta there, prioritise the more stealth-focused Survival options.As soon as you can, arm yourself with two guns: one that’s effective against Arc enemies (the Ferro is great for this); and one that is useful against other players, such as the Kettle or Stitcher, which are effective against even the best guns in the game. You should also carry bandages, shield rechargers and adrenaline shots. Consider taking smoke grenades everywhere as they’ll help you escape both Arc robots and aggressive players. Even when you have the best weapons and armour, you can still be overpowered by basic flying enemies such as Wasps and Hornets, so buy a bunch of seeker grenades – they’re cheap and highly effective against these tenacious foes.As soon as you have the money, increase the size of your stash – ie the number of items you’re allowed to store. Keep doing this until you max it out to 280 slots. You’re gonna need them.If you need to make money fast, go to Dam and visit the Pale Apartments, Ruby Residence and Pattern House – they are filled with high-value trinkets such as statues, snow globes and pottery jugs, and are relatively safe to explore.Arc Raiders review – pure multiplayer pleasureRead moreAt the beginning of each run, after you choose which map area you want to visit, the game offers you the chance to start with a free load-out, which includes a basic gun and some useful random items. It lets you get to grips with the area and do a bit of looting without the risk of losing valuable equipment. This is a brilliant option for when you’re exploring a new map for the first time, or if you just need to recoup your supplies after being killed on a previous run. If you survive, you can visit the trader named Lance and swap your basic Augment for a better one for no charge.The game takes aggressive behaviour into account when matching you with other players. If you shoot people, you’re more likely to be put on servers where people shoot back. If that doesn’t sound like fun, be nice to other raiders. Use the emote wheel to greet them, and join up to fight larger enemies. You’ll learn faster and I’ve often been given items by players who I’ve helped out.Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What else is this ‘board of peace’?Owen JonesBlair, Putin, Erdoğan, Orbán: the names of those invited to serve say it all. And it's about so much more than GazaMon 19 Jan 2026 13.27 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 17.39 ESTShareThe fate of the Palestinian people offers a warning about the future of humanity. When I recently visited the West Bank, Palestinians kept impressing the same point on me: Israel has turned their land into a laboratory. The technology of oppression that it has deployed – including in its genocide in Gaza – ranges from hi-tech surveillance to military drones and AI on the battlefield. These technologies have beenexportedto oppressive states across the world. And it doesn’t stop there.This brings us to Donald Trump’s “board of peace”, now set to rule Gaza. In the sleepy Oxfordshire village of Sutton Courtenay, where George Orwell lies buried, the ground itself ought to be shaking. This isn’t peace. It’s naked neocolonialism.Not a single seat is reserved for a Palestinian, let alone a survivor of Gaza. Trump will serve as chair in an individual capacity rather than as US president – in other words, as Gaza’s emperor. Its invited members include Tony Blair, who is despised across the Middle East as an architect of the illegal invasion of Iraq. If you’re curious about his skill set when it comes to rebuilding ravaged Arab territory, recall what the Chilcot inquiryconcludedabout that catastrophe: “the UK failed to plan or prepare for the major reconstruction programme required in Iraq”.Who else? At least two property developers, including Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whoonce boastedof the “very valuable” potential of Gaza’s “waterfront property”. Hungary’s far-right autocrat Viktor Orbán. An Israeli billionaire, Yakir Gabay, and an Americanprivate equity tycoon, Marc Rowan. Vladimir Putin, who helped pioneer reducing predominantly Muslim lands to rubble in Chechnya, also has an invite,according to the Kremlin. Sure,Israel isn’t happy, presumably because the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been invited. Nothing but total control of Gaza would satisfy them – but that is little consolation for its traumatised Palestinian population.The clues about where this is heading are hardly subtle. Trump isdemanding $1bn from each countryto be a permanent member, and the draft of the charter appears to suggest, as per Bloomberg, that he will control the money. A year ago, heproposedpermanently resettling Gaza’s population: ethnic cleansing. He posted an AI-generated video showcasing Gaza as a luxury resort, featuring a giant golden statue of himself.It would be naive to assume that he has abandoned such plans, even if pressure from Arab statesappears to have had some effectlast year, when he said “nobody is expelling any Palestinians”. That was clear in little-noticed comments he made at a recent press conference withBenjamin Netanyahu – the Israeli prime ministerwanted by the international criminal courton charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Trump suggested that if Gaza’s population “were given the opportunity to live in a better climate, they would move. They’re there because they sort of have to be.”He leaned on polling suggesting almost half of Gaza’s populationwould leave. Hardly surprising: the territory has been reduced to apocalyptic ruin, its survivors living in tents, deprived of life’s essentials.When Netanyahu says Palestinians will “be allowed to exit,” ashe did last year, he clearly anticipates they will not return. At the beginning of the genocide, he privately backed “voluntary migration” in principle, perhaps knowing his army was going to make Gaza unliveable. “Our problem is [finding] countries that are willing to absorb Gazans, and we are working on it,”he told his alliestwo years ago.Note, then, that Israel recently recognised Somaliland. Somalia’s president suggestedit had intelligencethat the breakaway republic had agreed to take refugees from Gaza in exchange. Somaliland denies it,but its foreign minister didn’t rule it outlast March. Gaza is a devastated wasteland, now destined to be a money-making scheme for property developers and Trump’s courtiers.But this isn’t just about the Palestinian people. The “board of peace”’s charterdoesn’t even mention Gaza. It reads as an attempt to build an alternative to the UN: a blunt instrument for Trump to exercise American power. In other words – here is a template, with Gaza merely acting as a trial run.Yet if Trump believes this will serve the interests of US hegemony, a brutal collision with reality awaits. Western dominance was founded on three pillars: military supremacy, economic dominance and moral superiority. The first was slain in the killing fields of Iraq and Afghanistan. The second was discredited by the 2008 financial crash. And moral superiority? This was always a con, of course, as the torture chambers of US-backed dictatorshipsin Latin Americaor the peeling skin of Vietnamese children hit by American napalm can testify. But, unlike older rivalries between great powers, the cold war was sold as a clash of universal philosophies: democracy and freedom v socialism and equality. The Soviet collapse was presented as the triumph of the western creed.As the US militaryincineratedAfghan wedding parties, and American soldiers werephotographedwith rictus grins as naked Iraqis were piled into a human pyramid at Abu Ghraib prison, those moral claims disintegrated. When US Democrats armed and facilitated the liquidation of Gaza, American moral bankruptcy was exposed as a bipartisan affair.What is striking about Trump is that he has abandoned even the pretence of moral superiority. On Venezuela, he openly boasts that US companies are going to “take back” the country’s oil. Gone are claims that US hegemony is driven by a desire to protect the freedom of all humanity – “a country that would be a light unto the nations, and a shining city upon a hill,” as Ronald Reagan put it.Trump’s crude honesty merely hastens the fall of US power. Moral supremacy was always a deception, but it was a useful lie. It bought at least some support and acquiescence. Now it is dead, the world will be ever more eager to turn the page on its failing masters.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You arrange to open the day’s trading on the stock exchange to hail a “new golden age” for the City and bask in the sight of theFTSE 100 index above 10,000, and what happens? Youhave to skip offto the prime minister’s statement on Greenland.In the event, Rachel Reeves needn’t have worried about the poor optics of overseeing a terrible day for share prices. Donald Trump’sweekend threat of tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK, did not cause an explosion in the London stock market.The Footsie closed down 0.4%, which doesn’t register on the doomsday radar, although European stocks did worse. There was even a£7.7bn bid for the insurer Beazley at a fat premium.Why the relative calm? Well, markets have learned to live with Trumpian tariff adventures. They know the attention-grabbing initial threats do not always translate into action, at least not at the advertised level. With hindsight, Trump’s“liberation day” last April, which did shake markets, created one of the best buying opportunities in years and 2025 as a whole wasa bumper year for stock markets almost everywhere.Markets fall and gold and silver hit new highs after Trump’s latest tariff threatRead more“More than a year into Trump’s second term, market participants have become increasingly desensitised to his rhetoric and sceptical that it will feed through into action,” says Jonas Goltermann, the deputy chief markets economist at the thinktank CapitalEconomics. Quite: markets expect Trump’s 1 February deadline for the first 10% tariff to be postponed. In any case, the next step is the US supreme court’s ruling on the legality of Trump’s existing tariff policy.Investors’ complacency obviously guarantees a bigger reaction if it is misplacedBut two other points are worth noting in the market’s reaction. First, investors’ complacency obviously guarantees a bigger reaction if it is misplaced. The risk of a UK or eurozone recession – highly likely if extra tariffs were to be imposed for an extended period, say economists – is almost the least of it. If the breakup of Nato is also on the cards, that is one of those long-term geopolitical shifts that markets tend to be terrible at pricing – or, rather, they take their time to do so because the consequences are genuinely unclear.But the Deutsche Bank currency strategist George Saravelos also raised the more immediate – and alarming – spectre of tit-for-tat measures going beyond tariffs on goods and into capital markets. “Europe owns Greenland, it also owns a lot of Treasuries [US debt],” he wrote, suggesting that European funds may be less willing to own US assets “in an environment where the geoeconomic stability of the western alliance is being disrupted existentially”.What are Trump’s latest tariff threats and could the EU hit back with its ‘big bazooka’?Read moreThose holdings are indeed large: European countries own $8tn of US bonds and equities, almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined, he calculates. It is indeed one card Europe holds: the US is running large external deficits that need to be funded without, Trump hopes, creating a slide in the dollar or a rise in US borrowing costs.In practice, we’re miles away from a coordinated European decision to hold fewer US treasuries, assuming it could even be agreed. European funds probably don’t want to be told to sell into a market where the aim is lower prices. On the other hand, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is talking aboutactivating the EU’s “anti-coercion instrument”to restrict access to the single market for US companies, so one can see which direction the wind is blowing.“It is a weaponisation of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets,” Saravelos says. Yes, that would be the big short-term market escalation. It is remarkable that it’s even being discussed – but not as remarkable, of course, as the idea of annexing a fellow Nato member’s territory.Explore more on these topicsTariffsNils Pratley on financeStock marketsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEconomicsGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

That is the question. When even Piers Morgan has taken his head out of Donald Trump’s bum far enough to see a glimmer of daylight, then it’s fair to say the US president has probably overstepped the mark.Not content withthreatening tariffsagainst the UK and seven EU countries for sending troops to Greenland – having previously demanded Nato allies get stuck in to protect the country from Russia and China – The Donald has now sent a letter to the Norwegian prime minister tocomplain about not winning the Nobel peace prizeand to say he was so pissed off he was thinking of starting a war instead.If this is the new alignment of the rules-based order then the west is falling apart in front of our eyes. Presidents Putin and Xi must be living their best lives. This is everything they dreamed of and more.All their sins can be forgiven and they now have licence to do as they please in Ukraine and Taiwan. And all because the Orange King Baby in the White House is having a temper tantrum at not getting his own way. His doctors urgently need to do a review of his meds. A little less aspirin and industrial quantities of antipsychotics would be doing us all a favour.Meanwhile,Keir Starmerjust can’t catch a break. Two weeks ago, he had been planning to make a big new year speech on the cost of living crisis. That got scrapped when Trump kidnapped Nicoás Maduro. Second time unlucky.This same domestic relaunch speech just got hijacked again at the weekend by the US president. By the time the prime minister gets round to telling us what he’s planning to do about the domestic situation, the cost of living will have gone up again.So Monday morning found Starmer giving an emergency press conference in Downing Street. This was Keir at his most grave. And, to be fair, he is better at being serious than he is charismatic and engaging. This was Keir from his barrister past. Explaining to a client why he had lost his appeal against the death sentence. Next stop a spell as an undertaker. “I am so sorry for your loss.”Greenland’s sovereignty could only be determined byGreenlandand Denmark, he said. Our values are resolute. Here was a line in the sand. Something on which we could all agree. Though he didn’t have any helpful insights into what he might do if the US took matters into their own hands and seized the island by force.2:32Greenland's future must be decided by Greenland and Denmark 'alone', says Starmer – videoInstead Starmertried to take the heat out of the situation. Now was not the time for overreaction. An implicit rebuke both to Emmanuel Macron for threatening retaliatory tariffs and to Ed Davey and Zack Polanski for making trouble.What was needed was a cool head. Calm diplomacy. No need to make a drama out of a crisis. Just sit down with The Donald and talk things through. Man to man. Once Trump had had things explained to him, he would have a rethink. Realise he had acted a bit hastily. A gentle reminder that starting a trade war with your allies was a wee bit over the top. This wasn’t the way the special relationship was supposed to work.All of which was fine as far as it went. Only it was all predicated on a category error. Because it all presupposed that The Donald was a sentient being. Someone who could respond sensibly to reason. A proper grownup. Except it has long been clear that this isn’t the reality we are dealing with. And to be fair, Trump has never pretended to be anything other than what he is.The Donald is a bully who enjoys using his power on those weaker than him. He doesn’t care about Nato and other global alliances. Everything is about his machismo. And he doesn’t need a reason for taking Greenland other than he quite fancies it. Because he can. He likes the attention. Likes to see Starmer and other leaders desperately scrabbling around to coordinate a response. He enjoys other people’s weakness and wants to go down in history as the president who extended the territory of the US.If Keir had hoped to offer some reassurance, he failed badly. The journalists at the press conference understandably wanted to know if there was a plan B. OK, so the prime minister hoped to change the president’s mind. Yup. We could all agree that would be a good thing. But we all knew that wasn’t very likely. The Donald tends to do exactly what he feels like. Keir tried to tell us that he didn’t think the president was planning to take Greenland by force. Except that’s exactly what he has said he will do if the Danes continue to say it isn’t for sale.“Retaliatory tariffs are a bad idea,” said Starmer. He isn’t wrong. A trade war would undoubtedly harm the UK economy. And falling out with your most important ally who helps maintain your nuclear deterrent can generally be filed under “bad idea”. But where do you draw the line when The Donald goes ahead and does all the things he says he is going to do? Imposes tariffs; annexes Greenland; trashes Nato.In KeirWorld where no boat should ever be rocked, The Donald operates in a world without consequences. Where every humiliation is only greeted with an invitation to inflict further humiliation. Were Trump to take a fancy to Scotland – hell, he owns a couple of golf courses so why not the whole country: first he takes Turnberry then he takes Holyrood – what would Starmer do then? Apart from saying how disappointed he was and that we needed to maintain good relations with the US at all costs.Maybe Keir will prove us all wrong. He will secure a meeting with the president in Davos and The Donald will see the light. But you wouldn’t put money on it. Starmer has acquired the reputation of being the world’s best Trump wrangler but right now it’s hard to see we have got that much in return.It could just be that Keir used his best bargaining chip long ago when he offered the president a state visit on the first date. That’s the only thing The Donald has ever really wanted from us. We gave it away too cheaply.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchForeign policyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsGreenlandDenmarkUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

But we Americans are denying that realityMon 19 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 13.39 ESTShareThe United States seems determined to turn its back on the rest of our planetary neighbors. The Trump administration’srecent decision to withdrawfrom 66 international treaties, conventions and organizations is striking for the range of its rejections. Everything from the global treaty on climate change to multilateral efforts to address migration and cultural heritage, clean water and renewable energy, and the international trade in timber and minerals has been summarily dismissed as “contrary to the interests of the United States”.It’s no surprise that an administration hellbent on physical walls around the United States would also put up such walls of indifference, as if all of these longstanding collective efforts were simply “irrelevant” to our interests as a country, as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, put it in apublic statement. And yet, as we know, the reality of contemporary life on Earth is so profoundly otherwise. How has the truth of our interconnectedness with others elsewhere become so difficult to grasp in the United States?Over the last decade, I’ve been studying this problem as a cultural anthropologist. In a recent book,Something Between Us: The Everyday Walls of American Life, and How to Take Them Down, I show how profound patterns of isolation and division have crept into the everyday texture of American life. Increasingly fortified homes and neighborhoods, bulked-up cars and trucks, visions of the body as an armored fortress, media that shut out contrary views: these interlocking walls have sharpened the divide between insiders and outsiders, separating Americans on an everyday basis and encouraging us to disregard our relationships with others.Going it alone is a path to autocracy, not autonomyMy research is informed by exchanges over many years with Americans from many walks of life: realtors and urban planners, salesmen and consumers, activists for social and environmental justice. I think of the way that a home improvement podcaster framed the value of home security technologies at a 2021 builders convention I attended: “Now it’s not your problem,” he said, describing how smart lights would lead burglars down the street to someone else’s home. Or the troubling lesson an automotive designer I met in California learned from focus groups about SUV design: “If there are two cars in an accident,” people kept telling him, “I want my kids in the bigger car.”With everyday life organized in such antagonistic terms, it becomes difficult to see the complex ways in which our own individual interests are bound up with the interests of others. Social and environmental problems are more easily set aside as the concerns of others elsewhere, rather than as matters of shared concern and common responsibility. When the divide between self and other becomes as stark as it has in everyday American life, efforts to address collective predicaments or to respond to the suffering of others can meet with deep skepticism.The rejection of climate diplomacy and the celebration of fossil fuels by our leaders and policymakers are troubling indeed. But these developments represent more than a policy framework catering to powerful lobbies and industries. They also reflect habits of thought that address our wellbeing and the freedom to pursue it in sharply individualistic terms. To make meaningful change on these matters, we have to address these ways of living and thinking.The vicissitudes of global weather will increasingly take the shape of natural disasters, as they did one year ago with the Los Angeles wildfiresFor here is the reality acknowledged in so many of the global arrangements spurned by our national leadership these days: our future is caught up with the welfare of others beyond our bounds. Economic inequalities and environmental instabilities propel migrants to distant places, including our own borders. The vicissitudes of global weather will increasingly take the shape of natural disasters, as they did one year ago with the Los Angeles wildfires.These problems are interconnected. And if our instincts in the face of challenges like the climate crisis are to bar the door and turn up the air conditioning, the air will only grow warmer and more unpredictable outside.Martin Luther King Jr confronted such truths many years ago in his1963 letterfrom the Birmingham city jail, memorably evoking that “inescapable network of mutuality” through which “whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly”. The “single garment of destiny” that King wrote about may indeed be fraying now, but it can be stitched back together more fully, by leaning once again into an attitude of mutual aid and collective solidarity.I think, for example, of the clean water activists I spoke with in the city of Newburgh in the Hudson River valley. Organizing against thecontaminationof their municipal water supply by “forever chemicals” from a nearby air national guard base, these activists have worked to develop a sense of watershed awareness, the idea that choices made upstream will affect the lives of those downstream. They held a series of public conversation circles on the theme of “I Am Water”, encouraging participants to reflect on their own intimate relationships with water as a way of imagining themselves as elements in a wider shared ecology.“We had to start with our own bodies before going to the body of water itself,” the Newburgh activist Gabrielle Hill explained to me. And there was something deep to absorb in these words of hers, for we all share the substance of our lives with the environment that sustains us, here in United States and in the larger world beyond.Like many others, Hill has been galvanized by recent threats to our democracy. She decided to run for a district post in her local Orange county legislature, and won the Democratic party nomination last year. The night of that victory, she shared an African proverb with her supporters: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” This communal spirit was reflected in the priorities at the heart of her successful campaign platform: clean public water, accessible public transportation, affordable housing for Newburgh’s diverse working-class communities.Going it alone is a path to autocracy, not autonomy. Repressive powers ask us to reject our interdependence and imagine our security in isolated and suspicious terms. But the collective movements that have mobilized in these fraught times teach us something else instead: our wellbeing is best conceived as a communal resource. Our fates are bound together, whether or not it interests us to acknowledge this truth.Anand Pandianis Krieger-Eisenhower professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpUS domestic policyUS foreign policyClimate crisisUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Each year on this holiday, we reflect on King’s life and legacy. We wonder about what he might make of this moment. Though civil rights protesters in the 1950s and 60s were repeatedly met with extreme state violence, Americans are now facing a president who is troublingly more powerful than past figures such as the notorious segregationist and Alabama governor George Wallace.Militarized and masked federal police forces, abetted by a corrupted justice department, are expansive and employ far more deadly weapons against protesters today. Civil rights leaders often sought federal intervention to combat localized racial violence in the south. But now, local and state officials, along with ordinary citizens who have been galvanized by federal violence, are combating government crackdowns against immigrants and their neighbors. Over the span of a week, ICE agents killed an American wife and mother of three, Renee Good, and shot a man from Venezuela during a traffic stop. They have arrested and detained American citizens and have terrorized neighborhoods, businesses and schools. Their irrational, unprofessional and unconstitutional actions have caused chaos, panic and harm throughout American cities. This is far from the progress King dreamed of, and he used his last years to warn Americans to refuse comfort, the status quo, and bring oppression to an end.Exactly one year before Dr King was assassinated, on 4 April 1967, he gave his famous “Beyond Vietnam” speech at Riverside church in New York City. More than 3,000 people were in attendance. At the time, King had come under intense fire for having renounced the Vietnam war; his outspokenness put him at odds with Lyndon Johnson, who felt King should have been indebted to him for his efforts in pushing through civil rights legislation. It also put King at odds with his own people and the press. The NAACP thought King was conflating civil rights and Vietnam, and wanted him to stick to the strategy regarding domestic issues.The press hammered him: a Washington Post article claimed that King was diminishing “his usefulness to his cause, to his country, and to his people”. As a Black man and minister, apparently, King was only supposed to care about the oppression of Black Americans. Instead, King called for a “worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one’s tribe, race, class and nation”. He argued for an “all-embracing … unconditional love for all mankind”.The Trump administration contends that Americans are threatened by the presence of immigrants and anything, for that matter, that resembles diversity, equity or inclusion. King, in a way, forewarned: “We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. And history is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate.”On the streets of Minneapolis, like the streets of Portland, Chicago, Boston, Charlotte and Los Angeles, people are courageously taking up the responsibility they have to their neighbors. They are embracing the unconditional love for all mankind in opposition to the federal government, which has wreaked havoc on the lives of ordinary Americans and immigrants. King’s words have come back full force.In his speech, he declared: “These are revolutionary times. All over the globe, men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppression.” How can one read King’s words and not think of Minneapolis, Tehran, Caracas or Gaza? Being a minister meant that King not only pointed out the flaws in a system, but also offered vision and a mandate: “Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism and militarism.”These three threats to humanity ruled King’s world then and also define ours now. Today, we can use the “urgency of now” that he spoke of to move on from the empty platitudes that this day of remembrance often evokes. Instead, we can focus on the purpose and costs of the liberties that we are working so hard to manifest. King said it best in closing: “If we will make the right choice, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our world into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. If we will but make the right choice, we will be able to speed up the day, all over America and all over the world, when ‘justice will roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream’.” The choice will not be easy or without cost, but the alternative – what we see on our screens and streets today – is unconscionable.Explore more on these topicsMartin Luther KingOpinionRaceUS politicsCivil rights movementcommentShareReuse this content"

Will others buckle?Mon 19 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 08.34 ESTShareAyear ago – just a year ago – the Kennedy Center inWashington DCwas a world-class centre for the performing arts. It had a resident opera company, respected artistic teams, and a run of the acclaimed musical Hamilton to look forward to. It had a bipartisan board that upheld the dignity of an organisation that, since it was conceived of in the mid-20th century, had been treated with courtesy and supported by governments of both stripes.How quickly things unravel. Donald Trump inserted himself aschair of the organisationsoon after his 20 January inauguration, dispatched the hugely experienced executive director, and installed his unfortunate loyalistRichard Grenellto run it. This former ambassador to Germany might have wished for better things; at any rate, entirely inexperienced in the arts, he seems utterly out of his depth. Things have unravelled. Artists have departed the centre in droves. Hamiltonpulled out. So have audiences. In November, Francesca Zambello, the artistic director of the Washington National Opera,told methat ticket sales had tanked for the opera. Analysis by the Washington Postshowedit was the same pattern across the centre.Every day, Zambello was receiving messages of protest from formerly loyal members of the audience: shredded season brochures stuffed into an envelope and returned; missives saying, among other things, “I’m never setting foot in there until the ‘orange menace’ is gone.” The financial hit was so serious, she told me, that the opera company was considering uprooting from the centre and going it alone. Grenell and co’s insistence that all productions should be “net neutral” – fully funded in advance – was also an insuperable problem. With large numbers of singers and musicians to pay for, as well as the spectacle that patrons come to enjoy, productions are generally financed not just by ticket sales but by grants and philanthropic support.This week, the company made it official: itwill leavethe Kennedy Center. Anew websitehas been launched. Donations have flooded in, along with solidarity. There may be trouble ahead – the Kennedy Center holds the WNO’s endowment, and lawyers are rolling up their sleeves to thrash out the divorce. The Kennedy Center management’s official position is that it wastheywho decided to “part ways” with the company, with a strong whiff of the dumpee claiming to be the dumper. From the spring, opera lovers in Washington and the surrounding region will probably be able to attend performances at the Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University, among other venues. From the autumn, the hope is that the company will find longer-term homes at Constitution Hall and the Shakespeare Theatre Company’s Harman Hall.The WNO board made its resolution in the nick of time to retain a shred of dignity. Just before Christmas, after the president had spent months apparently joking that the centre should be named after him, the words “The Donald J Trump and” wereaffixed to the building’s facadeabove “The John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts”. (How can it be a memorial to Donald Trump, you ask, when he is still alive? To which one can reply only with a bemused shrug.) The new, slightly mismatching letters looked as if they might have been picked up atFour Seasons Total Landscaping. The Trump and Kennedy Center it became – a move whose legality isdisputed.View image in fullscreenGianandrea Noseda of the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center, Washington DC, in 2016.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesNow the opera is leaving, the Kennedy Center is by all accounts somewhat forlorn. One insider told me it was like a “funeral parlour – there’s a deathly pall over the place”. The cancellations keep happening; while I have been writing this article, another has been announced. There will beno annual concertat the centre on Martin Luther King Day, which falls this year on 19 January. Instead, after 23 years of the “Let Freedom Ring” event at the centre – in its time headlined, variously, by Aretha Franklin and Chaka Khan – the concert will be held elsewhere. A look at the seating plans on the centre’s website tells its own story: with a few exceptions, such as this week’s performances by star pianist Daniil Trifonov, events are selling poorly across the board. The centre may be chugging forward into a future as a tomb-like convention centre – give or take the opening of a Trump-approved movie. (Take your seats for the premiere of Melania, a film about the first lady, on 29 January.)Trump’s assault on the Smithsonian: ‘The goal is to reframe the entire culture of the US’Read moreWith the imminent removal of the opera, the National Symphony Orchestra, the other resident performing group, is left in glorious isolation. This week, its music director, Gianandrea Noseda, put out astatementthat seemed like a veiled response to WNO’s departure, and yet at the same time, said a whole lot of nothing. Titled Music Belongs to Everyone, it began: “The National Symphony Orchestra is your orchestra; it is part of the community in which you live, and, in some way, part of your family.” On it went in similar airy vein, ending with: “The NSO and I await you – doing what we know how to do best: making music.” Noseda’s clouds of meaninglessness were presumably meant to affirm that politics have nothing to do with symphony orchestras, though if that really were the intended drift, one wonders what he has been thinking all these years while conductingShostakovich.Things are changing rapidly in Washington’s cultural organisations. Also within the past week, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery hasswapped out its previous portrait of Trumpfor a replacement and changed its labelling. In the new photograph, Trump’s knuckles graze his Oval Office desk as he snarls into the middle distance. It was an open secret that mention of his two impeachments on the previous label had irked him. The new label is shorn of any biographical detail. The Smithsonian has buckled, presumably an attempt at appeasement – never a word you want to be using in relation to a leader like Trump. This week also marked the deadline for the institution to provide the White House with a mountain of documentation about labels, plans, catalogues, staffing, budgets and programmes, with emphasis on the marking of the US’s 250th anniversary. In aletter to the Smithsonianbefore Christmas, the White House, in reissuing its demand for this paperwork, claimed that “The American people will have no patience for any museum that is diffident about America’s founding or otherwise uncomfortable conveying a positive view of American history.”A year into Trump’s second term, a battle for America’s soul is being fought – not just in the streets of Minneapolis, Chicago and Portland, but in its cultural organisations. It will be telling to see who is willing to fight it and who is ready to fold.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writerExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionWashington DCArts fundingArts policyUS politicsTrump administrationOperacommentShareReuse this content"

But thekilling of Renee Goodearlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, as well as the regular, often violent confrontations that ICE stages on US streets, show so much that is unravelling in plain sight. The rule of law, the freedom to protest, and even the right to walk ordrivein the streets safely without being assaulted by the state, seems to exist no longer in the towns and cities where ICE has made its presence felt. The most disturbing aspect of all this is how quickly it has happened. But for a government agency such as ICE to become the powerful paramilitary force that it is, several factors need to be in play first. Only one of them is Donald Trump.ICE may look as if it came out of nowhere, but the sort of authoritarianism that results in these crackdowns never does. It takes shape slowly, in plain sight, in a way that is clearly traceable over time. First, there needs to be a merging of immigration and security concerns, both institutionally and in the political culture. Established in the wake of 9/11, ICE was part of a government restructuring under President George W Bush. It was granted a large budget, wide investigative powers and a partnership with the FBI’s joint terrorism taskforce. The work of enforcing immigration law became inextricably linked to the business of keeping Americans safe after the largest attack on US soil. That then extended into a wideremphasis, under Barack Obama, beyond those who posed national security threats, and on to immigrants apprehended at the border, gang members and non-citizens convicted of felonies or misdemeanours.The dragnet became wider, the budgets became bigger, and due processstarted to wither. Trump then grew ICE into the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, with a budgetsurpassingmost of the world’s militaries. And he imbued the agency with a supreme mandate of saving the US from existential threat, a sort of praetorian guard vested with his executive power.To get where the US is today, you also need an unhinged rightwing media to do the work of scaremongering and priming the public, relentlessly banging the drum on illegal immigration and the threat of demographicoverwhelm. And, relatedly, of course, the US immigration crackdowns are sustained by a culture of plain old racism. One that hides behind concerns for public safety, but is in fact a way to channel discontent about the reality of a country that is far less white than many would like.Next up is a long history and engrained culture of military supremacy. The scenes of ICE officers entering neighbourhoods, heavily armed, looked almost indistinguishable from scenes of US soldiers abroad. So much of the mythology of the American soldier, who has infinite mandate to use violence overseas in defence of freedom and American values, can be seen in thepropaganda around ICE. The merging of military and policing functions can be seen in the absurd arsenals of domestic police forces, with their drones, weapons, explosives, armoured personnel carriers and masked faces. And it can be seen in the personnel who move between overseas and domestic forces. The New York Times has reported that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good,servedin Iraq.I have been thinking about what it was about the ICE phenomenon that felt chillingly familiar to someone who grew up under repressive regimes. It wasn’t the deployment of huge numbers of forces, nor was it even the violence. It was the sense that anything could happen to anyone, not just those expressly identified as the legitimate targets of crackdown. The abiding experience of living with authoritarianism is the sense not of imminent assault, but of the constant possibility that suddenly, you could be in trouble. At a traffic incident where the officer didn’t like your tone, at a gathering that was deemed to violate a curfew and then forcibly dismantled, or even on social media where a mindless post could affect your ability to leave the country. It is a state of effacement of all civil rights, and a swelling of government into a volatile, capricious overlord, as safe or scary as the single enforcer in front of you who happens to be vested with its power.The US has passed through that veil. But there are warning signs in the UK. The relentless portrayal of immigrants as a threat to safety and social cohesion. The same glamorisation of the imagery of crackdown, now a feature of government propaganda asministers attendHome Office immigration raids. The same expansion of powers and discretion to the police to include ever wider definitions of what a public order infraction is, such as factoring in the “cumulative impact” of pro-Palestine rallies. The transformation of protest into dissidence. Theempowermentof the UK Border Force, which now has the right to seize someone’s mobile phone even when they are not under arrest. The swirl of nativism that underpins it all. Throw in one charismatic and mendacious political leader, and a rightwing press amplifying all the necessary fever dreams of a country in crisis, and you are on a path to passing through that veil. It can happen in Britain too, just with fewer guns.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpProtest (US)commentShareReuse this content"

Dare we even mention the Harambe of it all?Mon 19 Jan 2026 18.55 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 19.18 ESTShareLately, you’d easily believe we’ve travelled back into a sepia-toned, bygone era.Social mediahas been inundated with grainy images of purple sunsets, selfies adorned with flower crowns and outfits that largely consist of ripped jeans, plastic chokers and olive-green utility jackets.Where the hell am I? And what year is it?There’s no way to avoid it; 2016 nostalgia is in full force.Harper’s Bazaardescribed 2016 as “the last good year”, and everyone – ranging from Nobel prize laureateMalala Yousafzaito nearly every influencer within a five-mile radius – has posted their own decade-old throwback pictures, Snapchat filters and all. Arguably the poster girl of 2016’s spirit (for better or worse),Kylie Jenner, even hopped on to the trend and shared images that were the envy of almost all young girls at the time.Millennial pink hair. Thigh-high boots styled with T-shirt dresses. Heavy, full-glam makeup that revitalised the entire cosmetic industry. Absolute chills.“You just had to be there,” she captioned the post. But, in my best attempt to emulate the great Carrie Bradshaw, I couldn’t help but wonder if everyone who was romanticising this particular moment of time actuallywerethere. Don’t they remember that 2016 was, well, kind of a shit one?Does my obsession with old trinkets make me a hoarder or a sentimental maximalist? | Eleanor BurnardRead moreI recall a lot of people concluding that 2016 felt rather rotten by the year’s end. After all, this was the year that kicked off Brexit, saw Pauline Hanson’sreturn into Australian politicsand, most notably, the transformation of Trump’s presidency as a punchline into a tangible, horrifying reality.Was this not the year that kicked off the divisive hellscape we find ourselves in today? Dare we even mention theHarambeof it all?Pop culture-wise, 2016 was also notable for its many beloved celebrity deaths. David Bowie.Alan Rickman. Carrie Fisher. Prince and George Michael, for god’s sake! It also saw the genesis of Jared Leto’s terribleportrayal of the Joker in Suicide Squad, while the#MeToo movementwas still a year away from truly breaking ground.The colourful fashion trends of the early 2010s that were built upon the foundation of experimentation also muted into something a lot more corporate and a lot less fun, spurred on by the girlboss-ification of culture.It’s too easy to fall into a rose-coloured haze when reminiscing about the past, especially when a lot of these images are quite literally draped in a pink-hued filter. For those of us who came of age at the time, it’s natural to feel nostalgic for when adulthood still felt electrifying. So, it’s also not that hard to see why a lot of folks are now yearning for a time when avocado toast was thrilling and AI was confined to science fiction.We were clubbing to Rihanna’s then-new album, Coachella was still the epitome of cool and Pokémon Go managed to achieve world peace for a limited time, forcing people to leave their hovels and go outside to touch grass en masse.As someone who can’t help but becomesentimental for practically every moment of my life, it’s hard to resist the siren song of the 2016 culture reappraisal. I was blasting Lemonade andBlonde, watching Stranger Things and Insecure for the first time, while noshing on sugary pink Starbucks concoctions only a young person could stomach and soaking up the final moments of optimism that was extinguished by 2017. A lot of us didn’t know the world could get so scary, so quickly.Contrast this with our current year, which has only existed for a few weeks but is already chock-full of the chaos characteristic of the 2020s. We began amid the devastating fallout of the Bondi beach massacre, while a US president elected a decade prior made threats to forcibly take over nations.But losing oneself in the rose-tinted echoes of the past does not a good coping mechanism make.Despite the horrors, great art is still being made, and this bout of 2016 wistfulness might be the very cure for this new-year funk. Let’s learn from our mistakes! I would even argue that the sheer awfulness brought on 10 years ago has made the majority of us more resilient and aware of injustice; even if it feels like the opposite is true.Besides, 2026 may yet become another beloved calendar darling in the pantheon of memorable years – we haven’t even had a full month of it yet!Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaOpinionCelebritycommentShareReuse this content"

Violi for the ConversationMany tattoo inks available in Australia fail to meet current EU standards, with no national regulatory framework to protect consumersMon 19 Jan 2026 18.51 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 19.27 ESTShareIn recent decades, millions of Australians have embraced body art – an estimated30% of adultshave a tattoo. Over a third of those with tattoos have five or more pieces.Trend reporting from industry and lifestyle sources suggests designs are becoming increasinglylarge, colourful and complex. Although tattoos have become more common, less attention has been paid to what’s in the inks being injected into people’s skin.In a study published today in theJournal of Hazardous Materials, our team analysed tattoo inks available in Australia. We found they contain carcinogenic organic chemicals and toxic metals at levels that wouldn’t meet existing European safety standards.Tattoo ink regulationsInjected into living tissue, tattoo inks are designed to last essentially permanently. Once in the body, pigments can persist, migrate through the lymphatic system or slowly break down over time.Concerns about tattoo ink composition are not new. In Europe, early guidance on such inks emerged morethan a decade ago, and was initially non-binding. As tattooing became more widespread, regulators moved towards stricter controls.Since 2022, the European Union has enforcedbinding chemical limits on tattoo inks, restricting metals including arsenic, cadmium and lead as well as specific organic compounds that are known or suspected to be carcinogenic. Tattoo inks that don’t comply cannot be legally sold in EU member countries.Australia doesn’t have an equivalent national framework for regulating tattoo ink. There’s minimal routine oversight of what tattoo inks contain in Australia, and consumers have limited information available. There’s no requirement to perform routine batch testing of inks sold in Australia.Oversight relies on voluntary compliance, with one government survey released in 2016,and updated in 2018. That survey found many inks wouldn’t meet European guidelines, which at the time were less restrictive than the current EU framework.Similar issues with tattoo inks have been found in theUnited States,SwedenandTurkey. Problems included inaccurate labelling, elevated metal concentrations, and in some cases evidence ofcellular toxicity in lab tests. While people sometimes have acute reactions to tattoo ink, detecting potential long-term or chronic exposures is much harder.What we did and what we foundThe project began with an interesting question from a high school student. As part of her senior year research project, Bianca Tasevski, then at St Mary Star of the Sea College in Wollongong, contacted the School of Chemistry at the University of New South Wales to ask what was actually in tattoo inks.To answer the question, we analysed 15 tattoo inks including black and coloured inks sold in Australia. The inks were all from major, established international brands widely used by tattoo artists.This analysis provides a snapshot of inks currently sold in Australia, and was not intended to monitor batches across locations as a surveillance exercise, which is a role arguably more suited to regulators. Thus, specific brands are not disclosed.With two standard, widely used laboratory approaches, we measured the concentrations of metals in the inks and screened for a broad range of organic chemicals.From former Nazis to refugees and DV survivors, tattoo removal is giving Australians a ‘second chance’Read moreEvery ink we tested would have failed at least one EU safety requirement. We detected multiple toxic metals at concentrations exceeding EU law. These include arsenic, cadmium, chromium and lead. Although detected at trace levels, these concentrations are considered unacceptable for tattoo inks by EU regulators.We also identified organic compounds in some inks, including aromatic amines restricted in EU countries because of theircarcinogenic potential.Some patterns emerged across ink types. Black inks contained a broader range of regulated metals, while brightly coloured inks often contained high levels of specific pigment-associated metals.Why pigments often contain metalsIdeally, tattoo pigments should be bright, stable and resistant to fading. Metals are particularly important in obtaining such properties.Metals are not always intentionally included in inks. They can be residues or impurities from pigment manufacturing, or byproducts from incomplete purification.In our study, we found extremely high concentrations of some pigment-associated metals including titanium, aluminium and zirconium in specific coloured inks.These metals aren’t currently restricted in tattoo ink under EU legislation, but their presence at such high levels is notable because of long exposure times, unknown chemical forms, and unknown effects of chronic exposure.Ink chemistry is not the same as health riskWe’re not toxicologists, and our study doesn’t assess health effects. Our work was limited to analysing the chemical composition of tattoo inks. We didn’t measure how much of these substances are absorbed into the body, how they behave over time, or whether they cause any harm.Health effects will depend strongly on many factors including chemical form, dose, exposure time and individual biology. Cancer Council Australia advises tattooshave not been shown to cause cancer, but notes concerns about ink composition.Anumber ofepidemiological studieshave examined potential links between tattoos and health outcomes. However, such studies are challenging to interpret without directly measuring ink chemistry or exposure.We need better regulationThe findings point to a clear regulatory gap in consumer protection. Many tattoo inks available in Australia wouldn’t meet current EU standards and there’s no routine system in place to identify or address this blind spot.A sensible, practical step would be increasing the monitoring of tattoo inks and reviewing Australian standards to align with international best practice. This would improve transparency, provide clearer information to consumers, and reduce unnecessary exposure to hazardous substances.Tattoos are a form of self-expression that many Australians value. As with other products that are injected into the body, knowing what they contain is a reasonable starting point for oversight and informed decision-making.William Alexander Donald is a professor of chemistry at UNSW, and Jake Violi is a postdoctoral fellow at UNSW.

We know Farage’s party will only enrich the wealthyMon 19 Jan 2026 12.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 13.40 ESTShareClass politics is back, as if it ever went away. Robert Jenrickdeclares thatTories are toffs and “the divide in British politics has become Reform’s workers party versus the Tory posh party”. He says the Tories are so “out of touch” they are no longer “the party of working people, of provincial Britain, of the towns and cities”. He’s not wrong, says Prof Tim Bale, political analyst: “Reform can claim to be a disproportionately working-class party.”Considering the social class difference between the two rightwing parties, where does Jenrick belong? As a private school and Cambridge-educated former director of Christie’s auction house, is he too posh for Reform, even though he’s the son of a small businessman and first in his family to go to university? Hardly, since it’s a party founded by zillionaires. It’s a forever political mystery that low-paid/working-class voters will opt for the very wealthy with contrary financial interests. Bale points out that the Tories’ grip on power always relied on backing from a third of working-class voters.Populist demagogues of the Jenrick/Reform stamp seduce with appeals to “anti-elite” emotions, only to betray supporters as cannon fodder once in power. As money flows to thehyper-rich in the US under Donald Trump, the trickery in Reform’s tax-and-spend policies would similarlyreward better-off peoplemost. But Nigel Farage is adept at the theatrics of class, brandishing a pint and last weekopposing a tougher drink-drive limitas an assault by Labour’s “Islington, north London, bicycling classes” on British pub culture in rural areas. The irony is that this Labour cabinet, as it earnestly strives to save lives on the road, has the most working-class origins ever, but it lacks that bogus working-class blokey swagger of the Dulwich College city trader.Class always matters. Tomorrow’s report from the National Centre for Social Research shows education has become an even stronger class proxy and predictor of voting. “A person with education below A-levels or no educational qualifications had about two times the odds of voting for either theConservativesor Reform UK than someone with a university degree or higher,” it finds. The more educated join the liberal-left side of the great line, the least educated vote most right. That’s a long tradition. Over 150 years ago the political economist John Stuart Mill said: “Stupid people are generally Conservative.” Tories were often called “the stupid party” – even by themselves sometimes, approvingly, as a sign that they are closer to public sentiment than liberal pointy-heads. Before that, the Know-Nothings in the US in the 1850s were a nativist, anti-immigration, anti-Irish Catholic movement. Education humanises, which is why the right wants to reverse the trend of more learning.Class may shift and morph, but gross inequality is more pressing than ever. Narrowing that class gap is Labour’s founding mission: its governments always make some progress. How it hates the “metropolitan elite” tag, trying to cling to the identity of its name and old roots in the north and Midlands. That nostalgia is an error, says Bale: even in red-wall marginals the votes it can win are not now the old working class. AlthoughLabourat the last general election won most working-class votes, it has to face up to its definition by Prof Sir John Curtice, doyen of psephologists: “Labour’s core vote is now the young middle-class professionals in London. That’s a stereotype, but that’s who they now are, mainly.”That’s hard to accept for middle-class Labour people who see themselves as on the side of the working class, committed to improving the lot of those with the least. The mortal blow to their self-image was the Brexit vote, when so many working-class voters they thought they stood with shoulder-to-shoulder marched away in the opposite direction. That hurt, viscerally. Yet the class mission is just as pressing as ever when the top 10%owns five times the wealthof Britain’s entire bottom half and, well educated or not,84% thinkthe income gap is too wide.No amount of defections will change the fact that Reform and the Tories are singing the same tunes | John HarrisRead moreThe great rise in education is a Labour success, withhalf of working-age adults having a degreeor level 4 equivalent, increasing with each age cohort. Only around7% of my generationwent to university. All of the cabinet and shadow cabinet have degrees, but only four out of seven Reform MPs. It’s quite a class divide that onlyone in five Reform supportersare graduates, partly because they are older.Britain’s failure has beenleaving behindthe one in five who have no qualifications, worse than in similar countries. An unintended consequence of better education for most has been “credentialism”, making qualifications obligatory, barring the old tea-boy-to-boardroom route up the ladder. In trying to prevent any more left-behind children, Labour’s education funding priorities go to early yearsBest Start hubs, further education and apprenticeships, as ever putting class first. Will well-intentioned middle-class Labour be rewarded for that? In the long run, yes, as more educated people are less likely to vote right.For a crumb of comfort in facing the hard right, Curtice reminds me that Reform voters are a lot older, as are Tories. “They remember primary schools with world maps coloured British empire pink, those values are unrecognisable now.” Brexit was their last hurrah, now widely rejected. Unless Reform swerves in new ways to attract the young, this rising up against the socially liberal “elite” may be a dying gasp, not a rising force. If Reform wants class to be the battleground, that’s Labour turf – so bring it on.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsInequalityOpinionLabourConservativesReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

I’m not entirely sure why. Perhaps it’s because he died during the pandemic lockdowns, which made the basic administrative tasks required after someone dies even harder. Or perhaps it’s because he didn’t leave any instructions about where he wanted to be scattered, and the idea of storing an urn without a plan is too overwhelming. Or, perhaps, grief just made it impossible to complete that final step.When someone dies, the paperwork seems endless. And even after you think you’re done, letters arrive in the name of the dead person and you are forced to pick up the phone once again and deal with it, while later breaking at the sight of their name on a bill they will never pay. It is utterly exhausting to be undertaking all of this when you are chafed with grief, and also attempting to organise a funeral, a memorial, a burial or a cremation.Given that nearly two-thirds of Australians choose to be cremated, it would make sense if we had plans for what we wanted after we were gone. And many of us do. But others do not – leaving the decision to the living. And because those of us left behind are desperate to honour the person we love, we are tasked with scattering their ashes somewhere important, somewhere relevant, somewhere we know they’d approve of. And that can feel like an overwhelming responsibility at a time when getting out of bed is hard enough.When my mum died, we scattered her ashes at a bend on the Williamstown beach in Melbourne. She’d grown up there, surviving a hard and often impoverished childhood by escaping to the lifesaving club, so returning her to the water made sense. And it was a place we all remembered her being, so we could sit with her memory whenever we visited.Later, Dad admitted he’d also scattered some of her ashes in his front garden, near the spot where we’d buried my brother’s dog. At the time, I hated the idea of mum being separated, and I decided that when it was my turn, I’d leave strict instructions about where I wanted to be. But now ironically that I’m older, and closer to death myself, I’m not sure how I feel about any of these final steps.A decade since Dad died, cricket has become a reminder of his love for us | Lucianne TontiRead moreMy daughter is currently studying an arts subject called Death at university, and part of the assessment is creating a service for her own funeral, and another for someone she loves. Rather than being frightened by the content, she has relished the candidness of the conversations with other students and lecturers. She is now comfortable discussing the environmental costs of cremation and burials, the ritual of washing the body, and of using a shroud rather than a coffin. At 20, it may seem young to be having these sorts of conversations, but I’d argue that instead of making it mysterious and secretive, she can now talk openly about what she wants when she goes.When I tell a friend I haven’t collected my partner’s ashes, the look on her face makes me question if I am neglectful leaving him to rest in a drawer somewhere instead of bringing him home. And so, I immediately email the funeral home to enquire about collection, apologising for having taken so long. The director is reassuring, explaining it isn’t uncommon for a funeral home to store uncollected ashes, although there is an endpoint because they can’t keep them for ever. She suggests perhaps I could come in the following week. We make a date. But when the day arrives, I cancel at the last minute. It still feels too early.It is only when my dad’s ashes, buried in a box of family photographs, come to rest in my office that I decide it is time to collect my partner’s ashes too. My dad died in January last year, and we still haven’t worked out what to do with him either, but I like him being in my house. Sometimes I even have a chat when I am supposed to be working. Read him a sentence of two of something I’m struggling with. I decide that I like the idea of the two men that I loved being stored in such close proximity. It’s as if they are company for each other.And so, I rebook the appointment. And this time I won’t cancel.Nova Weetman is an award-winning author of books for children and young adults, including The Edge of Thirteen, winner of the Abia award 2022.Explore more on these topicsDeath and dyingOpinionFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s why they’re silent about the biggest of them allIngrid RobeynsEconomic inequality is at the heart of all humanity’s major problems, but the wealthiest refuse to confront a system that benefits themMon 19 Jan 2026 08.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 14.34 ESTShareThis week, hundreds of government leaders, heads of state, and business executives are gathering at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) inDavos. They will be discussing solutions to the world’s biggest risks and problems.But everything suggests that, once more, what will not be addressed at their meeting is the biggest threat to humanity and the planet: neoliberal capitalism.All forms of capitalism are characterised by extensive private ownership of companies as well as the primacy of the profit motive. But the specific neoliberal form of capitalism that has risen to dominance from the late 1970s onwards has additional features: the privatisation of companies previously in public ownership; a shift in power from workers to capital owners; and reduced taxes on entrepreneurs and the richest.The transition from mixed economies under social democracies to neoliberal capitalism has led to a notable increase of wealth concentration at the top, which is now eroding (and in some places even destroying) our democracies. The absence of a sustained discussion of neoliberal capitalism in elite circles is illogical, since it is the main cause of the other problems that will be discussed at Davos.Last week, the WEF launched its 2026 Global Risks Report, in preparation for the Davos meeting. Experts were asked to pick from a provided list the risks that they consider to be the biggest for the world. Geo-economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation and social polarisation are regarded as the top three risks for the next two years. Over a period of 10 years, the top three are extreme weather conditions, biodiversity loss and ecosystems collapse and critical changes to Earth systems.Inequality in income and wealth comes in seventh place. The analysis in the report presents it as the factor that is most central, as it connects most other risks. That is certainly a valid observation. However, the commentary in the report does not provide a good understanding of what the precise problem with inequality is. The WEF reduces inequality to the feelings of citizens who perceive themselves to be excluded and who are unhappy with their limited opportunities for social mobility.Yet at its core, economic inequality is about much more fundamental issues. It is about who gets what share of what we produce together.Neoliberal ideology, with its focus on individuals and the efficiency gains of competition, makes us inclined to think that we can attribute wealth-holding to individual efforts. But this is a myth.The economy is a complicated ecosystem of interlinked processes, in which the areas where the largest profits are made are reliant on other fields that provide the conditions for this to be possible. Without people working in the public sector for the common good, such as (often poorly paid) childcare workers, teachers and NHS doctors and nurses, there would be no productive workforce to co-create the profits of the business owners.In recent decades the divide has widened, making capital owners even richer and workers even poorer. Taxes have also shifted from capital to labour, and the possibilities for the very richest people to pay hardly any taxes have amplified. That is what citizens are also angry about – and rightly so.As I documented in detail in my book Limitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth,economic inequality is also about the increase in social, ecological and political damage caused by billionaires and centimillionaires (one whose wealth is estimated at $100m or more). But to see that, we need a system-level analysis of the fundamentals of our political economy. And unfortunately, we have no reason to believe that this will happen in Davos. As long as we dodge the question of whether neoliberal capitalism delivers what we want, and fail to take seriously the question of whether there are better systems, the world’s key problems cannot be properly understood, let alone solved.We now also know very well what to expect if the increase in extreme wealth concentration is not tackled. In his book As Gods Among Men, the economic historian Guido Alfani writes that extreme wealth has historically been tolerated because the richest people have come to the aid of society at crucial moments, whereas now we are seeing mainly the opposite. Luke Kemp, who analyses 5,000 years of the rise and fall of civilisations in his book Goliath’s Curse, sees the same trend towards collapse emerging for global capitalism. According to Kemp, there are two paths for our future: either we will witness global societal collapse, or we will radically change the way we organise our societies. Kemp also detects economic inequality as a crucial factor in predicting societal collapse.And it’s all happening while we stand by and watch, simply because political and economic elites are not willing to engage in an honest debate about what economic system we need.At the root of all our problems stands one travesty: politicians’ surrender to the super-rich | George MonbiotRead moreIf meetings such as the one in Davos do not even talk about capitalism, how can our leaders start to even question it? The Global Risks Report contains precisely zero references to capitalism (let alone socialism or social democracy or other relevant terms). It says nothing about the extensive knowledge that exists in academic scholarship (and beyond) about the disadvantages of capitalism and the possibilities of alternative economic systems.The elite gathering in Davos seem to forget that the economic system, including companies, financial institutions and other economic actors, does not exist for its own sake. Economic activity exists to ensure that all people can live a good and meaningful life, in a just society, and within the ecological limits of the planet. Neoliberal capitalism does not deliver that for us. So why are we not discussing whether there is a better alternative?The answer to that question is that the elites meeting in Davos benefit from neoliberal capitalism, and they have been able to spread a false ideology that maintains that it is the best possible system for all of us. They have a very strong interest in maintaining the system that gives them wealth, status and power. An increasing proportion of the wealth created under neoliberal capitalism goes to the richest 1%. The remaining wealth-holders among the richest 10% are also rewarded for working full-time to protect the money at the top of the wealth pyramid. They do so by working in what scholars have come to call “the wealth defence industry”.That is what we need to know about increased economic inequality. And it remains largely unmentioned in elite circles. Because if it were mentioned, people in the economic elite would then have no choice but to look at their assets and portfolios and ask themselves an uncomfortable question: am I part of the problem?Ingrid Robeyns is an economist and philosopher, and holds the chair in ethics of institutions at Utrecht University.

But it's complicated by lots of dos and don'tsMon 19 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 11.48 ESTShare‘Idon’t believe in an interventionist God,”sings Nick Cavein the opening line of his 1997 song, Into My Arms. But Jim Sharma, a football fan who is a devotee of Wolverhampton Wanderers FC, very much does – and who can blame him?For the detached, the uninformed and nonsports fans, the issue here is that Wolves had a terrible start to the season and, until the other day, looked set to beat Derby County’s unenviable record as theworst-performing teamin Premier League history. Then they played my team, West Ham, and had their first taste of victory since April. Wolves 3 West Ham 0.How did that happen? I was watching that game – with my Wolves-supporting father-in-law – and I think we were both equally shocked by the result. But maybe Wolves had help. Sharma believes that it happenedbecause the pope himself had promised to pray for him– and his team – when he presented the pontiff with a special Wolves shirt (with “Pope” and the number one on the back) when they met in Turkey a few weeks previously.It’s arguable. Wolves played another seven games (of which they lost six and drew one) between then and when they finally managed to win one. Why the delay? Surely the pope’s prayers would be answered quicker than that? On Saturday, when relegation threatened and West Ham beat Tottenham with a goal at the very end – the first win in 10 games – it seemed like a miracle to us. Was it via the pope again, or lots of prayers conveyed direct from east London? Neither you might say. But then, God/mysterious ways …This question of divine intervention – does it exist? When is it appropriate to seek it? Who is listened to, who isn’t quite so much? Who should be? It all deserves some attention.I am a vicar. I believe in the power of prayer (obviously!), but still I feel it’s problematic to assume that the almighty micromanages human affairs to that extent. Take the weather: when farmers and gardeners are praying for rain, but brides want a nice, fine day for their wedding, what is God supposed to do? Whom should He disappoint?This divine dilemma was powerfully illustrated in the surprisingly theologically sophisticated2003 comedy Bruce Almighty. Jim Carrey’s Bruce – who has temporarily been given all of God’s powers while the “Big Man” (Morgan Freeman) is on holiday – is overwhelmed by the sheer number of requests. So he simply answers “yes” to all of them. The result is chaos: hurricanes and rioting in the streets – because while everyone won the lottery that week, that also meant they received only $1 each.But the implications of this “slot-machine” view of divine intervention can be even more troubling than that. I always wince when I hear a fellow believer testifying that they prayed for a parking space and “the Lord provided one”. Really? I know I’m only a humble employee, not the boss – but does the boss really adjudicate parking spaces? Isn’t His time better spent addressing child poverty or the conflict in the Middle East?View image in fullscreenMorgan Freeman as God and and Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan in Tom Shadyac’s Bruce Almighty (2003).Photograph: Universal/AllstarAnd, of course, the belief that “God is on our side” has been the cause of many of the problems in the world throughout history. Not all of them, as some atheists like to claim, but enough to be deeply embarrassing for religious people such as me.Fortunately, most of us have moved on from that tribalistic understanding of God.As the novelist Anne Lamott once said: “You can safely assume that you have created God in your own image when it turns out that He hates all the same people you do.”God – if She exists – must be the God ofallpeople, not justmypeople.It’s complicated. Several years ago, looking for my first senior post as a priest, I found myself shortlisted for a parish that seemed just right for me. I prayed earnestly that I would get the job. I also asked God to bless the other candidates with something equally perfect for them – to show Him that I wasn’t completely selfish. However, on reflection, I realised that there was a further flaw in my thinking: again, what was I asking God to do? If the decision-makers preferred one of my rivals – which is, in fact, what happened – did I want Him to supernaturally change their hearts and minds and pick me instead? Wouldn’t that be tantamount to mind control? Hardly compatible with either free will or a truly loving God.As it happens, if I had got that job, I wouldn’t have ended up in Wye, where I’ve now been for 16 happy years. So, it seems that mydeeperprayer – that God would provide the right post at the right time – was answered.Does it really work like that? Would any deity be more concerned at any one time with the theological employment status of one West Ham fan in Kent than the health and welfare of millions of other people around the world? I can’t answer that, other than to quote Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury (who, coincidentally,has helped Caveto latterly feel more sympathetic to the idea of an interventionist God),who said thatwhile it might be “intellectually frustrating” to suggest that prayer can “tilt the outcome of a situation in a particular way”, that is, nonetheless, the only way “to do justice to the somewhat chaotic Christian experience of intercession and unexpected outcomes (miracles, if you must)”.So one can believe on the basis that nothing else makes much sense. That helps me. But I still won’t be praying that West Ham will rally and somehow avoid relegation this season – for all the ethical, moral and theological reasons that I’ve mentioned above – and because I simply haven’t got that much faith.Ravi Holy is the vicar of Wye in Kent and a standup comedianExplore more on these topicsReligionOpinionChristianitycommentShareReuse this content"

At the moment, you can’t prompt it with the name of a specific pop star, but asking for “stadium-level confessional pop-country” that “references past relationships” or “public rivalries” might get you a Taylor Swift-style song or thereabouts.In June 2024, Suno becamethe target of litigationby record company trade body the RIAA on behalf of major labels in the US, while German collection society GEMA, representing songwriters, filed its own lawsuit the following January. Both claimed the service was training its systems on their copyrights without authorisation or licences.View image in fullscreenEffortless … Suno’s user interfacePhotograph: SunoGen AI music services have triggered an existential crisis in the music industry. The utopian reading is that they will democratise creativity. The dystopian one is that art will be smothered by AI slop, as humans making music become surplus to requirements. (And many musicians already struggle to make a living from streaming revenues.) Dave Stewart of Eurythmics called them an “unstoppable force”and saidmusicians should, begrudgingly or enthusiastically, embrace them. Catherine Anne Davies, AKA the Anchoress,told me recentlyshe believes it to be “dystopian”. Music lawyer Gregor Pryor has argued it is already killing off background music work.Suno is now valued at $2.45bn – yet it only has 1 million paying subscribers“I like to think of us as trying to make the next format for recorded music,” says Shulman. “The format of the future will be interactive.” What does he mean? “It should be social, meaning you’re doing it with other people. What we are doing is building the best digital version of that.”Investors were clearly not scared off. In November, Suno raised $250m (£187m) in funding, taking its valuation to $2.45bn (£1.83bn). Gen AI is the hottest thing in Silicon Valley, with a Stanford University report saying it drew $34bn (£25bn) in private investment in 2024. But there are fears, notably at theBank of England, that this brilliant boom can only be followed by a bitter bust. For now, however, investors believe gen AI is too big to fail. The stakes for Suno’s success are astonishingly high, especially given the recent leaking of aninvestor presentationsuggesting the company only had 1 million paying subscribers. The standard monthly plan costs £8.25 ($10).“The thing that investors needed help realising,” says Shulman, “is how important music is in the world. Once you show them, their minds are changed and they realise that much, much more is possible.”When a new outside technology imposes itself on the music industry, the response typically runs from apoplexy to legal action, then negotiation and ultimately licensing. The three biggest names in gen AI music are at different stages along this trajectory. Klay got dealswith all three majorsbefore launching or training its technology on music, making it a rarity in this “Launch first, license later” world. Udio signed deals with Universal Music Group (UMG) and Warner Music Group (WMG). Suno, however, only has a deal with WMG, and legal action from the other majors is still live.Listen to Into the Blue by Sienna Rose – a viral Top 10 hit on Spotify, widely suspected to be AI-generatedShulman, now 39, was a failing musician, which provided a catalyst for Suno. “I played in a lot of bands in high school and college,” he says, speaking by video from his home in the US, pointing to the bass hanging on the wall behind him. “I was OK, not great, and I was not going to be able to make a great career out of it.” He’s cautious and thoughtful when speaking, without the tang of arrogance you sometimes get from heavily hyped start-up founders.A career swerve into a physics PhD led him to Suno’s other co-founders. They wanted to build something different to heavyweight AI companies such as OpenAI, as those deal with “reasoning and automation to solve very specific problems. Music isn’t like that. There’s not a right or a wrong answer. It’s not a problem to solve.”I made a really funny song with my four-year-old yesterday. I would sound like ‘AI slop’ to you – but I love itThere remains debate about where exactly Suno sourced the music to train its systems – essentially breaking music into data strands for cataloguing – before its licensing deals were in place. “We train our models on medium- and high-quality music we can find on the open internet,” wrote Shulman in a2024 blogpost. Suno’s initial legal defence was that this constituted fair use, and the music it drew on did not require prior permission. The record industry thought differently. “Fair use,”countered the RIAA, does not apply “when the output seeks to ‘substitute’ for the work copied.”I ask Shulman what he means by the “open internet”. There is a clear distinction between what is copyrighted (recordings are typically protected for 70 years) and what is in the public domain. “Copyright is a different thing,” he says. “I can’t get into too many specifics because there is active legal stuff going on, and also some of it is trade secrets.”Could Suno’s philosophy of “democratising” music-making be inherently anti-art? What once sprang from extraordinary human creativity now becomes ordinary. Shulman insists that, as with digital recording or sampling, this is just another example of how technology “pushes music forward”, how “new people get discovered” and “new genres get invented”.The issue of so-called AI slop is wholly subjective, he says. “I made a really funny song with my four-year-old yesterday morning. That is ‘slop’ to you – you don’t care about it – but I love it. It’s fantastic.” He is keen to stress, meanwhile, that music generated by Suno can be extremely high quality.And AI-powered music is flooding streaming services: Deezer says more than a third of music delivered to it each day is AI (equal to 50,000 tracks), and 70% of streams of AI music on Deezer are fraudulent (scammers get cheaply made AI tracks on to such services, then use bots tomanipulate streamsat scale in order to get royalty payments, although services areincreasingly wiseto this). The company has startedtagging AI tracksto alert users.Bandcamprecently announced that it won’t platform music “generated wholly or in substantial part by AI”.View image in fullscreen‘A bit of a goof’ … the 70s rock-style AI-generated band Velvet Sundown.Illustration: thevelvetsundownbandShould others follow? Shulman will say only that he doesn’t want to be “the arbiter of what happens on other platforms. There’s maybe some line to draw, but I don’t know where.”Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI “act”, released their debut album and a follow-up last summer. The 70s-styled rock band generated millions of streams, but it was a short-lived phenomenon. “I don’t know exactly what their strategy was,” Shulman says of Velvet Sundown. “It was all a bit of a goof. I think that’s why it was a flash in the pan.”Some AI-powered tracks have staying power, though. Following allegations it used Suno to cloneJorja Smith’s voice, I Run, by Haven, was excluded from the UK charts, but a version re-recorded by Kaitlin Aragon, a human singer, was chart-eligible and went Top 10. Into the Blue bySienna Rose, who is widely suspected to be an AI act, recently made the Top 10 on Spotify’s Viral 50 Global chart. And the track Jag Vet, Du Är Inte Min is one of the biggest of the year so far in Sweden, although it has beenbooted out of the country’s chartsfor being “mainly AI-generated”.AI, bot farms and innocent indie victims: how music streaming became a hotbed of fraud and fakeryRead moreMore concerning was Suno being used last year to create tracks that theAnti-Defamation Leaguesaid glorified Adolf Hitler, deployed racist slurs and talked of “white power”. Shulman says: “It was three songs that had a combined 10 plays. It was a very small thing. Unfortunately, drawing attention to it made it worse.” He says Suno has developed more rigorous safeguards to stop similar things happening in the future.Suno is keen for its deal with WMG to be seen as proof that gen AI companies can partner in mutually beneficial ways. Did the$1.5bn (£1.1bn) that AI company Anthropicpaid to the book industry in September to settle claims its AI was trained on pirated copies spook Suno to get deals done swiftly? “We didn’t pay all that much attention to that,” says Shulman. “There’s a lot more to do together than fighting one another. And we intend, with this Warner partnership, to show that very strongly.”But questions do persist about the WMG deal. Did the label insist on changes to the service? Were payments made to cover past use of its music in Suno’s training? Did WMG get equity in Suno? Shulman won’t reply, saying only that it is “a little early” to share such information, possibly fearful of compromising pending licensing deals.View image in fullscreenJorja Smith, whose vocal style may have been imitated by an AI to generate I Run by Haven.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/ShutterstockAgreements with the majors are one thing, but wooing artists is another. The majors insist they will only have their music used if they opt into deals. But if only a tiny percentage do – never mind their name, image and likeness rights – this will surely compromise results.In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell popularised “the 10,000-hour rule”, suggesting that this is the amount of practise time an artist needs to achieve any sort of mastery. Will the likes of Suno change this? “I think people will [still] have to spend 10,000 hours,” says Shulman. “They may be doing different things and practising different skills, but they will certainly need to spend 10,000 hours to make the best music in the world.”Musicians are deeply concerned about AI. So why are the major labels embracing it?Read moreAs part of its charm offensive, Suno signed up US producerTimbalandas a strategic advisor, but he had to make a public apology after he took a track by producerK Freshwithout permission and,Fresh alleged, “uploaded it into Suno’s AI platform, and released an unauthorised AI remix”.Nevertheless, Shulman says the musicians he talks to about Suno see it as an important new creative tool and songwriting aid. He had previously told the 20VC podcast: “I think the majority of people don’t enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.” This does not mean musicians hate the creative processin toto, but they are appreciative of tools that can remove at least some of the grunt work.They just see it as a dirty secret, he suggests now. “When you get people one-on-one, they’re just more comfortable admitting it. It was described to me that we’re the Ozempic of the music industry – everybody is on it and nobody wants to talk about it.”The fear, of course, is that by putting music on Ozempic, it wastes away to nothing.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockAI (artificial intelligence)Music industryComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So while I was still at Harvard, I’d make music videos in my head. One day, while listening toBad Boy/Having a Party by Luther Vandross, I thought: “This could be a great music video or movie.” And I sat down that night and wrote a script for a short film that ended up not only being made but shown at festivals and becoming a big hit in the world of student films. Spike Lee’sShe’s Gotta Have Ithad piqued interest in up-and-coming black film-makers. New Line Cinema saw my short and brought me in for a meeting. I pitched an expanded version of my idea and they said: “Let’s do it.”The studio wanted Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. Instead, I asked Kid ’n Play – AKA Christopher “Kid” Reid and Christopher “Play” Martin – to star. I loved their music videos, their style, their look. But I still had to convince New Line. They said: “Who are these guys?” I said: “They’ve got platinum records.” I had no idea if they did!The VP ran upstairs and said: 'We need to grab these guys'The movie – about a kid who’s been grounded but can’t bear to miss the party of the year – kept everything from the student film. It was just a matter of building on the world and the characters. It was exhilarating. I remember thinking: “It seems to be going great, but how do I know what going great feels like?”A lot of movies have clearly been inspired by House Party. That’s great. And I was inspired by Risky Business, National Lampoon and Animal House. I watched Lovers Rock,one of the movies Steve McQueen madeabout black British life. It wasn’t a comedy, but I thought: “This really captures the same spirit as House Party.”House Party is the only film to capture a very specific period of hip-hop, just before gangsta rap. It also talked about safe sex, a burgeoning issue at the time. I thought: “We’re gonna hide this” – like when you have to give your dog a pill so wrap it in bacon. We won an award from a health clinic in New Jersey that said: “Kids come in, ask for condoms and reference your film.” That was one of the things I’ve carried with me: make fun movies, but there’s nothing wrong with a little protein in there.Christopher ‘Play’ MartinKid and I had worked very hard for what felt like for ever to sign a deal with Select Records. Our first album, 2 Hype, came out in 1988. The reason Reggie wanted us from the giddy-up was because of our music videos. We were very animated. I guess you could say the camera loved us.I didn’t want to do the movie. Run–DMC’s Tougher Than Leather didn’t do well at all and I thought: “If Run–DMC can’t pull off a hit movie, how the heck will Kid ’n Play?” We were making more legal money than I’d ever seen. It was a gamble to ruin the momentum. But I was outvoted by Kid and our producer, Hurby Luv Bug. It was the best outvoted experience I’ve ever had.Kings From Queens: The Run-DMC Story review – incredibly honest and raw TVRead moreWe went to a meeting at New Line in the heart of Manhattan, in a suite on the 19th or 20th floor. We were given some scenes to improv, but it was horrible. I thought: “Well, we ain’t getting this movie.” This VP from New Line escorted us out on his way to a late lunch, but it was 3pm, just when all the high schools were letting out, and all these kids who recognised us swarmed us like we were the Beatles or the Jackson Five. This VP went back upstairs and told his business partners: “We need to grab these guys.”Making the movie felt like work, nine to five. There’s a part where I’m pushing equipment into the trunk of the car, scraping up speakers. The trunk came slamming down on my hand, so hard it bent my ring. Reggie went: “All right, next take.” I was like: “Dude, really?”House Party is probably the most excellent representation of that era. Even though Kid and I were musically successful, our characters still represented any other wannabe rapper. The clever thing is that the film never says what city or state we’re in, which means anyone can think it took place in their hood.House Party is available on 4K UHD from 2 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeComedy filmsHip-hopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the endearing protagonists of the latest spin-off of the franchise, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, invite it.Their names, as in theGeorge RR Martinnovellas on which the series is based, are Dunk – short for Ser Duncan the Tall – and Egg. Dunk (Peter Claffey, a suitably tall former Irish rugby union player, last seen in Bad Sisters) was squire to a hedge – non-noble – knight, Ser Arlan of Pennytree (Danny Webb), who took the boy under his wing but never quite got round to knighting the man before dying. We first meet Dunk burying his mentor under an old elm tree and taking up his arms against the sea of troubles that are about to engulf him. Dunk is a simple soul (very simple, some might say – he may look like a medieval Jack Reacher, but inside he is more of an eager but baffled labrador) and sets out to find a lord he can himself serve as a hedge knight.Fortunately, one of his early pit stops is at a tavern that brings him into the orbit of the bald-headed, ethereal-looking, rovingly intelligent child Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell, a mighty screen presence in a tiny frame and quite fascinating to watch). Egg offers to be Dunk’s squire (“You look like you need me the most”) and off the underdog and underpuppy go through the back roads of Westeros, 100 years before GoT, with the Targaryens on the Iron Throne and some familiar surnames floating around elsewhere, towards a jousting tournament that might provide Dunk with the win and mentor he needs.View image in fullscreenA mighty screen presence … Dexter Sol Ansell as Egg in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc.In Game of Thrones franchise terms, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a bagatelle. If House of the Dragon was born of a desire to turn the tide of fans’ anger over the original’s finale (or final season. Or final seasons. Discuss animatedly until even Jon Snow is bored to death) while keeping the appetite for more alive until GRRM had completed his masterwork, this new offering seems to be something quite different. What this means for our collective hopes for the two remaining books in the sequence, let us not dwell.One of the most obvious points of departure is that while GoT burned through plot like Maester Pycelle’s wildfire through Stannis’s fleet, very little happens in the average episode of AKotSK (which comes in at about the 30-minute mark instead of its progenitor’s full and weighty hour). We are here for the budding friendship between knight and squire, even if it is not always clear – given Egg’s much greater knowledge of how the world works than dear old Dunk’s – which way round those roles are allocated, and a level of emotional investment in the pair that it would have been frankly foolish to apply to any of the characters in GoT once we saw what they did to Ned Stark.It’s not exactly entry-level stuff – there is too much swearing, too many inventive tortures (albeit more often graphically described than shown in full and granular detail as was traditional), plus a bit of full-frontal male nudity that … raises questions. Plus, later on, there is an episode too full of gore for the series to be safely shown to unsupervised non-Eggy children. But it is a much, much gentler proposition than either Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon. Instead of severed peens we get Dunk bumping into lintels. Instead of Red or Purple or Sansa’s weddings, we have averagely drunken nights in taverns. Instead of sons being served up in pies we have no sons being served up in pies. It’s much more restful. And there’s no Ramsay Bolton, save still in your nightmares.View image in fullscreenNo sons being served up in pies here … A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.Which does rather make you wonder who the target audience is? Not children, who might otherwise warm to this tale of a bumbling adult periodically saved by the wise child at his heels. Not epic fantasy fans jonesing for the next instalment of A Song of Ice and Fire (though dragons exist in living memory, this era of early Westeros is free of magic and sorcery). And although it gestures towards larger questions, like the corruption of innocence and the pros and cons of the feudal mentality, it doesn’t delve into them deeply or carry enough weight on its own to attract a great audience of non-diehard GRRM fans.But perhaps the fact that it is not going to set the world on fire, either literally within the show or metaphorically without it, is the point. The real world is now too Westeros-like for us to cope with any more. The land of fabled violence is now our safe space. We are all Dunk, just hoping for protection from even something as fragile as an Egg.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK; in the US it is on HBO; in Australia it is on MaxExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGeorge RR MartinGame of ThronesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not that close. This inky screenprint is bigger than she is, its face wider and taller. But it’s not a picture of the outer person but an inner vision. As we stand in front of it I seem to fall into radiating pools of blackness – to cross into darkness.Emin has curated an exhibition for the depths of winter. It’s a generous, unexpected show with an eclectic yet profound openness to kinds of creativity many might think incompatible: paintings, installations, performance art all face the night here. She sets artists she nurtures at theEmin Studiosalongside her heroes Edvard Munch, Louise Bourgeois and other luminaries of modern art – if luminary is the right word in this stygian setting. For, by a stroke of lighting genius, the Carl Freedman Gallery has been plunged into nocturnal shadow that still lets you see the art.View image in fullscreenBaconian screaming mouth … The Castle and the Citadel by Laura Footes.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist and Carl Freedman Gallery, MargateIt begins with a concrete waistcoat, like something that might be dredged up encasing a skeleton. The body has gone, leaving holes for arms, legs, neck. It’s by Antony Gormley, cast from himself, and you wonder if he is a bit of a Houdini to have escaped it. Uneasy portraiture dominates this room. Munch gazes like a numbed, ragged pair of claws from his 1895 self-portrait, with a skeletal arm.Joline Kwakkenbos, a resident artists at Emin’s Margate studios, displays three bizarre, striking paintings including Self-Portrait as a Painter as Lucretia, in which she sits in 18th-century costume stabbing herself. It gets doomier. A wailing, stuffed head, malformed and agonised, isolated in a vitrine, is Bourgeois’s answer to Munch’s Scream.Some artists have answered Emin’s sombre call with blasts of hokey gothic.Lindsey Mendickhas made ceramic busts of putrid zombie women whose festering sores and disintegrating flesh look all the more repulsive in shiny glazed pottery. Is this horror or comedy horror? Mendick may not be sure herself. PainterLaura Footes, another graduate of Emin’s studios, is clearly serious in her big allegorical painting of the lords of business and politics seated at a long meeting table with a Dracula castle hovering nearby. It uncomfortably smacks of conspiracy theory but a brilliant detail of a Baconian screaming mouth in a pink flesh-cloud shows her ability.Next to Footes’s painting is a relic of a performance byHermann Nitsch, the Vienna actionist who staged outrageous “Orgy-Mystery Theatre” mass happenings at his own castle with lashings of animal blood. It’s a board covered in sketchy lines and real blood from which emerges a skull-faced figure like some Mesoamerican god of death. It’s entitled Design for “Grablegung (Burial)”. Close by, Anselm Kiefer displays a hammer and anvil in a vitrine with Thor written on the glass, a sculpture that shakes with the power of the Norse thunder god.View image in fullscreenCareful with that axe … Georg Baselitz, Ein Werktätiger, 1967, oil on canvas.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist and Modern Collections Limited, LondonMyths and monsters, floating castles and vampire orgies – terrors of the dark. But sometimes you see the uncanny in broad daylight. Walking near his Suffolk home at dawn, the photographerJohnnie Shand Kyddcaptures eerie mists over icy still waters, banks of whiteness shrouding bare trees, clouds looming over wind-raked reeds. These black-and-white pictures hold their own with Kiefer’s mythic vitrines andGeorg Baselitz’s 1967 painting Ein Werktätiger, in which a woodcutter with an axe appears to break into pieces before our eyes, as if he’s chopped himself up with his own axe. The final work is by Gilbert & George. Emin tells me it makes her think of the gates of hell. It’s is a picture in which their faces are compressed, twisted into monster masks amid stark winter branches that form a black gate.Her exhibition, she says, recognises the dark times we are in – you can fill in your own nightmares – but also offers solace from her experience of cancer: “I thought I would die but didn’t.” There is hope in darkness, as stone-age crowds knew when they gathered for the winter solstice at Stonehenge. It is where you have to go to start again. Of course you don’t have to go through what Emin has to know that by entering darkness we discover light. This happens to everyone every 24 hours. You go to bed, put out the light and cross into darkness. When we wake up everything is new. What were those passing phantoms in the night – just dreams and fears?View image in fullscreenAbandon all hope … Gilbert & George, Bowery, 2008.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist and White Cube, LondonFor this artist they are more real than that. In Emin’s large new painting at the centre of the show, a woman is curled up on her bed. Over her stands a cowled visitant. It looks pretty spooky to me but the artist seemingly sees this ghost as a friend, for the painting is called I Am Protected. Maybe we’re all being watched over until we wake up soon: here’s hoping.Crossing into Darkness is at Carl Freeman Gallery, Margate, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsArtTracey EminEdvard MunchAntony GormleyAnselm KieferGilbert & GeorgereviewsShareReuse this content"

Not that it shows: this “refreshingly nasty” (as Barnes’s friend Martin Amis put it) crime caper is beguilingly well written, with passages that display all of Barnes’s perception and wit. The plot of reverse blackmail and the shocking climax only add to the fun.Sample line“Two in the morning is when sounds travel for ever, when a sticky window makes a soft squeak and three Panda cars hear it from miles away.”View image in fullscreen9The Porcupine (1992)Barnes’s shortest novel is a satire of the personalities in a collapsed European communist regime. Former leader Petkanov is to have a televised trial. He believes he did nothing wrong – “They loved me” – and despises Gorbachev’s western-friendliness, “sucking Reagan’s dick and then sucking Bush’s”. His crimes (“He corrupted everything he touched … He lied all the time, as a reflex”) sound ever familiar. This funny, savage novel reminds us that when the old order passes, it doesn’t die; it just waits.Sample line“If you beat someone with a stick and order them to say they love you, sooner or later they will tell you what you want to hear.”View image in fullscreen8The Lemon Table (2004)The second of Barnes’s three story collections is infused with ageing, but full of energy. There’s a musical comedy spirit to A Short History of Hairdressing, in which a man measures his life in haircuts, from youth through marriage (“the only adventure open to the cowardly,” he says, quoting Voltaire) to the “mattressy eyebrow hairs” of old age. Hygiene explores the death of sex, while The Silence focuses on Jean Sibelius, with Barnes wearing his knowledge lightly. In Knowing French he ranks one of his own books, telling an imaginary reader not to bother with his second novel, Before She Met Me (1982). We’re saying nothing.Sample line“When the heart breaks, he thought, it splits like timber, down the full length of the plank.”View image in fullscreen7The Sense of an Ending (2011)Twenty-four years after hecoinedthe term “posh bingo” to describe the Booker prize, Barnes finally won, on his fourth shortlisting. He is in his comfort zone here – middle-class England, memory, sex – but the proximity of death sharpens things. When narrator Tony feels the end is approaching, he looks the other way: to youth, the time before bumptious confidence gave way to the agnosticism of middle age. His quiet life is suddenly overturned by remorse about an ex-girlfriend. And once the mind starts turning, it’s hard to stop.Sample line“Remorse, etymologically, is the act of biting again. That’s what the feeling does to you.”View image in fullscreen6Staring at the Sun (1986)This extravagantly imaginative novel looks back too: but from the future of – ready to feel old? – the year 2020. Barnes predicts online books and a form of AI, but the heart of the story is Jean Serjeant, approaching her 100th birthday and wondering “How do you tell a good life from a bad life, a wasted life?” Her reluctance with sex (“it was like someone being sick all over you”) and her childhood are among the aspects worked through with Barnes’s usual blend of fun and essayistic insight.Sample line“When she thought of Michael and sex she imagined an over-filling water-tank which occasionally had to be drained.”5Arthur & George (2005)Barnes, who was always doing something different, did something different again with this fat historical novel inspired by a real miscarriage of justice, and featuring Arthur Conan Doyle. The story switches between Conan Doyle’s viewpoint and that of the wronged man, George Edalji. It raises questions of truth, Englishness and fame. As arguably Barnes’s most straightforward novel, Arthur & George was rightly predicted by his publishers to win him “an entirely new audience”. “I sort of feel awkward about that,”Barnes said, “because I liked my old audience.”Sample line“He is quite clear about the writer’s responsibilities: they are, firstly, to be intelligible, secondly, to be interesting, and thirdly, to be clever.”4TalkingIt Over (1991)Barnes’s ability to bring a fresh eye to the oldest subjects is seen here, as a love triangle is narrated by the participants in turn, each appealing to the reader: “The three of us are in here until it’s resolved.You’rein here too.” Staid Stuart, flashy Oliver and pragmatic Gillian battle it out, where accounts of the same events differ and there is no objective truth. A sequel, Love, Etc, followed in 2000. Barnes did consider making it a trilogy, but – alas for fans – has now announced that his new book, Departure(s), will be his last.Sample line“Of course,youknow if they’re really fucking, don’t you? Go on, tell me.”View image in fullscreen3The Noise of Time (2016)This novel – Barnes’s best of the 21st century – is a spiritual cousin to The Porcupine, but more grounded and personal. In 1930s Russia, Dmitri Shostakovich has fallen foul of the Soviet authorities: his music is too elitist, insufficiently “authentic, popular and melodious”. But for Shostakovich, music is art, and “art is the whisper of history, heard above the noise of time”. With analytical delicacy and his own popular touch, Barnes untangles the questions of how we submit to power and whether we can look ourselves in the mirror afterwards.Sample line“To be a hero, you only had to be brave for a moment […] but to be a coward was to embark on a career that lasted a lifetime.”2A History of the World in 101/2Chapters (1989)If the storyteller and the experimenter have always been competing impulses in Barnes, here is where they work most beautifully together. It’s a novel in stories, running from biblical times to a futuristic heaven, loosely linked by Noah’s Ark. This is an exceptionally wide-ranging, ambitious book, taking in animals on trial, art criticism and jungle exploration, all in multiple narrative forms. And throughout, it’s as diverting as it is stimulating.Sample line“When I say ‘I’ you will want to know within a paragraph or two whether I meanJulian Barnesor someone invented.”1Flaubert’s Parrot (1984)“I wish he’dshut upabout Flaubert,”said Kingsley Amisof Barnes – but the arch-Francophile was just getting started with this breakthrough book. Following two traditional novels, this felt like a great release: Barnes finally doing what he really wanted to. It tells stories, it plays around, it ducks and feints around the narrator Geoffrey Braithwaite and his, well, Barnesian interest in Flaubert. Incorporating biographers’ professional rivalry, a widower’s grief, opposing chronologies of Flaubert’s life and even an exam paper near the end, this is delicious, nutritious entertainment.Sample line“Whatever else happens, we shall remain stupid.” (Said by Gustave Flaubert, of course.)Explore more on these topicsBooksRankedJulian BarnesFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For a man of 86, he has impressive lung capacity. He lets it go and watches it take a satisfyingly theatrical trajectory, rising to a height, then plummeting. “Free the spirit,” he says, in character as Ed, an elderly gay man searching for release.There was a lot of spirit-freeing over the weekend atPitlochry Festival theatre. In a bold pre-season move bynew artistic director Alan Cumming, the UK’s most idyllic venue launched its first LGBTQ+ festival in an atmosphere of exuberance. Programmed by Lewis Hetherington, Out in the Hills was a three-day compendium of talks, scratch performances and workshops that turned a sedate theatre into a buzzy social hive.I arrived as the audience for Coinneach MacLeod, AKAthe Hebridean Baker, was spilling out. A large and colourful group were posing for a picture in the foyer, while queues squeezed past for the bar. Many were on a high after the previous night’s Queer As Folk! ceilidh, led by theMalin Lewis Trio. Others were anticipating Sunday afternoon’s conversation between trans playwright Jo Clifford and her daughter Catriona Innes. I failed to find anyone who had done Finlay Wilson’s Kilted Yoga, but it was a thing.View image in fullscreenFree spirits … Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming and Graham Norton.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanMcKellen was there for a rehearsed reading of Equinox, a new monologue by Laurie Slade, the playwright drawing on his professional skills as a psychotherapist to mix in reflections on Freud and the Oedipus complex. Written in a tone of spiky regret, it was about Ed’s abandonment of his family and attraction to a domineering younger man. Under the direction of Sean Mathias, McKellen grabbed the mic from the table in front of him and held it close, the better to spit out the plosives of an irascible man struggling to find the right words at the bitter end of his life.“Be slow to judgment,” Ed pleaded as he recalled an estranged daughter, a neglected wife and the desperate patient he failed to help. The relationship with the “midnight man” he picked up in a gay bar seemed no less humiliating.McKellen got a second round of applause simply for sitting in the audience of the next event, a suitably frothy conversation between Cumming andGraham Nortonabout the TV host’s career.View image in fullscreenAn irascible man struggling to find the right words … Ian McKellen performing in Equinox.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanWith Cumming sporting the legend “Ae fond pish” on his black shirt and wearing a pair of ankle boots he got from the set ofThe Traitors US, the tone was frivolous and funny, even as he gently edged into questions about homophobia, representation and rights.‘I’m not just putting on nice plays’: Hollywood star Alan Cumming’s plan to reignite theatre in the Scottish HighlandsRead more“I love that there’s this big gay thing in the middle ofScotland,” said Norton, delighted to be part of such a happy event.

It is currently the most watched film on Netflix, because it is a Netflix movie. So how is Damon choosing to promote his new Netflix movie? By kind of laying into Netflix.During an interview on The Joe Rogan Experience, Damon went to great lengths to describe the differences between going to see a film theatrically and watching it on television. Explaining his experience of watchingOne Battle After Anotherin an Imax screening, Damon said: “I always say it’s more like going to church – you show up at an appointed time. It doesn’t wait for you.”Making something that you know will be primarily watched onNetflix, on the other hand, means resigning yourself to a lack of concentration. Maybe the lights are on. Maybe you’re watching it in chunks. Maybe your kids won’t shut up. Damon told Rogan that the streamer asks film-makers to dumb things down a little, adding a big action set piece early on to keep viewers interested, and advising them that: “It wouldn’t be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they’re watching.” Describing this, Damon added: “It’s going to really start to infringe on how we’re telling these stories.”View image in fullscreenThey are cops, going after a drug gang, or something like that … Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in The Rip.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/PANow, there are three ways to take this. The first is: well, duh. If you’ve ever watched anything on Netflix, you’ll know that what Damon said is completely true. If the streaming era of film-making has a signature tell, it’s that things quite often have to be slowed down and explained to us over and over again like we’re a bunch of children.It isn’t a film, but the last season of Stranger Things was a perfect demonstration of that. In fact, I’m convinced that its episodes were so long because, before anything actually happened on the show, some characters had to slowly explain exactly what they were about to do. This arguably reached its nadir in a scene where someone literally used some props to carefully reiterate the plot so far, which is the storytelling equivalent of watching a pub bore demonstrate the offside rule with beermats.There are exceptions to the rule, of course – typically if Netflix thinks it’s got a sniff of an Oscar, maybe with aFrankensteinor aTrain Dreams, then directors are usually allowed to be as oblique as they want. But aside from that we should all sit down, shut up and wait to be spoonfed.The second takeaway is that maybe, just maybe, Netflix knows what it’s talking about. Obviously it’s very depressing to think that the owner-elect of Warner Bros thinks that anyone who watches anything is a distracted, attentionless idiot. Had this always been the case, then there is an enormous possibility that 2001: A Space Odyssey would have had a wacky sidekick who kept asking David Bowman what all the whizzy colours mean.View image in fullscreenPay attention … Matt Damon in The Odyssey.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyHowever, Netflix is also in possession of a colossal amount of granular viewing data. It knows what we watch, why we watch it and how long we watch it for. And this is plain, concrete data that doesn’t deign to flatter us with highbrow assumptions. It has looked into its crystal ball and seen that we’re all just a bunch of slack-jawed apes who watch things with one hand gripping our phones and the other shoved down the front of our trousers. In other words, if Netflix says that we need to have the plot explained to us over and over again, it’s because it has run the numbers and knows that we do.But obviously we shouldn’t ignore the third takeaway here, which is that Damon is a few months away from the biggest hit of his entire career. As the star of Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey, Damon knows that he’s about to feature in a huge, theatrical-first spectacular that will probably play with the concept of time and (whisper it) in all likelihood be quite hard to follow at times. And he knows that it’s going to make a billion dollars, which gives him quite a strong position to crap on Netflix.That said, if Netflix had made The Odyssey then Damon would have kept halting the action to explain why so many characters have such similar names. And it probably would have made two billion dollars, because this is what we deserve.Explore more on these topicsFilmMatt DamonNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, having blazed through Love Island and silenced her Strictly haters, the Welsh sensation is really hitting the big timeMon 19 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 19 Jan 2026 06.09 ESTShareAt the end of last year’s Strictly Come Dancing semi-final, pro dancerNikita Kuzminmade a tearful appeal to camera, “I speak to the audience at home: guys, just please, please be kind!” His celebrity partner, Love Island winner, Dancing on Ice contestant and musical theatre actor Amber Davies, had been getting a lot of flak online. “You have had so much hate, every single day,” said Kuzmin.Isn’t it crazy that we have to remind people to be nice to other humans who are just doing their job, I say to Davies, when we meet in a London hotel bar. “I genuinely think it’s getting worse,” says Davies, who has been in the public eye since 2017. “With TikTok, when people jump on a bandwagon, they go for it,” she adds. “But I feel like the nasty comments I was getting [on Strictly] weren’t actually coming from the younger audience, they came from the older audience.”If you’re confident, you’re seen as stuck up. Too sweet and you’re fakeDavies is of the “just ignore them” school of thought and she beams positivity with a bright, perfect smile. The 29-year-old from Denbigh, north Wales is both girl next door and glamazon. It’s Monday morning but she’s looking very Friday night: dolled up for a shoot, pristine makeup defining the pretty angles of her face, slicked-back hair, gold 1980s earrings. Davies is warm and open without giving everything away. She is steeped in the language of personal growth and being one’s best self, the kind of person who on her musical theatre podcast,Call to Stage, will share mottoes such as “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone”, and comes across as very sincere.View image in fullscreen‘Heartbroken it’s over’ … with Nikita Kuzmin on Strictly.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PAWe’re here to talk about her touring withLegally Blonde the Musical, but we can’t ignore the cultural juggernaut that is Strictly, in which she reached the final. Yes, being part of it is as good as everyone says it is: “Being in the Strictly bubble, it’s so magical. I’ll never experience anything like that again. I’m heartbroken it’s over.” No, she doesn’t think the format needs a shake-up, nor does she have any suggestions for new presenters. Her experience on set was never any less than supportive, but still it hurts when people are horrible to you online.A lot of it was people saying she shouldn’t be there because of her previous dance training (she was a last minute stand-in for an injured Dani Dyer), but fan fave Lewis Cope also had dance training and didn’t get the abuse. “Well, I’m a woman,” says Davies, adding, “I am ambitious. And [people think] confidence comes across as being stuck-up. But if you’re too sweet, you’re fake, so you can’t do anything right.” There was an article in one paper about her being a diva, and that bothered her more than online comments (“At the end of the day, not everyone’s going to like everyone”), because she felt a narrative was being built about her. “And I just want to say, none of this is true!”Davies has been here before. When she landed her first big stage job, post-Love Island, in the musical9 to 5(in the Jane Fonda role), people couldn’t wait to say that she was a talentless reality TV blow-in who hadn’t paid her dues. Except that Davies had been dancing and singing since she was tiny, putting on shows with her older sister Jade in the living room, which they’d charge their nana £1.50 to watch. At 13 she was coming to London for training, and moved there at 16 to study musical theatre at Urdang. She’s clearly a grafter.View image in fullscreen‘I did genuinely fall in love’ … with Kem Cetinayon Love Island.Photograph: ITV/REX/ShutterstockDavies had been scrambling about for work after graduating (cruise ship, backing singing) when the ITV dating showLove Islandapproached her, via Instagram. “I had the summer of my life,” she says, no regrets. Do people on that show really think they’re going to find love? “Yes,” she says straight away. “And I know my truth was that I did genuinely fall in love.” She split with boyfriend Kem Cetinay after five months (although she tells me she’s still in touch with his mum, which is totally on brand for the very wholesome, family-oriented Davies), and although she enjoyed the whirl of celeb parties, there was something missing: musical theatre.Since getting positive reviews in 9 to 5, Davies has also starred in Bring It On, Back to the Future, Pretty Woman, The Great Gatsby, and now Legally Blonde, playing Elle Woods, the Reese Witherspoon character from the 2001 film. “When I heard it was going back out on tour I had to audition for it. It was a no-brainer for me, a dream role,” she says. The story of a fashion-obsessed sorority girl who becomes a hotshot Harvard law student matches the film, although it’s set in the present day.There’s a cartoony element to Elle, with her everything-pink wardrobe and handbag-sized dog, but, says Davies, “When I went into the audition I played her very human, and the director Nikolai [Foster] wants to take it in that direction. You have to recreate it with your life experience.” After all, Davies knows a bit about being underestimated herself. “I feel like I was destined to play this role because I’ve had my own version of that. It’s literally going to be incredible,” she says, in a very Elle Woods way.View image in fullscreen‘Dream role’ … Reese Witherspoon and co-star in the 2001 film Legally Blonde.Photograph: Mgm/AllstarFans of the film will be pleased to hear that Elle’s famous “bend and snap” move survives in the choreography byLeah Hill, but Hill – recently assistant choreographer on the Wicked films – has ideas of her own. “She is so unique in the way that she thinks, she’s ahead of the game,” says Davies. “She doesn’t stick to one genre, one style – there’s one section where we go from hip-hop to ballet in one breath. She is one to watch.”Most of Davies’s roles have been in shows adapted from popular films – “Movie musicals are paying my mortgage!” – and she’s pragmatic about what that means for the theatre business. “This industry is extremely tough. It’s a lot easier to bring an audience in if they’re familiar with a story. It would be nice for there to be a space for brand new, original musicals, but I just think in this climate, we don’t see as much of a bite towards those.”With over a million Instagram followers, Davies must have similar appeal to casting directors, although she’s quick to say, “I’ve had to fight tooth and nail for roles … I don’t think I’ve ever been given a role I haven’t deserved.” She’s also quick to champion others, especially her sister Jade, who she’ll tell you is the most talented person she knows. Jade walked into a job on Les Misérables at 19 and has been working ever since, often as a swing, which means understudying multiple ensemble roles: “That’s 10 times more difficult than what I do.” It was Jade’s reputation, says Davies, that gave her legitimacy within the industry when some people thought she was just a reality TV wannabe.View image in fullscreen‘Musicals pay my mortgage’ … in The Great Gatsby at the London Coliseum.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDavies’s boyfriend,Ben Joyce, is in the biz too. They met on the Back to the Future musical (he was playing Marty, she was Lorraine, his mum). He’s an impressive singer, and to go by his appearances on Davies’s podcast, also an incredibly sweet, unassuming man, who always has her dinner on the table for her when she gets in from a hard day’s rehearsal. He’s not very … Love Island, I say. Davies laughs. “He’s so amazingly talented. He’s the kindest soul in every room he walks into. Kindness and talent, that’s the combination of dreams.”They’ve just bought a house together in London, where in the downstairs loo Davies hung a handwritten letter from Dolly Parton, who wrote the 9 to 5 show and was involved in the production. Parton always remembered everyone’s names and the conversations they’d had, Davies tells me. “She’s a very intelligent woman, very funny. Everybody thinks they know her, but I’d say she’s one of the most private women in the world.” A kind of privacy, perhaps, that rising stars just can’t have today when, thanks to social media, “everyone knows everything about everything”.Davies comes across as confident but she struggles with nerves. “I’m terrible, and it’s getting worse as I get older,” she says. “My nerves on Strictly were horrific – that was next level, like, numb hands.” She traces the fear back to singing at an Eisteddfod in Wales. “I was about 11 or 12 and I went wrong on national television. I completely stopped.” Nerves or not, there’s no stopping her now. “People say to me, ‘Oh, what do you want to do after musical theatre? I’m like, ‘I literally want to do this for the rest of my life,’” beams Davies. “I want to do eight shows a week for the rest of my life, and I’ll be happy.”Legally Blonde the Musical is on tour, opening at Curve, Leicester, 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDanceStrictly Come DancingMusicalsReality TVTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The prize is run in partnership with Hachette UK and LoveReading, and supported by organisations including the Frontline Club, New Writing North and The Reading Agency.David Roche, chairman of Libraro, said the prize was created to “put power in the hands of writers and readers”. It’s announced amid a broader boom in self-publishing, which in the last few years has seen several self-published authorsbreakthrough to huge mainstream success, including Colleen Hoover and Freida McFadden.The competition is open to anyone aged 18 or over, worldwide, regardless of previous publishing history or professional representation. Entrants will have the chance to receive constructive feedback from readers, while shortlisted authors will be given professional support to help them package and format their manuscripts before they are assessed by the judges.Maclaren said the prize reflected a shared belief that “readers shape culture”. She added: “Through this competition, readers are not just participating in a single prize, but are part of a wider publishing ecosystem,” helping to “expand the range and diversity of books that reach publication.”Entries open on 19 January and close on 15 February, with reader engagement running from 19 February to 20 March. The shortlist will be announced on 21 April, and the winner revealed on 13 May.Explore more on these topicsBooksAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

He’ll takeGreenlandfor minerals. He’s a criminal,” he said.Skarsgård hails from Sweden; Sentimental Value director Joachim Trier is Danish and Norwegian. Greenland is self-governed butDenmarkruns its defence and foreign policy.Writing on Truth Social, Trump called for the “complete and total purchase” of Greenland and threatened EU nations who deploy troops in opposition with financial tariffs.Björk, the Icelandic singer and – like Skarsgård – a veteran of Lars von Trier films, has also criticised the US president, as well as Denmark.“I wish all Greenlanders blessing in their fight for independence,” she wrote on social media. “Icelanders are extremely relieved that they managed to break from the Danish in 1944. We didn’t lose our language (my children would be speaking Danish now), and I burst with sympathy for Greenlanders.”She added: “Colonialism has repeatedly given me horror chills up my back, and the chance that my fellow Greenlanders might go from one cruel coloniser to another is too brutal to even imagine.”Skarsgård, who is still recovering from a stroke, plays an ailing film director in Joachim Trier’s film, and recentlyrevealedthat a plan was afoot to resurrect Meryl Streep’s character for a second Mamma Mia! sequel. “A lot of people are working on it,” he told People.Explore more on these topicsFilmStellan SkarsgårdDonald TrumpGreenlandBjörkDenmarknewsShareReuse this content"

If they want their films in cinemas, people have to feel comfortable about what they’re committing to.”View image in fullscreenClare Binns has led initiatives to embed cinemas in their communities.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianOver a four-decade career, Binns has built a reputation for championing diverse and independent film-making, working with directors including Danny Boyle, Steve McQueen, Charlotte Regan and Alice Winocour. She began as an usher at the Ritzy cinema in Brixton, south London, in 1981, later running Zoo Cinemas before joining Picturehouse in 2003.Like much of the sector, Picturehouse has endured a turbulent few years. Cinemas were badly hit by Covid closures and the slow return of audiences, pressures compounded by the 2023 Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes, which disrupted release schedules.This month, Leonardo DiCaprioquestioned whether audiences still had an “appetite”for cinema after his critically acclaimed film One Battle After Another failed to break even at the box office.Binns said cinemas were “in a much better place” than they were two years ago. “It’s been very tough for cinemas. During Covid, everybody got used to sitting on couches and watching streaming services. But that’s changing. We’re working with the streamers to bring people in.”She pointed to repertory programming as evidence of renewed interest. “We’re seeing young audiences coming in to watch Hitchcock and Agnès Varda on the big screen.”Concerns remain about industry consolidation, includingNetflix’s bid to buy Warner Bros Discovery. “Any studio transformation is unsettling,” Binns said. “But people have predicted the end of cinema many times – when television arrived, when we went digital. We’re still standing.”For cinemas to remain sustainable, she said, originality and commitment were crucial. “Anora, Hamnet, Marty Supreme were all original stories. And when film-makers engage properly, doing Q&As and working with cinemas, audiences respond.”Binns has also led initiatives embedding cinemas in their local communities, including partnerships with Brixton Soup Kitchen and Poetic Unity. She warned that theclosure of local cinemaswas “definitely something to worry about” and called for VAT reductions.View image in fullscreenBromley Picturehouse in London, which closed permanently in August 2024 amid rising costs.Photograph: Andrew Sparkes/Alamy“Local cinemas are fantastic resources. They get people out of their houses, they’re community hubs. If that disappears, it’s a tragedy,” she said.Binns will receive her Bafta at the film awards ceremony on 22 February. Calling the award an “incredible honour”, she said it recognised the cultural and commercial importance of cinemas. “I’m one of many of an army of people doing the best they can to get great films into cinemas and keep cinemas working.”Emily Stillman, the chair of the Bafta film committee, said: “Clare Binns’ impact on the British film industry is profound – she is a hugely talented and beloved visionary. [Her] unwavering commitment to bring a diverse range of storytelling to the big screen, her belief in the power of cinema and her ongoing work championing emerging independent film-makers is inspirational.”Explore more on these topicsFilmThe BrutalistKillers of the Flower MoonBaftasAwards and prizesFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He went on to co-direct The Lion King, a phenomenal success, yet it never went to his head … he carried a sense of wonder, generosity, and enthusiasm that lifted everyone around him.”Spirit of Walt but no Mickey Mouse in Disney’s planned desert communityRead moreDisney CEO Bob Iger remembered Allers as “a creative visionary whose many contributions to Disney will live on for generations to come”.“His work helped define an era of animation that continues to inspire audiences around the world, and we are deeply grateful for everything he gave to Disney. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and collaborators,” Iger wrote in a statement.Born in New York in 1949 but raised in Arizona, Allers became a fan of animation at the age of five after seeing Disney’s Peter Pan. He got his start at Disney on Tron (1982) as part of the storyboard team, then working as a storyboard artist on Oliver & Company (1988), The Little Mermaid (1989) and The Rescuers Down Under (1990) before becoming head of story on Beauty and the Beast (1991) and working on Aladdin (1992).In 1994, Allers and Rob Minkoff co-directed The Lion King, which became the highest-grossing film of 1994. It was temporarily the second-highest-grossing film of all time, behind Jurassic Park. The Lion King remains the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film of all time, as well as the bestselling film on home video, having sold more than 55m copies around the world.Allers and Minkoff won the Golden Globe for best motion picture musical or comedy for The Lion King, with Allers going on to write the 1998 Tony-winning Broadway adaptation of The Lion King with Irene Mecchi, which continues to be performed in theatres around the world.Allers also worked on Lilo & Stitch and the story of what would later become The Emperor’s New Groove while at Disney. He also co-directed Open Season, Sony Pictures Animation’s first feature film, with Jill Culton.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyThe Lion KingAnimation in filmnewsShareReuse this content"

This film-making family multitasks above and beyond, serving not just asco-directors, co-writers, producers and stars, but also operating the camera and making the costumes. The results are genuinely striking, professional and effective (especially in terms of scare-generation). And if the scripts are often a smidge pretentious, they are never less than interesting and always original.Their previous offerings includeHellbender, Halfway to Zen and Rumblestrips, tales that often revolve around families or familial units, although John Adams doesn’t always play the dad character and Poser isn’t always the mother. In their latest, Poser has cracked open the indigo pot and spun up some wool to make a witchy, cerulean outfit to play weird woman Solveig, a figure with strong maternal feelings, not least towards the many bluebottles that follow her everywhere; she isn’t, however, technically a mother to the protagonist, college student Mickey (Zelda Adams). The economical dialogue eventually reveals that Mickey survived cancer some years ago which resulted in a hysterectomy, but a new inoperable tumour the size of an apple (very biblical) has recently grown in her abdomen and she has maybe six months to live.Willing to try anything that might help, Mickey answers a mysterious summons to visit Solveig in a remote, dank forest house, accompanied by her widowed father, Jake (John Adams). The accommodation looks like an ornate Victorian house mated with a baobab tree, producing a structure made of mostly gnarled roots and limbs covered with moss. Jake isn’t thrilled with the foraged mushroom and leaf diet, or the lack of en suite bathrooms, but he is game for anything that might help his daughter. Mickey is more open to Solveig’s bizarre hospitality, pointedly antiquated circumlocution and tendency to microdose her guests with psychedelics. No doubt some viewers would rate this experience highly if it were offered on Airbnb.The film-makers build up a thick miasma of atmosphere over the first 45 minutes as the visuals switch between Mickey and Jake’s puzzled normie points of view and the more outlandish visions and memories connected to Solveig. The latter come drenched in fake blood, populated by rotting corpses with huge screaming mouths, and stillborn babies chucked unceremoniously into buckets while assorted supporting players – many of whom, if you check the credits, have the surname Adams, funnily enough – stand around looking solemn and menacing.The effect is unnerving and fecund with menace, but there are a few too many sequences padding out the action where we hear Solveig intoning what sounds like bad Emily Dickinson parodies – stuff like “The truth won’t hide in dreams/It lies still/Seen”, the rhythms sprung like a battered mattresses. Overall, this is better and glossier than some of the Adams-Poser posse’s earlier efforts, but perhaps not quite enough of an evolution to take their vision to the next level.Mother of Flies is on Shudder and AMC+ from 23 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The black-and-white cinematography lends a visual sumptuousness to the rituals of harvest: we see giant machines extracting cotton buds from open bolls, leaving behind a whirl of white fluffs fluttering in the air. The painful legacy of slavery in the country means that the choreography of farm work is rich with poetic and political meaning. Owning land is more than an economic matter; it also allows for autonomy of labour and preservation of heritage, to be passed on to future generations.Hardworking as the farmers are, however, systematic discrimination continues to hinder their financial security. While their white neighbours have easy access to federal support, Black farmers are faced with near-insurmountable red tape, resulting in much longer waiting times for funding. With the landslide effect of operational costs and taxes, many have had their land taken away from them. One particularly poignant sequence follows 89-year-old Carlie Williams, who has farmed since his teens, as he struggles to negotiate the price of prescription glasses. Most of the subjects in the documentary also hail from older generations; the implication is that, with all its precariousness, this line of work is no longer viable for younger people.Still, this documentary is far from an elegy. The resilient community fight back, as they march to Washington to protest against the inadequacies of the Biden administration. Echoing the cycle of crop cultivation, Shyne’s film inhabits the seasons of life, bookended by images of a funeral and the open sky. This vanishing way of life is imbued with a dose of melancholy, yet hope still remains for a better harvest in the future.Seeds is atBertha DocHouse, London, from 23 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsFarmingRacereviewsShareReuse this content"

That, and the amusing cameo at the end from Keith David as the Simulator, AKA God, who explains to the awestruck mortals that God is an entirely free creator, rather like a self-published novelist, then grows irritated when the mortals think that being self-published is lame: “It’s not my fault if you don’t understand the industry!”This is an exhausting indie romp on the subject of time travel, and sometimes plays like a funnier version ofShane Carruth’s time-travel classic Primer– well, slightly funnier. Samuel Dunning plays Tim Travers, a goateed scientist who has stolen nuclear materials from a terrorist group to power the time machine he has invented. He sends himself back one minute into the past with a gun to kill his younger self to investigate the time-traveller’s paradox: if he eliminates his one-minute younger self, then won’t he also disappear at that moment, popping like a soap bubble, because it means he can’t exist in the future? But given that he has to exist in the future to have set all this in motion, doesn’t it mean that this time-travelled self has to survive?Well, apparently it’s the latter, and Tim keeps going repeatedly back, creating many different selves who at one stage indulge in a bizarre off-camera orgy. A hitman, working for that furious terrorist group from which Tim stole, has the unhappy task of whacking all these space-time clones.This is a film that drones on and on, though it does have a nice walk-on from Danny Trejo and there’s the unintended side-effect of making you appreciateDouglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy which did all this and more with a much lighter touch.Tim Travers and the Time Traveler’s Paradox is on digital platforms from 26 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsComedy filmsDanny TrejoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fortunately, Joseph Phibbs’s cello concerto, written for Guy Johnston and here receiving its world premiere, brought its own musical cohesion, distinguishing itself in an otherwise uneven programme.Scrupulously crafted, its five contrasting movements basked in a warm tonality and boasted a multihued orchestration with rich, fluent string writing and imaginative effects in wind, brass and percussion. Emerging from gentle double bass pizzicatos and cushioned cellos, Johnston’s solo line, pensive and unshowy throughout, was neatly framed thanks to Clemens Schuldt’s mindful control over hisBBC Symphony Orchestraforces.The shimmering, shuddering Aubade, brimming with light and dancing counterpoint, gave way to the mournful Elegy, a long cello threnody stretched out over a pulsing orchestral heartbeat. An eerie Nocturne, tense and agitated, was haunted by the cries of night-birds and perhaps something more sinister, before the wistful Vocalise brought this attractive new concerto to a radiant conclusion.View image in fullscreenPensive … Guy Johnston performs Joseph Phibbs’s cello concerto.Photograph: Mark AllanElsewhere matters were less consistent. Tchaikovsky’s Hamlet, a prolix tone poem complete with stentorian ghost, Russian-accented Ophelia and a brusque military intervention, got a kick up the backside from Schuldt whose clipped, brittle reading was undoubtedly exciting, if low on warmth. At just five minutes, Mel Bonis’s Ophélie, one of the late-Romantic composer’s enthralling series of musical sketches of iconic women, proved that less is often more. Rippling harp, sweeping strings and melancholy oboe cocooned the hapless heroine as she drifted to her watery grave. The performance, though, was on the loud side.The German conductor was more in his element with the anonymously cobbled together suite from Richard Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier. His interpretation was idiomatic, with the waltz sequences nicely swung, but a tendency to micromanage robbed the music of some of its flow. No amount of arm waving could paper over the cracks in this Frankenstein’s monster of a score, however, as the music lurched from one bleeding chunk to another. Schuldt’s tendency to ramp up the volume only added to a sense of misguided bluster. A shame, as the orchestral playing, once again, was excellent.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanBBC Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

Before I sit down to a platter of oysters atLa Cabane des Bons Vivants, one of the village’s canal-side restaurants, I stand and watch orange flames bellow up from a tangle of long, skinny pine needles inside a large, open oven. They are piled on top of a board of carefully arranged mussels and, by setting fire to the pine needles, the shellfish cook in their own juices.This is the curious tradition ofmoules à l’éclade, a novel way of cooking mussels developed by Marennes-Oléron oyster farmers along the River Seudre in the Charente-Maritime, halfway down France’s west coast. The short-lived flaming spectacle is a prelude to sliding apart the charred shells and finding juicy orange molluscs inside – and just one highlight of our evening along La Grève. The avenue that cuts between the oyster beds, lined by colourful, ramshackle huts and rustic pontoons is an alluring venue for a sunset meal by the canal, the atmosphere all the more lively and fascinating for it being in a working oyster-farming village.View image in fullscreenI’m with my family here in the Charente-Maritime, just north of where the Gironde estuary meets the Atlantic and around an hour south of the region’s more famous resorts of Île de Ré and La Rochelle. Our five days here will show us how a holiday rolls with the same alluring vibe as those settings farther north, but costs less and has more to explore (our base is a comfortable villa in the village of Étaules), with towns such as Royan on the itinerary.The first stop for any self-catering stay in France, though, is the market. Royan’s is out of this world. Completed in 1956, the Marché Central de Royan has a decidedly futuristic vibe; inside, the 50-metre-span dome is lit by a space-age pattern of skylights, suggesting this flying saucer might take off at any moment.View image in fullscreenMoules a l’éclade: mussels cooked with pine needles over a firePhotograph: Hemis/AlamyIts offerings are equally impressive, and we stock up on cheeses, including a creamy Brillat-Savarin and a fruity Comté; charcuterie, including the local terrine,legrilloncharentais, and saucisson; a big blousy lettuce, crunchy cucumber and a perfumed melon. It takes some resistance to say “C’est tout,merci” when each stallholder says “Avecceci?” (What else would you like?) after each choice, and we come away laden with bags of fresh, local goodies.When it comes to beaches we’re spoiled for choice. The children have brought bodyboards, so we head for the Atlantic wavesA short walk from the market is another mid-century marvel, theÉglise Notre-Dame de Royan. Like the market hall and much of the local housing, it was built as the town recovered from Allied bombing towards the end of the second world war and is extraordinary – especially when you catch sight of its concrete belltower and sharp angular structure above the roof-lines. Inside, it is even more impressive and is said to have provided inspiration for the audience hall in Dragonstone in the TV series Game of Thrones.A triangular stained-glass window is framed by V-shaped pillars that tower above, punctuated by thin windows of white glass. We explore its balconies and hidden features between the concrete alcoves, before coming outside into the bright sunlight. The beach is a few steps away, but we resolve to return, when our gastronomic treasures aren’t wilting in the car.When it comes to beaches here, we’re spoiled by choice. The children have brought bodyboards, so we head to Plage Le Vieux Phare for action on the Atlantic waves. It’s overlooked by a cartoon-like red-and-white painted lighthouse, thePhare de la Coubre. A queue is snaking from its entrance and the views from the top are said to be wonderful, but we choose to enjoy it from the beach instead – what with it being 35C.View image in fullscreenA street in Mornac-sur-Seudre, a few miles north of Royan.Photograph: Helene Alexandre/AlamyWe hike across the soft sand to the life-guarded area a short distance from the ruined old stone lighthouse. Soon we’re jumping and riding the ferocious waves and the sight of the beach, east and west, disappears in a haze of sea spray.The beach we visit the next day is more sedate; a day trip to the Île d’Oléron takes us to Plage de Boyardville at the north of the island. Our drive takes us through pine forests and deep woods that expand across the island, which is twice the breadth of the Île de Ré. We park beneath towering pine trees and follow the path to the beach, a picnic of our market spoils in the cool bag. The boardwalk leads to a perfect crescent and a shallow lagoon in which children tumble and splash.Saint-Pierre-d’Oléron is reminiscent of the Île de Ré, only a little scruffier, which adds to its charmTo my left, the silhouette ofFort Boyardlooms on the horizon. The concept behind this architectural curiosity dates from the mid-17th century but it was finally completed amid tensions between the French and English in 1857. The fort was intended to guard the coast but soon became obsolete and was used as a prison. From the beach it looks quite small, but distances can be deceptive: it is in fact 68 metres long and could house 250 soldiers with 74 cannons. Recounting my hazy memories of the 1990s Fort Boyard TV game show – a kind of Crystal Maze at sea only with tigers and Dirty Den (Leslie Grantham) – warrants a raised eyebrow from my 12-year-old son.After indulging in ice-cream sundaes atLe Café de la Plage, we head into Saint-Pierre-d’Oléron, the island’s main town. It’s late afternoon on a Sunday, so few shops are open but there’s a four-piece jazz group playing on the main street, which brings an upbeat lilt to the sleepy town. With hollyhocks swaying in the breeze, white-washed, green and grey-shuttered houses, and long early evening shadows, it is reminiscent of the Île de Ré, only a little scruffier, which adds to its charm. We browse the shops that are open and wander back to the car, feeling sleepy and sun-kissed.View image in fullscreenOyster shacks in La Tremblade.Photograph: Willy Mobilo/AlamyAs we drive over the bridge back to the mainland, the tide has come in under it, and several aluminium oyster-catching boats are speeding by beneath.The village of Mornac-sur-Seudre to the south is also reminiscent of the Île de Ré, with its white-washed houses, creeping wisteria and bright pink oleander bushes. We go early evening for a sundowner, next to its own waterway and oyster beds, and see more moules à l’éclade going up in flames outside the seafood restaurantLe Parc des Graves. We window-shop the gift shops and galleries, annoyed we didn’t get there earlier.La Tremblade is our favourite though, and so we return to La Grève for a final meal atLa Cabane de la Grand-Mère, which does its mussels differently –moules à la brasero. The recipe, borrowed from oyster-farming communities near the Mediterranean, sees them marinated with herbs, onions, white wine and olive oil and then cooked on a griddle over a fire. After swigging back a platter of briny oysters, we tuck into the steaming pots of mussels and agree these are the best we’ve ever eaten. I ask the owner how they are cooked and she tells me the recipe. “All the very best flavours!” she laughs. When I say how they’re even better than moules à l’éclade, she smiles and says: “Ah but, with the éclade, it’s a much bigger spectacle! The flames are amazing!” I can’t disagree.Transport from Portsmouth to Caen was provided byBrittany Ferries; return crossingfrom£224for a car and a family of four.

The cherry tomatoes provide a welcome fresh note, but otherwise it’s a happy cupboard raid.An old Nigel Slater recipefirst put me on to the idea of using yoghurt to finish a pasta dish, and it works brilliantly here to balance the harissa.

Add the chickpeas and harissa, and cook for a further three to four minutes, by which time the pasta should be ready.Drain the orzo, reserving a mugful of its cooking water. Tip the pasta in with the tomatoes, chickpeas and harissa, add the lemon juice, and mix well; if need be, add a splash or two of the reserved water to help the sauce emulsify.

I’ve always been drawn to dishes that celebrate simple, honest ingredients and local tradition, and these two recipes are inspired by that spirit, and by a childhood spent doing lots of fishing in Wales. The seafood cawl is a lighter, coastal take on the Welsh classic, while the rarebit is rich and nostalgic. Both are designed to be cooked slowly and shared generously, and an ode to home kitchens, good produce and quiet moments around the table.Cawl of the sea (smoked haddock, leeks and barley – pictured top)This is a fishy twist on the national dish of Wales, a hearty stew that’s traditionally made with meat and root vegetables.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes42 tbsp butter2 leeks, trimmed, finely sliced, washed and drained2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped1 celery stick, trimmed and finely dicedSea salt and black pepper150g pearl barley150ml dry cider1 litre fish stock, or vegetable stock400g undyed smoked haddock fillet100ml double cream1 tbsp wholegrain mustard1 tbsp chopped dill1 tbsp dill oil(optional, to serve; to make it, simply blitz 20g dill in 20g sunflower oil, leave to infuse, then fine-strain through muslin and store in a clean jar in the fridge for up to two months)Lemon wedges, to serveMelt the butter in a heavy-based pan on a medium heat, add the leeks, garlic, celery and a pinch of salt, and saute gently, stirring, for eight to 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Stir in the pearl barley, toast for a minute, then add the cider, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and leave to cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 30-35 minutes, until the barley is tender.Lay the haddock on top of the barley, cover the pan with a lid and leave the fish to poach gently in the steam for six to eight minutes, until it flakes easily. Lift out the fish, flake into large chunks, then fold these through the barley with the cream, mustard and chopped dill. Season generously, taste and adjust as needed.Ladle into warmed bowls, drizzle with a little dill oil, if using, and serve with lemon wedges for a touch of brightness.Black Bomber rarebit with onion marmaladeView image in fullscreenLuke Selby’s Black Bomber rarebit with onion marmalade.There are few more satisfying hot snacks or light lunches than Welsh rarebit, so it pays to give the classic some proper attention.Prep10 minCook45 minServes41 tbsp butter1 large onion, peeled and finely slicedSea salt and pepper1 tsp brown sugar1 tsp cider vinegar1 tsp Worcestershire sauce1 tsp English mustard100ml dark ale– I useMagic Dragon’s Border bitter200gSnowdonia Black Bomber cheddar, or other mature cheddar, grated1 egg yolk4 thick slices strong ale bread(about 250g), or sourdoughFirst make the onion marmalade. Melt the butter in a small pan over a low heat, then add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt, and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 25-30 minutes, until soft and golden. Stir in the sugar and vinegar, cook for another five minutes, until sticky, then take off the heat.While the marmalade is cooking, make the rarebit mixture. Put the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, ale and a pinch of pepper in a small pan, warm gently, stirring to combine, then gradually whisk in the cheese until it’s melted and the sauce is smooth. Take off the heat, stir in the egg yolk until well combined, then leave to cool slightly – as it cools, the rarebit mixture should thicken to a spreadable paste.Toast the bread lightly on both sides under a hot grill. Spread a spoonful of the onion marmalade over one side of each slice, then top generously with the rarebit mixture. Return the bread rarebit side up to the hot grill for two or three minutes, until the rarebit is bubbling and golden, then serve immediately with an extra spoon of marmalade on the side and a pint of ale, if you fancy it.Luke Selby is chef/partner ofPalé Hallin Llandderfel, Gwynedd, north WalesExplore more on these topicsFoodBritish food and drinkStarterSoupSeafoodWinter food and drinkSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"
