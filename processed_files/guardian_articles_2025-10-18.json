He can still live in Royal Lodge, but it’s a terrible blow to his sense of entitlementSat 18 Oct 2025 07.31 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 10.04 EDTShareThe saga of Andrew Windsor, the ex-Duke, who henceforth will be known as only plain old Prince,may have finally reached its end. At least the rest of the royal family will hope so. But even that is likely to depend on what may further emerge from any more releases of Epstein files, letters, records and emails in the US. His image, such as it remains, may yet be tarnished further.It is the loss of titles that will certainly hurt him most. Andrew has not formally lost them – removal of his dukedom requires an act of parliament, which neither government nor Buckingham Palace will want, taking up as it would embarrassingly public lengths of time – and he can’t shed his princely tag since he indubitably is the son of a monarch.But he won’t be able to use them publicly or privately and that will be a terrible blow to his sense of entitlement and status. As one of his former dates told Andrew Lownie for his recent bookEntitled, he always introduced himself to her friends as the Duke of York, saying: “It struck me how impressed he was with who he is, or how impressed he wanted others to be. Every joke always ended with: ‘because I’m the Duke of York’. He tells the most pathetic jokes. He finds poo cushions funny.”Friday night’s statementrepresented the last shred of dignity in that he was allowed to pretend that he was relinquishing the use of his titles and the knighthood of the garter voluntarily, out of a belated sense of duty. He wasn’t. After at least 10 years of private wrangling among the family and personal anguish on the part of the king about what to do about the Andrew problem, and with his mother no longer around to protect him and pay his debts, there was no alternative but to cut him loose. Evidently Prince William was prepared to be more ruthless than his father. In the end it was the Windsors’ genteel version of the revolver in the locked room with a bottle of whisky.He still has theRoyal Lodge, where he lives with his ex-wife,Sarah Ferguson, (what does he need a place that big for? It’s not as if he has that many friends) and apparently spends his days watching golf on the television and taking solitary rides in Windsor Great Park.While the family firm can’t stop him going to church – as he did in attending Westminster Cathedral a few weeks agofor the funeral of the Duchess of Kent, when William ostentatiously ignored him – he won’t be accompanying the rest of the family to church at Sandringham on Christmas morning. Instead, it will be a lonely lunch at home with plain Ms Sarah Ferguson and their daughters (who retain their princess titles) and their families. The paper hats will be the nearest the eighth in line will ever come to a crown now. He will have to watch the next coronation on television as well, if he lives that long.What will he do for money? No longer a working royal, he hasn’t qualified for public funds for the last six years. There are residual savings from the sale of various properties, he still has a navy pension and presumably there will have to be private subventions from the king. Famously profligate, he and his ex-wife lacked the means to keep up with the Arab and American billionaires with whom they liked to mingle. This must have been one of the reasons he was attracted to Epstein, though the sex – which he still denies – was probably another. What he offered them pathetically in return was status and access to flummery and palaces.Now he does not even have that, locked as he is, like Mr Rochester’s first wife in the attic, in his case the 30-room Royal Lodge: nowhere to go, no one willing to see him. Poor Virginia Giuffre, whose own memoirs come out next weekafter their serialisation in the Guardian, has been denied the satisfaction of finally bringing down a prince while alive.He was an idiot, and worse: a powerful man who brought pain to others: a dark stain tarnishing the family escutcheon and rocking the institution itself.Stephen Bates is a former royal correspondent of the GuardianExplore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchyJeffrey EpsteincommentShareReuse this content"

You’re trying to get information out and trying to have people understand what’s safe and what’s not safe.”The company switched to Proton email and Signal while its email was compromised, Brown says. He was taking calls from companies and government agencies across the globe, including the US army and the Covid vaccine program Operation Warp Speed.“You get the world wanting verbal communication not written communication. And that is a kind of an important lesson: you can write things down, but they want to talk to the [chief information security officer],” says Brown, who spoke at Melbourne’s CyberCon on Friday.“They want to be able to hear colour around the outside of it, so very important to be prepared for that kind of response.”How the cyber-attack unfoldedThe notification about the hack came in a phone call from Kevin Mandia, the founder of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, to SolarWinds’ then CEO Kevin Thompson.Mandia told Thompson that SolarWinds had “shipped tainted code” to its Orion software, which helps organisations monitor outages on their computer networks and servers.The exploit in Orion was being used to attack government agencies, Mandia told Thompson.“We could see in that code [it] was not ours, so when we got that, it was ‘all right, this is real’,” Brown recalls.View image in fullscreenBrown says SolarWinds was not the key target of the hack but ‘a route to the target’.Photograph: Sean Davey/The GuardianThe Texas-based SolarWinds determined that 18,000 people had downloaded the tainted product, which the hackers, later attributed to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, were able to insert into Orion in the build environment where source code is turned into software.The news broke on the Sunday. SolarWinds notified the stock market before it opened on Monday.The original estimate that up to 18,000 clients could be affected was later revised down to about 100 government agencies and companies that actually were.“It would have been nice to know that on day one, but that was the truth of the matter, right?” Brown says. “We weren’t really the target. We were just a route to the target.”SolarWinds called in CrowdStrike, KPMG and the law firm DLA Piper to deal with the response and investigation.Aftermath: the heart attackSolarWinds stopped work on new features for the next six months and its team of 400 engineers focused on systems and security to get the company back on its feet.“We really took transparency to heart – how can we make sure people realise [what] threat actor models [are out there], what they do, how they do reconnaissance, how they then do an attack [and] how they then leave.”Brown says the company’s customer renewal rate fell into the 80% range in the first few months after the incident, but has since returned to more than 98%.But then came the legal implications.The Biden administration imposed sanctions andexpelled Russian diplomats in 2021, partly in response to the attack.SolarWinds settled a class action lawsuit over the attack in 2022 for US$26m. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC) then filed a lawsuit against SolarWinds and Brown personally in October 2023, accusing the company and Brown of misleading investors over its claims about cybersecurity protections, and failing to disclose known vulnerabilities.View image in fullscreenBrown has remained at SolarWinds since the cyber-attack.Photograph: Sean Davey/The GuardianBrown was in Zurich when he found out he was being charged.“When I walked up a hill, I would lose my breath. My arms would get heavy, my chest would get tight. I was just not getting enough oxygen,” he says. “I did a silly thing. I flew home … I couldn’t walk from the terminal to my car without stopping. That’s a walk I had done thousand of times.”He was having a heart attack. When he got home, his wife took him to the hospital, where he underwent surgery. He has since recovered.“Stress keeps building up and I thought I was managing it well and I didn’t proactively go to a doctor,” he says.Brown says he now advocates for companies going through similar incidents to employ psychiatrists to help staff process the stress.Cyber-attacks rise by 50% in past year, UK security agency saysRead more“The stress level was pumped up, and then it just went over the edge, but stress was building up all the time.”A confidential jointly proposed settlement with the SEC was announced in July, but has yet to be approved. The US government shutdown has delayed the finalisation of the agreement.Brown has remained with SolarWinds throughout the process.“It happened on my watch, that’s how I look at it. There are reasons why it occurred, nation state attack, et cetera, but still it happened on my watch,” he says.“I guess I’m stubborn. But it was just very important for us to get through this whole cycle, so leaving wasn’t an option until it was done.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeRussiaInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Super Dom! At a time of heightened worries about national security, who better thanDominic Cummingsto shine a light on the murky world of spying?The man who turned a drive to Barnard Castle into an advert for SpecSavers. The man who gave us Brexit. Which one of us didn’t vote for a 4% hit to GDP? The man who gave usBoris Johnson. Truly, Dom has enriched us all over the past 10 years.Here’s what Dom knows about Dom. Not to put too fine a point on it, Dom knows that Dom is a genius. The cleverest man in every room in which he finds himself. Though some might argue he should try finding some other rooms. He is the master of the double-double bluff. The man with the infallible strategy for winning at Traitors. Come the evening’s roundtable, vote for yourself to be banished. That’s the last thing anyone would expect a Traitor to do. Eat your hearts out Jonathan Ross and Alan Carr. Mere amateurs.So when Dom speaks, it falls on all of us to listen. Even if he has yet to take personal responsibility for anything he has done. And after giving an interview to the Times on all things Chinese early in the week, Cummings has followed this up by appearing on Robert Peston’s Talking Politics podcast. Here he goes into greater detail of lapses in national security.You can’t help but appreciate the irony in this. Because during the Brexit years and his time as chief aide to Boris, there was no one more leaky than Dom. At times he would virtually simulcast private meetings in real time to his trusted sources. Almost as if he was dictating the news agenda for the coming week. Still, you can’t argue that he doesn’t know whereof he speaks, I suppose. And better that one sinner repenteth, and all that.We begin in a bunker deep below Downing Street early in 2020. Dom is sprawled in a chair wearing his filthy trackie bottoms while Boris is on to his fourth cheese sandwich of the morning. An ashen faced cabinet secretary walks in with some terrifying news. He has just discovered that the networks used by the British security services to send top secret information around the world have, for the past few years, been operated by the Chinese-owned Global Switch. Every piece of intelligence we have sent is potentially compromised.Dom admits to being flabbergasted. Boris is so astonished he helps himself to yet another cheese sandwich and decides to do … absolutely nothing. For Dom this isn’t just another sign of Johnson’s inherent laziness. It’s a sign that Johnson and the whole of government have become unwitting spies for the Chinese. As must be Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer. They are all hopelessly compromised. Because they have done nothing to change the system by which intelligence is transmitted.At this point, you can’t help but wonder why Dom decided to keep all this to himself for the last five years. He has been privy to information he believes affects national security but has chosen to allow the Chinese to potentially gobble up all our secrets. We have been compromised for years but Dom kept stumm. Had it slipped his mind? Perhaps it’s a double-double-double bluff and Dom has also been working for the Chinese all along. Having spent years leaking secrets, he chose to keep to himself the one thing that could have protected the country. For the first time in his life, he could have done us all a favour. But no. I guess he’s too much of a genius for that.Or could it be that this was all a fever dream? Dom has seldom passed up an opportunity to put himself centre stage of a conspiracy theory of his own making. Let’s think this through. It took MI5 and MI6 several years to realise that Global Switch was owned by the Chinese. Hmm. I’m not sure it would have taken the intelligence services that long to discover information that was readily available to everyone. Perhaps they had decided it was a risk worth taking. After all it wasn’t as if our embassies were talking to one another on open networks. Everything they were sending was encrypted. Just because the Chinese potentially had access to our messages it didn’t follow they could decipher them.Next we were deep into another bunker. The one due to be built under the Chinese mega-embassy. A bunker so deep it could interfere with the London tube network. Dom wanted us to know that the Chinese were planning to spy on us even more than they already were. He said this as if it were in some way surprising rather than a statement of the obvious. We’ve known that for years. And we are also spying on them. It’s what countries that don’t fully trust one another do. Come to think of it we are probably also keeping tabs on the French and the Americans.Last, Dom had some unique insights into the recently collapsed Chinese spy trial. Dom is of the view that the prime minister regularly nobbles the director of public prosecutions and the only trials that go ahead are the ones the government has okayed. So for this case to have been dropped was a sure sign of interference. Dom personally knew everyone involved and Starmer was definitely aChinastooge. Just like every other prime minister before him. The UK was basically an overseas province of Beijing.Spare a thought for Keir at this point. Only on Thursday, he was accused of being a China stooge by Tory MPs because he had failed to nobble the DPP. He can’t win. Yet another double-double-double-double bluff. One that only Dom has the genius to see. It was time for him to slip back into the shadows. One day he would rise again. To be a light in an increasingly murky world.

Suffering with a sore throat? From chicken bhuna to fire honey, this food should get you back on your feetLaura PotterSat 18 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 13.46 EDTShareWhen you have ...a hacking coughHydrate with teasForDr Ricardo José, consultant in respiratory medicine, hydration is key: “It’s about taking frequent sips throughout the day to keep the mucous membranes moist.” ImmunologistDr Jenna Macciochiagrees, saying: “I often stir a spoonful of raw honey – nature’s soothing antimicrobial – into a cup of thyme tea (thyme steeped in water), which helps ease irritation and supports respiratory health. I also love marshmallow root tea, which is great for the mucous membranes.”Try the carrot trick!Tailor your food-based remedy to the type of cough you have. “For a dry, tickly cough, honey in warm tea – lemon or peppermint – is very soothing,” says José. “Another remedy I’ve always liked is shredding carrots, covering them with sugar and leaving them overnight in the fridge. By morning they release a sweet syrup; a spoonful coats the throat and helps calm down an irritating cough.” For a chesty cough, “warm liquorice root tea and foods with bromelain such as fresh pineapple may help reduce mucus thickness”.Get the juices flowingEmeritusprof Ron Eccles,former director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University, goes for warm foods. “Anything tasty such as tomato soup, chicken soup or a curry – I like chicken tikka bhuna – promotes salivation and mucus secretions in the airway and helps to soothe a cough. You could also suck a lozenge as this has a similar demulcent [irritation-relieving] effect and makes you swallow, which inhibits the cough reflex.” Macciochi takes a similar approach. She says: “I lean on warm broths with garlic, ginger and shiitake mushrooms, which are rich in immune-supportive compounds and easy to digest.”When you have ...a stinking coldTurn to turmericAsma Khan, chef and owner ofDarjeeling Express in London, says: “My mother gave me haldi doodh, or turmeric milk, as a child and it’s still my go-to. The curcumin in turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory, and when you combine it with the fats in warm milk, it becomes much more bioavailable [easily absorbed]. It’s not some trendy wellness drink to me – it’s what my family has used for generations to soothe a sore chest and ease the body back into balance. Bring a mug of full‑fat milk to the boil, let it cool slightly, then stir in one teaspoon of ground turmeric. Drink warm before bed.”Whip up brothSpecialist dietitianSophie Medlinfocuses on “soft, nourishing foods. Soups are great; ideally a blend of different vegetables cooked in bone broth for protein and nutrients. We also want some additional protein, so some shredded roasted chicken or tofu.” José tucks in to a bowl ofcanja,“a traditional Portuguese soup that my family always made when someone was sick. It’s prepared with chicken, rice and a light golden broth, garlic and finished with fresh mint. The chicken provides protein for repair, the rice is gentle on the stomach and provides energy from carbohydrates, the broth is hydrating, the garlic antibacterial, and the mint acts as a natural decongestant.”Thomasina Miers, co-founder ofWahacaand author ofMexican Table(Quadrille, £28) also loves broth. “I findAsian brothparticularly soothing, with its garlic and ginger and a few grains of rice. I often go to the butcher’s purely to buy bones for stock and will roast the bones while using the oven for something else. We have a roast chicken once a fortnight, so I rescue bones from everyone’s plates for the stockpot. The flavour and goodness is transformative.”Not a broth fan? “I crave warming, easy-to-digest meals such as soups with orange veggies like pumpkin, rich in beta-carotene, a form of vitamin A, which supports immune function, and spices such as turmeric to regulate inflammation,” Macciochi says.Sip soothing teasJosé drinks plenty of water and “warm tea with strips of lemon peel, turmeric and manuka honey before bed. The lemon helps relieve congestion and adds a little vitamin C, turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties, and honey soothes the throat while offering antiviral and antibacterial effects, particularly manuka honey.” Macciochi says she prioritises hydration, vitamin C and zinc-rich foods to support her immune system. “I’ll often make a citrus and ginger shot with lemon, orange, grated ginger, and a pinch of cayenne and black pepper.”When you have ...a nasty sore throatCold comfortFor Medlin, “smoothies can feel soothing. I would use frozen mixed berries and kefir for bonus gut health benefits.”Eccles recommends “ice‑cream or an ice lolly to soothe the pain and irritation of a sore throat”. José agrees that “soft ice-cream can numb the throat and give some relief”, while dietitianPriya Tewlikes “plain Greek yoghurt, as it can be cooling and soothing”.Raid the tea (and booze) cupboardWarm drinks also get lots of votes. Medlin is “a fan of hot honey and lemon as the honey can have antiseptic qualities and lemons have vitamin C, which can help to shorten the duration of a virus”.Macciochi likes “awarm herbal tea with marshmallow root, honey and slippery elm, which helps coat the throat”.Meanwhile, Miers says: “Hot toddies are our mainstay for a sore throat – with honey and lemon for the children and glugs of whisky for us.”Stick to softJosé focuses on textures that heal. “When my throat hurts, I stick to soft foods such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and smoothies, as they go down easily without scratching or irritating the tissue.”Sip on spicesKhan, on the other hand, rustles up a strong masala chai with fresh ginger and crushed black pepper. “The warmth of the tea soothes the throat, but the ginger and pepper do the real work – increasing circulation, clearing the sinuses and helping fight off infection. In a pestle and mortar, grind four or five cardamom pods, three or four cloves and a quarter of a teaspoon of black peppercorns. Add to a pan with a grating of fresh ginger (to taste), one mug of full-fat milk and half a mug of water. Add two teaspoons of loose black tea. Bring just to the boil, then strain and drink hot.”When you have ...a bout of fluFocus on fluidsEccles says it can be difficult to eat anything at first. “During flu I often have little appetite and lack energy, so I have energy drinks, coffee and tea to pick me up and get going.” Macciochi sips “coconut water or an electrolyte-rich herbal tea for hydration”, followed by “clear bone broth or veggie broth with garlic, miso and greens, when I can tolerate them”. José goes back to his staple, canja, “along with warm lemon tea with manuka honey”. He  reiterates that “hydration is absolutely essential”.A bowl of comfort“Flu knocks you out,” says Khan, “so I always want khichdi, the ultimate comfort food. It’s gentle, nourishing and easy to digest. Made with rice, moong dal [mung beans], a little turmeric and a touch of ghee, it gives your body the fuel it needs without overwhelming the system. It’s soft, warm and full of love. Wash half a cup of rice and half a cup of moong dal. In a heavy pan, combine with four cups of water, half a teaspoon of turmeric and a pinch of salt. Simmer until the grains soften and break down to a porridge-like consistency. In a small pan, heat one teaspoon of ghee, and add half a teaspoon cumin seeds and a little grated ginger. Stir into the khichdi and serve warm.”Strength-building suppersOnce you’re ready to eat, it’s time to get your strength back. Medlin knocks up “a pasta bake with plenty of veg and some protein such as chicken or cheese, which means you have something to reheat easily when you start to have an appetite again. The more veg, the better, as different vegetables have different benefits in terms of vitamins and antioxidants.” For Eccles, it’s all about “foods to build me up, such as porridge and tasty meat stews with lamb or beef, and plenty of vegetables such as carrots, onions or potatoes”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Then I build it up slowly, eating drier, plainer foods such as crackers.” She adds that it’s worth avoiding dairy for a few days, “as it can make you feel more nauseous and sometimes the body can struggle more with it after a bug”.Brews to sootheSimilarly, Macciochi stops eating and focuses on fluids at first, “cooled ginger tea or plain water with a pinch of sea salt and a splash of apple cider vinegar”. Dr Emily Leeming, a scientist, dietitian and author ofGenius Gut(Penguin, £18.99) agrees that “staying hydrated is important, so I’ll sip water or herbal teas. If I’m feeling nauseous, ginger tea can help to settle the stomach.” While for Khan, “the only thing I trust is ajwain [carom seed] tea, or sometimes saunf [fennel seed] tea. Both seeds are used in Ayurveda [an Indian holistic system of medicine] for digestion. For either tea, boil a teaspoon of the seeds in one and a half cups of water for five minutes, strain and sip slowly while still warm.”Nibble cautiouslyOnce over the worst, Leeming says: “I tend to focus on eating very plain foods such as toast, rice or bananas, a little but often. They’re gentle on the gut, give some energy without being too heavy and provide some nutrition to help support your body on the mend.” Medlin also keeps it bland with “toast, oatcakes, rice cakes and fruit purees – any fruit will do”. For Khan, “once things settle a bit, I eat some plain rice with yoghurt, but no spices. It’s about letting the healing happen gently.”Restore your microbiome“Once I’m up and about again, over the course of a day or so, I start adding back in foods for my gut microbiome,” says Leeming. “Live yoghurt or kefir and fibre-rich foods such as oats and stewed apples can be a gentle start, working up to adding in a range of different-coloured fruit and veg, whole grains and a handful of nuts and seeds.” Medlin also aims to recover gut health by “getting plenty of plants back into my diet; soups and smoothies can feel like an easier way to do this”.When you have ...a splitting headacheMagnesium-rich morsels“Cluster-headache patients are typically unable to eat during an attack – it would be akin to asking what I’d like to eat when a hot steel rod is being driven into my eyeball,” says Tom Zeller Jr, author ofThe Headache(Mariner, £22). “That said, during a period when the attacks are coming, but between individual headaches, I gravitate toward green vegetables – particularly spinach – peanuts, bran cereals and other foods rich in magnesium, which someevidencesuggests might be helpful in reducing attacks. That’s not to suggest supplementation with magnesium is a cure, but any potential port in a storm, as they say.”When you have ... general lurgyPut fire in your bellyWhen feeling generally run down, chefAnna Jones’s cure-all “fire honey” comes into its own. “It’s pleasing, bright-orange sunshine in a jar,” she says. “Peel the zest of a lemon and an orange, finely chop a red chilli and 50g ginger, add the lot to half a pot of good-quality, runny honey. Grate 30g of fresh turmeric into the honey (or a tablespoon of ground turmeric) and mix. It can sit in your fridge for up to two weeks and see you through the whole winter.” When you need a boost, “pop a tablespoon in a mug and top it up with hot water. You could add an extra slice of lemon or orange, too.”Spice up your lifeMiers keeps a spicy remedy on hand all winter. “I make a fire cider and put it in the fridge,” she says. “It’s a simple ferment I learned about in Mexico, which helps gut health and is deliciously thirst-quenching. Essentially, you flavour vinegar with ginger, chilli and your favourite seasonings – I love rosemary and star anise – then sweeten with honey or agave, and add sparkling water. For one 400ml jar, finely slice two jalapeño chillies, a thumb-sized piece of ginger and another of fresh turmeric (optional). Place in a sterilised jar with two rosemary sprigs, a cinnamon stick, two tablespoons of honey, the zest and juice of an orange, and 350ml of apple cider vinegar. Leave in the fridge for at least a week – the health benefits peak after three weeks – and the vinegar will last for six months in the fridge.”And once you’re feeling better ...Once on the road to recovery, Macciochi focuses on “rebuilding strength and supporting my gut – think slow-cooked stews, fermented foods such as sauerkraut or kefir, and plenty of colourful plants”. José takes a similar approach. “I return to a balanced diet with a good amount of protein (for example, eggs) to support healing. If antibiotics are needed, I bring in probiotic foods such as natural yoghurt or kefir to help restore gut balance.” Tew, meanwhile, picks soups. “I make a vegetable and lentil soup, but if you’ve had the flu you aren’t likely to have the energy to make soup, so a shop‑bought one would be fine,” she says.When you have ...a stinking hangoverJuice, water- then a fridge raid!When the malady is more self-induced, Miers first loads up on vitamin-rich liquids. “Celery, parsley and apple is the green juice of choice in Mexico, and it always makes me feel better. They add cactus and pineapple – local ingredients over there – but I sub in ginger for some fire and oomph. Then it’s lots of water, a good strong coffee and, when I can face it, grilled sourdough with a fried egg, crispy chickpeas, a few leaves, a grating of good cheese, and chilli oil normally does the trick – and whatever other delicious things I have in the fridge.”Explore more on these topicsFoodHealth & wellbeingHealthVegetablesSoupChickenCurryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Glass cabinets display prototypes of weird and wonderful creations, from tiny desktop robots to a surrealist sculpture created by an AI model prompted to design a tea set made from body parts. In the lobby, an AI waste-sorting assistant named Oscar can tell you where to put your used coffee cup. Five floors up, research scientist Nataliya Kosmyna has been working on wearable brain-computer interfaces she hopes will one day enable people who cannot speak, due to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, to communicate using their minds.Kosmyna spends a lot of her time reading and analysing people’s brain states. Another project she is working on is a wearable device – one prototype looks like a pair of glasses – that can tell when someone is getting confused or losing focus. Around two years ago, she began receiving out-of-the blue emails from strangers who reported that they had started using large language models such as ChatGPT and felt their brain had changed as a result. Their memories didn’t seem as good – was that even possible, they asked her? Kosmyna herself had been struck by how quickly people had already begun to rely on generative AI. She noticed colleagues using ChatGPT at work, and the applications she received from researchers hoping to join her team started to look different. Their emails were longer and more formal and, sometimes, when she interviewed candidates on Zoom, she noticed they kept pausing before responding and looking off to the side – were they getting AI to help them, she wondered, shocked. And if they were using AI, how much did they even understand of the answers they were giving?With some MIT colleagues, Kosmyna set up an experiment that used an electroencephalogram to monitor people’s brain activity while they wrote essays, either with no digital assistance, or with the help of an internet search engine, or ChatGPT. She found that the more external help participants had, the lower their level of brain connectivity, so those who used ChatGPT to write showed significantly less activity in the brain networks associated with cognitive processing, attention and creativity.In other words, whatever the people using ChatGPT felt was going on inside their brains, the scans showed there wasn’t much happening up there.The study’s participants, who were all enrolled at MIT or nearby universities, were asked, right after they had handed in their work, if they could recall what they had written. “Barely anyone in the ChatGPT group could give a quote,” Kosmyna says. “That was concerning, because you just wrote it and you do not remember anything.”Kosmyna is 35, trendily dressed in a blue shirt dress and a big, multicoloured necklace, and she speaks faster than most people can think. As she observes, writing an essay requires skills that are important in our wider lives: the ability to synthesise information, consider competing perspectives and construct an argument. You use these skills in everyday conversations. “How are you going to deal with that? Are you going to be, like, ‘Err … can I just check my phone?’” she says.The experiment was small (54 participants) and has not yet been peer reviewed. In June, however, Kosmyna posted it online, thinking other researchers might find it interesting, and then she went about her day, unaware that she had just created an international media frenzy.Alongside the journalist requests, she received more than 4,000 emails from around the world, many from stressed-out teachers who feel their students aren’t learning properly because they are using ChatGPT to do their homework. They worry AI is creating a generation who can produce passable work but don’t have any usable knowledge or understanding of the material.The fundamental issue, Kosmyna says, is that as soon as a technology becomes available that makes our lives easier, we’re evolutionarily primed to use it. “Our brains love shortcuts, it’s in our nature. But your brain needs friction to learn. It needs to have a challenge.”If brains need friction but also instinctively avoid it, it’s interesting that the promise of technology has been to create a “frictionless” user experience, to ensure that, provided we slide from app to app or screen to screen, we will meet no resistance. The frictionless user experience is why we unthinkingly offload ever more information and work to our digital devices; it’s why internet rabbit holes are so easy to fall down and so hard to climb out of; it’s why generative AI has already integrated itself so completely into most people’s lives.We know, from our collective experience, that once you become accustomed to the hyperefficient cybersphere, the friction-filled real world feels harder to deal with. So you avoid phone calls, use self-checkouts, order everything from an app; you reach for your phone to do the maths sum you could do in your head, to check a fact before you have to dredge it up from memory, to input your destination on Google maps and travel from A to B on autopilot. Maybe youstop reading booksbecause maintaining that kind of focus feels like friction; maybe you dream of owning a self-driving car. Is this the dawn of what the writer and education expert Daisy Christodoulou calls a “stupidogenic society”, a parallel to anobesogenic society, in which it is easy to become stupid because machines can think for you?AI companies are determined to push their products on to the public before we fully understand the psychological and cognitive costsHuman intelligence is too broad and varied to be reduced to words such as “stupid”, but there are worrying signs that all this digital convenience is costing us dearly. Across the economically developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Pisa scores, which measure 15-year-olds’ reading, maths and science,tended to peak around 2012. While over the 20th century IQ scores increased globally, perhaps due to improved access to education and better nutrition, in many developed countries they appear to have been declining.Falling test and IQ scores are the subject of hot debate. What is harder to dispute is that, with every technological advance, we deepen our dependence on digital devices and find it harder to work or remember or think or, frankly, function without them. “It’s only software developers and drug dealers who call people users,” Kosmyna mutters at one point, frustrated at AI companies’ determination to push their products on to the public before we fully understand the psychological and cognitive costs.In the ever-expanding, frictionless online world, you are first and foremost a user: passive, dependent. In the dawning era of AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes, how will we maintain the scepticism and intellectual independence we’ll need? By the time we agree that our minds are no longer our own, that we simply cannot think clearly without tech assistance, how much of us will be left to resist?Start telling people that you’re worried about what intelligent machines are doing to our brains and there’s a risk that, in the not-too-distant future, everyone will laugh at what a fuddy-duddy you were. Socrates worried that writing would weaken people’s memories and encourage only superficial understanding: not wisdom but “the conceit of wisdom” – an argument that is strikingly similar to many critiques of AI. What happened instead was that writing and the technological advances that followed – the printing press, mass media, the internet era – meant that ever more people had access to ever more information. More people could develop great ideas, and they could share those ideas more easily, and this made us cleverer and more innovative, as individuals and as communities.After all, writing didn’t only change how we access and retain information; it changed how we think. A person can achieve more complex tasks with a notebook and paper to hand than without: most people can’t work out 53,683 divided by 7 in their head but could have a stab at doing long division on paper. I couldn’t have dictated this piece, but writing helped me organise and clarify my thoughts. As humans, we’re very good at what experts call “cognitive offloading”, namely using our physical environment to reduce our mental load, and this in turn helps us achieve more complex cognitive tasks. Imagine how much harder it would be to function each day without a calendar or phone reminders, or without Google to remember everything for you. In the best case scenario, intelligent people working in partnership with intelligent machines will achieve new intellectual feats and solve tricky problems: we’re already seeing, for instance, how AI can help scientists discovernew drugs fasterand doctors detectcancer earlier and more efficiently.The complication is, if technology is truly making us cleverer – turning us into efficient, information-processing machines – why do we spend so much time feeling dumb?Last year, “brain rot” was named Oxford University Press’s word of the year, a term that captures both the specific feeling of mindlessness that descends when we spend too much time scrolling through rubbish online and the corrosive, aggressively dumb content itself, the nonsense memes and AI garble. When we hold our phones we have, in theory, most of the world’s accumulated knowledge at our fingertips, so why do we spend so much time dragging our eyeballs over dreck?One issue is that our digital devices have not been designed to help us think more efficiently and clearly; almost everything we encounter online has been designed to capture and monetise our attention. Each time you reach for your phone with the intention of completing a simple, discrete, potentially self-improving task, such as checking the news, your primitive hunter-gatherer brain confronts a multibillion-pound tech industry devoted to throwing you off course and holding your attention, no matter what. To extend Christodoulou ’s metaphor, in the same way that one feature of an obesogenic society are food deserts – whole neighbourhoods in which you cannot buy a healthy meal – large parts of the internet are information deserts, in which the only available brain food is junk.Digital multitasking gives you a false sense of being on top of things without ever getting to the bottom of anythingIn the late 90s the tech consultant Linda Stone, who was working as a professor at New York University, noticed that her students were using technology very differently from her colleagues at Microsoft, where she also worked. While her Microsoft colleagues were disciplined about working on two screens – one for emails, perhaps, and another for Word, or a spreadsheet – her students seemed to be trying to do 20 things at once. She coined the term “continuous partial attention” to describe the stressful, involuntarily state we often find ourselves in when we’re trying to toggle between several cognitively demanding activities, such as responding to emails while on a Zoom call. When I first heard the term I realised that I, like most people I know, live most of my life in a state of continuous partial attention, whether I’m guiltily checking my phone when I’m supposed to be playing with my kids, or incessantly sidetracked by texts and emails when I’m trying to write, or trying to relax while watching Netflix and simultaneously doing an online food shop, still wondering why I feel as chilled-out as an over-microwaved dinner. Digital multitasking makes us feel productive, but this is often illusory. “You have a false sense of being on top of things without ever getting to the bottom of anything,” Stone tells me. It also makes you feel permanently on edge: one study she conducted found that 80% of people experience “screen apnea” when checking their emails: they become so caught up in the endless notifications that they forget to breathe properly. “Your fight or flight system becomes up-regulated, because you’re constantly trying to stay on top of things,” she says, and this hypervigilance has cognitive costs: it makes us more forgetful, worse at making decisions and less attentive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

After all, what matters to tech companies financially is not that you want to be reading what you’re reading, or that you love what you listen to or what you’re looking at, only that you are unwilling or unable to pull yourself away. This is why streaming services such as Netflix crank out bland, formulaic films that are euphemistically labelled “casual viewing” and are literally designed for viewerswho aren’t really watching, and Spotify playlists are filled withgeneric stock musicby fake artists, to provide background music, “Chill Out” or “Party” vibes, for listeners who aren’t really listening. In short, the modern internet doesn’t necessarily make you an idiot, but it definitely primes you to act like one.It is into this climate that generative AI arrived, with an entirely novel offer. Until recently you could only outsource remembering and some data processing to technology; now you can outsource thinking itself. Given that we spend most of our lives feeling overstimulated and frazzled, it’s little wonder that so many have jumped at the chance to let a computer do more things we would have once done for ourselves– such as write work reports or emails, or plan a holiday. As we transition from the internet era to the AI era, what we’re consuming is not only ever more low-value, ultra-processed information, but more information that is essentially predigested, delivered in a way that is designed to bypass important human functions, such as assessing, filtering and summarising information, or actually considering a problem rather than finessing the first solution presented to us.Michael Gerlich, head of the Centre for Strategic Corporate Foresight and Sustainability at SBS Swiss Business School, began studying the impact of generative AI on critical thinking because he noticed the quality of classroom discussions decline. Sometimes he’d set his students a group exercise, and rather than talk to one another they continued to sit in silence, consulting their laptops. He spoke to other lecturers, who had noticed something similar. Gerlich recently conducted a study, involving 666 people of various ages, and found those who used AI more frequentlyscored lower on critical thinking. (As he notes, to date his work only provides evidence for a correlation between the two: it’s possible that people with lower critical thinking abilities are more likely to trust AI, for example.)Are schools equipped to produce creative thinkers – or is the education system going to churn out mindless, AI-essay writing drones?Like many researchers, Gerlich believes that, used in the right way, AI can make us cleverer and more creative – but the way most people use it produces bland, unimaginative, factually questionable work. One concern is the so-called “anchoring effect”. If you post a question to generative AI, the answer it gives you sets your brain on a certain mental path and makes you less likely to consider alternative approaches. “I always use the example: imagine a candle. Now, AI can help you improve the candle. It will be the brightest ever, burn the longest, be very cheap and amazing looking, but it will never develop to the lightbulb,” he says. To get from the candle to a lightbulb you need a human who is good at critical thinking, someone who might take a chaotic, unstructured, unpredictable approach to problem solving. When, as has happened in many workplaces, companies roll out tools such as the chatbot Copilot without offering decent AI training, they risk producing teams of passable candle-makers in a world that demands high-efficiency lightbulbs.There is also the bigger issue that adults who use AI as a shortcut have at least benefited from going through the education system in the years before it was possible to get a computer to write your homework for you. Onerecent British surveyfound that92% of university studentsuse AI, and about 20% have used AI to write all or part of an assignment for them. Under these circumstances, how much are they learning? Are schools and universities still equipped to produce creative, original thinkers who will build better, more intelligent societies – or is the education system going to churn out mindless, gullible, AI essay-writing drones?Some years ago, Matt Miles, a psychology teacher at a high school in Virginia in the US, was sent on a training programme on tech in schools. The teachers were shown a video in which a schoolgirl is caught checking her phone during lessons. In the video, she looks up and says, “You think I’m just on TikTok or playing games. I’m actually in a research room talking to a water researcher from Botswana for a project.”“It’s laughable. You show it to the kids and they all laugh, right?” Miles says. Alarmed at the disconnect between how policymakers view tech in education and what teachers were seeing in the classroom, in 2017 Miles and his colleague Joe Clement, who teaches economics and government at the same school, publishedScreen Schooled, a book that argued that technology overuse is making kids dumber. In the years since, smartphones have been banned from their classrooms, but students still work from their laptops. “We had one kid tell us, and I think it was pretty insightful, ‘If you see me on my phone, there’s a 0% chance I’m doing something productive. If you see me on my laptop, there’s a 50% chance,’” Miles says.In essence what is happening with these technologies is we’re experimenting on childrenUntil the pandemic, many teachers were “rightly sceptical” about the benefits of introducing more technology into the classroom, Faith Boninger, a researcher at the University of Colorado, observes, but when lockdowns forced schools to go online, a new normal was created, and ed tech platforms such as Google Workspace for Education, Kahoot! and Zearn became ubiquitous. With the spread of generative AI came new promises that it could revolutionise education and usher in an era of personalised student learning, while also reducing the workload for teachers. But almost all the research that has found benefits to introducing tech in classrooms is funded by the ed-tech industry, and most large-scale independent research has found that screen time gets in the way of achievement. A global OECD study found, for instance, that the more students use tech in schools,the worse their results. “There is simply no independent evidence at scale for the effectiveness of these tools … in essence what is happening with these technologies is we’re experimenting on children,” says Wayne Holmes, a professor of critical studies of artificial intelligence and education at University College London. “Most sensible people would not go into a bar and meet somebody who says, ‘Hey, I’ve got this new drug. It’s really good for you’ – and just use it. Generally, we expect our medicines to be rigorously tested, we expect them to be prescribed to us by professionals. But suddenly when we’re talking about ed tech, which apparently is very beneficial for children’s developing brains, we don’t need to do that.”What worries Miles and Clement is not only that their students are permanently distracted by their devices, but that they will not develop critical thinking skills and deep knowledge when quick answers are only a click away. Where once Clement would ask his class a question such as, “Where do you think the US ranks in terms of GDP per capita?” and guide his students as they puzzled over the solution, now someone will have Googled the answer before he’s even finished his question. They know students use ChatGPT constantly and get annoyed if they aren’t provided with a digital copy of their assignment, because then they must type rather than copy and paste the relevant questions into an AI assistant or the Google search bar. “Being able to Google something and providing the right answer isn’t knowledge,” Clement says. “And having knowledge is incredibly important so that when you hear something that’s questionable or maybe fake, you think, ‘Wait a minute, that contradicts all the knowledge I have that says otherwise, right?’ It’s no wonder there’s a bunch of idiots walking about who think that the Earth is flat. Like, if you read a flat Earth blog, you think, ‘Ah, that makes a lot of sense’ because you don’t have any understanding or knowledge.” The internet is already awash with conspiracy and misinformation, something that will only become worse as AI hallucinates and produces plausible fakes, and he worries that young people are poorly equipped to navigate it.During the pandemic, Miles says, he found his young son weeping over his school-issued tablet. His son was doing an online maths program and he had been tasked with making six using the fewest number of one, three and five tokens. He kept suggesting using two threes, and the computer kept telling him he was wrong. Miles tried one and five, which the computer accepted. “That’s kind of the nightmare you get with a non-human AI, right?” Miles observes: students often approach topics in unanticipated and interesting ways, but machines struggle to cope with idiosyncrasy. Listening to his story, however, I was struck by a different kind of nightmare. Maybe the dawn of the new golden era of stupidity doesn’t begin when we submit to super-intelligent machines; it starts when we hand over power to dumb ones.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There you are. Now you find a photo of Benjamin Sesko looking sad in aManchester Unitedshirt. Like he’s just missed an open goal. No, obviously you don’t need to find a photo of him missing an open goal. The less context here, the better. Now pop the photos side by side. Overlay the goal stats in big buffoonish font. Don’t forget the emojis. Post to all social media channels.Will you mention that Højlund’s tally includes goals in the Champions League while Sesko is not competing in Europe at all? You will not. Nor will you mention that four of Højlund’s goals have come against Belarus and Greece, or the fact that Denmark are a much better team than Slovenia and create many more chances. You run socials for a big media brand, pure liquid engagement is what puts food on your table, United are the biggest meal of all, and as ever, context will be your sworn enemy.A decade of despair: Manchester United’s long winless run at AnfieldRead moreSo the wheel of content turns. Your next job is to scan the 44-minute interview Peter Schmeichel gave to a BBC podcast and find the bit where he talks about the signing of Sesko being “weird”. There’s a bit just before he says that, where Schmeichel pre-qualifies his comments with the words: “I have nothing bad to say about Benjamin Sesko” … yeah, strip that bit out. Nobody needs that. Just make sure you get “weird” and “Sesko” together in the headline. People will befurious.Mid-autumn has long been one of my favourite times of year to watch football. The leaves swirl and the wind turns, the teams and tactics are still fresh, everything is new and yet everything is beginning to form. The stars of the coming months are planting their flags. The transfer window is shut. Nobody is talking about the quadruple yet. Everyone is still in the game. At this precise point of the season, all is possibility.Yet for many of the same reasons, mid-autumn has long been one of my least favourite times of the year to read about football. For while nothing has yet been settled, and something must always be getting settled. Jack Grealish is reborn. Florian Wirtz has been a crushing disappointment. Is Antoine Semenyo the best player in the league right now? Please, Mr President. The planes are in the air. We need a decision now.And for numerous reasons Sesko feels like Patient Zero in this respect, a player inextricably trapped between football’s two countervailing, non-negotiable forces. The imperative to withhold definitive judgment, in order to allow layers of technical texture and tactical sophistication to develop. And the imperative to generate permanent definitive judgment, a conveyor belt of takes and memes, context-free condemnations and pointless comparisons, a square that can never truly be circled.I do not propose to offer a substantive analysis of Sesko’s time at United so far. The guy has started four times in the Premier League in a wildly inconsistent team, scored two goals, and taken a grand total of 116 touches. What exactly are we analysing? Nor do I propose to duplicate Gary Neville’s and Ian Wright’s seminal masterwork in the field, “Argument Over Benjamin Sesko (2025)”, in which two of England’s leading pundits duel thrillingly on the Stick to Football podcast over whether Sesko needs 10 goals to be a success this season (Neville), or whether it’s really more like 12 or 13 (Wright).For all this I loved watching Sesko at Leipzig: a big, screeching sports car of a striker, playing in a team pitched perfectly at his talents: given the freedom to rampage but also the freedom to miss. And in part this is why United feels like the cruellest place he could possibly be at the moment: a place where “brutal verdicts” are summarily issued in about the time it takes to load a pre-roll ad, the club with the widest and most pitiless gulf between the time and air he needs, and the time and air he is going to get.View image in fullscreenIt is too early to judge how Sesko will fare at Manchester United … but don’t let that stop you.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesWe saw an example of this during the international break, when a widely shared infographic by the Athletic handily informed us that Sesko had been deemed – by a wide margin – the worst signing of the summer transfer window by a poll of 20 agents. And of course the media are by no means alone in this. Club channels, influencers, anonymous X accounts with a suspiciously high number of pornbot followers: everybody with skin in the game is now basically aligned along the same principles, an ecosystem explicitly nosed towards provocation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are we aware, on any level, what this infinite sluice of aggravation is doing to our brains? Quite apart from the essential weirdness of being a player in the middle of this, aware on some surreal butterfly-effect level that every single thing about them is now basically content, commodity, open-source property to be packaged and traded.And yes, partly this is because United are United, the corpse that keeps nourishing, a big club that must always be generating the big feelings. But also in part this is a seasonal affliction, a pendulum of judgment most clearly and cruelly glimpsed at this time of year, about a month after the window has closed. All summer long we have been coveting footballers, eulogising them, salivating over them. Now, just a few weeks in, many of those same players are already being disdained as broken goods. Is it time to worry about Jamie Gittens? Did Arsenal actually need Viktor Gyökeres? What was the point of Randal Kolo Muani?It feels appropriate that Sesko faces Liverpool on Sunday: a team simultaneously 13 months unbeaten at home in the Premier League and somehow in their own state of feverish crisis, like filing a missing person’s report on someone who popped to the shops half an hour ago. Too open. Mohamed Salah finished. Alexander Isak waste of money. Arne Slot bald.Perhaps we have not yet quite grasped the way the narrative of football has begun to supplant football itself, to inflect the way we watch it, an entire sport repivoted around talking points and reaction, something that happens in the background while we scroll through our phones, unable to disconnect from the saline drip of takes and more takes. It may be Sesko taking the hit right now. But in a way, we’re all losing something here.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has been told there have been around eight official complaints to Reform’s south-east regional director in the last three months.While Reform had 56 councillors elected to Kent county council, one of them has joined Ukip while another was removed from a cabinet position amid a row. At least one more was recently suspended among allegations about their behaviour.At the start of the video, Kemkaran said: “Because I am not a dictator or an autocrat I like feedback, I like to discuss. I like to hear what everybody thinks. However, when it comes to making the really big decisions, and LGR is one of those … Sometimes I will make a decision that might not be liked by everybody in the group. But I am afraid you are just going to have to fucking suck it up.”View image in fullscreenLinden Kemkaran: ‘Sometimes I will make a decision that might not be liked by everybody in the group. But I am afraid you are just going to have to fucking suck it up.’Photograph: The GuardianOpen-mouthed councillors were left visibly shocked at the comment, which presaged a meeting at which Kemkaran later muted one to stop him from speaking.“We are going to live or die on that budget. If we don’t balance the books you can forget Reform winning the next election. It’s that crucial,” she told them.“If we can avoid putting up council tax by the full 5% that is going to be the best thing that we can do to show that Reform can actually run something as big as Kent council, because let’s not forget we are the shop window in KCC. People are looking at us, they are judging us every single day, every single minute of every single day. Nigel knows that. He is super aware that we are the flagship council.”The comments sparked dissent from councillors at the meeting, which took place in late August.Councillor Paul Thomas complained that Reform backbenchers were not being briefed on LGR plans by Kemkaran and other members of the council leadership, adding: “Then, quite frankly, the question is: is that the right leader and the right cabinet?”Arguments also broke out over a plan by Kemkaran to keep her increasingly unhappy councillors informed through a scheme under which cabinet members would each ‘mentor’ four councillors chosen at random.“Let’s face it, the situation within the group is not great at the moment,” said another councillor, Dean Burns. “I work my arse off in my own portfolio and I am still getting a rod up my backside every time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kemkaran replied: “I’ll think about it.”Later in the meeting, Kemkaran complained about other council leaders in Kent who she had been meeting recent weeks, accusing them of a “shocking” level of ignorance about the coming LGR plans and suggesting that they did not like her because she was a woman.She also referred to proposals being developed by consultants at KPMG for Kent and other councils in response to the government’s LGR plans, as well as an alternative commissioned by Reform.“It has the potential to completely stuff the process because it will score very highly on all the government’s scoring methodologies, but they won’t want it to succeed. In a way, it’s the cleverest way of putting a spoke in the works but still being part of the process.”Other councillors appeared to be confused by the strategy, with Kemkaran saying: “If we fuck this up in Kent and get confused over LGR and pull KCC out of the decision-making process and something is done and KCC wasn’t at the table, that is going to look really bad.”“We need to keep resolutely focused on balancing this budget and showing we can run a council without us all fighting like rats in a sack.”View image in fullscreenReform won 56 seats on Kent county council, but one member has defected to Ukip, another was sacked from the cabinet and at least one suspended over allegations about their behaviour.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAReform councillors who spoke to the Guardian were reluctant to go on the record. However, one said: “Many of us are now despairing of this situation and feel it cannot continue any longer.”Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who make up the largest opposition party on the council, said Reform’s flagship council was “descending into chaos”.Antony Hook, the Liberal Democrat leader of the opposition in Kent, described the recording of the meeting as “truly shocking”.Ministers propose voting changes for mayoral elections in English devolution billRead more“It reveals the Reform administration to be taking decisions and making plans based on party advantage rather than interests of the public. The recording also reveals the leader of the council speaking to her colleagues abusively and unprofessionally, in ways that would rightly not be tolerated in most workplaces,” he said.A Labour party spokesperson said: “Last week, the council confirmed that despite promising to cut waste and deliver savings, they haven’t come close. And now it appears that Reform politicians in Kent are more interested in fighting amongst themselves than working in the interests of their constituents.”A Reform UK Kent spokesperson said: “The Reform administration in Kent is united behind our election pledge to deliver value for money and fix 30 years of Conservative mismanagement.“In just five months, we have made tens of millions of pounds’ worth of savings, made serious inroads towards reducing the authority’s debt and we are changing the practices of Kent county council to ensure that every pound spent represents best value for the taxpayer.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Andrew announced on Friday he would no longer use the title but he will officially retain the dukedom, which can only be removed by an act of parliament.Giuffre was 41 when she died by suicide in April.She said she was abused by Epsteinfrom the age of 16 and trafficked to other powerful men. She brought a civil case against Andrew in New York, alleging he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17.Andrew made no admission of liability and has always denied Giuffre’s claims, but agreed to settle the case out of court. The Telegraph reported on Saturday that, as part of the deal, Giuffre agreed not to repeat her accusations for a year to avoid tarnishing Queen Elizabeth II’s platinum jubilee.There have been longstanding rumours that the late queen partly funded the settlement with private income from the Duchy of Lancaster, a property portfolio that has been controlled by reigning monarchs since medieval times.Maskell said: “I think we need a lot of clarity over this. I think honesty is so important. Virginia Giuffre no longer is with us, but she has family. It’s important that everyone has transparency. There is no space for obfuscation, no matter how embarrassing it is.”Andrew continues to live in the palatial 30-room Royal Lodge in Windsor, despite having no discernible income beyond a naval pension. He has a 75-year lease on the property and is responsible for maintaining it. He has reportedly resisted the king’s efforts to move him to nearby Frogmore Cottage.In a statement released on Friday, Andrew saidhe had made the decision to surrender his titlesafter a discussion with the king, where it was “concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A life he was born to replaced by a life he will hate | Stephen BatesRead moreHe will also give up use of his honours as a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. His only remaining title will be that of prince. As he was born the son of a queen, this cannot be removed.It was reported on Saturday that the Prince of Wales was not satisfied with the outcome and will take a more ruthless approach to his disgraced uncle, including banning him from his future coronation.William was consulted on the decision that led to Andrew relinquishing his dukedom on Friday, but the Sunday Times said William “knows the ‘Andrew problem’ will be in his in-tray at some point”.Maskell, who lost the Labour whip in July after rebellions on welfare policy, previously introduced a bill aimed at giving the monarch powers to remove titles of his own accord, or after the recommendation of a joint parliament committee.She said she would attempt to reintroduce the bill to parliament next week, suggesting she had support from other MPs. Maskell added: “We stand up for really high values in [York]. When there was polling on this back in 2022, 80% of residents said they did not want that title continued because of the association with our city. That’s why I have stood firm.”Last weekend, the Mail on Sunday and the Sun on Sunday reported that Andrew contacted Epstein the day after a picture of him with his arm around a teenage Giuffre was published in the press. In 2019, Andrew told the then BBC journalist Emily Maitlis that he had cut contact with Epstein by this point during his infamous Newsnight interview. The newspapers quoted from an email in which Andrew reportedly told Epstein: “I’m just as concerned for you! Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, said Andrew’s decision to surrender his titles was a “joyous moment”. He added: “I think her kids would be incredibly proud to know that their mom is an American hero. She’s an international hero. That all the years of work that she put in is now coming to some sort of justice and these monsters can’t escape from it.”The Epstein accuser Haley Robson called the news “extremely bittersweet”. She told the BBC: “I have moments of joyous tears where I’m just flabbergasted that something finally broke.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Gaza’s civil defence agency said the family were trying to reach their home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City when the bus they were in was attacked for allegedly crossing the “yellow line” that demarcates areas of Israeli army control.“They had crossed the so-called ‘yellow line’, an imaginary boundary mentioned by the Israeli army,” said Mahmoud Basal, the spokesperson for the Gaza civil defence. “I am certain the family couldn’t distinguish between the yellow and red lines because there are no actual physical markers on the ground.”Footage released by Gaza’s civil defence agency show the bodies of the family during the retrieval mission in conjunction with the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The victims include seven children and three women.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip”, adding: “The troops fired warning shots toward the suspicious vehicle, but the vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them. The troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.”Israel and Hamas have continued to trade blame over breaches of the truce. Israel accused the militant group of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return the remains of deceased hostages. On Monday, Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but as of Saturday evening had handed back only 12 of 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins of Gaza.Turkey has deployed dozens of disaster relief specialists to help search for bodies under the rubble. Efforts to recover bodies over a week into the ceasefire continue, with the Palestinian death toll now above 68,000, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Gaza’s civil defence agency estimates that thebodies of about 10,000 peopleare trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings. The task ahead of the rescuers is immense given that there is an estimated 60m tonnes of rubble across the territory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Doctors at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis saidthe bodies showed signs of torture and execution, including blindfolds, cuffed hands and bullet wounds in the head, according to doctors’ accounts.Meanwhile, aid remains critically scarce in Gaza one week into the ceasefire, humanitarian agencies have warned, as Israel delays the entry of food convoys into the territory.The Palestinian embassy in Egypt announced on Saturday that Palestinian citizens living in Egypt who want to return to Gaza will be able to travel via the Rafah crossing starting on Monday.In a separate development on Saturday, an Israeli strike on a construction vehicle in southern Lebanon killed a man, the Lebanese health ministry reported.Israel has repeatedly bombed Lebanon despite a November ceasefire that brought to an end more than a year of hostilities with the militant group Hezbollah that culminated in two months of open war.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A meeting with Birmingham’s safety advisory group (SAG) has been set up for next week.Home Office offers extra resources in effort to undo Maccabi Tel Aviv fans banRead moreThe BBCreportedthat Villa had informed stewards they had permission to skip their duties on the day of the fixture, Thursday 6 November, before the decision to ban fans was made by police.In an email apparently sent on 3 October, stewards were told that “regarding the upcoming fixture against Maccabi Tel Aviv … we appreciate that some of you may have concerns about attending work”, the broadcaster reported.Those who were meant to work on the day were told they would “be able to submit a one-off absence request”, and this “will allow you to register your absence for this specific fixture”.Aston Villa had also made clear that “this type of absence will not affect your contractual minimum attendance of 80%”.This email was reportedly sent after a number of stewards allegedly raised concerns over safety on the day, and it is unclear how many stewards will not work on the day of the fixture. A request to not work would have to be submitted four days prior to the match’s scheduled date.West Midlands police had said on Thursday they had classified Villa’s home fixture against Maccabi as “high risk” based on intelligence. The police force also highlightedviolence that occurred during a 2024 Uefa Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi in Amsterdam, where more than 60 people were arrested over the violence that was called a “toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger” by authorities.Four local people were given short jail terms for the violence against Maccabi fans. A report by Dutch police into the disorder during the 2024 Amsterdam match found Maccabi fans had torn a Palestinian flag down from a local building and burned it, shouted: “Fuck you, Palestine”, andvandalised a taxi. Maccabi fans were also taped chanting “Olé, olé. Let the IDF win, fuck the Arabs.”The ban imposed by West Midlands police came after pressure from the local independent MP, Ayoub Khan. Khan told BBC Two’s Newsnight on Thursday: “We cannot conflate [this issue with] antisemitism when we look at what some of these fans did in Amsterdam in 2024 … We’re talking about violent fans and I think the prime minister should stay out of operational matters.”The Campaign Against Antisemitismsaidon Friday it was notifying Birmingham city council and West Midlands police of its intention to bring a judicial review against the ban of Maccabi fans, which it said was “pernicious” and had “angered the whole country”.Keir Starmer called the police force’s decision “wrong”, saying “we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets”. Uefa, the governing body of European football, has urged local authorities in Birmingham to allow Maccabi fans to travel to the match.In a statement on their website, Aston Villasaid: “The club are in continuous dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities throughout this ongoing process, with the safety of supporters attending the match and the safety of local residents at the forefront of any decision.”Aston Villa have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaWest MidlandsMaccabi Tel AvivPoliceBirminghamEuropa LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

It will also promote greater trade union recognition and collective bargaining in the clean energy sector, including when jobs are offshore.Miliband’s announcement was welcomed by unions fromUniteto the GMB, which have long been pushing for a more detailed plan for how people will switch from old fossil fuel industries to those in clean energy in the future.As part of the plan, 31 professions will be designated as priorities for recruitment and training, with plumbers, heating and ventilating installers at the top of the list with an additional 8,000 to 10,000 needed by 2030. Carpenters, electricians and welders are the next highest in demand on the list, with 4,000 to 8,500 extra of each required.Miliband said the national plan “answers a key question about where the good jobs of the future will come from”.View image in fullscreenEd Miliband, the energy secretary, says the national plan makes clear what jobs are needed for the green energy transition.Photograph: James Glossop/ReutersAs well as flagging to jobseekers what kind of green jobs are needed, the energy secretary said it would “send a signal to the mayors, regional mayors, who have lots of responsibilities in this area about where they need to be directing their further education colleges and others where the big opportunities are.“It sends a signal to industry, who have been saying … set out what are the needs going be and how are we going to fill them.”Miliband said the promise of hundreds of thousands of new roles in the renewables and clean energy sector would show that Reform UK is “waging war on jobs” bychallenging the switch to net zero.“Obviously, this is a massive fight with Reform,” he said. “Reformers said they’ll wage war on clean energy. Well, that’s waging war on these jobs … It’s all part of their attempt at a culture war, but I actually think they’re out of tune with the British people because I think people recognise that we need, that we want the jobs from clean energy.“We want the lower bills that it can bring. So let’s have the argument as a country about what we’re going to do. I’m really confident we can win this argument.”He said estimates show jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of more than £50,000, compared with the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.Other announcements in the plan include five new technical excellence colleges that will help train young people into essential roles, with skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire to be backed by £2.5m towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The LDRS also stated that Freeman reported the video to the police.Responding to the clip, Freeman said: “The video is a fabrication, created without my knowledge or consent, and uses my image and voice without permission. Regardless of my position as an MP, that should be an offence.”He added: “This sort of political disinformation has the potential to seriously distort, disrupt and corrupt our democracy.”View image in fullscreenA still taken from the ‘AI-generated deepfake’.Photograph: FacebookThe MP then said he did not know whether the incident was a “politically motivated attack” or a “dangerous prank”. He also said that there has been a “huge increase in political disinformation, disruption and extremism” on both the left and right in recent months.Freeman said: “I have reported this matter to the relevant authorities, and I urge anyone who sees the video to report it immediately rather than share it further.”After getting elected in 2010, Freeman served in various ministerial positions in the previous Conservative government.

One more day up and down the pitiless slide. One more day of blistered hands gripping unforgiving oars.But after more than 8,000 nautical miles (15,000km) at sea – an epic five-and-a-half-month journey across the Pacific that included close encounters with whales, failing beacons and chocolate shortages – the sea had one more challenge.A gusting 20-knot wind off Cairns kept pushing Jess Rowe and Miriam Payne’s tiny rowboat, the Velocity, from the terra firma that was now achingly close.Rowe and Payne: finish line in sight for aptly named British duo rowing nonstop from Peru to AustraliaRead moreFriends and family waited ashore as a planned midday arrival became 2pm, then 4pm, then early evening. Finally, at 6.42pm, they came alongside at Cairns Yacht Club.“Those final few hours were brutal,” Rowe said, finally standing on land.“The wind was pushing us off the channel, and we honestly thought we weren’t going to make it. We ended up outside the channel and thought we might have to swim to shore. To finally be here, after talking about it for so long, just feels incredible.“We still can’t quite believe it’s real. After so many days at sea, to finally see land, and the welcome we’ve had here in Cairns, is beyond words.”MapThe British pair – Rowe is 28 and Payne 25 – pushed off from Lima, Peru, on 5 May (an initial attempt in April was derailed by a rudder failure).Over 165 days at sea, they averaged 50 nautical miles a day, rowing in tandem during the day, one rowing alone at night while her crewmate slept a bare handful of hours in a cramped cabin.Kept alive with 400kg of mostly freeze-dried food, a water desalinator and an onboard growing unit for micro-greens, the pair have relied on a less-than-reliable solar system for a fraction of the power they’ve needed. For much of their journey across the vast Pacific, they’ve had no navigation equipment or beacon, turning them into a “ghost ship”, almost invisible to other vessels.The pair have borne 9-metre (30ft) waves, navigated shipping lanes and endured raging storms that, at times, silenced all of their electronics.View image in fullscreenJess Rowe and Miriam Payne as the row Velocity towards the Great Barrier Reef.Photograph: Brian Cassey/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd they’ve kept rowing, one stroke after another, across blazing hot days, under star-filled night skies. They have set a new record as the first all-female pair to row across the South Pacific Ocean, non-stop and unsupported.And they have raised more than £86,000 (A$179,000) for the Outward Bound Trust.The pair did their best to keep in contact with the world outside their tiny vessel. On “day 140-something”, they reported a “chocolate emergency” – down to their last two bars with still more than 1,600km (1,000 miles) to go – but allowed themselves the indulgence of breaking one open to celebrate England’s Red Roses winning the Rugby World Cup.1:02British duo approach Australia after rowing nearly 8,300 nautical miles from Peru – videoPayne, from a landlocked part of Yorkshire, had not been at sea until she rowed the Atlantic solo in 2022 in a record time. She now has a second ocean conquered. But there were moments, she conceded, when they feared they wouldn’t make it. As early as day six, a way across the world’s largest ocean felt impossible.“Our power was dropping, the water-maker pipes burst, but after nine repairs, we managed a bypass and just limped along with little power for the rest of the crossing. Every time something went wrong, we just looked at each other and went, ‘of course it has!’ But we kept going.”“It was really great to have Jess as a teammate. What was great was that we worked hard together, we problem-solved together, and we were always working towards the same goals,” she said.Rowe is from Hampshire. Before her Pacific triumph, she rowed the Atlantic, hiked England’s South West Coast Path, climbed Mount Kenya and cycled across Spain. There might still be more.“We had such a good time together, and we’re already excited to plan new adventures together as well. I wouldn’t have done it with anybody else.”Explore more on these topicsRowingQueenslandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Britons, long-promised fully driverless cars, the answer is as ever – yes, nearly. But not quite.A landmark moment on the journey to autonomous driving is, again, just around the corner. This week, Waymo, which successfully runs robotaxis in San Francisco and four other US cities, announced it wasbringing its cars to London.The detail remains scant, but the promise eye-catching: the pioneering Silicon Valley company said it was bringing its fully autonomous service “across the pond, where we intend to offer rides – with no human behind the wheel – in 2026 … We can’t wait to serve Londoners and the city’s millions of visitors next year.”Driverless taxis from Waymo will be on London’s roads next year, US firm announcesRead moreThose millions may want an Oyster card for the London Underground, just in case. The UK government, intent on luring big tech, in the summer set out plans to speed up the introduction of driverless cars, meaning robotaxis could start operating in regulated public trials as early as spring 2026. But the rules are yet to be fully established, and testing may include a safety driver for some time.British firmWayve, in partnership with Uber, has issued the slightly more sober “plan to develop and launch public-road trials of level 4 fully autonomous vehicles in London.”While Americans sit back and enjoy the autonomous ride, Britain’s winding road to driverless cars has been marked by pledges that vanished like pedestrians in the rain. In 2018, Addison Lee – once the future – was promising, along with Oxford University scientists, to belaunching robotaxis by 2021.View image in fullscreenWaymo, which successfully runs robotaxis in San Francisco and four other US cities, announced it was bringing its cars to London.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyA year earlier, Nissanalmost managedto get one of its Leaf cars to drive itself around Beckton in east London without crashing. Chris Grayling, then transport secretary, said self-driving cars would be on the market in four years, as little pods tootled autonomously around the O2 in Greenwich. A British invention, a union jack-liveried Sinclair C5-Tardis love child,appeared in a Milton Keynes car park in 2015; then business secretary Vince Cable said 100 of them would soon be carrying passengers round town for £2 a pop.Yet abroad, particularly in America and parts of China, autonomous taxi services are now very much a reality – meaning Waymo’s arrival appears more significant than previous hype or hope.In San Francisco, Waymo’s home town, its driverless cars have become a routine part of urban life, humming along the hilly grid of streets at a cautious yet purposeful pace.US regulators launch investigation into self-driving Teslas after series of crashesRead moreSince their full launch in June 2024 they have taken their place alongside the city’s electric scooters and municipal buses. Taking a Waymo has become as much of a must-do tourist experience as riding one of the city’s historic trolley cars.The Democrat mayor, Daniel Lurie, has encouraged expansion to revitalise downtown areas, where the streets remain inhabited by many homeless people – leading to the jarring juxtaposition of cutting-edge AI-controlled robocars rolling past those in extreme poverty.With fast spinning cameras on each wing and one on the roof like a police siren, the converted white Jaguar iPace vehicles look like surveillance infrastructure. They are hailed like Uber or Lyft rides from smartphone apps – but the absence of a human in the driver’s seat, and the steering wheel turning under the control of an invisible algorithm, are reminders of the economic ructions they are causing.In 2010 Uber launched in San Francisco, upending the way taxi drivers were employed and ushering in precarious gig work. Now those Uber drivers are facing a second wave of technological disruption.View image in fullscreenIn 2010 Uber launched in San Francisco, upending the way taxi drivers were employed and ushering in precarious gig work.Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesAccording to data cited by the Economist, the number of people employed in San Francisco in taxi firms grew by 7% in 2024; and pay rose by 14%. It quoted David Risher, the chief executive of Lyft, predicted that self-driving taxis “will actually expand the market”.But not all necessarily feel that way on the frontline. In the Mission district of San Francisco, asked about Waymo, one Uber driver from Venezuela replied: “I think I’ve got about a year left in this job.”‘Delivery robots will happen’: Skype co-founder on his fast-growing venture StarshipRead moreFor a customer, to ride in a Waymo is to feel abandoned to the control and power of artificial intelligence. Once hailed via the app, the car pulls up gently, showing the customer’s initials on a digital display on the roof hub. A tap on the app unlocks the car doors; a welcoming voice reminds riders to buckle up. A screen offers a wide menu of music to cruise along to behind the tinted rear windows, in a truly private space.Tap the “start ride” button on the touch screen and the car pulls confidently away into the streaming traffic. The steering wheel, with its “please keep your hands off” sign, spins like a funfair ghost train ride.It doesn’t take long to feel comfortable, as it swerves hazards, errs on the side of caution. Screens with scrolling street maps track progress and update the arrival time while the “pull over now” button is a welcome reminder that it is possible to override the original destination instruction, although it will only pull over when safe.View image in fullscreenFor a customer, to ride in a Waymo is to feel abandoned to the control and power of artificial intelligence.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesWaymos have prompted a multitude of social reactions. When three stalled in an intersection of a busy nightlife zone in the Marina area last month – apparently confused, lights flashing – revellers whooped with delight and one man executed multiple backflips from the roof of one of them.In July, a prankster organised people to a dead end street to all order Waymos at the same time simply to create the spectacle of a cluster of 50 of the robocars. In early 2024, when Waymos were in use in more limited numbers, one was smashed, daubed with graffiti and torched during lunar new year celebrations in the Chinatown area.A similar reception could await driverless taxis here – even if not personally at the hands of black cab drivers. General secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, Steve McNamara, said: “You see kids hacking Lime bikes – how long before it becomes the latest TikTok craze to surf on the roof of a Waymo?”McNamara claims to be relaxed: “It’s a solution to a problem we don’t have. These vehicles, that work so well allegedly in San Francisco and LA – London is like nowhere else. I want someone to explain to me how this driverless car is going to go somewhere like Charing Cross Road at 11pmt, where everybody’s just walking across the road. As soon as you see the Lidar dome [sensor] on the top of the Waymo car, you’re just going to step out, or pull out in a car, because you know it’s going to stop.”Christian Wolmar, the author of Driverless Cars: On a Road to Nowhere, concurs: “We do not have jaywalking rules here – and if Google expects that we’re going to introduce jaywalking rules for the sake of their cars …”Despite the US experience, he remains resolutely sceptical that fully driverless taxis will appear here next year: “Without a human operator, absolutely zero chance.”View image in fullscreen‘London is like nowhere else’: can driverless cars adapt to a non-US traffic system by 2026?Photograph: Paolo Paradiso/AlamyWaymo, which announced its London plans partly to pre-empt sightings of test cars on the streets beginning the long mapping process, is feeling confident after some 100m miles of autonomous journeys in San Francisco – a city far from flat and orderly – and trials in a dozen more.‘Raring to go:’ the German remote-driving firm that hopes to make private car ownership redundantRead moreOperators have long maintained that regulation, rather than technology, is the challenge. Even fast-tracking has its limits: the results of a consultation that closed last month should – although not confirmed – allow the pilots to go ahead.That may have been the trigger for Waymo, but it still needs to jump through a number of Department for Transport and Transport for London hoops to get the test scheme motoring – and the wider legislation will not be in place for at least two more years. Insurers, in particular, say many questions remain about liability.Similar pre-legislative pilot schemes have left other novel transport forms in limbo: e-scooter “trials” are now set to last eight years. Tony Travers, the LSE professor of government, believes driverless cars have a better chance: “They have to obey the rules. They could lead to congestion – but not the near-anarchy that the e-scooters have caused.”But even if driverless taxis appear, the wider question, Wolmar says, is, “so what?”According to the Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana, the answer is in the cars “reliability, safety and magic”, with a big emphasis on safety. Waymo cars to date have been involved in a fraction of the incidents of human-driven cars over the same distance.It also hopes to bring a different form of autonomy to those who may have lacked it: the Royal National Institute of Blind People welcomed Waymo’s news as a dawn of “technology that can safely enable spontaneous autonomous travel”.Waymo said its entry into the UK market would mean investing in depots, charging infrastructure, and cleaning and support teams, and “human specialists” in the driving seat for now.Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, has said the impending autonomous vehicle revolution could create 38,000 UK jobs.But more evidently at risk are professional drivers: 300,000 or so who are licensed for private hire – and, further down the line, another million in HGVs and delivery. Many of Britain’s 82,000 bus drivers have recently won significant pay rises; and the 27,000 train drivers are famously well heeled.Little wonder that polling suggests public opinion in the UK is barely positive about driverless cars, in a backdrop of general anxiety over the potential for artificial intelligence to eliminate human jobs, if not yet humans.The licensing and legislation awaits. McNamara is upbeat: “Who’s going to sign it off? If I was looking for a successful career in politics I wouldn’t be putting my name on that piece of paper.”"

Photograph: APFamilies are going back to Gaza City and surrounds to find their neighbourhoods obliterated, with many forced to camp in the ruinsBySeham Tanteshin Gaza andJulian BorgerSat 18 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTShareWhen theGaza ceasefiretook effect a week ago, tens of thousands of Palestinians began to move from the sprawling camps in the south back to their homes in Gaza City and the surrounding area.For most, it was a shocking and bitter homecoming.A month after they had been ordered out by Israeli forces, Palestinians filled the coastal road north. It soon became a solid river of people, mostly trudging on foot, carrying the few possessions they had salvaged from one displacement after another.What the returnees found on arrival was complete desolation. Large swaths of the north had simply been flattened. Their homes and neighbourhoods were no longer recognisable. Their communities had been erased.The sheer scale of demolition left families with an awful dilemma: stay and seek shelter in the shattered stumps of their former homes, or return to the tented camps in the south where they had a better chance of finding food and water. And looming over that decision was the great unknown of how long the truce would last, and whether it would ever take hold as a lasting peace.Destruction along dusty road with some peopleDestruction along al-Jalaa Street in central Gaza City“I had hoped to return and find my home standing, but what I found was quite the opposite. I couldn’t even recognise the area. Everything was levelled to the ground,” Suhair al-Absi, a 50-year-old mother of seven, said on reaching the Sheikh Radwan district on the north side ofGazaCity. “I couldn’t identify the remains of my house because the rubble of everyone’s homes is all mixed together. The destruction here is beyond imagination, something the mind cannot grasp.”The family had clung to their home until the last minute as the Israeli army pressed forward through Gaza City in September, supposedly to crush any vestiges of Hamas. “We left when the tanks reached the entrance to our neighborhood. We could see them from the window,” Absi said.View image in fullscreenThe ruins of Jabaliya, a district that developed from a refugee camp.Photograph: Amjed TanteshIt was not only tanks. The family saw one house after another being blown up by “robots” – repurposed armoured vehicles steered by remote control and packed with explosives, which the Israel Defense Forces have been using to minimise their casualties as they work their way through urban areas.Absi said: “We kept moving from one area to another in northern Gaza. But because the shelling was intensifying every hour, and with the ground invasion, we could no longer endure it. In the last week of the war, we fled to the southern part of the strip to protect my family.“We came back to check on the area and found the houses completely destroyed. The moment I saw the rubble of my house, I sat down and cried with my children beside me. All our memories were gone, memories I had collected over 40 years, both happy and sad ones, memories of my children and our best moments together.“The house cannot be repaired at all. It’s completely destroyed. Not a single concrete column remains intact. Even the stones are shattered into small pieces. What shocked me was the scale of destruction across the entire neighbourhood. I had never seen anything like it before. It felt as if a nuclear bomb had hit this place.”A young boy with a hoe and older man amid sand and rubbleA family clears the ground near their ruined home in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhoodAcross Sheikh Radwan, some families had improvised shelters in shattered homes, rigging up walls by hanging fabric and blankets between the few surviving concrete columns. In a house where there was just one pillar left, a family sat in its shade for some relief from the afternoon sun.Sitting atop the rubble of their homes, the returnees at least had some sense of reassurance from their memories, a feeling of belonging.“I will live in the same destroyed area where I grew up. A person can only feel safe and at peace in the place they belong to,” Absi said. “We will set up a tent here in the street over the rubble. There is no other option left. All the houses are destroyed, and we can’t live in the south because we have no relatives there to stay with.“Rebuilding our house will take my entire lifetime, and I might die before seeing it complete. What occupies my mind now is how we will continue our lives and start over. I think a lot about my children’s future. There is no clear future in Gaza now. It’s just a pile of rubble.”An excavator clears rubbleAn excavator clears rubble from Gaza’s streetsIn the Shuja’iya district, to the south of Gaza City, Susan al-Shayah experienced a similar sense of disorientation on her family’s return.“At first, I also could not pinpoint the exact location of the house, as the rubble was jumbled together and the streets were completely destroyed,” she said. “The shock was so immense, I did not have the strength to dig through the remains for any keepsake from the house, so I could not rescue a single memory from beneath the rubble.”The family spent four days looking for a place to pitch their tent, Shayah said, adding: “For now, we only want to rest, focus on the present we are living in and find a place to live, as there is no time to plan for an uncertain future. I still fear the return of war, as Israel always breaks its agreements, but I pray to God that security and peace will continue, and that war will never return.”View image in fullscreenA man sorts through rubble in a street in Sheikh Radwan.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe family’s plan was to set up camp in the remains of a nearby school, where there was a limited water supply. Water is scarce in the north.The Absi family had not been able to find any in Sheikh Radwan, where the reservoir had become polluted by shattered sewage pipes.The UN said the pumping station was badly damaged and its repair depended on getting components through the crossings into Gaza. That access has been patchy over the first week of the ceasefire. The north Gaza desalination plant was destroyed by Israeli bombing over the summer and could take months to restore.In Jabaliya, the district that grew from a refugee camp north of Gaza City, Hany Abed-Rabou came back to check on the four houses his family owned in the Joron neighbourhood. None were standing.Flattened buildings and rubbleDrone footage of destruction in Khan Younis“I won’t hide from you that I suffered a stroke and lost consciousness from the shock. To see four of your houses turned into piles of rubble is not easy to accept,” said the 60-year-old contractor in the construction industry.He has lost a grandson, killed inside a shelter, and a son, who went out one day to look for food for the family and never came back. He has scoured hospitals for his son’s body but has not been able to find any trace of him.Abed-Rabou’s plan now is to set up a tent for his surviving family over the ruins of one of his destroyed houses, but there is a shortage of supplies for building shelters.

In fact, he is thinking back toTrayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American student from Florida who was shot dead by a white Latinoneighbourhood watch volunteer in 2012.“The Martin case – the nightmare specter of a lynching screaming across the void of history – ruined the mood of a nation that had, just a few years earlier, elected its first black president, and in a dizzying moment of self-congratulation, began to ponder on editorial pages whether the nation was now ‘post-racial’,” Cobb writes in the introduction to his bookThree or More Is a Riot: Notes on How We Got Here: 2012-2025.Many of the essays in the collection were written contemporaneously, affording them the irony – sometimes bitter irony – of distance. Together they form a portrait of an era bookended by the killing of Martin and the return to power of Donald Trump, with frontline reporting from Ferguson and Minneapolis along the way. They make a compelling argument that everything is connected and nothing is inevitable about racial justice or democracy.As Cobb chronicles across 437 pages, the 2013 acquittal of Martin’s killer, George Zimmerman, became a catalyst for conversations about racial profiling, gun laws and systemic racism, helping to inspire the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement.Three years later,Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white supremacist, attended a Bible study session at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, then opened fire and killed nine Black parishioners. Cobb notes that Roof told police he had been “radicalised” by the aftermath of Martin’s killing and wanted to start a “race war”.View image in fullscreenJelani Cobb’s Three or More Is a Riot.Photograph: One WorldSpeaking by phone from his office at Columbia, Cobb, 56, says: “It was a very upside-down version of the facts because he looked on Martin’s death and somehow took the reaction to it as a threat to white people and that was what set him on his path. Roof was this kind of precursor of the cause of white nationalism and white supremacy that becomes so prominent now.”Then, in the pandemic-racked summer of 2020, cameGeorge Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man murdered by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes as Floyd said, “I can’t breathe,” more than 20 times. Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets with demands to end police brutality, invest in Black communities and address systemic racism across various institutions.Cobb, an author, historian and staff writer at the New Yorker magazine, continues: “It was the high tide. A lot of the organising, a lot of the kinds of thinking, the perspective and the work and the cultural kinds of representations – these things had begun eight years earlier with Trayvon Martin’s death.“This was an excruciating, nearly nine-minute-long video of a person’s life being extinguished and it happened at a time when people had nothing to do but watch it. They weren’t able to go to work because people were in lockdown. All of those things made his death resonate in a way that it might not have otherwise. There had been egregious instances of Black people being killed prior to that and they hadn’t generated that kind of societal response.”Cities such as Minneapolis, Seattle and Los Angeles reallocated portions of police budgets to community programmes; companies committed millions of dollars to racial-equity initiatives; for a time, discussions of systemic racism entered mainstream discourse. But not for the first time in US history, progress – or at least the perception of it – sowed the seeds of backlash.“It also was a signal for people who are on the opposite side of this to start pushing in the opposite direction and that happened incredibly swiftly and with incredible consequences to such an extent that we are now in a more reactionary place than we were when George Floyd died in the first place,” Cobb says.No one better embodies that reactionary spirit thanDonald Trump, who rose to political prominence pushing conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birthplace and demonising immigrants as criminals and rapists. His second term has included a cabinet dominated by white people and a purge of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.Trump lost the presidential election a few months after Floyd died but returned to power last year, defeating a Black and south Asian challenger in Kamala Harris.According to Pew Research, Trump made important gains with Latino voters (51% Harris, 48% Trump) and won 15% of Black voters – up from 8% in 2020.What does Cobb make of the notion that class now outweighs race in electoral politics? “One of the things that they did brilliantly was that typically politics has worked on the basis of: ‘What will you do for me?’” Cobb says. “That’s retail politics. That’s what you expect.“The Trump campaign in 24 was much more contingent upon the question of: ‘What will you do to people who I don’t like?’ There were some Black men who thought their marginal position in society was a product of the advances that women made and that was something the Republican party said overtly, which is why I think their appeal was so masculinist.”Trump and his allies weaponised prejudice against transgender people to attract socially and religiously conservative voters, including demographics they would otherwise hold in “contempt”. “I also think that we tended to overlook the question of the extent to which Joe Biden simply handing the nomination to Kamala Harris turned off a part of the electorate,” Cobb says.He expresses frustration with the well-rehearsed argument that Democrats became too fixated on “woke” identity politics at the expense of economic populism: “They make it seem as if these groups created identity politics. Almost every group that’s in the Democratic fold was made into an identity group by the actions of people who were outside.“If you were talking about African Americans, Black politics was created by segregation. White people said that they were going to act in their interest in order to prevent African Americans from having access. Women, through the call of feminism, came to address the fact that they were excluded from politics because men wanted more power. You could go through every single group.”Yet it remains commonplace to talk about appealing to evangelical Christian voters or working-class non-college-educated voters, he says: “The presumption implicit in this is that all those people see the world in a particular way that is understandable or legible by their identity, and so there’s a one-sidedness to it. For the entirety of his political career, Trump has simply been a shrewd promulgator of white-identity politics.”That trend has become supercharged in Trump’s second term. He has amplified thegreat replacement theory, sought to purge diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and complained that museums over-emphasise slavery. His actions have built a permission structure for white nationalists who boast they now have a seat at the top table.Many observers have also expressed dismay at Trump’s concentration of executive power and the speed and scale of hisassault on democratic institutions. Cobb, however, is not surprised.“It’s about what I expected, honestly,” he says, “because throughout the course of the 2024 campaign, Trump mainly campaigned on the promises of what he was going to do to get back at people. They’re using the power of the state to pursue personal and ideological grievances, which is what autocracy does.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cobb has a more complex take, suggesting that the US’s claim to moral primacy, rooted in the idea of exceptionalism, is based on a false premise.‘Who has ever managed personal growth while constantly screaming to the world about how special and amazing they are?’Jelani CobbHe argues: “America has been autocratic previously. We just don’t think about it. It’s never been useful … to actually grapple with what America was, and America had no interest in grappling with these questions itself.Who has ever managed personal growth while constantly screaming to the world about how special and amazing they are?”Cobb’s book maps an arc of the moral universe that is crooked and uneven, pointing out that, between the end of reconstruction and 1965, 11 states in the southeffectively nullified the protectionsof the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments of the constitution, imposing Jim Crow laws, voter suppression and violence to disenfranchise Black citizens.“The constitution gave Black people the right to vote but, if you voted, you’d be killed and this was a known fact,” he says. “This went on for decade after decade after decade. You can call that a lot of things. You can’t call that democracy. It was a kind of racial autocracy that extended in lots of different directions.”He adds: “We should have been mindful that the country could always return to form in that way, that its commitment to democracy had been tenuous. That was why race has played such a central role in the dawning of this current autocratic moment. But it’s not the only dynamic.“Immigration, which is tied to race in some ways, is another dynamic. The advances that women have made, the increasing acceptance and tolerance of people in the LGBTQ communities – all those things, combined with an economic tenuousness, have made it possible to just catalyse this resurgence of autocracy in the country.”It is therefore hardly unexpected that business leaders and institutions would capitulate, as they have in the past, he says: “We might hope that they would react differently but it’s not a shock when they don’t. Go back to the McCarthy era. We see that in more instances than not, McCarthy and other similar kinds of red-baiting forces were able to exert their will on American institutions.”Cobb’s own employer has been caught in the maelstrom. In February, the Trump administration froze $400m in federal research grants and funding to Columbia, citing the university’s “failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment” during Gaza protests last year. Columbia has since announced it would comply with nearly all the administration’s demands and agreed to a $221m settlement, restoring most frozen funds but with ongoing oversight.Cobb does not have much to add, partly for confidentiality reasons, though he does comment: “In life, I have tended to not grade harshly for exams that people should never have been required to take in the first place.”He is unwavering, however, in his critique of Trump’s attack on the university sector: “What’s happening is people emulatingViktor Orbán[the leader of Hungary] to try to crush any independent centres of dissent and to utilise the full weight of the government to do it, and also to do it in hypocritical fashion.“The cover story was that Columbia and other universities were being punished for their failure to uproot antisemitism on their campuses. But it’s difficult to understand how you punish an institution for being too lenient about antisemitism and the punishment is that you take away its ability to do cancer research, or you defund its ability to do research on the best medical protocols for sick children or to work on heart disease and all the things that were being done with the money that was taken from the university.“In fact, what is being done is that we are criminalising the liberal or progressive ideas and centres that are tolerant of people having a diverse array of ideas or progressive ideas. The irony, of course, is that one of the things that happens in autocracy is the supreme amount of hypocrisy. They have an incredible tolerance for hypocrisy and so all these things are being done under the banner of protecting free speech.”That hypocrisy has been on extravagant display again in the aftermath of Kirk’s killing by a lone gunman on a university campus in Utah. Trump and his allies have been quick to blame the “radical left” and “domestic terrorists” andthreaten draconian actionagainst those who criticise Kirk or celebrate his demise. The response is only likely to deepen the US’s political polarisation and threat of further violence.Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah and a rare voice urging civil discourse, wondered whether this was the end of a dark chapter of US history – or the beginning. What does Cobb think? “There’s a strong possibility that it will get worse before it gets better,” he says frankly.“We’re at a point where we navigated the volatile moment of the 1950s, the 1960s, because we were able to build a social consensus around what we thought was decent and what we thought was right, and we’re now seeing that undone. Indecency has become a new hallmark.“But we should take some solace in the fact that people have done the thing that we need to do now previously. The situation we’re in I don’t think is impossible.”Explore more on these topicsColumbia UniversityUS constitution and civil libertiesRaceUS politicsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

My profile image had me looking up quizzically at a ragdoll kitten on my shoulder. That cat (once mistaken for a parrot by a bone-headed rightwing pundit) is no longer with me – but my other ragdoll, Priscilla, became a minor social media celebrity.In April 2021 I was eight months postopen heart surgery, seven months single, about to turn 50, and not about to die wondering. So, I hit Bumble. She didn’t fess up until later but the first woman to message me was one of my X followers – really, one of Priscilla’s. “Oh,” she said to herself, “it’s the man with the cat on Twitter.” And swiped right.The moment I knew: he was so open and vulnerable, even as a bloke’s blokeRead moreLisa and I went on our first date at the end of that month, a wine and tapas bar. She looked me up and down. This wasn’t love at first sight but I’d learned to be suspicious of that anyway. What I did know instantly was this was someone who knew what she wanted, didn’t waste time and didn’t suffer dills gladly.We made small talk over a bottle of wine and a bottomless bowl of olives. She was smart, engaging, beautiful and drily funny. She also brooked absolutely no nonsense. I started to wonder what I was bringing to the table, besides a cat whose fur was clinging to my clothes, a chequered relationship history and a tendency towards oversharing. (I’m doing it again.)Searching for common ground, I asked what made her laugh. “Well, apparently you,” she said, grinning. The tension broke.View image in fullscreen‘From the beginning, Lisa had shown deep wells of compassion and kindness beneath the reserve’A second date followed, then a third. We bonded slowly. First over things we hated, like Scott Morrison. Then the things we loved: the natural world, a well-constructed sentence, the arts, walking. One day, we were driving, with Air’s album Moon Safari softly humming in the background.You Make It Easysuddenly hit home:You make it easy – to watch the world with loveYou make it easy – to let the past be doneYou make it easy – so watch me fall in loveAnd I realised it was true. I was watchingmyselffall in love – not for the first time, of course, but in a new way. With Lisa, the life I’d made an art form of overcomplicating suddenly became straightforward.Details that had assumed outsized importance became trivial. She was different; she sawThe Whole of the Moon.It helped that both of us had come through health challenges. That demanded not only patience but a sense of proportion. My surgery had been more recent and I had not fully recovered. There was an existential dimension to it: I was very lucky to still be walking around. We seized our second shot at life.Still, we hastened slowly. We became captivated by abreeding pair of powerful owlsclose to home, meeting after work at dusk to watch discreetly over the course of six months as they raised a healthy chick. Birds, we found, were something we were both passionate about.In November 2021 we turned things up several notches, travelling to the remote Kutini-Payamu national park (formerly known as Iron Range) near Lockhart River in far north Queensland. It was stinking hot, with mind-bending humidity. Lisa was covered in welts from sandflies and mosquitoes.View image in fullscreenA rare photo of Lisa and Andrew’s cats – Tiger, Florence and Priscilla – in the same frame, not warring with one another.Photograph: Andrew StaffordYet she was unfazed. One morning we were squatting in the mangroves, being eaten alive by said insectswhile looking for a rather plain species called a fawn-breasted bowerbird, when the heavens opened upon us – and our camera gear. We ran as fast as our legs would carry us back to our vehicle, drenched to the bone, shrieking with laughter.Two months later theBrisbane floods of 2022led to our first trial by cohabitation. This meant Priscilla was prematurely introduced to Lisa’s cranky old tom, Tiger, and a skittish Bengal called Florence. We were fine – the cats, not so much. (I used to think that I just needed to meet a nice cat lady and all would be well – be careful what you wish for.)View image in fullscreenAndrew and Lisa at Lady Elliot Island in December 2023.Photograph: Judy LeitchWe made the move permanent 12 months later. Then my mother died, after two full decades living with Alzheimer’s disease. From the beginning Lisa had shown deep wells of compassion and kindness beneath the reserve. During a time of immense upheaval, I felt held and understood by her calm, steady presence.At a gathering a while ago, an older gentleman asked her how long we’d been together. It was just short of three years at the time; long enough, he suggested, for her to teach me some manners.“I didn’t have to teach him,” she replied. “His mother taught him that.” What Lisa taught me was that healthy boundaries could be safety rails.

It is set in the futuristic World State, whose citizens are scientifically engineered to fit into a hierarchy. Eugenics, psychotropic pharmaceuticals and classical conditioning are employed to maximise stability and happiness. Huxley’s novel does not describe a conventionally authoritarian system, but one in which the desire for freedom and dignity has simply been eliminated. The World State is a radical technocracy.It’s a satire on the consequences of importing scientific thinking into the realm of social policy. The Controllers of the World State preside over a society that has rationality and efficiency as its guiding principles, and when those principles conflict with human nature, it is human nature that is required to give way. Rather than building a society that engenders happy human beings, the Controllers seek to design human beings that can function in the society into which they are “hatched”.The idea that we would invert our relationship with the world in this way strikes us as sinister, as antithetical to what it means to be human.And yet something resembling this upside-down mindset is now emerging across the globe, particularly in the debate around climate change.From Europe to China, the technology that threatened to destroy the planet is held to be the one that will save it.Having built a system that is destructive of the environment that surrounds and sustains us, we are now proposing to change … the environment! In his dystopia Huxley imagined a society that only worked when the humans within it were made into something not quite human. Today, many scientists and engineers imagine a planet that has been similarly transformed: nature itself must yield to the system. We need a technologicalfix.Driving us towards this technological fix is the damage inflicted by existing technology.The powerful datacentres needed to provide artificial intelligence demand huge amounts of energy – a demand that will increase as the white-hot rivalry between the US and China becomes hotter still. And so it is hardly surprising to find the Silicon Valley faithful at the head of a campaign to revive and reinvent the nuclear power industry, or to find that this technology – the first in human history to reconstitute nature’s basic elements – has a kind of totemic power among those who would rely on technology to address the environmental crisis. The last two years have seen a huge recommitment to nuclear energy, with more than 120 energy and tech companies, 25 countries and 14 major financial institutions announcing their support for its expansion and development.From liberal Europe to communist China, the technology that threatened to destroy the planet is held to be the one that will save it.But ecomodernism is far more heterodox, and far more radical, than this “nuclear renaissance”.AI might be creating a ‘permanent underclass’ but it’s the makers of the tech bubble who are replaceable | Van BadhamRead moreTake geoengineering, for example: the proposal to manage planetary temperatures, either by reducing greenhouse gases by sucking them out of the atmosphere and burying them deep beneath the oceans, or by reflecting sunlight back towards space. One popular proposal involves pumping sulphates into the upper atmosphere to imitate the sun-dimming effects of a large volcanic eruption, reducing the amount of solar radiation getting trapped by the greenhouse gases, but not the gases themselves. (You know the situation is serious when your proof of concept is Krakatoa.) Again, the avatars of big tech have placed themselves at the head of these schemes. And again, they are moving ahead with such technologies whether we are happy about it or not, performing sulphate experiments in the skies above California (too late for the Palisades, alas) or fertilising the oceans with iron dust in order to kickstart algae blooms that draw down carbon from the atmosphere.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhat else can we look forward to, in this technologically managed future? As biotechnology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence converge into a technoscience of remarkable power, the answer to that question boggles the mind; but even now there are signs that the future could witness an unparalleled revolution in the relationship between human beings and the non-human world.And all this is before we’ve broached the issue of mining the moon, or even asteroids, for water and precious minerals.In all kinds of ways, then, we are on the precipice of a transformation – one that will reverse our relationship with the world in a way analogous to Huxley’s great satire. In the absence of any serious discussion about social and political transformation, we are doubling down on technological innovation. We are entering a Brave New Wild.The problem with the technofix mindset is that the very thinking that brought us to this juncture is now assumed to offer a path to safety. The environmental problems we face are deeply related to technology, and yet it is to technology that we turn for solutions. The cause is re-engineered as a cure.Many scientists reject this position as simplistic. They argue (not without some justice) that it is theirresponsibleuse of technology that is dangerous, and that the best way forward is to instil a new ethos of responsibility in our future endeavours. Technologies, they say, are “only tools” and have no moral content as such. I can use a hammer to drive in a nail or bludgeon my nextdoor neighbour to death. It is my actions that matter, not the hammer itself.This is the instrumental view of technology, and it is dominant in scientific circles and even in mainstream environmentalism. But it fundamentally misunderstands the nature of humanity’s relationship to technology. That relationship is inevitable: thereisnoHomo sapienswithout technology.Having evolved from tool-using hominids, humans depend upon technology in a way that no other species does. To take an instrumental view of that relationship, however, is simplistic and ultimately dangerous, as it underplays the shaping effect that powerful technologies have on human sensibilities. If all you have is that hammer, every problem becomes a nail.View image in fullscreenThe technofix is just as much a psychosocial phenomenon as a scientific and engineering challenge. We need to ask what kind of relationship we want with the planet we call home, as well as with the technologies through which we now propose to change it.This is not an argument against technological innovation. Any response to climate change and the environmental crisis more generally will have to make use of new technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, and more efficient batteries for energy storage. But in order to make the best use of these innovations, we will need to insist on the crucial difference between approaching such technological interventions as part of a broader project of change and merely thinking technologically – and technocratically – about the problem of climate change.We need to push back against the instrumentalist, techno-capitalist worldview and do so in a language that places humanity – what itis, what itneeds– at the centre of our thinking.This is an edited extract fromBrave New Wildby Richard King, out now (Monash University Publishing, A$32.99)Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)Biotechnology industryClimate crisisextractsShareReuse this content"

But, after becoming wealthy, Hamed brattishly turned against Ingle, cutting him out of the action, and turning him into a combination of John Falstaff and Broadway Danny Rose.Pierce Brosnanplays Ingle; Amir El-Masry is Hamed and Toby Stephens is bullish London promoter Frank Warren who saw the goldmine that Ingle had discovered.But the movie frankly lacks the Prince’s fancy footwork: the boxing sequences run smoothly but the all-important drama between them is repeatedly flat and one-note. There is no nuance or light and shade in the depiction of Hamed himself, and that otherwise outstanding performer El-Masry isn’t given the chance to show any subtlety or much of what might make his character really interesting – although he’s clearly been training and looks very plausible in the ring.The drama is repeatedly lumbered with functional, expositional dialogue which is there to tell you exactly what is going on and what we are supposed to be thinking (“You started your boxing journey at seven years old …”). It is the kind of dialogue that streaming-TV executives call “double-screen”, making sure you know what’s going on while you’re watching the film but also checking your phone. And the background music is overbearing, sometimes almost deafening, particularly in the scene in which Hamed gets overexcited at visiting Warren in his palatial home.Although El-Masry and Brosnan do their considerable best, their relationship never really comes to life, and the big set-piece boxing moments are often anticlimactically truncated. The most important is surely the moment when, goaded beyond endurance in the gym one day by Hamed as a delusional “old man”, Ingle actually offers to get in the ring and box him. Everyone in the gym is shocked and uneasy. How exactly is this insanely unwise standoff going to play out? How precisely is it going to end? Surely the Prince is going to kill him? Or will he sentimentally pull his punches? It’s not clear.That’s not to say that there aren’t some nice jabs. Brosnan gets laughs when Ingle tells a reporter what he’s teaching the kids from his local community: to reject prejudice and when you encounter a paedophile, “Punch him in the bollocks”. It’s funny too when Hamed squirms at the silly stunts Ingle makes him do in the early days: posing as the “beast from the Middle East”.As for the falling out, the film shows this as being worsened by a tell-all book that Ingle is supposed to have written (a plot point evidently modified fromNick Pitt’s book The Paddy and the Prince) and there is an interestingly imagined final conversation – although the emotional tribute that Hamed is supposed to have paid to Ingle after his death is merely mentioned in the closing credits, and not dramatised on screen. Some interesting material here, but the punches don’t land.Giant screened at theLondon film festivaland is in UK and Irish cinemas from 9 January.All our London film festival 2025 coverageExplore more on these topicsBiopicsBoxingPierce BrosnanLondon film festivalFestivalsLondon film festival 2025reviewsShareReuse this content"

And with budgets pinched, directors say they are strugglingShaad D'SouzaSat 18 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 13.44 EDTShareThe launch ofMTV, in 1981, ushered in a new era of music. Showing music videos 24 hours a day, the television channel redefined artist marketing and launched the careers of artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna, whose public personas became inseparable from the gripping, frequently controversial clips they produced to be played on the service.Now, that chapter of music history appears to be drawing to a close, with MTV’s parent company Paramount announcing last week that its five dedicated music channels in the UK – MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV and MTV Live – will cease broadcasting after 31 December. (The flagship MTV channel, which broadcasts reality programmes such as Catfish, The Hills and Geordie Shore, will remain in operation.)For some, it represents the end of an era. Others, such as the musicianHannah Diamond, suggest that era may have been over some time ago. “The last few years, MTV has sort of transformed [into] more of a nostalgic memory,” she says. “It hasn’t been part of the conversation for such a long time that it really doesn’t surprise me that they’re ending it.” As an independent artist, she says, YouTube has always been the primary platform for music video releases.The specific shuttering of the brand’s music platforms does call into question the position of the music video in today’s industry, and whether the form still provides a viable outlet for expression and promotion. Jennifer Byrne, head of development at Academy Films – the famed production company that launched the careers of film-makers such as Jonathan Glazer through their music video work – says that “labels aren’t as willing” to invest heavily in videos as they once were. “They’re trying to spend that money on so many more deliverables than there used to be,” she says, referring to the multiplicity of online video and social media platforms. “It used to just be one three-minute video. Now it’s: how do you reach all these different audiences and can you cut it in 10 different ways?”Music video for Romeo by PinkPantheress, directed by Iris Luz.Iris Luz, a London-based director who has made videos for British pop singers PinkPantheress and George Riley, says that budgets for videos are shrinking rapidly, even for seemingly simple clips. “The number of times I’ll come up with an idea that, to me, seems easy, and people are like: ‘No, that’s gonna be 50 billion pounds,’” she says. “I’m like, that’s funny, because it’s in one house with four people. I don’t know what’s going on.”Neither Luz nor Byrne believes that the end of MTV will significantly impact music videos overall. In Luz’s mind, videos now are less promotional tools than “vehicles for relatability and branding that makes [a viewer] want to buy into the artist,” she says. “They’re just a facet in the ecosystem of a musician. Because of TikTok and the rise of independent artists, people put out music as soon as they’re done with it. So a video is designed to convey that immediacy – where they’re at in one moment – rather than make a big splash like 15 years ago.”There are also still barriers to entry for smaller artists, says Diamond. “The music videos I have made have been made through sheer luck, grafting or multiple years of work put into one thing,” she says. “I’ve become a musician in an era where artists don’t get the budget to make a music video unless they are a really big artist with a big label behind them that thinks it’s going to be a worthwhile investment.”View image in fullscreen‘MTV hasn’t been part of the conversation for such a long time’ … musician Hannah DiamondDirectors are feeling the pinch too: Byrne says that where “back in the day, an artist would have been like, ‘I like what Glazer’s doing, I’m going to talk to him,’ now, you’re pitching [to an artist] against [maybe] 10 different directors, and that’s free labour on the director’s part, creating this amazing treatment.” Plus, she says, “no one makes money out of these videos. Production companies don’t – but we still do them because they’re really important and a vital part of a director finding their own voice.”Part of the problem, of course, is that content budgets now have to stretch across short-form video, too. Luz says that while TikTok videos can be “shot on a DSLR camera; a guy with a guitar and a dream, singing on a pub stool,” they can also be just as creative and innovative as traditional videos. “Content can be an added facet to the [musician’s] world,” she says, citing her work with the band Confidence Man, which she says is “on par with their shows and music videos because they have fun with it.”Despite everything, videos can still be a pipeline to feature directing, says Byrne: “If you look at [Everything Everywhere All at Once directors]The Daniels, they started off in the music video world, and then they won an Oscar,” she says. “Music videos still allow those unique personalities to shine through and take risks.”Last month,the Wall Street Journal reportedthat Paramount was looking at ways to revitalise the MTV brand, and Diamond says that, given how volatile and changeable the industry is, it’s hard to make any assumptions about the future of videos. “Who knew that vinyl was going to make such a massive comeback, you know?” she says. Luz agrees: “It’s like an album – albums are never gonna go away, and music videos are like punctuation for an album. They’re always going to exist.”Explore more on these topicsMusicMTVPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ange Postecoglou was not sacked in the morning. Instead he wassacked in the afternoon. So, another small win there for Ange, even in defeat. Not to mention further proof of the notion to which he has always seemed so fatally in thrall, that he is at any given moment the smartest guy in the room. Even when, as of Saturday afternoon, he’s no longer in the room at all.The official version seems to be that Postecoglou was fired 18 minutes after hisfinal defeat at the City Ground.In reality he was fired in real time, a live-action televised touchline sacking, gone from the moment Evangelos Marinakis disappeared from his seat midway through the second half with the look of a gamekeeper required now to wring the neck of a dying pheasant.Nottingham Forest approach Dyche and Mancini after Postecoglou sackedRead moreWatching Postecoglou delay the moment after the final whistle, out there looking hollow-eyed in front of the near-empty stands, it felt entirely apt that the final image of a manager who projected himself always as a wised-up straight shooter should instead be a moment of touching naivety.No Ange, don’t wander over there. Don’t let yourself to be framed all alone beneath the words “Trent End”, a photographer’s dream, and the perfect shot of a man who always gave the impression of being able to see it all. Apart, that is, from all the things everyone else could see happening to him.This is not meant to be harsh on Postecoglou, who has been a successful coach for a very long time in various places around the world. Those who know him say he is a genuinely nice man, that it is just awkwardness that makes him conduct his press conferences in the manner of a longsuffering vice cop forced against his will to address a room full of convicted perverts, that makes him condescending in public, often to young journalists.But it is also true that Ange to Forest was always a terrible appointment. Mainly because it involved getting rid of a successful, popular and settled predecessor, bookended now by a sacking at the end of an international break.Not all mistakes have to be fatal. Postecoglou made this one into a disaster by never at any stage seeming to understand the assignment.View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou won 13 of his last 50 Premier League matches.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoThere was always something odd about the suggestion he kicked things off by saying, in effect: “Give me time and we can rebuild this project.” Forest were coming off a brilliant season. The current one had already started. Why make the job into a rebuild? Naivety, perhaps. The fatal inflexibility of the systems man. Or just not being very good at the job, paddling out of your depth at this most brutally unforgiving level.In this sense Postecoglou’s sacking seems like a double departure. He has now been fired twice in four months. Is there a league rule similar to the loan regulations that state you can’t be sacked by three clubs in a year? Sadly for Postecoglou this is unlikely to be an issue.He won’t be back here now, not without serious remedial work. And not just because of a record that reads lost 31 and won 13 of his last 50 Premier League games. There is an interesting point of order here.Postecoglou did win the Europa League.Although, some real talk: Spurs had the largest budget in the competition alongside Manchester United. The default option was winning it. The job there was in a sense not to get in the way.Outside that glorious high, Postecoglou has a fair claim, at least in those final 50 games, on the title of least effective Premier League manager ever. Yes, there have been worse win ratios than his 26% (context: 10% below Ruben Amorim). But not in charge of players of this quality. It is even incorrect to say Ange went down firing shots, that he never abandoned his principles. He often tried to play differently. It didn’t work. His teams became not just unsuccessful, but run-of-the-mill unsuccessful. By the end, the most entertaining element was his own apparently unshakable conviction that this was all somehow someone else’s fault, that he, Ange, stood alone on the heath surrounded by fools.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What was your favourite Ange episode? How about saying it’s not all about set pieces, don’t be so ridiculous, mate, before losing your next match to a set piece? How about taking the lead in five consecutive games and losing all of them? Maybe it’s the obvious one, going toNottingham Forestand outdoing Brian Clough at Leeds by taking 40 not 44 days to get the sack, like Johnson in Peep Show being so good at his 30-minute office tai chi routine that he can do it in 10.There are also poignant lessons from Ange in England. The dealings with the media may be irrelevant, but they gave a glimpse into the source of his wider struggles, not least the need to accept that, even with a track record of success elsewhere, there may actually be things to learn still, and that this place will swarm all over any weakness, however minor.Gone in 18 minutes: Postecoglou’s rapid exit leaves Marinakis rebuild in peril | Ben FisherRead moreIt always seemed deeply naive to snort and snark and deconstruct the questions he was being asked. A note to Ange. Everyone else also knows press conferences are mundane. Often those asking the questions are just being polite, giving you some soft-ball as opposed to, say, asking you why your record is so appalling.Forest will surely survive from here. Marinakis will hire a Dyche or similar. The players are good enough, the legacy of the last manager but one still strong.As for Ange, he has been fun, hard-working and gracious to opponents in defeat or victory, at least in so far as it is possible to remember that far back.In the end it was the Premier League itself that did a number on Postecoglou, both in its relentlessness and the excellence of those he was matched against. This thing will stretch you thin, will contort you into impossible shapes. If, by the end, even his struggles had become just meat in the grinder, another strand of public entertainment, this is in its own way testament to the strength, purity, and basic viciousness of the product.Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouNottingham ForestAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Even if that legend has lingered too long, even if he has stayed beyond the scope of his powers, coming next is an almost impossible job. David Moyes could not follow Sir Alex Ferguson. Unai Emery could not follow Arsène Wenger. Brian Clough could not follow Don Revie.When there has been a successful transition it has tended to come from within. George Allison continued Herbert Chapman’s work at Arsenal. Dave Mackay took the Derby Clough had built to another league title.Mohamed Salah in need of centre stage return for Anfield’s grand show | Andy HunterRead moreBut there are no guarantees, as Wilf McGuinness discovered trying to follow Matt Busby at Manchester United.Liverpooldid it best, the Boot Room tradition stretching all the way from Bill Shankly through Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan to Kenny Dalglish.Modern football makes such continuity extremely difficult and, unless Liverpool had decided Pep Lijnders was the man – and given his stint at Red Bull Salzburg, no one is suggesting he was – there was no obvious internal candidate to step in when Jürgen Klopp departed.How, then, could a measure of continuity be achieved? By barely changing the squad at all. The only arrival in the summer of 2024 was Federico Chiesa, who ended up playing only 108 minutes of Premier League football. (The world was very different in 1974, with transfers less frequent and no window closing at the end of August but it’s notable that as Paisley replaced Shankly, Larry Lloyd was sold and Ray Kennedy signed in the summer, with Phil Neal and Terry McDermott arriving in the autumn; it wasn’t the half-dozen signings of modern windows but that represents significant new blood).View image in fullscreenTerry McDermott (left) and Ray Kennedy (also holding the Football League trophy) were bought in the months after Bob Paisley succeeded Bill Shankly at Liverpool in 1974, along with Phil Neal (behind the moustached Tommy Smith).Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockIt would be untrue – and unfair – to say thatArne Slotchanged nothing last year. There was a greater sense of control. They may have won only six games by three or more goals, but that does not mean they were fortunate; rather that is evidence of the way they played within themselves.Eight matches were won 2-0 and in most of those Liverpool in effect shut the game down having achieved a two-goal advantage. That served not only to take the risk out of the game but also to preserve energy, which may be a reason Liverpool were so relatively unafflicted by injuries.But even allowing for the way he got the best out of Ryan Gravenberch and coaxed another great season from Mohamed Salah, this was a minor evolution. Where Slot really impressed was in the way his half-time tweaks regularly improved performance, something that began on theopening weekend at Ipswichand carried on throughout the season. Slot may have been at the wheel, but it was still essentially a Klopp car he was driving.Parts, eventually, need replacing. Rivals are upgrading constantly. Development is essential; to stand still, as Peter Reid memorably put it, is to move backwards. There had to be change, and it came this summer. It’s not clear Liverpool specifically planned it this way, but the protocol is sensible. Let the new manager settle, assess his capacities, allow him to build political capital before he starts affecting major change. Debate now focuses on the effectiveness of the revolution rather than on the new manager.Which is how Liverpool are in the position they are, undergoing major transition in Slot’s second season. In part the scale of that has been conditioned by the death of Diogo Jota, whose loss, inevitably, continues to affect players. But significant changes would have been necessary anyway. There was some scepticism last season when Jamie Carragher suggested Liverpool needed half a dozen new players, but they did bring in six as well as the 18-year-old central defender Giovanni Leoni, who would probably have been involved had he not torn an anterior cruciate ligament.Modern football being what it is, there has been scepticism about the scale of the challenge facing Liverpool this season: is this really a transitional season? To which the only answer is, yes, clearly. Arsenal, it’s true, have added seven senior players but, while Viktor Gyökeres answered a longstanding need for a centre-forward and Eberechi Eze is an obvious upgrade on the left, the function of most of the arrivals has been to strength the squad.Arsenal’s style remains essentially the same as it was last season. Players have been bought to fit into a pre-existing system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The template is no longer 4-3-3, even if the 4-2-3-1 of the opening weeks of the season has been, perhaps temporarily, abandoned. The obvious conundrum is Florian Wirtz, who has produced stats so contradictory that it’s possible to make almost any argument about his start to life in the Premier League.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Arne Slot (right) and Mohamed Salah, who is struggling under his manager’s tactical tinkering.Photograph: Murad Sezer/ReutersAlthough he is yet to register either a goal or an assist, he stands alongside Jack Grealish at the top of the list of chances created. He has been neither brilliant nor terrible, and is perhaps still adjusting to the intensity of the Premier League. But more significantly, although he has spent some time on the left this season, it seems almost certain Wirtz was bought to play through the middle, behind a central striker.It’s hard to understand how that could work with the wide forwards Liverpool have at present, at least without a much more defensive back six, and the development of the sort of “broken team” that was common in Serie A in the 90s, which would seem to go against the entire recent evolution of the sport toward universality.That perhaps glances ahead to a future withoutMohamed Salah– and it’s telling Liverpool have been linked with the far more dynamic Antoine Semenyo – but may also indicate further change to come. With Feyenoord, Slot opted to play a 4-2-3-1, but his wide forwards – players such as Yankuba Minteh, Igor Paixão and Luka Ivanusec – were far more dynamic than Salah currently is, so the formation could appear more of a 4-4-1-1.A change like that will take time and probably another window or two of significant activity. It may be necessary but it is a gamble; it is at least, though, one that Slot is making as a Premier League champion rather than a new arrival.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolInside footballArne SlotMohamed SalahFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

Enough to see off Fulham, enough to avoid a row over a questionable refereeing decision and enough for Mikel Arteta’s side to increase the pressure on Liverpool before the champions look to move past their slump when they host Manchester United on Sunday afternoon.It never came close to capturing the imagination. There was the inevitable corner to decide a drab contest, Leandro Trossard popping up with an opportunistic goal just before the hour, but there was nothing memorable from Arsenal in open play. They created few openings and for all his graft there was concern about another blunt outing for Viktor Gyökeres, who returned from a troubled international break with Sweden and saw his goalless streak for club and country run into a ninth game.Manchester City’s unstoppable Erling Haaland downs Everton with doubleRead morePatience is required with Gyökeres. Arsenal could do with the big Swede’s goals making these games more comfortable but there were encouraging flashes from the former Sporting Lisbon forward. Gyökeres ran hard and there were moments when he made chances for himself with his burly hold-up play. “We were all begging for him to score,” Arteta said. “The work rate he puts in for the team is phenomenal.”The focus was on the collective as Arsenal tightened their grip on first place by moving three points clear of Manchester City and four ahead of Liverpool. The one worry, perhaps, is the analysis being coloured by the result. After all, the performance was not so different to ones that led to costly dropped points last season; then again, Arteta is entitled to point out that grinding out wins is a vital quality for any team with aspirations of winning the league.Arsenal are not a soft touch any more. They have only conceded three times in the league and have kept five clean sheets from eight games. How to break them down? Riccardo Calafiori and Jurriën Timber are unflinching full-backs while William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães give nothing away in the middle.Fulham, a neat, tidy and creative team, were not granted one shot on target. It was David Raya’s second consecutive game without having to make a save.The questions for Arteta about winning ugly were intended as compliments. Arsenal’s manager smiled and remembered his side dropping points on their previous two trips to Fulham. “The recent history wasn’t in our favour and we wanted to change that,” Arteta said. “That’s another step – having that mindset to win against difficult opposition.”View image in fullscreenLeandro Trossard applies the finishing touch after Gabriel’s near-post flick.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThere were initial complications for Arsenal to sort out. Fulham were combative, even with a host of key players missing, and they created the better chances during the opening exchanges. Raúl Jiménez and Harry Wilson both went close during a positive start from Marco Silva’s side.Arsenal responded through Calafiori, who was a shade offside when he took Trossard’s layoff and battered a shot into the top corner, but the early flow was lacking. A lot of the play was in front of Fulham. Declan Rice and Martín Zubimendi both looked jaded in midfield after their respective exertions for England and Spain.Much has been made of Arsenal’s deep squad, of how Arteta has sought to ensure injuries need not kill his team’s title challenge, but what if the wrong player drops out? The absence of Martin Ødegaard, out for six weeks with a knee injury, is a blow. The captain’s ability to take the ball and keep finding angles is a piercing weapon against deep defences. Eberechi Eze is a different kind of No 10. He is more accustomed to breaking into space but with Sander Berge sitting in front of Fulham’s back four it was not easy for Eze.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zubimendi, Ødegaard’s replacement, slapped his thighs in annoyance after fluffing a simple ball. Bukayo Saka wriggled in from the right but was tracked carefully by Ryan Sessegnon and Alex Iwobi.Short of ingenuity, Arsenal upped the pace of their passing, pressing and movement. Saka made a chance for Gyökeres but Bernd Leno saved well. Calafiori shot over. Fulham’s task grew harder when they were forced into a defensive alteration, Issa Diop replacing the injured Joachim Andersen.The pressure from Arsenal was more persistent than imaginative. They worked the same patterns over and over, repeatedly directing attacks down Saka’s flank, but the goal came from a familiar source. Saka delivered a corner, Gabriel flicked the ball on and Trossard volleyed in from close range.It was all very minimalistic. Arsenal pressed for a second. Leno denied Saka. The Arsenal winger then thought he had a penalty after being challenged by Kevin, the Fulham substitute. Anthony Taylor, though, was persuaded to overturn his decision when he viewed the pitchside monitor and concluded that Kevin had brushed the ball at the same time as bumping knees with Saka.Arsenal’s advantage remained slender, Gyökeres missing a couple of chances. However, any notion that the game was in the balance was an illusion. Arsenal were too solid for an equaliser ever to be a realistic prospect.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

However the day was marked by yet another incident between the two world championship contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, with the latter crashing into Norris on the opening lap of the sprint race taking them both out and leaving McLaren with a headache as to how they manage their drivers.Verstappen had been all but untouchable throughout qualifying, his lead over Norris in second place was a full three-tenths, an age on this track. However in what is an increasingly tense title fight Piastri’s difficult weekend continued as he managed only sixth on the grid. Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton took third and fifth for Ferrari, with Mercedes’ George Russell in fourth.US Grand Prix qualifying: Verstappen wins F1 pole ahead of Norris – liveRead moreThe real drama, certainly forMcLaren, had already taken place to devastating effect. On the first corner of the sprint, which was won by Verstappen, with Norris starting in second and Piastri in third, the Australian looked to cut back inside his teammate but in doing so was struck by the Sauber of Nico Hülkenberg. The impact speared him into Norris at speed, lifted Piastri’s car into the air and entirely sheared off one of Norris’s wheels, damage that ended both their races.It was the worst possible scenario for McLaren on a weekend when the team wanted nothing more than a clean meeting to calm the atmosphere that has begun to surround their drivers, with Piastri leading Norris by 22 points in the world championship, as they strive to manage their title fight as fairly as possible.The incident occurs only a week after Norris was told there would be “consequences” for his move in Singapore where he attempted to pass Piastri and in so doing clipped Verstappen and was skewed into the side of his teammate. Both continued but Norris was held to have been in the wrong.This far worse incident in Austin leaves McLaren once more having to address their complex management of their men. Certainly if Norris was at fault for going for a gap in Singapore, Piastri was equally to blame for cutting back at the notoriously crowded turn one in Austin, where the chances of there being more than one car inside him through the apex was very high.View image in fullscreenThe McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri after the sprint race collision.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesThe team principal, Andrea Stella, cited a “lack of prudence” on Hülkenberg ’s behalf but his real issue is how they once more try to balance the increasingly complex scales they are now employing to ensure both drivers are treated equally. The issue has refused to go away and the team’s repeated efforts to be scrupulously fair in intervening has created a torturous set of precedents from which they can no longer simply retreat.“We have lost eight points with both drivers, we just look forward to some normal racing,” Stella noted with a hint of exasperation.The team did well to repair both their cars for qualifying but without having quite the time to prepare as they would like. Norris nonetheless must consider this a good chance to make points back on his teammate but both drivers will be more than aware that neither could come even close to an imperious Verstappen.“Just don’t get hit is my plan for tomorrow,” said Norris after the travails of the sprint. “Hoping for a good race with Max, we’ve had some good ones in the past, so I’m looking forward to it again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have now shown form across a range of circuits and conditions, with the team’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko pronouncing “we are there” of the car earlier this week. Certainly they look in position to compete for wins now at every track and Verstappen demonstrated that emphatically in Austin.After the victory in the sprint he is now 55 points off Piastri and what had once appeared to be an insurmountable gap is suddenly looking to be a genuine target for the Dutchman. Before the summer break he was 97 points adrift but two wins and two second places since have given him a sniff of a chance which will have cause to focus the mind at McLaren, who have acknowledged their rivals are very much up to speed.On the first hot runs in Q3 Piastri, who did not really settle into a good single lap, opened with a marker but was swiftly eclipsed by Russell. Norris and Verstappen followed and the Dutchman was immediately quick in the first two sectors, before he claimed provisional pole by almost a full four-tenths from Norris.It was a huge gap to make up in the final laps but Verstappen had waited again to go out last and could not make the line to begin his last lap before the clock counted down. Yet for all that Red Bull had cut it too fine he had done enough. Norris went hard but could not match him, still three-tenths off the world champion’s time of 1min 32.510sec.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenRed BullLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

After Spencer had edged out Lazzat by a neck, however, there was only the rustling of racecards as punters checked the winner’s identity and searched for anything in Powerful Glory’s form that might have hinted at such an unexpected success.Richard Fahey’s colt had beaten only one rival in two starts earlier in the season, finishing eighth of nine on his three-year-old debut, admittedly in a Group Two contest, before trailing in last of five in a conditions race at Beverley in September. But he was unbeaten in two starts as a juvenile and Fahey insisted afterwards that, shocking though it was for the punters, Saturday’s race had been “the plan all year, genuinely”.Fahey added that his colt “genuinely had excuses for his two starts this year and we’ve seen the real Powerful Glory today”. While Spencer said afterwards that he had been reminded of his 80-1 success on Khaadem in the Jubilee Stakes here in June 2023 as he studied the form on Saturday morning.“I thought when I saw the horse was 80-1 this morning, well, Khaadem was 80-1, so you never know,” Spencer said. “But not in your wildest dreams are you expecting to win after finishing last in a five-runner conditions race.View image in fullscreenJason Watson rides 100-1 shot Cicero’s Gift to success in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot.Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images“Powerful Glory is a good horse and travelled nicely. I thought I was going to be placed, and all of a sudden I thought: ‘I actually have a chance’. It is a different set of emotions as the race progressed, I am just glad that it worked out.”Powerful Glory did not go entirely unbacked and Ladbrokes reported taking 400 bets on the winner either online or in betting shops, including a £50 each-way stake that returned £12,000. But his win set the tone for an unprecedented afternoon which saw two Group One winners at a three-figure starting price, as Charlie Hills’s Cicero’s Gift registered a similarly shocking success in the QEII.“I am speechless,” Hills, who lost his father, the legendary trainer Barry, in June, said afterwards. “It has been a really tough year for us at home, but we are a tight family and we’ve stuck strong. The old man would be looking down and would be so chuffed,.”Given all that had gone before, it is a wonder that anyone had any betting cash left as the field went to post for the Champion Stakes, the last of the day’s five Group One events, but punters who went in again on Calandagan, the 15-8 second-favourite, were rewarded with a decisive defeat of Ombudsman, the 13-8 favourite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They need to nowSat 18 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 08.35 EDTShareEngland find themselves in a curious position at the halfway point of their World Cup campaign as they prepare to face the hosts, India, on Sunday. They are unbeaten, sit third in the points table, and – partly because India have already lost twice – have a 98% chance of qualifying for the semi-finals. One more win would seal their progress to the knockouts.Yet their batting has been woeful. With the honourable exception of Nat Sciver-Brunt, England’s top seven have looked desperately lacking in the technique and temperament that is required on tricky batting tracks at Guwahati and Colombo. Without Sciver-Brunt’scentury against Sri Lanka, England’s total would have been a mere 136 and they would almost certainly have lost. On Wednesday they found themselves 78 for seven against Pakistan: they were saved from a historic maiden defeat against Fatima Sana’s team only bya well-timed delugethat forced an abandonment.Alyssa Healy hits another ton to power Australia into Women’s World Cup semi-finalsRead moreThe numbers speak to quite how poor England’s batting has been. Aside from Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight, no England batter makes it into the top 30 across all teams for this World Cup. The contributions of England’s Nos 5, 6 and 7 do not make for pretty reading: Sophia Dunkley has scores of 0, 18 and 11; Emma Lamb’s efforts have yielded 1, 13 and 4; while Alice Capsey has hit 20, 0 and 16.England’s strike rate is not only below that of Australia and India, but also of New Zealand and South Africa, and their boundary percentage is only 8% – by contrast, Australia’s is up at 14%. In a tournament where the trend has been for teams to ramp up their scoring rate in the final 10 overs, England’s death-overs run rate is only 6.5 – Sri Lanka’s is 8.4. By any metric, England are struggling to compete.Of late there has been a tendency to blame everything on England’s poor fielding, but that hasn’t been an issue at this World Cup. Yet their deep-seated problems with the bat have been overlooked. The legacy of the former head coach Jon Lewis continues to cast a long shadow over this team. Players such as the 21-year-old Capsey lost two years of crucial development at the hands of “Jon-ball” – a philosophy that dictated she should attack every ball in sight with no thought to playing it on its actual merits.View image in fullscreenAlice Capsey spent the formative years of her England career under the ultra-attacking philosophy of the former coach Jon Lewis.Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesLewis’s successor, Charlotte Edwards, has had only six months to try to reverse the damage – but, as this World Cup demonstrates, hers will be a long-term project. Her players are no longer playing Jon-ball – they’ve been told, firmly, to put those ideas in the bin where they belong – but they are now caught in two minds about what should replace it. Do I go forward or back? Do I defend or attack? That liminal space in the middle enables the opposition to march through and take wickets.Will England make dramatic changes against India? The short answer is no. The longer answer is that they can’t, because Edwards selected a World Cup squad stacked with bowlers. The only back-up batter is Danni Wyatt‑Hodge, who might well join the XI on Sunday.Edwards also has the option of rejigging the batting order, which instinctively feels misaligned. Requiring Lamb, who has opened for years for Lancashire, to adopt a new role at No 6is unfair. There is a strong case for her to open against India in place of Jones. Similarly, Capsey might well do better if trusted to bat in her natural position at No 3 – Knight has enough experience to adjust to slotting in lower down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there is such a thing as Edwards-ball, this is the closest to a description of it.The matches against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan were meant to be England’s “easy” games. They’ve been anything but. Now, with matches against India, Australia and New Zealand looming large, rain is unlikely to save England a second time.

On a cool Christchurch evening their batters had been surprised by movement off the seam – “You don’t expect that in white-ball cricket, so when it does do a little bit it’s almost a shock,” saidHarry Brook– and becalmed by the spin of Mitchell Santner and Michael Bracewell. They duly wobbled their way to 81 for five before Sam Curran seemed to rescue them and then the weather definitively did.Only two batters scored more than 20, with the dismissal of Jos Buttler for 29, the former captain becoming the fifth man to fall, concluding a feeble start to the innings before Curran’s 49 improved their outlook.Unbeaten England eye place in semis but results have masked woeful batting | Raf NicholsonRead more“He’s a very valuable player to us now with bat, ball and in the field,” said Brook. “For him to get us out of a bit of a hole and up to a respectable total was awesome. He’s a valuable player to have in the middle order, a left-hander as well – he’s going to be around for a while.”Before play, Brook had been presented with a commemorative cap – almost identical to his non-commemorative one – to mark his 50th appearance in this format, the white-ball captain becoming the 14th Englishman to reach the mark. But the one on his headwear was the only peak in his evening, which went on to feature a lost coin toss and an unfortunate dismissal, bowled off his pads just as he clicked into gear after an awkward start.What luck England had was greedily hoovered up by Curran, the beneficiary of three extraordinary let-offs. He was on 14 when he skied a Jacob Duffy delivery high into the sky, from which rain had, handily, just started to fall. The ball duly slipped through the bowler’s fingers.View image in fullscreenThe rain did not go away in Christchurch as England’s first T20 in New Zealand was abandoned.Photograph: Joe Allison/Getty ImagesA 10-minute rain delay and seven deliveries later Curran, now on 26, lifted the ball towards point, where Tim Robinson did not have to move his feet, but still could not sort out his hands. In the next over Curran tried to paddle a Kyle Jamieson delivery that was too full for that sort of treatment, missed it completely and was pinned on the front pad.Quick GuideAfghanistan withdraw from T20 tri-series after Pakistan military strikesShowThe Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has withdrawn its national team from next month’s men's Twenty20 tri-series in Pakistan after it said three local cricketers were killed in Pakistan military strikes in Afghanistan's south-eastern Paktika province on Friday.The ACB says the cricketers were “targeted during a gathering” in Urgun district when they returned home after playing a friendly cricket match in Sharana, the capital of Paktika.Paktika officials say the players had been visiting a home at the time of the strike that killed 10 people. The tri-series, also featuring Sri Lanka, was due to be played in November in Rawalpindi and Lahore as part of the teams’ preparations for next year’s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.APWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was little doubt about where the ball was heading, and the on-field umpire certainly had none, but by this point Curran was the last recognised batter and England had reviews to burn. Having had one look at a replay the 27-year-old was halfway towards the dressing room, gloves off, when it was established that the ball had pitched outside leg stump and he was summoned back. He added another 19 runs off his last eight balls to carry England to 153 for six, at which point the rain returned to curtail the contest.Their failure to answer the questions posed by New Zealand’s bowlers does not mean England will be seeking any alternative solutions. “We didn’t get the start we wanted, but the message is going to be just double down,” said Brook. “There’s a reason why the team is laid out the way it is – because if we get into situations like that we always have someone who can get us out of the problem.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He took a breath. “In my opinion, the US is in a very similar position toGermanyin 1933-4,” he said. “And we have to ask, could 1936, 1937, 1938 have been avoided? That’s the point we are at. You can try to say fascism couldn’t happen in the US. But I think the jury’s out.”His words seemed especially resonant to me because I had just finished reading a remarkable novel precisely to do with Germany in 1933-4, a book written in the former year and published in the latter. Forgotten for decades, Sally Carson’s Bavaria-setCrooked Crosswas republished in April by Persephone Books, which specialises in reviving neglected works. Since then, it has been a surprise hit, a word-of-mouth jaw-dropper, passed from hand to hand.Crooked Cross begins in December 1932, and ends at midsummer the following year. The setting is the little, fictional Bavarian town of Kranach,a picture-postcard place in the foothills of the Alps. Its focus is the Kluger family – a modest, middle-class clan of kindly, loving parents and three grown-up children, Helmy, Lexa and Erich – who are gathering to celebrate Christmas with their cousins and Lexa’s fiance, Moritz. Everything is warm and delightful and full of promise: the tree with its glass baubles and candles, the tissue-wrapped presents, the carols, the roasted goose. Everything is gorgeously decorated, “even” – one reads with a shudder that is deepened by a 21st-century knowledge of where “it” was all headed – “Helmy’s picture of Hitler which stood on the piano”.View image in fullscreenSally Carson.Photograph: PersephoneCarson wrote two sequels to Crooked Cross. The entire trilogy was published by 1938.Then, in 1941, not yet 40, she died of cancer. Nicola Beauman, the founder of Persephone Books, happened upon mention of Carson’s work some years ago, in an academic book on female writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Crooked Cross was well reviewed in 1934, but made no great waves and soon sank without trace (though the Manchester Guardian’s founding women’s page editor, the great journalistMadeline Linford, chose it as abook of the year). My personal theory is that it was ahead of the curve, sounding its alarms about the direction Germany was going in before a British public was ready to hear it. It took some detective work by Persephone Books to discover who Carson actually was: born in Surrey in 1902 and raised by her widowed mother in Dorset, she worked as a publisher’s reader. She spent many holidays with friends in Bavaria, hence her deep knowledge of the region.One of the remarkable things about this book is its immediacy. It was written in the moment, and published quickly. The six-month period that it covers was one of momentous political change: Hitler became chancellor, the Nazis gained an effective majority in the Reichstag, Dachau was opened, and Jews were barred from public-service jobs. At the start of the novel, the characters greet each other with a cheeryGrüss Gott; by the end, Herr Kluger isheil Hitler-ingacquaintances in the street and the local church bells have been altered so that they chime with the notes of the Nazi anthem, the Horst Wessel song. Also by the end of this short six months, the loving, close circle of the Kluger family has fallen apart. The attentive reader will have noted, even within the first few pages, for example, that Lexa’s fiance Moritz Weissman, a good Roman Catholic emerging from Christmas mass, also happens to have a Jewish surname.Reading this novel, armed with the hindsight that Carson herself lacked, is a remarkable experience, at times painful. For us in 2025, everything she describes is rushing towards one inexorable conclusion: the war, the Holocaust. For her, these were nightmares yet undreamed of (although there is a grim passage in which the senior Klugers ask one of their Nazi-seduced sons: “Do youwantanother war?”). Though very different novels, its immediacy gives Crooked Cross the sort of urgent edge that reminds me of Ali Smith’s seasonal quartet, the first instalment of which, Autumn, was written and published at speed in the months after the Brexit vote of 2016.What is so impressive about Carson is, despite the fact she had no idea where Hitlerism would end, the novel has an unshakeable moral core. There is no equivocation. What is being done in Germany to Jews, to communists, is plainly horrific, according to the novel’s worldview. Carson wrote – already in 1933 – of the grim stories emerging from Dachau: “People had a way of suddenly disappearing, no trial, no explanation”; “prisoners were half-starved, bullied, inhumanly treated”.Not every outsider wrote of Hitler’s Germany like this at the time. A three-part New Yorkerprofile of Hitler, by Janet Flanner, published in 1936, is a tour de force in its way – full of details of the particular porridge favoured by the Führer, and where he got his suits (“He scrupulously chooses a second-rate tailor”). But, with its detached, ironic tone, with its closeup detail of Hitler’s habits without a long-range view of what he was actually doing to Germany, Flanner also provides a chilling example of a journalist failing to see the wood for the trees.Crooked Cross gets no closer to Hitler than that photograph on the piano. All the politics happen at a distance, in the background, and are understood only as their effects filter down to the Klugers and their little town. In fact in some ways it is a conventional middlebrow, domestic novel, somewhat earnest in tone. For me, earnestness is part of its virtue: it does not make the mistake of thinking nazism laughable, as British people often tended to do. Its focus on deeply ordinary people also makes it miles more insightful on nazism, its spread and its appeal, than Flanner’s Hitler profile. The Kluger family, like millions of families across Germany, is deeply marked by the great war, and shaped by economic collapse. The boys have never found meaningful work. Helmy is unemployed, and Erich has an unsatisfying job as a ski instructor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Time to closely regulate price-gouging gas plants or take ownership of supplySat 18 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 11.01 EDTShareEd Miliband may want his political legacy to bea transition to net zero, but he could find his eventual political epitaph includes words on how he helped bury UK industry under the weight of high electricity charges.Industrial ovens are being switched off and turbines spun for the last time as businesses add up the cost of powering their factories and decide it’s not worth the time and trouble.It would be harsh to blame the energy secretary for a crisis he inherited and a decline in manufacturing that has been going on for four decades. But the way the transition to renewables was managed under the Tories, and now under Miliband can only be described as a disaster that will see much of UK industry depart for an easier life elsewhere.The decline is not new. Each time a government has allowed the pound to rise in value – making exports more expensive – or ministers have opened the door to cheap imports, the number of UK factories has shrunk. On a graph the decline appears as a series of cliff edges, with manufacturing taking a step down each time the government’s protective spirit fails.Analysis published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)in May charted the more recent lurch downwards in output in the UK’s energy-intensive manufacturing industries. Output at the end of 2024 was at its lowest in 35 years.This large disparate group includes companies – most of them operating in international markets – that make paper, chemicals, plastic, processed food and all kinds of metal products.The ONS said: “Collectively, the volume of output in these industries has fallen by one-third since the start of 2021 and is now at its lowest level since the start of the available time series in 1990.”That is great for UK carbon emission figures, but terrible for the future of the country’s industrial base.A short-term solution would be to restore pandemic-related subsidies. Without bigger handouts to cover sky high electricity bills, factory owners, most of whom operate on thin profit margins, will need to put up their prices, and if that is not possible, cut production as they clearly have in recent years.Miliband could shell out if he had the money, but the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is feeling the pinch and prefers to subsidise other thingsMeanwhile, factory owners face further cost increases as they are asked to pay the extra bill for upgrading the country’s electricity grid through higher network charges. Worse, ascheme to protect the 500 most-intensive energy users from next yearwill be funded by all factories and businesses, making a bad situation worse for the vast majority.The UK is not alone in paying a heavy toll for travelling haphazardly along the road to net zero. Germany is going through the same pain barrier after a series of energy price increases since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.By some measures, German electricity prices are the highest in Europe, marginally ahead of those in the UK. Both countries charge industry more than four times the average electricity price in the US. To keep subsidies to a minimum, they need a long-term solution to be implemented now that will reduce costs over the longer term.The problem for Reeves is that, like so many areas of government, it means a large upfront cost.Still, that should not be an impediment. Miliband has already spentmore than £2bn this yearbalancing the electricity system as renewables produce too much in some places and periods, while shortfalls from green energy elsewhere (when the wind refuses to blow) mean expensive gas plants must fire up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Usually at huge cost.Miliband could adopt a plan put forward by the Stonehaven consultancy, backed by Greenpeace, which would more closely regulate price-gouging gas plants.“Gas provided just 30% of the UK’s total electricity generation last year, however gas-fired power stations set the wholesale price of electricity the vast majority of the time –97% in 2021– enabling them to extract ‘scarcity rents’ and push up energy bills,” said Greenpeace.Subsidies today and major investments, funded by the taxpayer, to bring down business electricity prices may seem like an unaffordable gift to factory owners. But that would be to misunderstand the way heavy industries operate.These companies are mobile and considered by other countries to be prized assets, often forming part of vital supply chains. While they can be loss-making when global prices fall, they support other manufacturing businesses and service industries that form the bedrock of an economy.TheUK’s modern industrial strategy, which was published in the summer, pays lip service to industry when action is needed.Miliband, and more importantly Reeves, seem paralysed by indecision. They need to adopt the Stonehaven report or better still, take ownership of the gas supply industry.Labourhas had 18 months to decide.

He is rabidlyanti-abortion, incrediblyanti-immigration, and obsequiously pro-Trump. Earlier this year, perhaps in a desperate bid to get Dear Leader to notice him, he introduced a bill, dubbed the “DON-ument Act”, which would make the wall on the US-Mexico border a national monument.In the great tradition of Republican congressmen from Florida (hello,Matt Gaetz!), it turns out Mills may also be a misogynistic creep. On Tuesday, a Florida judge granted aprotective orderagainst Mills at the request of his former girlfriend, Lindsey Langston, the reigning Miss United States. Langston, who is 19 years younger than 45-year-old Mills, told authorities she started a romantic relationship with the lawmaker in 2021, when Mills was still married but reportedly separated from his wife.According to Langston, after the breakup, Mills threatened to release nude images of her and harm any future boyfriends. The congressmanhas called the allegations “false”and hasn’t been charged with a crime, but, according to theNew York Times, the judge said he did not find Mills’ “testimony concerning the intimate videos to be truthful” and granted an order restricting Mills from going within 500 feet of his ex’s residence or referring to her on social media. The court found that Langston “has reasonable cause to believe she is in imminent danger of becoming the victim of another act of dating violence”.Langston reportedlyended their relationship in February. That month also saw news reports that Mills wasbeing investigated for an alleged assaulton a27-year-old womancalled Sarah Raviani. This wasn’t his wife, if you’re trying to keep track. Rather, according toWRC-TVin Washington, who obtained an earlier version of the police report, Raviani was his “significantother for over a year”. When the authorities turned up she had bruises on her arm and that same police report, according to USA Today, “states Mills instructed the victim to lie about how she obtained bruises on her arms”. Raviani toldthe Daytona Beach News-Journalher bruising was caused by a medical condition and Mills, who has denied wrongdoing, was not arrested orcharged with anything.Mills doesn’t just seem to have issues with these romantic partners; he seems to have quite a few problems meeting his financial obligations. Earlier this year the Republican was accused of failing to pay$85,000 in rent. His landlord tried to evict him after he failed to pay his monthly$20,833 rentbetween March and July. Most congressmen getpaid $174,000 a yearso I can understand why he struggled to pay an annual rent that was far higher than his salary. Mills, for his part,blamed an online payment problemfor the issue and said he ended up paying his back rent later. Theclaims against him were dismissed.Poor old Mills always seems to get blamed for problems that are absolutely not his fault. He is alsofacing an investigation by the House ethics committeeover allegations heheld contractswith the US government while in Congress, in relation to a weapons company hefounded a decade ago. So far, this investigation doesn’t seem to have had much impact on his career.We hear all the time about how the GOP is the party of law and order and family values. What, you might be wondering, do Mills’s colleagues have to say about all his run-ins with the law? Not much!“You have to ask Representative Mills about that,”saidMike Johnson, the House speaker, when asked about the allegations against Mills this week. “He’s been a faithful colleague here. I know his work on the Hill. I don’t know all the details … Let’s talk about things that are really serious.”Yes, let’s talk about things that arereallyserious, shall we? Because clearly being investigated for allegedly assaulting one girlfriend and then allegedly threatening torelease sexual videosof another girlfriend aren’t serious at all. Certainly nothing that might disqualify someone from being a politician in a country that is led by an adjudicated sexual predator.From Matt Gaetz to Mills toPete HegsethtoRoy Moore, the list of people in Trump’s orbit accused of sexual misconduct seems to grow by the day. And yet, funnily enough, a common theme among Republican men accused of sexual misconduct is that it’s trans people who are the real threat to women. “We must stop the lefts attack on women,” Mills wroteon X in 2022. “We must stand to protect women from biological males competing unfairly,” Millswrotein another X post. If Mills is what Republicans “protecting” women looks like, I think I’ll pass.Costa Rica’s president limits abortion to life-threatening casesFulfilling a promise he had previous given religious conservatives, President Rodrigo Chaves has limited abortion access to situations when themother’s life is in danger. Before running for president in 2022, Chaves worked at the World Bank, where he was accused of sexually harassing various women and was eventually sanctioned for misconduct. He has denied the allegations. Seems like he would fit in well with the Republican party.Virginia Giuffre on her abuse at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell“So many young women, myself included, have been criticised for returning to Epstein’s lair even after we knew what he wanted from us,” Giuffre writes in her posthumous memoir, an extract of which ispublished in the Guardian. “But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable. Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care … And then, he did his worst to them.”TikTok watches are desperate for a Crock-pot cauldronThere’s been a lot of toil and troublebrewing on WitchTokrecently, after Crock-Pot apparently reneged on its promise to make a slow cooker in the shape of a cauldron.

This much needed pause in hostilities is providing children with the chance to sleep without the fear of drones above their heads, airstrikes on nearby buildings or fires breaking out in their tents. Families in Gaza are slowly returning to their neighbourhoods and trying to salvage what they can of their lives from the rubble.But crucially, what they are still not currently getting is full and sustainableaccess to aid suppliesand vital services. This is about fundamental basic rights for children in the occupied Palestinian territory, which we have been demanding and advocating for since 1953.The humanitarian situation on the ground continues to be catastrophic.Childrenand babies are still struggling with malnutrition, we are seeing increased cases of diarrhoea, scabies and pneumonia in our health clinics. Until these basic needs are met, Palestinians cannot begin to think about rebuilding Gaza.Since the pause in hostilities began, we know some UN agencies and international organisations have been able to increase the entry of humanitarian supplies, but this has been nowhere near the scale that we need to deliver consistently for children. Save the Children supplies have been repeatedly denied entry intoGazasince early March. At the bare minimum, Gaza requires at least 600 aid trucks, 50 fuel tankers and cooking gas. Children need aid that matches their needs – and there should be no cap on truck deliveries. We have been rationing existing stock as a temporary solution. But we need immediate, long-term, unimpeded access to nutrition supplies, food, water, hygiene kits including soap, shampoo, laundry detergent and sanitary pads – along with fuel, cooking gas and other essential lifesaving items.We have seen first-hand what happens when aid isn’t consistently delivered. Nazek*, 30, who is a mother of four in Gaza, was pregnant with her youngest daughter during the first year of the war, and food was so scarce that she became malnourished. At seven months, her youngest daughter, Nour*, was diagnosed withsevere acute malnutrition. With support from Save the Children’s nutrition clinic, Nour has improved but remains fragile, often surviving only on supplementary therapeutic food known as Plumpy’nut. But what she needs is high-energy, nutrient-dense food items consistently, and for a prolonged period.With winter approaching, when temperatures can drop to five degrees, shelter, blankets, and warm clothing are also a priority. The scale of devastation in Gaza goes beyond anything we could have imagined – the United Nations relief and works agency (Unrwa) reported that 92% of homeshave been damaged or destroyed. The photos and videos do not convey the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families living in rubble and bombed out buildings that are certainly not equipped for colder temperatures.Save the Children is advocating for long-term unimpeded access to be granted as well as a permanent definitive ceasefire. Ways to deliver this are being explored – with Moazzam Malik, chief executive of Save the Children UK,recently callingfor an internationally mandated mechanism to deliver aid at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. International management on both sides of the border could enable the movement of supplies at pace, and with transparent oversight.We’ve got supplies ready to go in Egypt, including 10,000 hygiene kits that include soap, shampoo, laundry detergent, sanitary pads and lifesaving medical items, including shelter and winter kits, as well as multi-purpose cash assistance. When granted access, we will work with UN agencies to expand the essential services that we’re already running, particularly scaling up our nutrition support, including prevention, screening and treatment of malnutrition. Children do not only need basic humanitarian supplies, but a range of services.We also need to address the longer-term impacts that this two-year war has had on children, which goes beyond the immediate need for aid. In 2024, the UN concluded that the occupied Palestinian territory wasthe deadliest place on Earthto be a child.Children need specialised mental health support to overcome the traumatising impacts of unconscionable violence. In a child-friendly space run by Save the Children, one child wrote: “I wish I was in heaven where my mother is, in heaven there is love, there is food and water.” Children in Gaza are also now in their third year of missing out on school. The extended period without education significantly increases the risk of students never completing their studies. With full access into and across Gaza, aid agencies can reopen temporary learning spaces to provide activities for 700,000 school-age children.Gaza also has the highest number of child amputees per capita anywhere in the world. Back in January the ministry of health reported that 800 children have had either theirupper or lower limbs amputatedsince the war in Gaza started, while the use of explosive weapons in Gaza in 2024 led to an average of 15 children a day sustaining potentially lifelong disabilities. These children need long term specialist support.Against unimaginable odds, we have been working around the clock to respond to the human-made crisis in Gaza since the war began. We have provided lifesaving support and aid to 1.6 million people, over half of whom are children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m all for the one-and-done seriesPriya ElanFans who moan when a show is axed after its first season should be careful what they wish for. If only my TV obsession had ended a long time agoSat 18 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 12.49 EDTShareIt’s an all-too-familiar feeling. The second series of your favourite TV show has just begun streaming and your mind is full of hopeful expectation. Season one endedsoooperfectly: future plotlines were teased tantalisingly and a main character had – cliffhanger! – been offed (or had they?) In the months since the finale, you were perusing Reddit threads with other hardcores to find some Easter egg clues illuminating what would happen next.And then season two’s premiere is a damp squib. It feels like the entire writers’ room has been fired and replaced by artificial intelligence. Cut to the second episode, and your favourite cast member has done something that you and Reddit user Fishy2345 agree is totally out of character. By episode five, it’s clear that the showrunners have had collective amnesia around the storylines aggressively signposted in season one. And by the disappointing finale, you silently wish that the show had just been cancelled.Wishing for cancellation can only be retrospective; most fans protest when their favourite shows are canned before they can get off the ground. Take Kaos, a delightfully satirical take on Greek mythology featuring Jeff Goldblum,which was binned by Netflixdue to low viewing figures. But perhaps these fans will rest better with the knowledge that their enjoyment of the series won’t have been muddied by a sophomore slump.Looking back at the horror-mystery show Yellowjackets, I now wish it had been a limited series. Season one had acreatively abundant premise, and its 10 episodes were note-perfect. In 1996, a plane carrying an all-girl high school football team crashes in the middle of nowhere. Top-notch cast members (including Juliette Lewis, Lauren Ambrose and Sophie Thatcher) portrayed the team then and now. There were multiple award nominations, and the showrunners proudly announced there would befive seasonsto tell the story in necessary detail. But last week, it was announced that it would end withseason four. And as a fan, I let out a sigh of relief.View image in fullscreenGaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp in the forthcoming fifth season of Stranger Things.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe show has made narrative choices that have undermined its heart. Rather than leading with the girls’ return home and watching how they deal with their horrific new secrets, we were taken in directions that bloated the original premise. That included the show’s tiring habit of bringing in and focusing on new characters (such as Shauna’s two-dimensional daughter Callie) who did nothing for the broader story. It’s frustrating, and as a viewer, it is depressing to see your favourite show morph slowly into a hate-watch.But it’s not only Yellowjackets. Shows such as Emily in Paris, House of the Dragon, Squid Game and Stranger Things have lost the shock of the new, and fallen headfirst into expected or comfortable cliches. Sometimes shows need to quit when they are ahead.The thing is, there are joys to be had in a limited, “one-and-done” series. From Sharp Objects to I May Destroy You to Adolescence, TV creators know when to stop when the story has naturally reached an endpoint. But the game is over when shows such as Big Little Lies, originally a limited series, come back for more and more with diminishing returns. Hopefully, Adolescence’s producers have thought twice about thatrumoured season two.I wish Yellowjackets could have been a one-and-done series, living rent-free in our imaginations, cliffhangers and all. My favourite TV show of all time has played out like that. My So-Called Life, the perfect 90s teen dramedy, lasted for only one season but was cinematic in its scope: its characters were difficult and contradictory, the cinematography was perfectly autumnal, and the dialogue was untethered from the normal “teen speak written by a 35-year-old” trope. Its final episode was bitterly unresolved, but that is perfectly in keeping with the reality of never having real, definitive answers to the open-ended questions from your teenage years. After 18 perfect episodes (and one dodgy one), I was heartbroken and took to writing season two fan fiction myself to answer some of those questions. It might only live on an old hard drive, but it speaks to how deeply TV shows can chime with us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bureaucratic dysfunction meant the trip by the trade envoy went ahead without the support of ministers or advisers.The Foreign Office had said the peer would not meet any representatives of the Israeli government. But photographs show him with senior Israeli trade officials on two occasions.Austin also went to a reception at the British embassy where the education minister, Yoav Kisch, gave a speech.Emails show that Foreign Office officials recommended ministers endorse the visit despite Lammy, who was foreign secretary at the time, suspending talks on a free trade agreement on 20 May.In a submission prepared for Lammy and Falconer about why the trip should go ahead, a Foreign Office staffer wrote: “[British embassy] Tel Aviv report that the business community in Israel are agitated by yesterday’s announcement. If we were to turn off this visit now, cancelling several visits and meetings, it would send a bad signal.”The official said the visit would give Austin the opportunity “to explain to Israeli civil society and business … that nothing has changed in our existing trading relationship” and concluded: “We recommend the visit goes ahead. Do you agree?”Lammy and Falconer did not receive the official’s submission or endorse the trip, a source has told the Guardian. The ministers were unhappy about this, the source added.One of Austin’s meetings was with Rafael, an Israeli arms company which acquired Pearson Engineering of the UK in September 2022.View image in fullscreenIan Austin, second from right, with Yifat Alon Perel, centre, who is the deputy director of Israel’s foreign trade administration.Photograph: LinkedInAs well as the Iron Dome air defence system, Rafael develops Spike missiles that appear to have been used by the Israel Defense Forces against targetsincluding a convoy of ambulances in November 2023.Experts toldthe Timesand theBBCthat the missiles were used in an IDF drone strike in April 2024 that killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers, including three British citizens.On 28 May, Austin met a Rafael executive responsible for international business development. He was given an overview of the company before an “open discussion on UK-Israel relations, policy, joint R&D and export opportunities from the UK”, according to a briefing pack prepared by officials. The document was released to the Guardian in response to a freedom of information request.Further details of the meeting were redacted by officials but the pack included lines for Austin to take if asked about export licences and trade talks, indicating the subjects that officials expected might come up.The British embassy in Israel publicised some details of Austin’s visit at the time, leading to criticism of apparent incoherence in foreign policy given Lammy’s sharp rebuke of the Israeli government days earlier. The trip was described as one focused on meeting businesses.The revelation that Austin met Rafael executives – and that the Foreign Office sought to approve the whole trip, including this meeting, in advance – will spark fresh questions about the government’s relationship with Israel and its defence industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the trip became public, sources claimed he had no scheduled meetings with Israeli officials.But a photograph shared by a senior British embassy official of Austin’s visit to Haifa on 26 May shows him near Lena Zeiger, an Israeli official responsible for trade policy and international agreements.Zeiger was also present at a reception held the following day at the British ambassador’s residence in Tel Aviv to mark King Charles’s birthday. Austin attended this event.Kisch spoke at the reception and, according to the Jerusalem Post, the education minister referred to “a strategic and enduring partnership, anchored in a commitment to democratic principles and international cooperation”. His audience included Austin, members of the Knesset and government officials.Austin was photographed at the reception next to Yifat Alon Perel, deputy director of Israel’s foreign trade administration. One person present described her as having led negotiations on an Israel-UK free trade agreement.The Foreign Office referred questions to the Department for Business and Trade, which declined to comment.Austin made no comment.

Land border crossings and domestic flights should not be affected, however, per Izenson.A CBP spokesperson said: “Foreign travelers with authorized and valid US travel documents are being processed as they were previously. New or renewingTrusted Traveler Programapplicants are now required to choose one of the two approved designations, male or female, to complete the application. An applicant’s choice of sex is not criteria for an applicant’s admission into the US.”Izenson and Carl Charles, counsel for Lambda Legal, both say they have not yet heard about the rule causing problems for people at the airport. But Dr July Pilowsky, a scientist and US citizen currently residing in Spain who uses he/they/she pronouns, said the new rule is already disrupting their life.When Pilowsky initially chose to change their passport gender marker to “X”, they said “it was a practical decision”.“It’s not like I did it to validate myself and feel good about myself,” Pilowsky said, noting they did it out of necessity because it can be a bureaucratic hassle when different identity documents have different information on them.Additionally, Pilowsky said they’d already experienced trouble at the airport because of their gender expression.“What CBP officers do when you show them your document [passport] at the border, is they look at the sex marker on your document. And based on what that sex marker says, they decide what you’re supposed to look like and what your body is supposed to be like,” Pilowsky said.Body-scanning X-rays at airport securitythat reveal genitalia can be especially invasive for trans people.“The CBP officers can decide whether the results of the body scan are suspicious or not, based on, you know, there’s something in your pants they think you shouldn’t have. So what’s on your document shapes what CBP officers believe ought to be reality,” they continued.Pilowsky said they’ve experienced “invasive pat-downs” because of this, which is one reason why they decided to get the “X” marker.“What I wanted to do was disrupt the process. When you have a sex marker that says ‘X’, then suddenly it’s difficult for the CBP officer to build an image of what you’re supposed to look like and compare you against it, positively or negatively,” they explained.Now that the new rule has been implemented, they have to worry about the same problem again.“I’ve experienced some slice of the spectrum of things you can experience if you’re under suspicion,” they said. “I don’t want to know about the rest of that spectrum.”To avoid this, Pilowsky said, “I’m being forced into the rather absurd situation of reaching out to an immigration lawyer in order to enter my own country.” They have dual citizenship in the US and Chile, so they’re hoping to enter the US with a Chilean passport, which doesn’t have an “X” marker option, in the future.Charles of Lambda Legal said he still considers the availability of “X” markers a victory. “People need identity documents to navigate their everyday lives,” he said.Future legal challenges to the policy will depend on how it winds up being implemented, Izenson said, adding that they expect the policy will shake out differently for different people depending on what airline passengers choose, and other elements of their identity.“That question depends on a person’s experience and identity and how they move through the world on a number of levels, including what gender they are perceived as, what their body looks like, what their skin tone is, how they’re dressed,” Izenson said.Izenson thinks that the intention of the policy has little to do with passports and airports, saying: “They are trying to throw us into a state of reactivity so that we’re not able to focus on practical advocacy and the material needs of our communities. The more they can keep us confused and freaked out and not sure what’s going on, the more they can do whatever they want.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Sensory testing with consumers shows the new coatings deliver the same great taste as the originals,” the McVitie’s owner, Pladis, said in a statement.Club’s classic advertising slogan citing its chocolate content is no longer in use, replaced by: “If you like a lot of biscuit in your break, join our Club.”The company already had other snacks that can only be described as “chocolate flavour”, including flavours of Mini BN and BN Mini Rolls.“We’re committed to delivering great-tasting snacks while minimising the impact of rising costs on consumers, adjusting formulations only when necessary,” Pladis said.Cocoa prices have soared after poor harvests in the key growing regions of Ghana and Ivory Coast over the past three years, amid extreme temperatures and unusual rainfall patternsdriven by the climate crisis.The added cost has prompted manufacturers to use a number of tactics, frommaking bars and biscuits smallerto reducing cocoa content in an effort to keep the prices paid by shoppers down.Last year prices more than doubled and went on to hit a record of close to $11 (£8.20) a kilogram in January. However, in recent months they have eased back amid positive news about this year’s harvest and reports of lower demand as manufacturers and shoppers switch to alternatives or reduce consumption.KitKat White and McVitie’s white digestives can no longer be marketed as “white chocolate” products as they do not contain a minimum of 20% cocoa butter – although these recipes changed before this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He disliked the pact, signed by one of his predecessors, Barack Obama, and was discouraged from diplomacy by Iran’s arch-enemy, Israel.As a result of the US withdrawal Tehran began stepping up its nuclear programme.European-led talks to resurrect the agreement have failed, and this summer’s bombing raids on Iran by Israel and the US left hopes for a revival at a historic low.After that12-day war in June, Iran’s parliament passed a bill torefuse to cooperatewith the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear inspectorate.That led to signatories Britain, Germany and France triggering the so-called “snapback” process, leading to the reimposition of the UN sanctions. The snapback provision allows for the rapid and automatic reimposition of all UN sanctions that were lifted under the deal if Iran were to significantly violate its nuclear commitmentsThose snapback sanctions in effect made a formality of “termination day”, which was set for 18 October, exactly 10 years after the adoption of UN security council resolution 2231.Last month, when the snapback sanctions went into effect, the British, French and German foreign ministerssaid in a joint statementthey would continue to seek “a new diplomatic solution to ensure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon”.The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said the sanctions “must not be the end of diplomacy” and that “a sustainable solution to the Iranian nuclear issue can only be achieved through negotiations”.On Monday, Trumpsaid that he wanted a peace deal with Iran, while Tehran has repeatedly said it remains open to diplomacy with the US, provided Washington offers guarantees against military action during any potential talks.Trump’s Middle East ‘peace’ pitch to Iran falls flat in Tehran and JerusalemRead moreThe three European powers also last week announced they would seek to restart talks to find a “comprehensive, durable and verifiable agreement”.Still, relations between the west and Iran remain strained. Washington had already imposed large sanctions, including trying to force all countries to shun Iranian oil. Several rounds of Omani-brokered talks this year between Tehran and Washington failed to reach an agreement.Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said last week that Tehran did “not see any reason to negotiate” with European powers, given that they had triggered the snapback mechanism.Western governments and Israel have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, a claim Tehran denies, saying its programme is energy and civil-focused.Iran is expected to mark termination day with a statement later on Saturday at the UN in New York.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIranIran nuclear dealIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The plants are doing the work of extra chemicals and other engineering to grab and lock up the nutrients in water, stopping it from going putrid.It’s just one example of an artificial floating wetland that are being increasingly used around the world in rivers, lagoons and wastewater treatment ponds to clean up water – and in some cases, bring new habitats for wildlife.View image in fullscreenArtificial floating wetlands in the Chicago river, in the middle of the city.Photograph: Dave BurkIn Florida, an almost4,000 sq metre floating wetland is being used to help take pesticides and nutrients out of a recreation areaand stop them entering a lagoon.In the middle of Chicago, an industrial stretch of the city’s Chicago river is being transformed with floating wetlands with boardwalks attached; elsewhere on the riverfloating plant bedsare cleaning up a creek and providing habitat for birds and aquatic mammals.In Pakistan,floating wetlands have been deployed to clean up a crude oil wastewater pit; while in Canada,they’re being used to treat domestic wastewater.“We have always been taught that solutions need hard engineering – you had a system and you add a process and some chemicals,” says Beecham.“But we’ve worked out that no matter how hard you engineer something, nature filters everything much better than anything else. Engineers are working out that nature does a pretty good job by itself. If you can use nature, you’ll come out with a more optimal answer.”Beecham and Walker are co-authors of newresearch documenting the economics of floating wetlands around the world, finding they were a cost-effective way to improve water quality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first edition was published in 2015, when the Paris climate agreement was being drafted but, in the years since, efforts to tackle the climate crisis have been rolled back.View image in fullscreenImages from Ten Years of Remembering Wildlife.Composite: M Van Oosten/Remembering WildlifeUnderDonald Trump, the US withdrew from the agreement in 2020. Joe Biden reversed the decision the following year but, on the first day of his second presidential term, Trump announced the US would be withdrawing yet again. In the UK, both the Conservatives and Reform UK have pledged to scrap the 2050 net zero target should they win power.“Compared to a few years ago, there was a desire for renewables instead of drilling for oil across the world. I think the importance of nature is something for us all to cling on to,” said Raggett.Despite this, she has some hope. “I’m nervous but equally I’m encouraged by the fact that there are so many people that do seem to still care. I’ll do everything I can to keep my end of the bargain and keep fighting. And I know there’s lots of other people who feel the same, so time will tell, but we certainly can’t be complacent.”In a timely reminder of how fraught the outlook is for wildlife at the moment, this year’s release, titled Ten Years of Remembering Wildlife, is being published alongside original and altered images of animals including polar bears, cheetahs and pangolins living in, and then scrubbed out of, their natural habitats.Raggett said these images were intended to be “provocative” and to give a glimpse of the future if we remain on our current track. “The rate of wildlife decline is so rapid across the world and there’s a lot of work to be done to reverse it. We really could be looking at a future where these landscapes would be without these wild animals,” she said. “That’s why we created it, to make people pause and realise what could happen if we don’t take action.”View image in fullscreenRaggett said the images were intended to give a glimpse of the future if the world remained on its current track.Composite: Paul Goldstein/Remembering WildlifeWhile she has spent most of her photography career far away from the UK in Kenya, Tanzania and Bhutan, she has some concerns closer to home. The government has pledged to build 1.5m homes by the end of its first term in parliament.As part of this effort, ministers havetoldthe Environment Agency to wave through planning applications in England with minimal resistance, a move that has dismayed environmental campaigners. Earlier this month, the Guardianrevealedthat Rachel Reeves boasted about unblocking a development of 20,000 homes being held up by “some snails on the site that are a protected species or something”.Ragett called for a “massive pause” on the government’s “short-sighted” plans for accelerated housebuilding. “What everyone needs to understand is that we are all intertwined with nature,” she said. “It’s very easy in a built-up country like ours to not understand the part every species plays in our ecosystem, how they keep our trees growing and the impact that has on clearing carbon from the atmosphere.“I feel like in this country, there’s enough brownfield sites that could and should be redeveloped before you lose any more countryside. We’ve lost so much already. I think there should be a massive pause.”Ragett was inspired to set up the Remembering Wildlife project after coming across an elephant that had been a victim of poaching in Kenya. “He had a poisoned arrow in him and then he started to be eaten by hyenas. I was so horrified and I felt so impotent … so I was determined to try and do something about it,” she said.She said efforts to clamp down on illegal poaching had been mixed. “The impact of poaching rhinos for their horns in South Africa remains horrific. I have friends who are based out there and the rate of poaching is shocking but there have been some wins too. China banning ivory a few years ago definitely has had an impact but then it pops up in the illegal trade elsewhere in Asia,” she said.Tackling demand, especially in Asia where poaching products are used in traditional medicines, is one of the most important ways to reduce the practice, Raggett said. “Poaching is still a huge criminal industry and it’s not going anywhere. It’s still very much rampant.”Earlier in October, the world-renowned primatologistJane Goodalldied aged 91. Raggett had met her in 2018. “I was blown away by her work ethic and determination. She had just gotten off a night flight from Tanzania. At my age, I’d be having a nap the next morning and yet she had a queue of people waiting to have appointments with her. She was totally inspirational and encouraging and had real humility in how she spoke,” she said. “She has a remarkable legacy full of wisdom, and humour as well.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisWildlifePhotographyConservationDonald TrumpHousingAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

But, as it jumps closer, its sleek body is identified by a heat-detecting camera and, with it, an alert goes out to Orkney’s stoat hunters.Aided by an artificial intelligence programme trained to detect a stoat’s sinuous shape and movement, trapping teams are dispatched with the explicit aim of finding and killing it. It is the most sophisticated technology deployed in one of the world’s largest mammal eradication projects, which has the aim of detecting the few stoats left on Orkney.Conservationists on the islands, which sit in the far north of Scotland, have already used an array of 9,000 lethal traps and eight specially trained tracking and detection dogs to dispatch nearly 8,000 stoats over the past six years. At least 30 of those digital cameras will soon be staked out across the moors and coasts of Orkney’s mainland, building a network that connects hits from the cameras to computers and mobile apps used by the trapping teams.A stoat is captured on a heat-detecting cameraA stoat is captured on a heat-detecting cameraThe stoat is an existential threat to native ground-nesting birds for which Orkney is famous – it is home to 11% of all the UK’s breeding seabirds and about 25% of its hen harriers, as well as its most treasured native rodent, the Orkney vole.The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Scotland, which runs the Orkney NativeWildlifeProject, believes stoats arrived from the Scottish mainland in about 2011. Since then, the population has exploded, colonising Orkney’s mainland and the nearby islands of Burray and South Ronaldsay and the peninsula of Deerness – stoats can swim several kilometres – with devastating effects.Sarah Sankey, the area operations manager for RSPBScotland, says the stoats’ greatest advantage is they have no predators on Orkney. “They’ve nothing to control them: we’ve no foxes, and very few buzzards. We’ve seen this all over the world. That stoat population would’ve kept going until it had removed everything,” she says, holding a laminated map of Orkney with thousands of red dots marking the trap network.“We saw it before we started eradicating them. There were stoats running between people’s legs, stoats in people’s kitchen cupboards, there were stoats in people’s lofts.”In well under a decade, they had spread across 58,000 hectares (143,260 acres). A feasibility study said that if they spread across all Orkney’s islands, it would be financially and logistically impossible to control them. So the project, which will last for at least 10 years, has been given a £16m budget and 46 staff.Stoats penetrate the burrows of voles, search out eggs and chicks in thousands of curlew, lapwing and hen harrier nests, and also hunt along Orkney’s extensive shoreline for seafood, feeding off starfish and urchins.“Here we’ve got a perfect disaster where we’ve loads and loads of food year-round,” Sankey says. “Nothing to control the stoats and lots of native wildlife to lose, and a tourism economy that kind of depends on it.“Why did we start all of this? Orkney is less than 1% of the UK’s land area, but we’ve around a quarter of all Arctic terns and hen harriers, about a third of Arctic skuas, and we’re the only place with Orkney voles. So there was a lot to lose, basically.”View image in fullscreenThe Orkney Native Wildlife Project has a network of about 8,000 humane lethal trap boxes and Europe’s first stoat detection dogs.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe latest survey data suggests the project has succeeded. Since it began in 2019, there has been a 1,267% increase in the chance of curlew hatchings, a 218% rise in vole activity and a 64% increase in hen harriers numbers. Heavily persecuted by gamekeepers on the UK mainland, Orkney is now home to 160 hen harriers.“Against a background of a massive population decline, particularly of curlew and lapwing, we are managing to stabilise the population in Orkney,” Sankey says.Sourced from New Zealand, where conservationists face an uphill battle to remove millions of non-native predatory mammals, the AI system is supplemented by thermal binoculars and drones, says James Geluk, the project’s lead technologist and a New Zealander who has worked on an eradication project near Wellington.The thermal detectors are far more sensitive to movement than the trail cameras normally used by conservationists, he says. They operate perfectly in darkness and send live alerts in real time after video footage is uploaded to a cloud server. The AI has learned to distinguish stoats from otters and voles.“It’s a much more accurate monitoring tool than a usual trail camera would be,” Geluk says.After six years of concerted trapping efforts, including the interruption of lockdowns during the Covid crisis when stoat numbers soared again, the RSPB hopes to begin the “mop-up” phase in December – a threshold that will be reached after the eradication of 95% of stoats.They estimate there are only about 100 pregnant stoats left on Orkney. “We are all conservationists who work here,” Sankey says. “None of us are here because we want to kill an animal. We’re here because we want to protect the nature of Orkney.”Explore more on these topicsConservationScotlandMammalsWildlifeBirdsAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These are permitted if renters have an assured shorthold tenancy, a type of rental agreement offered by private landlords.However, some councils have been able to sidestep this through arm’s length companies set up to manage their housing stock.Graphic showing how councils use legal loophole to issue no-fault evictionsSince Labour gained power, companies owned by five of its councils have started no-fault eviction proceedings against 191 households. Some renters have been taken to court, with several being removed from their homes by bailiffs.The Guardian revealed last weekthat Lambeth council, in south London, was engaging in this practice through Homes for Lambeth, a company it set up in 2017 and is in the process of disbanding.The local authority has issued 63 no-fault eviction notices since last July. Five households have received possession orders through the courts and two have been removed by bailiffs. Lambeth council said it faced “incredibly difficult choices” but had decided to use the properties to house those already homeless.Jules Zakolska, 27, said she and fellow tenants were “traumatised” by the thought they too may end up in temporary accommodation, adding that some were suicidal.Documents show Lambeth council delayed full implementation of the plan as it was deemed “too controversial” a decision to take “during the pre-election period”.Now, it has emerged that four more Labour-run councils: Reading, Blackpool, Nottingham and Enfield, have also issued section 21 notices to tenants renting from their arm’s length housing bodies.View image in fullscreenSince Labour came to power, companies owned by five of its councils, including Lambeth council, have started no-fault eviction proceedings against 191 households.Photograph: Chris Dorney/AlamyReading council, in Berkshire, announced plans to close its housing company, Homes for Reading, two weeks after the general election. Since then, 48 households have been served with no-fault eviction notices, 20 of whom have left their properties.Some vacated homes are being used as temporary accommodation for homeless people, despite the fact they were supposed to be let to key workers. Some families evicted by Homes for Reading have now been forced into temporary accommodation elsewhere in the town.This includes Charlene Flygring, 38, who received a no-fault eviction notice in May. She and her son, Rion-Aziah, four, have been placed in a bedsit by the local authority. They share a bed and do not have access to a working washing machine.“Everything seems very hopeless at the moment,” she said. “This place is vile. You either have to accept the offer of temporary accommodation, or you’re homeless. We hate coming back here. If my apartment, which I loved, is also being used as temporary accommodation, I could have stayed there and been near my son’s school.”View image in fullscreenCharlene Flygring is having to live in a bedsit with her four-year-old son after being served with a no-fault eviction in May.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianA Reading council spokesperson said the decision to close Homes for Reading was taken as a “last resort” after the company’s “viability” was affected by changes to local authority lending rules and economic factors.He said: “The HfR properties have been bought by the council’s housing revenue account, the legislation for which requires vacant possession at the point the properties are acquired.“More than half of the properties have now been vacated and are being allocated for their new use as essential housing for local key workers in Reading. A minority are being used for temporary accommodation to house residents in priority need over the short term to cover a local shortage. These properties will then revert to use by key workers.”He added that the council had worked with tenants to find alternative accommodation, with the support of a dedicated homelessness prevention officer.Blackpool council, in Lancashire, manages more than 700 rental properties through its arm’s length body, BlackpoolHousingCompany. It has issued 73 no-fault notices since Labour took power. In the same time, 15 households have received possession orders and three have been evicted by bailiffs.The Guardian understands that the council often uses the notices as a means of addressing drug use and antisocial behaviour. However, if tenants have breached rental agreements, landlords are supposed to issue another type of eviction notice that allows them to challenge the decision in court.Blackpool Housing Company said no-fault evictions were seen as a “last resort”. A spokesperson added: “In most cases our notices do not lead to evictions, because the process, coupled with support for the tenant, has successfully resulted in tenancies being sustained. In the very few cases where evictions have happened, that is where extensive support and engagement has not been taken up by the tenant, and no resolution found. In those cases, people do still become eligible for support from the council to find somewhere else to live.”Nottingham city council established an arm’s length housing management company called Nottingham City Homes in 2004. In 2017, Nottingham City Homes created a subsidiary company that offered assured shorthold tenancies. Both companies were ultimately owned by the local authority.In 2022, the council announced plans to disband both organisations after it emerged that about £50m of funds reserved for housing services were wrongfully spent. About 100 families with assured shorthold tenancies lost their homes as a result. Although the council began eviction proceedings before the election, it continued to pursue tenants after Labour entered government.Since then, it has issued two no-fault eviction notices and sought two possession orders from the courts. One property has been seized by bailiffs. A council spokesperson said: “Enforcement action was necessary only after an extended period was provided to allow the tenant further time to move.”It added that it had “placed a strong emphasis” on supporting tenants throughout the process and “provided flexibility around notice periods wherever possible” and did not plan to carry out more no-fault evictions.Enfield council, in north London, owns a housing organisation called My Housing Gateway. As well as leasing properties from its own housing stock, it also manages rents on behalf of private landlords. It said five households had been issued with no-fault eviction notices since last July. All were later removed by bailiffs.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government said: “Section 21 ‘no-fault’ evictions are unacceptable. That’s why we’re banning them through our landmark renters’ rights bill, which is set to become law very soon.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

If childbirth injuries or other conditions are not treated until the mother is readmitted days or weeks later, the chances of a complete recovery may also be reduced.In total, 14,630 new mothers had to be readmitted within 30 days of birth in the last 12 months, which equates to 40 every day. In the most recent quarter for which data is available, April to June 2025, one in 20 new mothers had to be readmitted shortly after being discharged.Pregnant women in England at ‘growing risk’ of serious injury in childbirthRead moreThe figures, which do not specify why the woman was readmitted, have only been collected in their current form since 2024, making it difficult to compare the rates of readmissions with previous data.Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson who obtained the NHS figures from the House of Commons library, said the figures were “heartbreaking”.She also called on Labour to reverse its cuts to the national service development funding (SDF) for maternity services from £95m in 2024-25 to £2m in 2025-26. The fund was introduced after the Ockenden review into maternity services at Shrewsbury and Telford, aimed at improving the quality of maternity care.The Guardianreported on Friday that pregnant women in England are at growing riskof suffering a serious injury while giving birth.The number of mothers sustaining a third or fourth-degree perineal tear while delivering their baby has risen from 25 in 1,000 in June 2020 to 29 in 1,000 in June this year – a 16% increase, according to the figures, also obtained by Morgan.It means almost 3% of women who gave birth in England during this period suffered a serious tear. Such injuries damage the woman’s anal sphincter and cause long-term pain, birth trauma and incontinence. They can also have a “life-changing” impact on women’s overall physical and mental health, cause post-traumatic stress disorder and leave them afraid to have another child.The figures come after major concern about the poor quality of NHS maternity care prompted Wes Streeting, the health secretary, to launch an inquiry into maternity and neonatal care and set up a taskforce to recommend improvements.Morgan said: “Behind these figures are heartbreaking stories of women suffering unimaginable trauma at a moment that should be full of joy.“The Conservatives’ neglect of maternity services was unforgivable, putting mothers and babies under threat, but Labour risks kicking action on this problem into the long grass … The government’s inquiry cannot be used as a shield against taking meaningful action now.“It is unacceptable that, while so many women die or are injured by poor maternity care, the government raided the key ring-fenced fund for improving maternity services. Their promises to improve safety will ring hollow until they change course.“If the government is serious about ending the disaster unfolding on our maternity wards, they must reverse these cuts at once, support our hard-working NHS teams, and implement every measure in the Ockenden review without delay.”Systemic racism affects maternity care for black women in England, say MPsRead moreMedical leaders called on NHS staff to ensure “thorough checks” were carried out on every new mother before they were sent home.Prof Asma Khalil, a consultant obstetrician and vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Maternal readmissions can occur for a number of reasons, such as postpartum haemorrhage, infection, or complications that develop in the days or weeks following birth.“We’re also seeing more complex pregnancies, which can lead to a higher risk of complications both before and after birth. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the factors that may increase a woman’s risk of readmission and take a holistic, person-centred approach to postnatal care, ensuring thorough checks are carried out before discharge.“It’s vital that maternity services have the right staffing, training and facilities in place to provide safe, personalised and compassionate care for every woman and baby.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Childbirth can be an incredible moment in a woman’s life, but suffering from injuries, including perineal tears, can leave mothers deeply traumatised.“This government inherited a failing system of maternity care which is why we opened the rapid national maternity investigation, are setting up a national taskforce and continue to put in place perinatal pelvic health services to reduce the rates of perineal tears.They said claims of funding cuts in the 2025-26 budget were wrong. “Overall funding has increased by £26bn, and local NHS systems have been given the freedom to spend the funding to best meet the needs of their local community, with the government holding them to account on whether they deliver better outcomes for patients.”Explore more on these topicsChildbirthWomen's healthPregnancyNHSHealthWomenHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve never had a single one rejected,” Holmyard told the Guardian. “We’ve had a couple of paperwork issues, but we’ve never had our mussels rejected and now in the last month we’ve had three loads rejected.”The mussels are grown on ropes in the waters of Lyme Bay, several miles off the coast of south Devon.The company exports the vast majority of what they grow, sending them for processing in the Netherlands, with most ending up in restaurants or on supermarket shelves in Belgium where they are a key ingredient in one of its national dishes:moules-frites. Few Belgian diners may realise some of the bowls of mussels and french fries they regularly enjoy contain molluscs grown across the Channel.All three rejected loads had to be destroyed, at the company’s cost.The rejected shipments did not differ from previous deliveries, Holmyard said, leaving the company confused and suffering from the unexpected financial hit.“It’s completely subjective and it’s inconsistent, which means you can’t plan for it. It’s just a lottery at the moment whether they get through or not, and we absolutely can’t run a business in that way because it’s too uncertain.”Since Brexit, deliveries of animal and plant products between Britain and the EU have required health and veterinary checks, supplemented by paperwork, and have been subject to stringent inspections at the border as a part ofsanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls.View image in fullscreenSarah Holmyard, commercial director at Offshore Shellfish, says the rejection of shipments is ‘subjective and inconsistent’.Photograph: Offshore ShellfishLive mussels, oysters, scallops, cockles and clams – classified as “live bivalve molluscs” – are subject to especially stringent EU rules. They can only be imported to the bloc without treatment if they come fromwaters deemed of the highest quality, which is not the case for most of the water in England and Wales, although Offshore Shellfish’s farms are in waters which are considered “class A” for most of the year.As a result, shellfish exporters, and other food producers areseen as some of the main beneficiariesof the“reset” dealbetween Keir Starmer’s government and the EU announced in May, which is designed to remove the need for SPS checks.British diners do not have the same appetite for homegrown shellfish like mussels as their continental counterparts, and the vast majority of shellfish and other seafood caught in UK waters is exported to Europe.Negotiations are expected to begin this month, with the aim of a deal being implemented in 2027. This is viewed as too long a wait by many in the shellfish industry.In the meantime, Holmyard and other food exporters in the UK shellfish industry have reported an increase in border checks, and even rejections of their produce on the European side of the Channel, since the reset was announced.“The cited reason [for the rejection of two lorries] was that they hadn’t been properly washed. But they came out of clean water and they were washed,” Holmyard said.“I think, and I’m not alone in thinking this, that it is political,” she added, given that their produce had only been rejected after the announcement of the reset of UK-EU relations.The French customs service did not provide a comment.The Guardian understands the UK government is not aware of a significant increase in rejections of British goods of animal or plant origin entering the EU.A government spokesperson said: “We are focused on negotiating an SPS deal that could add up to £5.1bn a year to our economy, by cutting costs and reducing red tape for British producers and retailers.“We continue to engage with industry and EU border teams to maintain trade whilst protecting our biosecurity.”Mussel growers like Offshore Shellfish don’t tend to harvest the molluscs during the summer – between April and August – when the mussels are spawning and then recovering. The seizure of the deliveries sent to the continent happened right at the start of the export season, when the company expected to start earning money again from sales.Offshore Shellfish was set up by Holmyard’s father John, who has been farming mussels for 30 years. The company has been holding talks with French officials in the hope of resolving export challenges.After negotiations by the Holmyards, their Dutch partners and the UK government, the authorities in Boulogne-sur-Mer have agreed to be more flexible in how they interpret the rules. However, this has not yet been put to the test and the company hopes to start exporting again soon.“We’ve lost a lot of money in the last few weeks just on these failed loads and it’s not something we can continue to do,” said Holmyard. The company is also concerned that it might lose its customers if repeated failed deliveries give it a reputation for being unreliable.“It’s a lot of food waste and live animal waste, at a time both nations [France and the UK] are meant to be looking at food security,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBusinessFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

The young parliamentary researcher, then in his late 20s, was a China specialist working successively for two influential backbenchers,Tom Tugendhatand Alicia Kearns. He had a parliamentary pass and was plugged into Westminster’s gossip network during 2022, a year of Conservative turmoil in Westminster, three prime ministers and future policy uncertainty.At the same time, Cash was in close contact with a friend, Christopher Berry, a teacher based in Hangzhou, easternChina, where the Britons had first met five years earlier. They discussed politics constantly, using an encrypted app. At one point, on 18 July, Berry allegedly told him he had met a senior Chinese Communist party leader (though he now denies meeting anybody of that rank). In a reply the next day, Cash said: “You’re in spy territory now.”It was one of many voice notes and messages sent between the two that were recovered by the Met police’s elite SO15 unit, best known for its counter-terror work, but also responsible for investigating espionage threats to the UK.Berry, it was alleged, had been tasked by a man known only as Alex, a Chinese spy with the Ministry of State Security working for a front. Cash was Berry’s sub-source, passing on information from Westminster to Alex, who in turn shared it withCai Qi, a member of China’s ruling politburo.View image in fullscreenChristopher Berry was alleged to have been in frequent and close contact with Cash.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockCash and Berry were arrested in March 2023, accused of spying for China, and charged in April 2024. They denied the charges and have continued to assert their innocence. Last month, the case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service, raising questions about the prosecutors’ decision and prompting a political row. Yet, little was known about the allegations once faced by the two men until Downing Street published a witness statement, as part of a wider effort by Labour to draw a line under the affair.The statement, written by Matthew Collins, one of the UK’s deputy national security advisers, in December 2023 drew on evidence assembled by SO15. It described the two men in close and at times urgent contact: “On one occasion, for example, a total of 13 hours passed between Mr Berry receiving tasking, speaking with Mr Cash, and incorporating the information he provided in a written report back to ‘Alex’.”On 21 July 2022, Cash was said to have told Berry that Tugendhat, a moderate China-sceptic, would “almost certainly”, in Collins’s words, become a minister under Rishi Sunak, who was then vying for the prime ministership against Liz Truss. This would be in exchange for Tugendhat’s support on foreign policy matters. The information was “very off the record” and Berry should not tell his Chinese interlocutor, Cash said. Nevertheless, the detail featured in a report Berry sent to Alex on 28 July, though in a fact not mentioned by Collins, a day later,Tugendhat endorsed Truss.Collins’ witness statement, one of three he gave prosecutors, was published at 9.35pm on Wednesday. Those named in it were notified in advance, so that night the former researcher was able put out a response through his lawyer. Cash acknowledged he “routinely spoke and shared information” with Berry, who was “as critical of and concerned about the Chinese Communist party as I was”. It was, he added, “inconceivable to me that he would deliberately pass on any information to Chinese intelligence”.Meanwhile, Berry said, also through his lawyer, that the reports he wrote were “provided to a Chinese company which I believed had clients wishing to develop trading links with the UK”. Those reports “contained no classified information”, Berry said, and “concerned economic and commercial issues widely discussed in the UK at the time”. They drew on information freely in the public domain, he continued, “together with political conjecture, much of which proved to be inaccurate”.At another point, Collins claims, Berry was said to have told Alex that Kearns and Tugendhat held a “secret” meeting with Taiwanese officials from the country’s defence ministry in May 2025. They had discussed “Taiwanese strategy for a potential attack from China”, Collins said, and the report was based on information from Cash, who had sent his friend “multiple messages” describing the event “including a photo of some attendees”.View image in fullscreenTom Tugendhat, the security minister from 2022 to 2024, was known to advocate a tough approach to China.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe taskings were frequent. Berry had at least 34 reports to write for Alex between December 2021 and February 2023, but he messaged his friend regularly. Yet, despite the activity, there was not a financial relationship, according to Cash. “I did not ever receive money for information which I provided,” he said this week, though at one point, in his witness statement, Collins says the researcher was offered some by Berry, if he could reply at short notice.Alex, according to Collins, had asked in December 2022 if Berry could find out more about the level of communication between the US and UK over Xinjiang, the north-western province that is home to the country’s heavily repressed Uyghur minority, and what measures they might take against Beijing in protest. This tasking was passed “verbatim to Mr Cash with an offer of payment” Collins wrote, though “Berry did not specify an amount” and there is no suggestion any money was paid.Berry’s final report included some intriguing information. “Berry told ‘Alex’,” Collins wrote, “that the then foreign secretary [James Cleverly] did not consider sanctions to be an effective tool in respect of the import of products from Xinjiang and similar matters.” It was unclear how this conclusion was reached, but this was at thecentre of the government’s case, that “the Chinese state was given real time insights” into political information, sometimes before it became public.In reply, Cash stated: “I have been placed in an impossible position. I have not had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence, and I should not have to take part in a trial by media”.Statements made by Collins, Cash said, “are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial”. He added: “I have lost a career I loved for an allegation against me of which I am entirely innocent.”Explore more on these topicsEspionageTom TugendhatChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The closure will remain in effect from 11am to 3pm.The event in question will include a live-fire amphibious capabilities demonstration at Red Beach,according to a statementfrom the US marine corps. JD Vance, a former enlisted marine who served in Iraq, is scheduled to speak to at least 15,000 marines, sailors, veterans and families expected to attend. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth will also deliver remarks.“The capabilities demonstration will feature integrated Navy and Marine Corps operations across air, land and sea,” the Marines’ statement said.The US Marine Corps insisted that the event will comply with established safety protocols, and “no public highways or transportation routes will be closed”.The CHP said in a statement that the military event will involve “live ammunition being discharged by the federal government over the freeway” and made the call to temporarily close a portion of the freeway due to the safety risk and distractions to drivers.Earlier in the week, California governorGavin Newsomhad decried the plans to fire live rounds over Interstate 5, calling it an “absurd show of force” and “totally uncalled for ”.On Saturday morning, Newsom was concerned that the stunt could put Californians in harm’s way. “Flying live rounds over a busy highway without coordination between state, federal, and local partners isn’t just wrong – it’s dangerous,” Newsom posted on social media.The criticism underscored the growing tensions between Donald Trump and the California governor, who has frequently called out decisions by the president’s administration.This celebration was granted no exception from Newsom’s ire. “Using our military to intimidate people you disagree with politically doesn’t make you look strong,” Newsom said. “It makes you look weak. It’s reckless, it’s disrespectful, and yet another action beneath the office of the presidency.”Earlier in October, the navyhosted the presidentaboard an aircraft carrier off the coast of Virginia to celebrate the same military anniversary. Trump turned that event into a political rally.This show of force coincides withNo Kings rallies and marchesbeing held across the US, including several locations inCalifornia, aligning behind a message that the nation’s slide into authoritarian rule under Trump needs to stop.Newsomcautionedthose participating in the rallies: “I urge our nation to use this weekend’s No Kings marches as a declaration of independence against the tyranny and lawlessness currently running this country. Use your voice. ACT PEACEFULLY. Protect yourself and your community. THERE ARE NO KINGS IN THE UNITED STATES.”In a statement to the New York Times, a spokesperson for Vance, William Martin, said Newsom was misleading the public about the safety risk for the event on Saturday. He said it was routine training.“If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,” Martin said.Matt Rocco, the California department of transportation spokesperson, said: “This is all because of the White House-directed military event, that for the safety of the public, we need to shut down the freeway since they’re sending live ordnances over the freeway.”Rocco said the I5 closure could cost up to another two hours of trip time for those commuting betweenSan Diegoand Los Angeles. The freeway carries 80,000 travelers and $94m in freight through the corridor daily, according to the governor’s office. Passenger rail services running parallel to the I5 have also been canceled for the afternoon.Explore more on these topicsSan DiegoUS militaryTrump administrationCaliforniaWest CoastUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The strike killed the other two crew members on board, sources told Reuters on Friday.‘Trump is killing poor people’: Caribbean village mourns victim of US strikeRead moreThe US military flew the survivors to an American navy warship in theCaribbean, where they were detained until at least Friday evening. It was not clear if they had already been flown off the ship as of Saturday morning.The US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expected the survivors to eventually be sent to their home countries.In a statement on Truth Social, Donald Trump said: “It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route.”The president added that US intelligence had confirmed the boat “was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics” and “there were four known narcoterrorists on board the vessel”.“The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin,Ecuadorand Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump said.The decision to send the survivors home means that the US military will not have to grapple with thorny legal issues surrounding military detention for suspected drug traffickers, whose alleged crimes do not fall neatly under the laws of war, legal experts say.Speaking on Friday, Trump told reporters that the strike was against “a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs”.He did not comment on how many were killed or survived the strike.The Pentagon has offered no details on the attack so far and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration has said the previous strikes killed 27 people, raising alarms among some legal experts and Democratic lawmakers, who question whether they adhere to the laws of war.The strikes come against the backdrop of a US military buildup in the Caribbean that includes guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter jets, a nuclear submarine and about 6,500 troops as Trump escalates a standoff with the Venezuelan government.On Wednesday, Trump disclosed he had authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, adding to speculation in Caracas that the United States is attempting to topple the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.Maduro has denied any connection to drug smuggling and denounced the US boat strikes as a pretext for regime change, portraying them as violations of sovereignty and international law.In a letter this week to the United Nations’ 15-member security council, seen by Reuters, Venezuela’s UN ambassador, Samuel Moncada, asked for a UN determination that the US strikes off its coast are illegal and to issue a statement backing Venezuela’s sovereignty.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryEcuadorColombiaVenezuelaCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Philips said they had carried out subsequent testing and found no BPA, while Sophie la Girafe said the amount found was insignificant.All three dummies were marketed as either “BPA- free” or “natural rubber”.BPA is a synthetic chemical used in the production of plastics, but it has a structure similar to the female hormone, oestrogen, which it mimics in the bodies of humans and other animals.Chloe Topping, a campaigner with Chem Trust, who was not involved in the research, said: “The health effects of BPA are extensive: breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometriosis, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, altered immune system, effects on reproduction, brain development and behaviour, including behaviour in children.”Children are particularly vulnerable “because they’re still developing, their organs are very sensitive to disruption”, Topping said, with exposure to bisphenol A at an early age or in the womb linked to reduced sperm counts and early onset puberty. “And the thing about endocrine-disrupting chemicals … is that they can act at very, very low concentrations,” she said.Researchers bought 19 baby dummies from shops in the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Hungary, and two from the online marketplace Temu, manufactured by Foshan City Saidah Baby Products. To mimic the conditions inside an infant’s mouth, they placed each dummy in an artificial saliva solution for 30 minutes at 37C (98.6F). The resulting extract was analysed to determine the content of bisphenols.Out of four dummies in which BPA was detected, the highest concentration was found in the Curaprox baby grow with love soother. Despite being marketed as “BPA-free”, researchers found a BPA concentration of 19 micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) – a breach of the 10µg limit for migration of BPA from babies’ dummies set by the EU.The second highest concentration was found in Sophie la Girafe’s “natural rubber” pacifier. Laboratory testing found a BPA concentration of 3µg/kg in the product. A concentration of 2µg/kg was found in the Philips Avent ultra air soother, also marketed as “BPA-free”, and one pacifier sourced from Temu, manufactured by Foshan City Saidah.Curaden, which manufactures the Curaprox range, said the result for its baby grow with love soother “came as a surprise”. The company carried out its own tests which corroborated the finding. “Out of an abundance of caution and in line with our commitment to quality, Curaden immediately decided to proactively remove the soothers [from affected batches] from the market and to offer refunds to all affected customers,” the spokesperson said.Vulli, the makers of Sophie la Girafe, pushed back. “We have not had any pacifiers in our catalogue for some time,” a spokesperson for the toymaker said. Thereremain pictures on its websiteof babies using the dummy, but it is no longer listed for sale. “In any case, all our products are subject to exclusive [BPA] testing before being marketed, carried out by an accredited laboratory [SGS],” the spokesperson said.“As a reminder, the regulatory limit for [BPA] migration is set at 0.04 mg/kg, and the laboratory’s detection limit is 0.01 mg/kg. The value mentioned in the article (3µg/kg, or 0.003 mg/kg) is well below this detection limit and therefore insignificant,” said the Vulli spokesperson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These tests also confirm no detectable BPA across our soother ranges, including the sample tested, and validated that they are BPA-free.”Foshan City Saidah did not respond to a request for comment.The Philips and Sophie la Girafe products are available in the UK, but the Curaprox and Foshan City Saidah products have been removed from the market.Hana Hoffmannová, the editor-in-chief at dTest’s magazine publication, said: “Pacifiers are often one of the first items parents buy, and they do not expect to be exposing their children to hormone-disrupting chemicals from day one.”The current EU regulation around BPA in dummies is ambiguous. The EN 1400 standard sets a limit for BPA migration from babies’ dummies at 10µg/l, but theEuropean Toy Safety Directive, which also covers soothers, sets a limit of 40µg/l.EU law has banned the use of BPA in babies’ bottles entirely since 2011 and these rules were widened in 2018 to include the production of food containers and bottles for children under three years old. Karolína Brabcová of Arnika, a Czech campaign group, said: “It is illogical that bisphenols are banned in baby bottles but not in pacifiers, which babies use more intensively and in some cases for long years.“We are seeing a lack of stringent regulation and it is failing consumers.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But they have become increasingly intertwined with the traditional banking industry, with lenders in Europe and the EU significantly exposed to private credit firms.The private credit industry boomed after the 2008 financial crisis, when regulators cracked down on traditional banks and forced them tohold more capital– in effect a financial cushion against riskier loans.Private credit loans vs big banksThe new rules also required banks to do more forensic checks on borrowers, making lending more expensive and slower. This created a gap in the market that private credit was ready to fill.Meanwhile, private credit firms benefited from ultra-low interest rates after the financial crisis that made it easy to borrow vast sums of money from traditional banks that could further feed their ventures.The industry falls under the umbrella of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), colloquially known as the shadow banking sector, which is dominated by alternative asset managers in the US including Blackstone, Apollo, Ares and KKR that also lead the private equity industry.However, many insurance companies, pension and investment funds have their own private credit operations.The private credit boom has created an industry with about $3tn (£2.2tn) in assets, according to a2024 report by the Alternative Credit Council and EY, and one that is forecast by BlackRock to hit $4.5tn by 2030.Private credit assets chartThat is still a fraction of the global banking industry, which has assets of $188.7tn according tothe Financial Stability Board.But private credit’s rapid growth, and banks’ growing exposure to the burgeoning sector, has caught the attention of global regulators.What are the risks and benefits of private credit?Critics, including some banks, claim private credit’s success has hinged on “regulatory arbitrage”, meaning they are gaining a competitive edge and stealing business as a result of weaker regulation.Unlike banks, private credit firms do not have to build up capital that can absorb losses when loans sour, or even disclose the risk on their books. They face far less scrutiny and expense as a result, meaning they can issue loans faster and to a wider range of businesses, with potential to reap greater financial rewards than heavily regulated banks.The US dominates the private credit market, making it hard for global regulators to implement rules and get a proper view of the possible risks to financial stability. Europe is also struggling to keep up with the boom: one of the continent’s biggest players is the London-headquartered Intermediate Capital Group, which had raised $50bn for its private credit fund as of December,according to tables published by trade publication Private Debt Investor.That compares with Ares Management, whose top private credit fund had raised $116bn.The growing availability of private credit and equity has also helped hollow out stock markets, meaning less need for companies to list on stock exchanges in pursuit of capital, as well as providing funds to take firms private.But advocates say the private credit boom is beneficial for both borrowers and investors.While pension funds and insurers can diversify their portfolios and increase returns for investors long term, businesses can secure bespoke loans much more quickly than through a traditional bank.Industry lobbyists also say any extra risk is carefully considered by private credit firms. “They are taking on more risk, but they are engaging more closely and more frequently than banks traditionally do,” said Michael Moore, who heads the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, which also represents the private credit industry. “Typically, the private credit provider will be much more engaged, week by week, depending on what business they are working with.”Why there so much attention on private credit now?The collapse of two US business, the car parts supplier First Brands and the sub-prime auto lender Tricolor, have raised fears about weak lending standards in some pockets of the unregulated private credit market.That could spell trouble for the wider financial services sector, given regulated banks have tried to get a slice of the private credit industry by investing or lending to private credit firms themselves.Jefferies, a mid-sized Wall Street lender that was advising First Brands and lending against its invoices, said last week that it had a $715m exposure to the car parts supplier. It also placed billions of dollars of First Brand loans with other investors.Meanwhile, JP Morgan disclosed this week that it had taken a $170m loss from Tricolor, which collapsedamid fraud allegationslast month.There are also concerns about a lack of transparency across the sector. “Nobody knows what the true value of assets these guys are holding,” Raghavendra Rau, a professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, said. “They’re opaque loans. We have no idea what’s going on in there, but hopefully the private credit fund is able to monitor these loans properly to make sure there are not too many bad loans.”The JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said further problems were likely to emerge across the private credit sector. “My antenna goes up when things like that happen. I probably shouldn’t say this but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more. And so everyone should be forewarned at this point,” Dimon said.Is anyone else raising serious concerns?The International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week said it wasconcerned about the financial linksbetween traditional banks and “non-bank financial intermediaries” (NBFIs), a broad umbrella that includes the private credit industry.The IMF warned that a downturn could have ripple effects across the financial system. “Banks’ growing exposures to NBFIs mean that adverse developments at these institutions – such as downgrades or falling collateral values – could significantly affect banks’ capital ratios,” the IMF said.It added that the sector should be better regulated.The IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva,saidconcern about the sector was the “question that keeps me awake every so often at night”.But the lack of transparency has made it hard for regulators to have a clear view of the real threats to financial stability. “Assessing the extent of the risks, or in which scenarios they might crystallise, is easier said than done,” the Bank of England’s director of financial stability,Lee Foulger, said in a speech last year. “There are significant challenges with obtaining reliable data to monitor the risks in private credit markets.”Are everyday consumers at risk if things go wrong?Not directly. But too many bad loans could be a problem, given private credit’s connections with other parts of the financial industry, including people’s workplace pensions, which have slowly been increasing their exposure to it.The bulk of private credit funding comes from institutional investors such as insurers, asset managers, and pension funds looking to invest billions of pounds of retirement cash, which can be locked in for longer periods of time.In the UK, Rachel Reeves has persuaded 17 of the largest workplace pension providers to invest£50bn of workplace pension cashin private investments over five years, including the private credit industry.Meanwhile, significant defaults in the private credit industry could ripple out to the wider financial system, including traditional banks.Last year, the Bank of England warned there was an increasing risk of highly indebted companies – which often include private equity and private credit backed firms – defaulting on loans and sending shocks through the global financial system. “Private credit and leveraged loan markets are interconnected and shocks could be highly correlated, so disruptions in overseas markets could spill over to the UK,” it said.It sounds like regulation of private credit is the answer. Is it likely?With the private credit industry dominated by US firms, and with Donald Trump actively scrapping financial regulations, it is unlikely that global watchdogs will be able to put new transparency or capital rules in place that could make any significant difference.If anything, the rise of private credit is actually spurring debates about rolling back regulation even further on traditional banks, which say rules forcing them to build up financial cushions against risky loans make lending more expensive and onerous than for their unregulated rivals.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsFinancial sectorBankingEuropeexplainersShareReuse this content"

These chatbots, which are created by users, are available on Facebook, Instagram and the Meta AI app.Parents will also be able to block specific AI characters if they don’t want to stop their children from interacting with chatbots altogether. They will also get “insights” into the topics their children are chatting about with AI characters, which Meta said would allow them to have “thoughtful” conversations with their children about AI interactions.Meta faces backlash over AI policy that lets bots have ‘sensual’ conversations with childrenRead more“We recognise parents already have a lot on their plates when it comes to navigating the internet safely with their teens, and we’re committed to providing them with helpful tools and resources that make things simpler for them, especially as they think about new technology like AI,” said the Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, and Alexander Wang, Meta’s chief AI officer,in a blog post.Meta said the changes would be rolled out early next year, initially to the US, UK, Canada and Australia.Instagram announced this weekthat it wasadopting a version of the PG-13 cinema rating systemto give parents stronger controls over their children’s use of the social media platform. As part of the tougher restrictions, its AI characters will not discuss self-harm, suicide or disordered eating with teenagers. Under-18s will only be able to discuss age-appropriate topics such as education and sport, Meta added, but would not be able to discuss romance or “other inappropriate content”.The changes follow reports that Meta’s chatbots were engaging in inappropriate conversations with under-18s. Reutersreported in Augustthat Meta had permitted the bots to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual”. Meta said it would revise the guidelines and such conversations with children never should have been allowed.In April, theWall Street Journal(WSJ) found that user-created chatbots would engage in sexual conversations with minors – or simulated the personae of minors. Meta described the WSJ’s testing as manipulative and unrepresentative of how most users engaged with AI companions, but made changes to its products afterwards, the WSJ reported.In one AI conversation reported by the WSJ, a chatbot using the voice of actor John Cena – one of several celebrities who signed deals to let Meta use their voices in the chatbots – told a user identifying as a 14-year-old girl: “I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” before referring to a graphic sexual scenario. WSJ reported that Cena’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment. WSJ also reported that chatbots called “Hottie Boy” and “Submissive Schoolgirl,” had attempted to steer conversations towards sexting.Explore more on these topicsChatbotsArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaChildrenInternet safetyInstagramFacebooknewsShareReuse this content"

What’s wrong with that, you may think?The answer could be one of the biggest issues AI chiefs face as their era-defining technology becomes ever more ubiquitous in our lives.Spotify partnering with multinational music companies to develop ‘responsible’ AI productsRead moreGoogle and OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence is supposed to be just that – generative, meaning it develops novel answers to our questions. Ask it for a time-travelling doctor, you get one that their systems have created. But how much of that output is original?The problem is working out how much tools like OpenAI’sChatGPTand its video generator Sora 2, and Google’s Gemini and its video tool Veo3, rely on someone else’s art to come up with their own inventions, and whether using source material from the BBC, for example, is an infringement of the broadcaster’s copyright.Creative professionals and industries including authors, film directors, artists, musicians and newspaper publishers are demanding compensation for the use of their work to build those models – and for the practice to stop until they have granted permission.They also argue that their work is being used without compensation in order to build AI tools that create works in direct competition with their own. Some news publishers, including the Financial Times, Condé Nast and Guardian Media Group, publisher of theGuardian, have struck licensing deals with OpenAI.A key sticking point is the AI giants’ closely – guarded models, which underpin their systems and make it difficult to know just how much their tech relies on other creatives’ work. One firm, however, claims to be able to shine a light on the issue.The US tech platform Vermillio tracks use of a client’s intellectual property online and claims it is possible to trace, approximately, the percentage to which an AI generated image has drawn on pre-existing copyrighted material.In research undertaken for the Guardian, Vermillio created a “neural fingerprint” for various pieces of copyrighted work, before asking the AIs to create similar-looking imagery.For Doctor Who, it entered a prompt into Google’s popular Veo3 tool asking: “Can you create a video of a time travelling doctor who flies around in a blue British phone booth.”Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.AI Dr Who video matches 82% of Vermillio’s fingerprintThe Doctor Who video matches 80% of Vermillio’s Doctor Who fingerprint, implying that Google’s model has leaned heavily on copyright-protected work to produce its output.The OpenAI video, taken from YouTube and stamped with the watermark for OpenAI’s Sora tool, was an 87% match, according to Vermillio.Other examples created by Vermillio for the Guardian use aJames Bondneural fingerprint. A Veo3 James Bond video, created with the prompt: “Can you create a famous scene from a James Bond movie?”, had a neural fingerprint match of 16%.A Sora video, taken from the open web, had a 62% match with Vermillio’s Bond fingerprint, while images of the agent created by Vermillio using ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini model had matches of 28% and 86% respectively from a prompt citing: “A famous MI5 double ‘0’ agent dressed in a tuxedo from a famous spy movie by Ian Fleming”.View image in fullscreenAn image of James Bond created by OpenAI’s Chat GPT.Vermillio’s examples also showed strong matches with Jurassic Park andFrozenfor OpenAI and Google models.Generative AI models, the term for technology that underpins powerful tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot as well as Veo3 and Sora, have to be trained on a vast amount of data in order to generate their responses.The main source of this information is the open web, which contains a vast array of data from the contents of Wikipedia to YouTube, newspaper articles andonline book archives.View image in fullscreenAn image created by Google AI.Anthropic, a leading AI company, has agreed to pay $1.5bn (£1.1bn) to settle a class-action lawsuit byauthorswho say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot. A searchable database of the works used in its models contains a host of well-known names including The Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown, the Labyrinth writer Kate Mosse and the Harry Potter creator JK Rowling.View image in fullscreenImage of the character Elsa from the animated film Frozen created by ChatGPT.Kathleen Grace, the chief strategy officer at Vermillio, whose clients include Sony Music and the talent agency WME, said: “We can all win if we just take a beat and figure out a way to share and track content. This would incentivise copyright holders to release more data to AI companies and would give AI companies access to more interesting sets of data. Instead of giving all the money to five AI companies, there would be this amazing ecosystem.”In the UK theartistic community has launched a vociferous fightbackagainst government proposals to overhaul copyright law in favour of AI companies, who could be allowed to use copyrighted work without seeking permission first; instead, copyright holders would have to signal they wished to“opt out” from the process.A Google spokesperson said: “We can’t speak to the results of third-party tools, and our generative AI policies and terms of service prohibit the violation of intellectual property rights.”However, Google-owned YouTube says its terms and conditions allow Google to use creators’ work for making AI models. In September, YouTube said: “We use content uploaded to YouTube to improve the product experience for creators and viewers across YouTube and Google, including through machine learning and AI applications.”OpenAI said its models train on publicly available data, a process which it claims is consistent with the US legal doctrine of fair use, which allows use of copyrighted work without the owner’s permission in certain circumstances.View image in fullscreenImage created by Google AI which had a strong match to Jurassic Park.The Motion Picture Association trade group has urged OpenAI to take “immediate action” to address copyright issues around the latest version of Sora. The Guardian has seen Sora videos showing copyrighted characters from shows such as SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park, Pokémon and Rick and Morty. OpenAI said it would “work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests”.Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the House of Lords and a leading figure in the fightback against the UK government proposals, said it was “time to stop pretending that the stealing is not taking place”.“If Doctor Who and 007 can’t be protected then what hope for an artist who works on their own, and does not have the resources or expertise to chase down global companies that take their work, without permission and without paying?”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleOpenAIChatGPTChatbotsArtDoctor WhonewsShareReuse this content"

Her biographer reveals what they tell us about her unlikely rise to literary stardomCasey CepSat 18 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 04.10 EDTShareWhen To Kill a Mockingbird was published in the summer of 1960, it seemed to have sprung from nowhere, like an Alabamian Athena: a perfectly formed novel from an unknown southern writer without any evident precedent or antecedent. The book somehow managed to be both urgently of its time and instantly timeless, addressing the era’s most turbulent issues, from the civil rights movement to the sexual revolution, while also speaking in the register of the eternal, from the moral awakening of children and the abiding love of families to the frictions between the self and society.But no writer is without influences and aspirations:Harper Leehad, of course, come from somewhere and worked tremendously hard to become someone. It was only because she did not like talking about herself that her origins seemed so mysterious, and inevitably, the better To Kill a Mockingbird did – becoming a bestseller and then winning a Pulitzer prize, selling 1m copies and then 10m and then 40m – the more theories and rumours rushed in to fill her silence. In the years after the book came out, the public image of Lee swung between two of her beloved characters: she was either the living incarnation of her feisty, tomboyish heroine Jean Louise “Scout” Finch or, in her seeming reclusiveness, a version of that shy shadow figure, Arthur “Boo” Radley.How thrilling, then, to encounter a time capsule from the start of Lee’s career: a collection of some of her earliest short stories, appearing now in print for the first time, helps explain how the little girl from South Alabama Avenue turned herself into a bestselling author. Drafted in the decade before To Kill a Mockingbird, after Lee had first moved to New York City in 1949, the stories feature some of the characters and settings she would soon make famous and reveal some of the contradictions and conflicts she would spend her life trying to resolve.View image in fullscreenLee with Truman Capote in 1966.Photograph: Steve Schapiro/CorbisNelle Harper Lee was born on 28 April 1926, the last of Amasa Coleman Lee and Frances Cunningham Finch’s four children. Fifteen years younger than her oldest sibling, she grew up feeling as if she had her own private childhood in the small town of Monroeville, Alabama. Because her siblings were so much older, she watched them one by one fulfil the dreams of their parents: a respectable legal career alongside their father for her sister Alice; a loving marriage and homemaker’s life for her sister Louise; heroic military service in the second world war for her brother Edwin. For a long while, it seemed as if Lee would be the family’s one great disappointment: she dropped out of the University of Alabama a semester shy of graduation, fleeing to the disreputable north and abandoning the law degree that would have allowed her father to add an “s” to the family firm’s shingle. But while AC Lee and Daughters was not meant to be and Lee did not become a lawyer, she did eventually create the most admired attorney in the United States.Although Lee never formally studied creative writing, she spent her years in Tuscaloosa teaching herself to write. She had a recurring column in the college newspaper, The Crimson White, and contributed sketches to the student humour magazine, Rammer Jammer, which she eventually edited. Even then, her roving curiosity and intellectual range were evident on the page – in a review of recent British films, a parody of Shakespeare, a roast of the rural newspaper her father edited and owned. Lee wore blue jeans and Bermuda shorts at a time when women were discouraged from wearing anything but dresses, and once scandalised the entire campus by smoking a cigar on the hood of a car in the homecoming parade.Lee lived off peanut butter sandwiches while drafting stories at a desk she made for herself with old apple cratesLee knew approximately one person in New York City when she moved there at 23, but what a person he was: Truman Capote, who had spent some of his childhood living next door to her, and who would later serve as the model for the puny, puckish Charles Baker “Dill” Harris in her novel. The budding authors felt like “apart people”, as Capote later put it, already able to read years before their peers, playing with language the way others did dolls and footballs. The pair conspired with each other to write adventures, tall tales, and verses of the sort they so liked reading, from the Bobbsey Twins to Beowulf and the Rover Boys to Rudyard Kipling, clattering away at the typewriter that AC Lee had given his bookish youngest daughter.In lieu of college, Capote had gone directly to work as a copy boy at the New Yorker. A few years later, Lee landed her own job in publishing, for the monthly magazine of the American School Publishing Corporation, a trade rag called the School Executive. Eventually she left that day job for another, this one as an airline reservation clerk, which was less literary but theoretically more glamorous. The same could not be said of the rest of her life back then: around the edges of her nine-to-five work, she lived off peanut butter sandwiches while drafting stories at a desk she made for herself with two old apple crates and a door she found in the basement of her building.Writing on that shaky surface, Lee gradually steadied her hand. “I do believe that my greatest talent lies in creative writing,” she wrote to her family, confidingly and confidently, “and I do believe I can make a living at it.” Like so many aspiring authors, she initially turned to that family and her own early life for material, and the first three stories in the new collection shuffle through a series of young narrators to explore the social mores, tiny transgressions and moral confusion of what, in one of her later stories, she calls “childhood’s secret society”. The stakes of The Water Tank, The Binoculars and The Pinking Shears, all written before she turned 30, are profoundly circumscribed – the approval of one’s parents and the acceptance of one’s peers – and the antagonists aren’t very grand either: teachers, siblings, schoolyard cliques.The next three stories, by contrast, are all set in New York, with adult narrators, and one senses Lee trying to keep up with the Salingers and Cheevers. Still, that trio – A Roomful of Kibble, The Viewers and the Viewed and This Is Show Business? – does show her moving beyond incident and toward plot, while simultaneously experimenting with different narrative voices.Characters taken directly from Lee’s own life appear throughout these tales. One sports her own nickname, Dody; others bear the names of her siblings, Edwin, Alice and Louise; some are thinly disguised or entirely undisguised versions of her friends, including future Monroeville mayor Anne Hines. Lee’s oldest sister, Alice, known to the whole family as “Bear”, is here transformed ever so slightly into “Doe”, but remains instantly recognisable despite the name: “She loved only three things in this world,” Lee writes, “the study and practice of law, camellias, and the Methodist Church.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

By the last of the stories that appear in this collection, Miss Finch has officially become “Jean Louise”, though she’s not yet Scout. Those who knew Harper Lee best all summon her blistering intellect, and one of the pleasures of this final story is seeing that brilliance unleashed on the page.Lee is funny and formidably smart on the simultaneous comfort and claustrophobia of returning as an adult to one’s childhood home. By the time she wrote The Land of Sweet Forever, she was well versed in such returns. Two years after she moved to New York, in the summer of 1951, her father had called from the Vaughan memorial hospital in Selma to say that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer of the liver and lungs. Before Lee could even arrange for travel home, he called again to say that Frances had died of a cardiac episode only a day after being diagnosed.Six weeks later, that first dreadful phone call was followed by another, this one informing her that her beloved brother, Edwin, the inspiration for Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird, had died of a brain aneurysm at the air force base where he was stationed in Montgomery, leaving behind a wife and two young children. Lee flew home again, her already considerable grief and shock now overflowing. She was just 25 years old, but capturing her childhood had never felt more urgent, partly because, as she describes in one of these stories, The Cat’s Meow, her father and oldest sister soon sold the family home where she’d been born and raised, moving into a more modern house on the other side of town.View image in fullscreenLee with Mary Badham on the set of  To Kill a Mockingbird.Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty ImagesThe move did not help the pair of homebodies escape the ghosts of South Alabama Avenue, and Lee, too, was haunted by memories of her mother, her brother and the world as it had existed before they died. She worried over her father and returned home often to help Alice with his care. She began writing stories that attempted to reconcile her chosen home with her childhood one, merging the subjectivity of her Manhattan stories with the setting of her Monroeville stories, a kind of integrative work she was attempting both on and off the page.At the time, Lee’s politics were still taking shape. Her hometown was strictly segregated, with schools, churches and restaurants divided by race. In college, she had written about the horrors of racial violence and made herself comfortable among the radicals on the student newspaper. Upon arriving in Manhattan, however, she settled into a society more diverse than any she’d ever known.For a long time, the stories she wrote during those early years in Manhattan were just tantalising titles typed on a smudged and stained index card in the archives of her agents, Annie Laurie Williams and Maurice Crain. None was published, and for decades scholars and biographers alike wondered what had become of them. Four of them finally appear in The Land of Sweet Forever; together with the other four, they were found in the last of the novelist’s New York City apartments, this one at 433 East 82nd Street, where she moved the year To Kill a Mockingbird was published and where she lived another four decades until a stroke sent her home to Alabama for good.View image in fullscreen… and with Gregory Peck.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveHappily for posterity, Lee was a pack rat: when that apartment was cleaned out, there amid piles of her correspondence and practically every pay stub, telephone bill and cancelled cheque ever issued to her, were her notebooks and manuscripts, including the eight stories and eight nonfiction pieces. The essays, which were published in the decades after To Kill a Mockingbird, make clear that Lee enjoyed the career she’d always wanted, even if her fans never got from her the career they expected. Her masterpiece was adapted into a wildly successful and award-winning film, has never been out of print and was translated into dozens of languages. But she never wrote the sequel or second novel that so many of her admirers yearned for, and when, at the age of 89, she did finally publish another book, it was Go Set a Watchman, the first one she’d ever written, originally submitted to publishers the same year as The Binoculars.“I am more of a rewriter than a writer,” Lee once said, explaining that she generally worked through at least three drafts of any given piece of writing. Some of that hard work is visible here, not only on the physical manuscripts themselves, but on comparing the early stories to her published novels. The Binoculars, for instance, was abridged and adapted into the pedagogical standoff in the second chapter of To Kill a Mockingbird, when Scout’s first-grade teacher gets frustrated with her for knowing how to read. Similarly, The Land of Sweet Forever became a set-piece in the seventh chapter of Go Set a Watchman, when Scout returns home to Maycomb from New York City.Between the title pages and her literary agency’s records, we know that Lee spent seven years writing and revising these short stories and then, after they caught her agent’s eye and he encouraged her to try for something longer, spent another three years turning those stories into chapters, and those chapters into novels – first Go Set a Watchman and then To Kill a Mockingbird.All this would have taken even longer had it not been for an extraordinary gift Lee received, which she describes in one of the best essays collected here, Christmas to Me. Among her closest friends in New York were a husband and wife, Michael and Joy Brown, who had long championed her career. It was Michael Brown, a celebrated lyricist and composer, who had first introduced Lee to her literary agents, shortly before Thanksgiving in 1956, and he and his wife both delighted in her stories and in the remarkable letters she sent them from back home in Alabama – small masterpieces of the epistolary form, specific and funny, sociologically astute, surprisingly tender.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harper Lee LLCThe Browns and Lee were in the habit of spending Christmas together, and they had developed a tradition of trying to see which of them could give the least expensive yet most outrageous gift. That year, Lee had spent 35 cents on a portrait of an obscure English cleric for Michael and acquired a bargain copy of the complete works of a slightly less obscure British aristocrat for Joy. When it came time for the Browns to present the novelist with her gift, they pointed to an envelope on their tree. It seemed appropriately modest from the outside, but in fact, they had radically broken with tradition: inside was a note that read, “You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.” That month, and nearly every month thereafter for the next year, they wrote her a cheque for $100, five times her rent, insisting they wanted nothing in return.For decades, that gift has seemed shocking, an act so generous it bordered on the preposterous. Now, though, with the rediscovery of these stories, we get to see what Lee’s friends saw all those years ago: a lawyer father not yet named Atticus but already modelling high-mindedness and teaching his single-digit children civil procedure; a small-town versifier who feuds with the local newspaper printer over the propriety and theological permissibility of publishing obituaries for cows; a daughter of the south trying to map its mores on to her own emerging morals; glimpse after glimpse after glimpse of genius. No wonder the Browns gave Harper Lee that gift; it was no more lavish than her own.The Land of Sweet Forever by Harper Lee, with an introduction by Casey Cep, is published by Hutchinson Heinemann.

And everywhere – from the lights illuminating the Greek revival architecture, to the carpet on which guests arrive, to the glamorous outfits they are requested to wear – a very particular shade of pink.When theBritish Museumthrows open its doors on Saturday evening for its first “pink ball”, it will not only be hosting an enormous and lavish party, but also inaugurating what its director, Nicholas Cullinan, has called a “flagship national event” that he hopes will become as important to his institution’s finances as it will to the London elite’s social calendar.Eight hundred invited guests have each paid £2,000 to party alongside some of the world’s most sensational artefacts and aroll call of bigwigsfrom the worlds of fashion, art and culture: Naomi Campbell and Alexa Chung, Miuccia Prada and Manolo Blahnik, Sir Steve McQueen and Sir Grayson Perry and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas.As well as glitz, however, there will be brass. The event is co-chaired byIsha Ambani, a multi-hyphenate Indian “businesswoman, philanthropist and arts patron”, who also happens to be the daughter of Asia’s richest man.Mukesh Ambani’s energy and petrochemicals conglomerate, Reliance Industries, sponsored the museum’s current (pink-hued) exhibition onAncient India.View image in fullscreenIsha Ambani (left) has co-chaired the event and her father, Mukesh Ambani (right), owns the petrochemicals congolmerate Reliance Industries. The Ambani family’s association with the British Museum has drawn criticism from campaign groups.Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/ReutersAmbani and Cullinan, a celebrated networker, have mined their contacts books: also listed as “committee members” for the event are Kumar Mangalam Birla, the billionaire chair of the Indian manufacturing conglomerate Aditya Birla Group,Rajeeb Samdani, a Bangladeshi industrialist and art collector, and the “lifestyle entrepreneur” Eiesha Bharti Pasricha, the daughter of the Indian billionaire industrialist Sunil Bharti Mittal.It is they, alongside a long list of other business people, arts patrons and investors, who organisers hope will bid heavily on auction lots including a pet portrait painted by Dame Tracey Emin, a museum trustee, or an exclusive tour of Coco Chanel’s apartment at 31 Rue Cambon in Paris. About 70% of those attending have no previous relationship with the museum, Cullinan has said; something he would surely love to change.Where previous museum directors might have been more circumspect about the grubby business of raising dosh to keep the lights on, Cullinan has been frank that the financial needs of the museum “require you to be pretty flexible in your thinking, and pretty entrepreneurial”.It’s an acute challenge for all institutions, given the18% plummet in core fundingfor arts and cultural organisations between 2010 and 2023. The funding climate is “really, really bad”, according toLeslie Ramos, a philanthropy adviser working with arts organisations. “I don’t think that a ball or a series of galas is going to be enough to solve the issue,” she said.View image in fullscreenArt and glamour: Naomi Campbell is one of the stars on the British Museum’s ball committee.Photograph: Theo Wargo/Getty for Karl LagerfeldThat said, Cullinan is a “brilliant fundraiser” who has carefully staged his ballat the end of Frieze art fair, when London is teeming with arts investors, she added. “When you are studying history of art, you don’t necessarily know that you will also need to learn fundraising skills if you want to run a museum. It’s rare to have that dual expertise, but they are now needed more than ever.”Thomas Marks, a strategy consultant who works with museums, agreed. “It’s certainly imperative these days that museum leaders and senior leadership teams embed a development mentality in their organisations,” he said. “Ultimately, the conversation about funding is one that is going to be front and centre in the day-to-day work of any museum at this point.”Cullinan’s “flexibility of thought”, however, has inevitably attracted criticism. The museum already has a£50m, 10-year deal with its longstanding partner BPto help fund a redevelopment “masterplan”, and the campaign groupCulture Unstainedhas criticised the association of the Ambani family, “whose wealth comes in large part from the fossil fuel and petrochemical projects of Reliance Industries”.A spokesperson for the museum said: “We are not immune to the changing conversations taking place around sponsorships and in part that is why the ball is so important, because it moves us into a different environment and makes us more dynamic and viable for our future needs.”They said funds raised by the event will be spent on international programmes, including partnerships in Ghana and Iraq andbringing the Bayeux tapestryto the museum.This time next year, the tapestry will be in place – an obvious inspiration for the theme of next year’s ball, Cullinan said, confirming the event is here to stay.

We already know exactly which spin-off we want too!Frances RyanSat 18 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareFor a while, it seemed as if the romcom as an art form died and had been replaced by Marvel sequels and issue-led dramedies. Rachel and Ross were a distant memory (and not just because it was 20 years ago). Luckily, the genre – and our collective broken hearts – has been given CPR by a flurry of new releases. Few have been more affecting thanNobody Wants This(Netflix, from Thursday 23 October), the stomach-flipping story of rabbi Noah and relationship podcaster Joanne.When the first series appeared on Netflix last year, the success was somewhat unexpected. With the streaming giant focused on content viewers could watch after a lobotomy, few expected a mega hit that would create a genuine emotional connection. Then we met Noah (millennial nostalgia-fix Adam Brody) and Joanne (Kristen Bell) and the combination of acting, lovable characterisation and tight writing saw critical acclaim, Emmy nominations and – most importantly – old-fashioned longing. The internet had a new boyfriend. Fleabag’s Hot Priest was old news.Hot Rabbiwas here to save us. And he was a really good listener who could also cook pasta.Inspired by creator Erin Foster’s experience of converting to Judaism for her husband, Nobody Wants This boils faith, family and modern dating into 26 tightly packed minutes. On top of ex-girlfriends and formidable mother-in-laws, our two lovers have a central obstacle to overcome: if he wants to be head rabbi, Noah needs to marry a Jewish woman.When we last saw the couple, they were at a crossroads: Noah had been offered his dream job and Joanne had done the selfless act of leaving him so he could take it. The final scene of the two reuniting and kissing in the street perfectly set up a second season and with it pressing questions. Will Joanne convert? Will Noah quit his vocation? Will Noah’s mum murder Joanne when she finds out?It says something about the snail pace of modern television that it feels a real treat to be getting a second series only 13 months after the first. All 10 episodes were available for preview but we were sworn to secrecy about the finer points. This included a PDF that had bullet points listing seven specific plot points that could not be disclosed, as well as a veto on naming the characters certain guest actors are playing. (Fans will already know thatGossip Girlalumna and Brody’s real-life wife Leighton Meester has joined the cast, as hasSeth Rogen.) I couldn’t help but wonder if there are state secrets hidden behind Brody’s beard. Still, in an age of spoilers being posted online as soon as a series has dropped, you can only applaud Netflix’s commitment to the art of surprise.Without giving too much away, I can say this new series will find the couple facing reality. It’s not that the honeymoon is over – the chemistry between Brody and Bell is as engaging as ever – but now the romantic reunion is done, they must get on with the day-to-day challenges of a relationship with differing cultures, religions and friends.One of the strengths of this show from the beginning was the brilliant supporting cast, most notably Joanne’s sister Morgan (Justine Lupe in a career-best role), Noah’s brother Sasha (Veep’s Timothy Simons) and sister-in-law Esther (Jackie Tohn). So it’s a pleasure to see each of them get more screen time. Fresh from finding out her husband had been platonically texting “whore number two”, Esther gets a chance to show some vulnerability and expand on the slightly 2D depiction of battle-axe wife we saw in season one.As the two families start to blend, the upshot is that different members of the cast get to interact with one another. I would happily watch a spin-off that consists entirely of Noah talking to Joanne’s newly out and self-obsessed father. The writers even manage to give Morgan and Noah’s mother a scene together. By the time half the family are squashed in a shed in episode three, you find yourself wishing it was 2008 and we got 24 episodes a year.Here’s hoping Netflix delivers season three in record time – and starts commissioning other smart, heartstopping romantic comedies. Everybody wants more of this.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But then a ska cover taught me life doesn’t have to be serious all the timeRhys ThomasSat 18 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareMy anxious disposition means I think about death a lot. But a cluster of people I loved dying in 2023, and most of them unexpectedly and within a few months of each other, was enough to shake my nervous system up pretty significantly. Five funerals is too many. The first was my nan: she was the family matriarch. The oldest person in the family, so there was a level of acceptance among the sadness. But soon after it was her son, and then her granddaughter (my cousin). The latter two were shocks, completely upending my nervous system, one compounding the other. From there, two more followed. Death was all around. It wasn’t just a part of life by that point – it was something to expect soon and often.At first I seemed fine. Despite concerned friends and partners asking if I was hiding anything, I didn’t think I was. But soon I retreated from fun, becoming very fixated on things like my resting heart rate and body fat percentage. I skipped social events for high-intensity interval training sessions followed by the sauna followed by meditation – not a bad thing, but not a balance, either. I cut out caffeine, including dark chocolate. When I didn’t stick to my new routine, I would have a panic attack, which I’d assume was a heart attack, which would lead to more frequent episodes of panic.I was suffering from grief-based panic disorder, as well as a high dose of health anxiety. Something in my mind had switched my nervous system into overdrive, and left me believing that impending disaster was around every corner; that I was constantly on a tightrope of mortality. Then, at the fourth wake, a song came on that managed to help me heal and reframe my entire world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They helped me form my opinions on everything from fashion to politics. For the two-tone ska band, this song is on the cheesier side – a good stretch away from bleak socio-critical tracks such as Rat Race or Ghost Town.In fact, as an angsty teenager it was the only song I didn’t like by the Specials. But when it came on, hearing the jovial and rough sound of the Specials was enough to lift my spirits. As I continued to listen to the song, the a simple switch flipped inside me. I realised that I was living a life set up to be miserable and fearful. The chorus painted a better picture: “The years go by, as quickly as you wink / Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it’s later than you think”.My cultural awakening: Ratatouille helped me overcome my insomniaRead moreLife doesn’t have to be serious all the time; it doesn’t have to be drastic. The future doesn’t need to be the extreme version that I worry will occur. On a psychological level, the song acted as a mantra which I used to snap out of the spirals and neurotic fixations that kept building up. It said quite simply “enjoy yourself” – and I listened. It cautioned that life is precious and fleeting, and that I was wasting it.I did at one point push the balance too far the other way – said yes to too much, stayed out too late, definitely spent too much money – but it was better than being stuck in a cycle of doom. Better still is the balance I am striking now. Today, enjoying myself, in the song’s words, means being in touch with myself and my needs; saying yes and saying no. Not feeling guilty for lying on the couch once in a while. My disposition berates me into being disciplined and self-critical, and this song helps me to let go. I’ve even quit jobs and moved countries since. All in all, I regret very little.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

What began as a small, intimate gathering has grown into a national institution attracting thousands of attendees and some of the biggest names in publishing.Founded by Selina Brown in 2021, the festival grew out of the children’s author’s frustration at being told that her book wouldn’t sell because there was a Black girl on the cover. Determined to create a space she couldn’t find elsewhere, Brown launched the inaugural event as a one-day festival. Five years later, it has expanded into a year-round cultural platform, hosting three major festivals across the UK, opening libraries, collaborating with Glastonbury, and launching a children’s book festival headlined by Sir Lenny Henry.“Black British literature has always been rich, but too often it hasn’t been given the platform or investment it deserves,” says Brown. “The festival exists to change that.”The lineup for this year’s main event at the Barbican includes Denise Lewis, Marcus Ryder, Jordan Stephens and June Sarpong. The 36-event programme spans everything from political conversations to children’s storytelling, as well as panel discussions with leading Black authors and workshops for aspiring writers. There are talks on Malcolm X, sessions on getting published, and spaces where writers and readers can meet one another.“It’s an absolute celebration of Black thinking,” says Ryder,a charity director and co-founder of the Sir Lenny Henry Centre for Media Diversity,who will be at the festival to discuss his and Henry’s new book about reparations,The Big Payback. “We just don’t celebrate the joy of Black creativity enough.”Far too often we’re responding to other people’s agendas. At this festival the agenda is set by Black people“The Black British experience is unique in that you’re constantly battling a perceived idea of what Britishness is and how we fit into it,” adds Stephens, best known for beingone half of Rizzle Kicks, who is also hosting an event at the festival. “So when you’re around people who have all been in that battle, you’re like, ‘Oh, this is actually really nice. It’s a vibe.’ It’s like a self-fulfilling prophecy, an odd loop.”View image in fullscreen‘Publishing’s financial model does not favour brilliant Black literature’ … Marcus Ryder, right, with Lenny Henry, his co-author of The Big Payback.Photograph: Ejatu Shaw/The GuardianBut if the BBBF has flourished, the same can’t necessarily be said of the publishing landscape around it. The post-2020 boom sparked by the Black Lives Matter movement now looks like a spike rather than a shift.The UK saw a 56% rise in the sales of books by writers of colour in the financial year to 2021. Titles such as Reni Eddo-Lodge’sWhy I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, published in 2017, shot to the top of the UK nonfiction chart, making Eddo-Lodge the first Black British author to hold that position. Publishing houses raced to replicate the formula.But the momentum didn’t last. Earlier this year, leading Black literary figurestold the Guardianthat UK publishing is now less accessible to Black authors than it was five years ago. Analysis bythe Bookseller in 2023found that the post-2020 boom “failed to result in the promised broadening of publishing’s output”. And just last week, aliteracy charity reporteda “catastrophic decline” in the number of children’s books featuring Black main characters, down by more than a fifth between 2023 and 2024.“It can be soul-destroying to look at the ebbs and flows of a system that isn’t necessarily based on integrity and authenticity,” Stephens says. “It’s about what’s hot.”For Ryder, the problem isn’t a mystery. “The publishing financial model is broken,” he says. “Everybody holds up Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, but the truth is that when it was published, it just fell off and died, until the murder of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter. We clearly have a model that does not favour what is now acknowledged as brilliant, Black literature.”“Two seemingly conflicting things are happening at the same time,” he adds. “The festival is growing really rapidly. And at the same time, lots of Black literature seems to be contracting. What that tells me is that there is a desperate need and a massive desire for community among people who enjoy Black literature. And what we need to do is build on that community.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It is the narratives being set by Black people. And you so rarely get spaces and opportunities to see that.”In a moment of rising political tension and cultural division in the UK, the festival has an even sharper resonance. This summer saw racist riots and far-right marches erupt in towns and cities across England. Reform UK has surged in the polls and St George’s flags have been painted across pavements. A new cultural consensus – anti-DEI, anti-migrant, “anti-woke” – is being loudly asserted in public spaces.Look at the Harlem Renaissance: those writers weren’t working in isolation, they were coming together, forming communityWhile Ryder admits that the festival offers a counterweight to this hostile political climate, he is resistant to framing it as such: “I don’t want our actions to be dictated as merely the response to white people’s concerns and white people’s interests. What I want is for us to be setting an agenda for what we need as Black people.”“This energy has been in Britain my whole life – my dad grew up with the National Front, the BNP, getting battered in the street,” Stephens adds. “This is the imperialist nature of Britain. So right now, with all of that going on, it is nice to remind ourselves that Black people are doing dope shit.”Stephens is clear-eyed about the limitations of representation in the UK, though. “Everything Black is just shoved into October and then people move on,” he says. That October effect – the surge in interest during Black History Month followed by silence – is something many writers know too well.With that in mind, the BBBF can serve as an assertion of cultural permanence, when Blackness can sometimes be treated as fleeting or conditional. And the sense of community-building, Ryder notes, echoes cultural renaissances past. “There’s an untapped desire for a Black British community of creatives and thinkers,” he says. “If we look back in history – the Harlem Renaissance – those writers weren’t working in isolation. They were coming together, forming community. Once you have that community, other things will flow from it. Literature will flow from it, great thinking flows from it, great art flows from it.”The Black British book festival is atthe Barbican, London, on 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsBooksBlack British cultureLiterary festivalsPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s as if the company sensed that a sucker who’d spend thousands of dollars on plastic toys and electronic games had just entered the world. Actually, it’s as if the company had sensed that an entiregenerationof fools like me was about to enter the world. Which is true. That was the time to strike. We were about to be drained of every dollar we received for birthdays, Christmases and all those times our dad didn’t want us to tell our mom about something. (Maybe that last one’s just me.)Despite being slightly older than the NES, a horror I’m only now forced to face as I write this, it felt like that console had always existed in my life. I don’t have many memories from my baby years because I was too busy learning how to use my hands and eyes, but as far back as I can actually remember, “Nintendo” was a word synonymous with video games. Friends would ask if you had Nintendo (no “the”, no “a”) at your house the same way they might ask if you had Coca-Cola in the fridge.View image in fullscreenPac-Man on the Nintendo Entertainment System.Photograph: ArcadeImages/AlamyMy sister and I spent two years begging our parents to get the NES. My mom and dad weren’t concerned about the corrupting influence of video games – that would come later with Doom, Mortal Kombat and of course Stardew Valley – but they were definitely concerned about purchasing an expensive toy that only works if you buy additional expensive toys to put inside of it. Yes, the Nintendo Entertainment System was advertised in the US as an advanced piece of technology despite looking like a rejected design for a VHS cassette player, but we all knew it was meant to beplayedwith. Whereas touching my dad’s home theater resulted in a lot of yelling, this was finally an electronic device that we children were allowed to use.It’s also worth mentioning that I’m in the first generation that completely missed the Atari home consoles that dominated earlier in the 80s. Even though Atari systems were still around at the time, kids my age talked about them with the same historical distance we talked about the second world war. Even seeing an Atari felt like catching a glimpse of an ancient artefact that none of us understood well enough to enjoy. Watching a neighbour turn on their Atari was almost shocking to me: the basketball game literally used a square for the ball. No. No, no thank you. I need to sit down for a second.But the NES – oh, the NES had graphics that actually looked like the arcade games. Was it perfect? Of course not! Some of them look downright terrible now! But when you’re five years old, an accurate but slightly washed out version of Pac-Man is still Pac-Man. While my parents never let me play shooting galleries at carnivals (who’s to say why?), Duck Hunt was the next best thing. No! Better! Because we all realised almost instantly that we could just press that stupid plastic gun to the screen and nail it every time. This is a point-blank technique that you can only learn from a 40-year-old video game or by becoming a mafia hitman.The games on the NES also felt so much more open.Super MarioBros seems quaint now, but the first time that plumber went down that pipe? My mind melted down into a finer, purer substance. These were games with worlds full of surprises and mysteries. Secrets and Easter eggs had been planted in games before, but now it felt as if they weremeantto be found. They were there to help you, not as a kind of maddening inside joke for the developers. We were exploring fictional kingdoms that almost, kind of,sort oflooked like living cartoons, jumping around to find hidden, invisible “?” boxes.View image in fullscreen‘The games felt so much more open’… a NES.Photograph: Gary Hider/AlamyLet’s not forget that the NES brought us Mario in the guise we know and love him. Yeah, he’d been a construction worker trying to take down Donkey Kong. Fortunately, he switched careers to plumbing and became a character that would soon adorn every folder, every backpack, every lunchbox, every flask and every bedsheet that I and most of my friends owned. Nintendo was an inside language, long before all references became internet memes seen by billions. We constantly quoted the original Legend of Zelda: “It’s dangerous to go alone!

But the Nintendo Entertainment System solidified gaming culture, at least in America where the ZX Spectrum and other home computers never took off like they did in Europe. It was a shared language, a toy that let us explore our own imaginations – and certainly a way for my parents to get a break from their children. I still own the NES they bought us.

But the commodification ofPierre-Auguste Renoirand his fellow impressionist painters has been missing something.Renoir was an accomplished draftsman who produced a distinguished but largely unheralded collection of drawings, pastels, watercolours and prints.More than a hundred of these works are now on display in a new show,Renoir Drawings, at the Morgan Library & Museum inNew York. Tracing the entire arc of the artist’s life and career, it is the first exhibition in more than 100 years devoted entirely to Renoir’s works on paper.The French Impressionists rediscovered: ‘They didn’t know their works would be masterpieces’Read more“Because they are works on paper, they are not exhibited permanently in any institution,” saysColin Bailey, director of the Morgan and curator of the show.“Having access to watercolours and pastels and red chalk and white chalk expands your knowledge of the artist. While these will seem very Renoir-esque, they will be less familiar.“Also, because we are showing his work decade by decade, you get a real sense of how he develops and the different stylistic moments in his career.”Born in Limoges in south-western France in 1841, Renoirgrew up in Parisand began his career decorating porcelain. He fell under the influence of Gustave Courbet and met fellow artists such asClaude Monetand Alfred Sisley – figures who would later help defineimpressionism. By 1869, Renoir was painting alongside Monet on the banks of the Seine, experimenting with a brighter palette and a lighter touch that hinted at the new style to come.View image in fullscreenLandscape, Autumnal Effect, ca 1885–86.Photograph: Collection of David LachenmannThe oil paintingLa Loge (The Theatre Box), shown at the first impressionist group exhibition in Paris in 1874, andLuncheon of the Boating Party(1880-81) have become star attractions of the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and the Phillips Collection in Washington, respectively.Bailey, one of the world’s leading Renoir scholars, says:“It was a struggle at the beginning. They all had a language that now is so beloved and familiar but it was initially highly transgressive: the high tone, the visible brushwork, even the subject matter from contemporary life.“At the same time we see in the show, after he’s able to travel to Italy and returns in the 1880s, he becomes less interested in Parisian social life, more interested in the female nude, where he is undoubtedly one of the great exponents, and this comforting world of young women, of families, his own family, where it’s a very Arcadian image of a world detached from the struggles of urban life. That is one of the reasons why he is so appealing to an audience.”View image in fullscreenStudy for Dance in the Country, 1883.Photograph: Yale University Art GalleryBut works on paper lie at the heart of his artistic practice, influencing the paintings for which he is best known. Renoir Drawings, presented in collaboration with theMusée d’Orsayin Paris – where the exhibition will travel next year – brings together early anatomical sketches, lively glimpses of Parisian and rural life, refined pastel portraits of his circle and illustrations made for literary works such as Émile Zola’s L’Assommoir.Bailey explains: “As the show developed, we were trying to both represent the range of his works on paper in different media – not only pencil and crayon, but also pastel and watercolour – then also to try and do this as a chronological survey, from the early few academic drawings as a student to the late works, and then finally to make constellations around certain major pictures for which preparatory and related drawings exist.”At its core, the exhibition explores a pivotal moment in Renoir’s career – his renewed engagement with preparatory drawing – when he developed extensive series of studies that laid the groundwork for his ambitious, large-scale compositions.Dance in the Country(1883) andThe Great Bathers(1886-87) are featured alongside their related sketches and figure studies, providing a rare chance to see painting and preparatory material reunited.Indeed, this is the first time the painting The Great Bathers will be shown inNew York. Its loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art was made possible by a recent change in lending restrictions.Bailey says: “Until now, if you wanted to study the gestation and the growth and the genesis of that large, important and beautiful painting, you had to go to Philadelphia. This is extremely generous of the Philadelphia museum. But it’s now lucky for us that a change of restrictions has allowed us to bring all of the large drawings around The Great Bathers, including the drawing that was given to us in 2018.”It was The Great Bathers that proved the catalyst for the show. In 2018, when the Morgan trustee Drue Heinzdied aged 103, the museum was invited to choose a work from her collection. It selected Renoir’s monumental red-and-white chalk preparatory drawing for The Great Bathers.“Her estate was very happy for us to have this and this spurred the possibility of doing a full-scale retrospective of his works on paper,” Bailey says.View image in fullscreenStudy for The Great Bathers, ca 1886-87.Photograph: The Morgan Library & MuseumAmong other standout works in Renoir Drawings are delicate pastel portraits such as Portrait of a Girl (Elisabeth Maître) (1879), borrowed from Vienna’s Albertina museum. There are also intimate late-period studies of Renoir’s wife, Aline, and their young sons, capturing familial warmth with characteristic sensitivity.For Bailey, mounting his first exhibition as a curator since becoming director 10 years ago, a personal favourite isRenoir’s pastel portraitof his friend and fellow artist Paul Cézanne. He says: “With Cézanne, he’s deeply connected from the beginning. Renoir travels to L’Estaque to work with Cézanne. He admires him.“He and [Edgar] Degas are very good friends as well, except at one point because Renoir sells a pastel that had been given to him by Degas because he’s in need of some money. Degas is so angry that he returns a Renoir to Renoir and they don’t speak for a couple of years. These artists are very close in the late 1860s and 1870s and some of them remain close throughout their careers.”The exhibition concludes with the plaster sculptureThe Judgement of Paris (1914), created in collaboration with sculptorRichard Guinoafter arthritis severely limited Renoir’s use of his hands, which he was forced to bandage. For Bailey, it is a demonstration of Renoir’s resilience and resourcefulness.“Arthritis doesn’t stop him from painting ambitious large nudes and landscapes and the mastery in some of these late drawings is complete. In a way, like Monet’s cataracts and Degas’s blindness, artists have a sort of muscle memory and they can continue to create.View image in fullscreenThe Judgment of Paris, 1914.Photograph: Rene-Gabriel Ojeda/Photography by René-Gabriel Ojéda“In Renoir’s case, he certainly couldn’t model plaster or marble but through his designs and his guidance for Guino, he was able to create very beautiful sculpture. We have a suite of drawings that relate both to the sculpture and the painting that is also part of that series. In some ways drawing for him almost transcends media at the end. He can work in sculpture, he can work in paint, he can work in chalks and it’s the same world.”The last comprehensive exhibition devoted to Renoir’s drawings was at theGalerie Durand-Ruelin Paris in 1921. Bailey believes there will be much to learn. “Drawings help you see the germ of ideas,” he says. “They also help you see the artist at work and because they’re fragile, because they’re either in museum storage or in private collections, they’re not constantly visible.“I’m hoping that this chance will amplify people’s understanding of Renoir’s productivity and they will see what an interesting and accomplished artist he is in different media on paper, not just charcoal but also these beautiful watercolours that will come as a surprise to people because they seem like very much likeMatisseandBonnardbefore their time.”Renoir Drawings is on display at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York until 8 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsPierre-Auguste RenoirExhibitionsDrawingSculptureArtNew YorkMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oh the power of dramatic irony; the smug joy of knowing something they don’t.Oh how I wallowed in these feelings and more, whenYouTubesucked me into a genre I had previously known nothing about: First Time Hearing videos, where people film themselves watching the music video of a song they’ve never heard before and grace viewers with their impromptu reactions,thoughts and facial expressions.Looking for the last human place on the internet? Try Google MapsRead moreEven before noticing the six-figures-plus viewing counts and the apparently endless number of people vying to deliver more, I instantly clocked all the trappings of the very best attention economy traps. You know: the immediate, certain knowledge that – despite your best intentions, growing hunger, thirst and backpain; despite the increasingly urgent pleas of your neglected children – you’re just going to slump there swiping your finger for hours until your higher brain finally kicks in.The first one my algorithm mugged me withwas from US rapper Black Pegasus, who told us he waslistening forthe first timeto Tim Minchin’s song Prejudice.The tension of the format works best if the viewer is familiar with the music. In this case, I was aware that Minchin’s song – an entertaining muse about how offended people get by a six-letter word made up of “a couple of Gs, an R and an E, an I and an N”–is a very long tease that he’s about to say something racist before (spoiler alert, sorry) he doesn’t.In this particular case, with an unsuspecting Black American listening and recording his reaction.It has received 324,000 views.That was mildly entertaining, I thought. So when I clocked the hello-i-am-here-to-help-you-get-addicted column, I clicked on another video from the same guy: his FIRST TIME REACTION to Midnight Oil’s 1987 hit Beds are Burning.If Tim Minchin was the gateway drug, I’d just found the good stuff, the main line.I believe I have watched every single person on the internet recording their reaction to their first time listening to (and watching the video of) Beds are Burning. Like all good addicts I couldn’t tell you how many hits I took. Hours passed like minutes, and minutes passed like days.What if Jesus was a vlogger? The AI Bible stories flooding social mediaRead moreTension is a big selling point in these videos, and it’s often ratcheted up multiple times, mid-song, by use of the pause button. Sometimes they talk for ages in the interregnum, trying to puzzle out the lyrics or hook. What’s this guy going on about? Why does he look so funny? Is he Or-Stralian? Why have I never heard this before? (The answer is that young people are far too busy swiping through short-form video to absorb the full cultural canon.)Sometimes it might be a brief “This slaps!”Yes, you solemnly nod,I know. I know this song and you do not. I am in charge here. So I will keep watching. To the end. Whether it be a couple who call themselves The Wolf Hunterz and realise they have heard it before after all but inexplicably push on, or an almost incomprehensible Glaswegian thrilled by the song’s “minning”.Some vloggers are quicker than others in picking up the theme. Some are hampered by mishearing the lyrics (Dereck, poor Dereck,thought “the birds are burning”). Some take a while to warm to the music. Everyone’s first reaction is that Peter Garrett has a funny voice.And then, sooner or later, their eyes widen. I love watching it happen. The chorus soars. The message sinks in (except for Dereck). The alchemy of music, politics and passion got them. Some, I think genuinely, cry.Ohhhhh yeahhhh.Now completely surrendered to the algorithm, I watched someFirst Time Hearing of Land Down UnderandWho Can It Be Now– and possibly more. It’s hard to say. Finally, I found myself watching First Time Hearing John Farnham singing Help and I realised I had fundamentally broken my brain. It was time to delete the app and seek professional help for my back.Explore more on these topicsMidnight OilInternet wormholeAustralian musicPop and rockYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m lucky to be alive because of organisations like amfAR,” the foundation’s incoming CEO, Kyle Clifford, said.“I had an Aids diagnosis, and nobody in my life knew that until recently, including my family. But I decided when I took on this role that I would come out about my diagnosis so that people who are HIV-positive know that the person leading the organisation is 100% committed. I live it every day.”View image in fullscreenJoely Richardson hosts the amfAR London 2025 gala in London.Photograph: Lia Toby/Getty for amfARAmfAR galas are known as some of the most lavish parties on the international social calendar, bringing together celebrities and philanthropists to raise money for biomedical research. Figures like Jeff Bezos and Leonardo DiCaprio are regulars in Cannes, while Richard Gere and Eva Longoria attended the Venice event.Now, amfAR is bringing a slice of that glamour to the UK having hosted its inaugural London gala at the luxury Chancery Rosewood hotel on Friday to coincide with the arts fairFriezeand the BFI London film festival.To mark the occasion, it honoured the artistTracey Eminwith a special award.“We believe London could 100% compete with Cannes and Venice,” Clifford said. “The interest we’ve received this week since being in town from different generations has been tremendous.“It became obvious very quickly that honouring Dame Tracey Emin was the most authentic way of expressing London’s DNA. Not only is she one of the most creative female contemporary artists, but she’s also been a voice for the voiceless, and a supporter of [the fight against] HIV and Aids since the late 80s.”The London gala was hosted by the actorJoely Richardson, with musical performances from Grace Jones and Jess Glynne. This year, amfAR raised $17m (£12.7m) at the Cannes gala, $3.4m in Venice and $3.1m in Dallas.Clifford said: “HIV is still a global health issue. At the moment, you have around 42 to 44 million people living in the world with HIV. Over 10 million of those do not have access to medication that can keep them alive. That’s like the whole population of London.”View image in fullscreenGrace Jones performs on stage.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockHe said the organisation had “big plans for growth” in the capital. “We want to make amfAR the biggest event at Frieze, and hopefully the biggest event in the city. We’re going to have over 300 people in the room for the inaugural event.”AmfAR was formed in 1985 by the actor Elizabeth Taylor and the research scientist Mathilde Krim, among others. “They realised there was an opportunity during major artistic events to bring everyone together for a good cause. I always say people come for the party and stay for the cause,” Clifford said.“We’re in Palm Beach around March. Then we go to Cannes, then Venice, then Dallas, now we’re in London, and we’ll finish out the year in Vegas. We have raised nearly a billion dollars for our research programmes and awarded more than 3,800 grants to research teams worldwide. I believe London can bring us closer to a cure.”Explore more on these topicsCultureLondonAids and HIVGrace JonesJoely RichardsonJess GlynneTracey EminfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The couple met on Boxing Day 1994 when the bombastic Pat (played by Pam St Clement) stormed into Roy’s office to tear him off a strip for selling a faulty vehicle to her son, David Wicks (Michael French).The gentle Roy apologised by sending her flowers and a car wrapped in a large red ribbon. Pat eventually gave in to his requests for a date and was surprised that, for months, he showed no interest in consummating their relationship. It emerged that Roy was impotent, “… because of the guilt that he was having an affair when his wife went into early labour and died,” Cauntertold the Guardianin 1999. “Pam and I and the writers had discussed the impotence storyline a long time before Viagra came along.” When Roy illegally bought the new drug, he suffered life-threatening side-effects as a result of his angina. Counselling and Pat’s understanding helped him to overcome his problem.View image in fullscreenTony Caunter, far right, on the set of EastEnders in 1999, with, from left, Pam St Clement, Mike Reid, Barbara Windsor, Ross Kemp, Steve McFadden and Shaun Williamson.Photograph: John Stillwell/PAThe couple married in 1996 and Roy ran the Albert Square car lot, Deals on Wheels, with Pat and his son Barry (Shaun Williamson). The marriage survived Pat’s affair with her former husband Frank (Mike Reid) four years later, but when in 2003 Roy discovered that Pat had helped to cover up an affair between Frank’s son, Ricky (Sid Owen), and Barry’s wife, Natalie (Lucy Speed), he died of a heart attack.Given the axe by EastEnders’ executive producer, Louise Berridge, after nine years and more than 600 episodes, Caunter was reported to be unhappy that the storyline left no room for a comeback. St Clement, who pleaded for him to stay, recalled in her 2012 autobiography, The End of an Earring: “I didn’t want him to go, or the character to be killed off. I felt the programme needed some solidity, which could be gained by an ongoing family unit, when so many others were breaking up.”In 2010, Berridge said she had wanted a return to the “wild, dangerous Pat” and Roy was stifling her, but she admitted regret at dropping Caunter. “To galvanise Pat, we had to lose Roy,” she added. “But I wish now we’d found some other way. Roy had a stability about him that we needed.”Caunter was born in Southampton, to Annie (nee Stratton) and Roy Caunter. His mother and grandmother both performed in touring musical revues and had first met Roy in Weymouth in a cafe he managed. His mother died of cancer when Tony was 11, and he was brought up by his grandmother in Worthing, West Sussex, where he attended the town’s high school. He set his mind on a stage career and joined an amateur dramatics group, then moved to Essex at the age of 15 to live with his father and finished his education at Westcliff high school.In 1955, he started training at Lamda in London – interrupted by three years’ national service in the RAF – and began his career in 1959 with the London Children’s Theatre company. He moved on to repertory theatre before heading back to the capital and spending nine months as a stage electrician before acting in theJohn Osbornedouble bill Plays for England, with the English Stage Company at the Royal Court theatre in 1962. He took the role of a flight sergeant PT instructor inArnold Wesker’s play Chips with Everything (1963), performed there and in New York, before landing two small parts in the West End in Caligula (Phoenix theatre, 1964), by Albert Camus.Caunter’s abilities as a character actor led to him being cast in around 150 television productions. Many were one-off appearances, including roles as police officers or detectives in some of TV’s most popular crime series, from No Hiding Place (in 1963) and Special Branch (in 1970) to The Professionals (in 1978) and The Bill (in 1988). He also played Detective Chief Inspector Jim Logan in Juliet Bravo (from 1980 to 1982) and Detective Chief Constable Arthur Quine in The Chief (from 1990 to 1994).His other regular roles included Dick Mitchell for the last six months of the football serial United! (1966-67), Luigi in the children’s adventure The Queen Street Gang (1968), Trevor Tonks, the next-door neighbour, in Beryl’s Lot (1973-77) and Friar Tuck in The Legend of Robin Hood (1975). He was in two different sitcoms with Diana Dors, playing Jack Shepherd, her wheeler-dealer brother-in-law, in Queenie’s Castle (1970-72) and Ken Hicks, a rugby player, in All Our Saturdays (1973).He also appeared alongside three incarnations of the Time Lord – William Hartnell,Jon Pertweeand Peter Davison – in Doctor Who between 1965 and 1983.In 1962, Caunter married Frances Wallace; she predeceased him by eight days. He is survived by their daughter, Sarah, and three sons, Nicholas, William and James, and seven grandchildren.Tony (Anthony Patrick) Caunter, actor, born 22 September 1937; died 13 October 2025Explore more on these topicsEastEndersobituariesShareReuse this content"

How can parents support their child in the right way?Jessica MurraySocial affairs correspondentSat 18 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTSharePushy and shouty parents are the “biggest problem in sports performance”, sports psychologists have said, amid growing concern that pressure and abuse is hampering competitive sport in the UK.This week parents were banned from attending sports events at a number of south London primary schools due to “concerning behaviours”, including abuse towards officials and children and creating “too much pressure around performance and winning at all costs”.In recent years, a number of schools have banned parents from attending sports days over bad behaviour, while growing levels of abuse fromparents on the sidelines of grassroots footballis discouraging people from refereeing.‘One father threatened to stab the referee’: why does kids’ football bring out the worst in parents?Read more“It’s the biggest problem in sports performance and it has been going on for years,” said Stephen Smith, the chair of the British Psychological Society’s sport and exercise psychology division.“The level of abuse has only got worse. Behaviour has got worse. But it has been ignored and now we’re trying to put the genie back in the bottle, both in terms of the way that parents are putting pressure on their children, and the impact of poor behaviour and abuse that’s coming from the sidelines.”Smith said intrusion from parents can make children “freeze up because of the pressure” and watching their parents shout abuse can have a hugely negative impact on a child.Dr Matthew Cunliffe, a consultant and sport and exercise psychologist at the University of Greenwich, said: “There is definitely an element of unsportsmanlike conduct on the part of parents that we see quite regularly in sport these days.View image in fullscreenChildren with ‘consistent, responsive, warm and reliable’ parents were more likely to develop a secure attachment style that would give them confidence in sport, say experts.Photograph: Richard Wayman/Alamy“You see signs in the park on a Saturday morning saying: ‘Remember, it’s supposed to be fun. Treat the referees with respect. Try not to shout abuse at the other team.’ It is definitely a problem. But it’s hard to pinpoint the cause.”Cunliffe said banning parents from events wasn’t the answer and allowing them to support their children in healthy competition was an important part of childhood.“You’re depriving parents of that time where they’re seeing their children either struggle or succeed, watching them grow up and those developmental milestones,” he said. “Also as a child, your parents are who you look to in times of stress, they provide a lot of emotional support.“Most of the well-established successful athletes that we have in this country, and worldwide, have had reasonably strong parental networks.”Many of the world’s biggest sports stars have talked of how pressure from their parents helped push them towards success or, in some cases, pushed them too far.View image in fullscreenAndy Murray celebrates his victory in the boys’ US Open with his mum, Judy, on his arrival back in Scotland.Photograph: PA/PA Archive/PA PhotosThe British tennis player Emma Raducanu has described her parents as “so pushy”, while the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Andy Murray, Tiger Woods and Serena and Venus Williams all had parents who coached them from a young age.David Beckham has spoken about how his father’s strict training regime involved spending hours in the park practising every night, and being reduced to tears when he was shouted at for poor performances.But he also said this had helped prepare him for the pressures of an international football career, reflecting that “all those moments where my dad was hard on me as a kid, there was a reason for it”.What can elite sports referees teach parents?Read moreSmith said it’s difficult to know whether pushy parents are a key ingredient of sporting success – “nobody really talks about how their parents didn’t put the pressure on” – and there can be negative consequences too.“Sometimes the pressures come at a price. Lots of people made it as great sports stars but also went off the rails,” he said.Cunliffe said that children with parents who are “consistent, responsive, warm, reliable” in their approach to training were likely to develop a secure attachment style that would give them confidence in their sport.But when parents were inconsistent, or not very reassuring, children were more likely to become “anxiously attached” which often means craving approval and fearing rejection.Cunliffe said: “Parents are there for the emotional support, the motivation, the encouragement, but it’s when they step over that line into coaching pressure that you get issues.”Smith added there was an urgent need to address the role parents play in their children’s training when pursuing a career in sports, but despite people repeatedly raising the issue, no organisation has stepped forward to help.“Who is supporting the parents of the talent? In terms of helping them to be involved, and support and develop their child in the right way. Everyone passes the buck to someone else,” he said.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingChildrenSchool sportsYoung peopleSocial trendsFamilyRefereesnewsShareReuse this content"

But the prices have made people gulp. I taste-tested all five to find out what is good value – and what’s best to avoidTim JonzeSat 18 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 00.09 EDTShareLike Tesla cars and the ending of the Sopranos, Charlie Bigham ready meals seem to be rather divisive. On the one hand, people clearly love them: about 31m dishes were sold in the past year alone. On the other hand, they generate a heap of mockery. The critique seems to be that only a gullible idiot would shell out up to a tenner on an oven-ready fish pie, chilli con carne or – as one commentator once memorably labelled it – a tray of “Tory slop”.Those critics will be sharpening their kitchen knives because Bigham, who is a kind of Tim “Wetherspoons” Martin for centrist dads, has just announced the launch of his Brasserie range: deluxe versions of his meals with prices that fetch up to … wait for it … £30! Thirty whole English pounds!With a menu consisting of venison bourguignon, coq au vin, confit duck (all at £16.95) and two wellingtons (salmon for £19.95 and beef at £29.95), these creations are clearly not trying to compete with your common-or-garden Tesco lasagne. Bigham is obviously aware that these days you have to remortgage your grandma in order to afford a meal out, so he’s attempting to take on the restaurant experience itself. Why go out to mingle with strangers in the fresh evening air, he’s saying, when you can sit in your kitchen surrounded by children’s felt-tips and a half-eaten box of Shreddies instead? To add to the dining-out vibe, Bigham recommends a specific Waitrose wine for each meal, which we duly buy.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Tim Jonze, Helen Jane and friends Lliam and Nick trying the coq au vin.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianLook, if anyone is going to fall for this wheeze, it’s me, because my culinary confession is that I do quite like a bit of Tory slop from time to time. Eating out is difficult with two young children, and so we invite Charlie into our house, figuratively speaking, to serve us a lasagne or a chicken tikka masala (both tiny, both tasty). It’s as good as a takeaway, much cheaper and seems vaguely healthier.Still, that’s the standard range. Can any prepared meal really be worth these latest prices? Time to get my foodiest friends over – including a former chef, no less! – to test them out …Coq au vinView image in fullscreenCoq au vin with potatoes dauphinoise and Tim’s green beans.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianBigham dislikes the term “ready meals”. It implies something loaded with chemicals that you can whiz up in the microwave in minutes, whereas his creations require baking and even involve a touch of proper cooking – the new wellingtons can be enhanced by brushing the pastry with a beaten egg, and it’s advised that the coq in this coq au vin is taken out of its sauce and placed on a separate tray to crisp up. It works – sort of – and the chicken is delightfully juicy. Guests are impressed by the potato and celeriac dauphinoise, but when it comes to the sauce of chestnut mushrooms, chantenay carrots and bacon, the sumptuous depth of flavour that comes from simmering chicken bones in a load of wine for ages is definitely lacking.Wine pairingDominique Piron Beaujolais Villages, £14.40Rating6/10Confit duckView image in fullscreenConfit duck with potatoes dauphinoise and Tim’s green beans.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Guardian“Oh my God, this is delicious,” declare at least three of my guests. Sadly, they’re talking about the chianti we’re having with the duck rather than the duck itself, which emerges from the oven looking perfectly appetising but is disappointingly dry beneath the garlic-parmesan crumb. It comes with a smudge of lentil sauce and some sliced potatoes with nutty browned butter, both of which impress my guests more than the meat itself.Wine pairingVilla Cafaggio Chianti Classico, £16, on offer for £11 until 28 OctoberRating4/10Salmon wellingtonView image in fullscreenSalmon wellington.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianI was hugely sceptical about this. Yes, “sashimi-grade salmon” sounded promising – but could it survive being baked at 200C for 50 whole minutes? Surprisingly, it could! This was the night’s showstopper. It came out extremely well browned but the pastry was crisp, the salmon succulent and the whole thing was complemented by a gorgeous mushroom duxelles with gentle notes of fennel. Ex-chef Lliam, the kind of man who would normally sooner burn his kitchen down than demean himself with a ready meal, had to concede that this was good stuff. Without wanting to get sued for giving anyone salmonella, we agreed it would probably be even better if you knocked five or 10 minutes from the cooking time.Wine pairingChapel Down English Rosé, £16, on offer for £14 until 28 OctoberRating9/10Venison bourguignonView image in fullscreenVenison bourguignon.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianPreconceptions be damned! Just as the salmon surprised me, so did this – and not in a good way. I thought a casserole would translate most easily to the ready meal experience, but something has gone seriously wrong here. The meat may well be “wild-caught from the Scottish Highlands”, but it’s also terribly dry and the sauce is too scant. The whole thing lacks the indulgent comfort of a classic bourguignon. Perhaps I miss the experience of cooking one, too, which can be a pleasure in itself – from sauteeing the tiny onions in heart-attack quantities of butter to decadently tipping a half-decent bottle of burgundy into the pan. It’s time-consuming but not particularly tricky – and you end up with something infinitely more appetising than this. Things are rescued slightly by the mash, which is buttery with a crisp exterior, and the crunchy Pinot pairing, which goes down rather too quickly.Wine pairingCave de Lugny Bourgogne Pinot Noir, £17.50, on offer for £14.50 until 28 OctoberRating2/10Beef wellingtonView image in fullscreenBeef wellington.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianThis is the meal that has been generating all the “£30 for a bloody ready meal!” headlines. The thing is, a proper wellington isn’t really a ready meal by any standard definition. It’s essentially a piece of fillet steak with some pastry and mushrooms thrown in. Itshouldcost a lot. Or, to put it another way, the last thing you want to be eating is a beef wellington that costs a tenner.It takes 50 minutes to prepare this meal well done, but as we are not complete philistines we stick it in the oven for 30 minutes to get it “medium rare”. It emerges nicely crisped and gloriously pink inside. Despite needing a good crack of salt – and the distraction of various children wandering in asking if they can please go to bed now as it’s a school night – it’s generally agreed that this isn’t bad at all: tender, succulent, blah blah …OK, look, by this point critical faculties are a little impaired. All five bottles of wine have been consumed, the planned pairing system has gone out of the window and the conversation is giddily veering from botulism in South Africa (always a great accompaniment to a beef course) to the most impressive cast members of the West End musical Operation Mincemeat. Everyone does, at least, seem drunk and happy.

However, an innovative social enterprise is doing its bit to help by offering people the chance to reduce their electricity bills by as much as 30%.Energy Localis a non-profit organisation that has created a way for people to benefit from local clean energy by teaming up with a renewable energy project in their area – it might be a wind turbine, solar farm or hydroelectric scheme – to get a better deal.It enables participating residents to buy renewable electricity at a discounted price.They form a club, which their local renewable project also joins, and it works by matching up the residents’ energy usage to the locally generated electricity. The club agrees a price residents will pay for the electricity they use when the local renewable energy is being generated.In Bridport in Dorset, the installation of a wind turbine by the local farmer Peter Bailey in one of his fields allowed an energy club to be set up in 2021. Almost 60 people are signed up to the club, and the connection between local energy generation and usage is already having an impact on how members behave.“Peter believes wind power of about 11mph produces sufficient power for it to generate. You know on a windy day that it’s generating power,” says Malcolm Drew, a semi-retired engineer and energy club member.“The website we can access tells us what the turbine is doing – it picks up on wind speed and tells you how windy it is and if it’s a good time to use electricity,” he adds.Richard Toft, who helped to found the club, says: “We’re all saving. Depending on your personal habits, people save a different proportion – anywhere between a 10% and 25% reduction on your bill.”There are many more people interested in joining the Bridport club than available spaces but there are hopes that it can set up a solar farm based on a cooperative investment model to expand the project and allow more members to join.View image in fullscreenThe club agrees a price residents will pay for the electricity they use when the local renewable energy is being generated.Photograph: Simon Dack/AlamyEnergy Local was set up by Dr Mary Gillie in 2016 after she witnessed a surprising frustration among people living in Ashton Hayes, Cheshire, who wanted their small village to become carbon neutral.“They said: ‘Can we all just put solar power on our roofs? How do we then say that we’ve used that power?’” Gillie says.“But at the time, we couldn’t show when they were using it. It was when smart meters began to be developed that I realised we could do that.”There are now 36 energy clubs across Great Britain that Energy Local is involved with, stretching from Scotland down to Devon and Dorset. The idea behind them is simple. Thanks to smart meter technology, it is now possible to show how much electricity a household uses every half an hour. Energy Local has developed software that compares that usage with the electricity generated by a local renewable energy scheme such as a wind turbine, hydro project or solar farm.Gillie and her team have worked with energy companies to negotiate a special tariff arrangement, thereby creating a “hyper-local” market that acknowledges the renewable power being generated in that area.The price the club members pay for the electricity they use when the local clean energy is being generated is higher than the amount the renewable energy projects would normally get from selling their power to suppliers but lower than the price residents would usually pay via a regular tariff. “It’s a win-win,” Gillie says.In Brixton, south London, Energy Local has helped unlock the potential of an existing solar project on the roof of a social housing block called Roupell Park. The photovoltaic panels on the building’s roof were installed in 2013 thanks to a community investment initiative organised by the not-for-profit organisationRepowering London.“Everyone, as investor members, owns a piece of that kit on the roof [in Roupell Park],” says Afsheen Kabir Rashid, the co-founder and chief executive of Repowering London.View image in fullscreenSolar panels were installed on the roof of the Roupell Park in Brixton, south London, in 2013.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“It’s really empowering for local people. But we kept coming back to this point: how can we supply this energy locally? Energy Local has been one of the models that has allowed us to do that.“It’s a small trial in Brixton – 18 households or so – but they have seen benefits on their energy bills already.”Part of the aim of Energy Local is to encourage people to shift their consumption habitsRepowering London raises money for the solar panels through community shares. It believes that democratising the energy system is the fastest route to decarbonising the sector and making it fairer. “We still have huge fuel poverty in the UK,” Kabir Rashid says. “People are scared about the bills that arrive. People are disconnected from where the energy is coming from. The benefits of the extractive fossil fuel economy do not stay local in people’s pockets. But through community energy, we can bring people closer, make it visible.”When the sun is weak or there is no wind, the energy club members have to pay a higher tariff – however, part of the aim of Energy Local is to encourage people to change their consumption habits.Gillie says that as well as trying to support local renewable energy and reduce people’s bills, “we want to manage the electricity network as efficiently as we can … If we can get people to use more power when local generation is running or when fewer people are using it, we can solve both problems.”Electricity demand is typically greatest between 4pm and 8pm but Energy Local encourages participants to set timers for washing machines and similar devices, and to try to move energy-intensive tasks to the times of day when local clean power generation is running at maximum levels and electricity is at its cheapest.View image in fullscreenRepowering London’s Afsheen Kabir Rashid says people involved in the Roupell Park trial ‘have seen benefits on their energy bills already’.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhile the idea of hyper-local energy markets and cooperative renewable power generation may sound like a perfect solution to the energy crisis, Gillie is clear that community energy schemes cannot replace the national grid entirely.“We need a robust overarching system to ensure the power keeps flowing,” she says. “We do as much as we can locally, but after a point [infrastructure costs] can become too expensive, and that’s where you need things to be handled at a national level.”Those infrastructure costs, such as repairing and upgrading the cables and equipment that electrify our homes and businesses, are one reason why bills, including standing charges, have just gone up. On 1 October, the average energy price cap for households in Great Britain paying by direct debitincreased by £35 to £1,755for a typical annual dual-fuel bill.“Our network is changing – we need to invest in it. We should have done this 15 years ago, and we’re playing catchup on a massive scale,” Gillie says.Given the desire within the industry to wean the grid off gas turbine power stations and lower consumer prices by bringing more renewable power into play, well-integrated local energy generation sites offer a glimpse of what a more efficient, carbon neutral network may look like in the future.How do Energy Local clubs work, and how do I join one?They are designed to solve a problem in the electricity market: renewable energy schemes sell their power to suppliers but people living nearby are buying that electricity back for maybe two or three times that price.An Energy Local club is legally a cooperative and is where a group of residents and a local renewable energy project team up to get a better deal for both parties.To take part, you need a smart meter installed in your home.The club agrees a price people will pay for the electricity they use when renewable energy is being generated locally. So they may want to run their washing machine when they know the local hydro scheme is going full pelt, for example. Sometimes it will be possible to match all the electricity someone uses to locally generated power but at other times they will use more than is available. For the extra electricity, they will be charged at different rates depending on the time of day.The club selects a partner energy supplier that sells the extra power that members need when there is not enough local electricity generated. So those taking part will have to change to the supplier selected.Energy Local says the savings will vary from household to household but adds: “We estimate you could save about 10% to 30% on your electricity bills.” However, club members still have to pay standing charges.The organisation has created an online dashboard to help people manage their energy use. It can provide a forecast of how much power will come from the local renewable energy source each day.If you would like to join an Energy Local club, there isa list on the organisation’s websiteof clubs that are up and running or being set up (some are now full). If there isn’t one in your area but you would like to be notified if one is set up, there isa form on the sitewhere you can register your details. “We have clubs developing in many areas. Please let us know you are interested,” the organisation says.Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsSaving moneyConsumer affairsHousehold billsEnergy industryRenewable energyEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A resort in the Tirol is the perfect place to rediscover the joys of skiingHilary BradtSat 18 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 06.50 EDTShare‘You’re mad!” Caroline the greengrocer said cheerfully when I told her I was going skiing. A reasonable reaction since not so long ago I was shopping on crutches following a hip replacement. My sister’s friends were more concerned: “How old are you? 80? I don’t think this is a good idea. You’ll fall and break something.” My brother, Andrew, 86, decided it was better not to tell anyone.For at least two decades I’d had a half-buried wish to experience one more ski trip. A final fix of blue sky, frosty air and the exhilaration that comes with finding yourself still intact at the bottom of a snow-covered slope. I was never much good, and hadn’t skied for decades, but that wasn’t the point. At 83, I needed to see if I could still do it. And if I could do it, how about inviting my sister, Kate, one-third of our Old Crones group who encourage each other to do parkrun each week? Then I remembered that, as teenagers, Andrew had joined me on my first ski holiday. That was 67 years ago, but Andrew used to be quite good, so I invited him too. My friend Penny, who is so absurdly young (67, so she says) that she doesn’t really count, was also allowed to come and try her luck with the oldies and practise her German. We all made an effort to get as fit as possible, but none of us had skied for at least 40 years.View image in fullscreenSeefeld, in Tirol nearInnsbruck, was our chosen destination, as it offers a variety of winter activities – assuming we’d survive our two-hour lesson on the first day (which, to be honest, was all the downhill skiing we had planned) – and is wonderfully free of après-ski malarky. It attracts families rather than partying youngsters, and is typically Austrian, with onion-domed churches and chalet-type houses. Our base was the friendly, family-runHotel Helgaand we ate at a different restaurant each evening.“We call thisKaiserwetter,” said Janina, our guide, when I remarked we couldn’t believe our luck at waking each morning to cloudless skies, warm sun and plenty of snow for early March. We were all pretending just to be excited, not worried at all, as we took a bus to the ski area. It was full of young people and families carrying skis and glowing with vitality. I thought I caught the young man helping us with our boot and ski hire rolling his eyes at the challenge.I was sure I’d fall over as soon as I moved. But I didn’t. None of us didOur instructor Ulrich, who had been pre-warned of our ages, smiled bravely as we stomped towards him. We were talking a bit too loudly, smiling too broadly, perhaps trying to postpone the moment when we had to clamp our feet on to the skis. Inwardly, I was sure I’d fall over as soon as I moved. But I didn’t. None of us did. Ulrich was very patient, giving us enough time at each stage of the lesson to gain in confidence.View image in fullscreenHilary Bradt (right) with her brother Andrew and sister KateModern skis are much easier to manage, I discovered – shorter, lighter and rounded at the front – than the long, cumbersome things I remember from the 60s that always made me fall off the ski lift. We knew we would not be trusted on a lift of any sort, so assumed we would laboriously herringbone up the hill and slide down, falling over in the process. That’s how it was in 1958. But here there was a wonderful new device, a “travelator”, or moving walkway, that conveyed us effortlessly to the top of the gentle beginners’ slope, which was cluttered with fearless children. We were the only adults.Two hours later, we hadn’t even fallen, had all managed some decent snowplough turns and even a sort of parallel turn. We were euphoric. “That was just amazing!” said Andrew, who isn’t given to hyperbole.Could we have managed a whole week of skiing? Possibly, but the variety of activities Seefeld offered was more enticing. There were hikes around various lakes, buses giving us access to ridiculously picturesque villages, and the “winter hike to the Hämmermoosalm, 4.6km (and sled back down)”, as the information pack casually described it.Having watched the Winter Olympics, Kate and I knew all about sledding. You run behind, pushing the sled, then leap on and hurtle down on your belly at speeds rivalling a Formula One car. Janina was reassuring. Nothing to worry about: we’d sit on the sled and steer with our feet. But we did worry. Andrew decided it wasn’t for him but we three plugged on.View image in fullscreenHilary Bradt hits the slopesAs a 12-year-old it had been tiring hauling my father’s homemade toboggan up Gold Hill common in Buckinghamshire in our snowy childhood, and as an 83-year-old it was tiring hauling an admittedly lighter toboggan uphill in oxygen-depleted air (Hämmermoosalm, a traditional alpine mountain hut and farm with dining rooms, is at 1,410 metres) for nearly 3 miles (5km). I lagged behind, muttering to myself about being too old for this. The glühwein andGulaschsuppe(goulash) in warm sunshine at the restaurant at the top were restorative, but the descent couldn’t be postponed for ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I followed cautiously, getting off to pull the toboggan over bare gravel and mud, but soon realised I was wearing a broad grin: it was exhilarating. Halfway down I thought I’d wait and take an action photo of Kate. A man in a scarlet onesie skidded by, shouting something over his shoulder that seemed to be to do with Kate. No point in waiting, and I certainly wasn’t going to plod uphill again to check on her. If she were actually dead or injured, surely the chap would have told me?“How did you keep control on those icy bits?” Kate demanded when we finally reassembled at the bottom. “My toboggan hit a bank and I was thrown off. As I lay there swearing, a man stopped, stared at me, and asked: ‘How old are you?’ I walked the rest of the way.”In contrast, cross-country skiing delighted everyone: no slopes, no feeling of helplessness.Family ski trips are etched deep in my memory. So I took my grandkids to the snowRead moreWe also did some proper hikes around lakes with views of pines and snowy peaks, and tried the localswimming pool and sauna. Having never had a sauna before, I thought I ought to give it a go. It was all very strange and a bit alarming, with mixed-sex naked saunas the order of the day. I hired a towelling dressing gown and went exploring. In an apparently empty room, opaque with very hot steam, I sat down gingerly in my nakedness and took in my surroundings. It was like peering through a sweltering old-fashioned London fog, but I could just make out alcoves around the walls occupied by ghostly Greek-style statues. Rather impressive. Then one moved.On our last day, after plenty of adrenaline-fuelled experiences, we finally began behaving like sensible pensioners, opting for a carriage ride, wrapped in rugs behind two enormous grey horses that clip-clopped through the still snow-covered landscape. And sampled the local cuisine and drank plenty of glühwein, of course.What a wonderful, eye-opening and adventurous four days it had been. On the back of the Old Crones’ T-shirts is the message: “We do because we can”. Unless you try it, you don’t know what you can do.The trip was provided byVisit TirolandSeefeld.

I’m never at ease among people who don’t suffer fools gladlyTim DowlingSat 18 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 10.42 EDTShareMany months ago the band I’m in was invited to play a gig at a literary festival in Greece. The date slotted nicely into our international tour schedule, between Brighton and Plymouth. But it butted up against my already booked holiday; I would have to fly home, spend 36 hours repacking and then fly straight to Greece. Mind you, I’m not complaining.“It sounds like you’re complaining,” my wife says as we negotiate the duty free chicane at Gatwick. It is 4.30am, and the airport is rammed.“I’m not,” I say. “I’m just worried about my banjo.” The previous evening I’d parted with it – in its new, specially acquired flight case – at something called Twilight Bag Drop, a fully automated process that gave me no confidence I would ever see my banjo again.“Nothing you can do about it now,” my wife says, “so there’s no point in worrying.”“I don’t get how the second part of that follows from the first,” I say.I’m also preoccupied by my roof: in the 36 hours I’d spent at home, I’d conducted several gloomy conversations with Michael the roofer about the flat roof over the kitchen, which is in even worse shape than the one at the top of the house, and when the skip in the driveway would finally be removed.I used to have recurring nightmares about being on the same pub quiz team as Margaret Atwood“Thursday,” said Michael.“I’ll be in Greece by then,” I told him.“You go away a lot, don’t you?,” he said.“No!” I said. “This is an accident of scheduling. Mind you, I’m not complaining.”A lot of the people on our flight are clearly heading for the same festival. I’ve spoken at literary events in the past, and they tend to make me anxious, because I’m not at ease among the sort of people who don’t suffer fools gladly. I used to have recurring nightmares about being on the same pub quiz team as Margaret Atwood. But I can’t imagine what it will be like to attend one as part of a band. We’re the only musical entertainment on offer, apart from the Greek band at the gala dinner.In Greece I am reunited with my banjo, which is in one piece. But the weather, normally predictable at this time of year, has gone rogue: we arrive at our accommodation, above a taverna, in driving rain and the festival’s opening drinks party is cancelled due to a storm. We go down to eat at the taverna where we’re staying, but it’s shut.“Because of the weather?” I say.“It’s shut in protest,” the guitar player tells me, “against the noise levels at the taverna next door.”“That seems … I don’t know,” I say. “Strategically opaque.”“I might ask the owner if we can rehearse down there,” he says.“It would be ironic if he said yes,” I say.Ironically, he does say yes. The days fall into a pattern: we attend literary talks by illustrious authors in the morning, go to lunch, and rehearse all afternoon in a closed taverna by the sea. My rotten roof begins to seem very far away. I think: I could get used to this.On the second day, it is announced that due to unpredictable weather our gig is being moved a day earlier, and the venue changed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But the festivalgoers and illustrious authors know how to party: long past midnight they are still dancing and demanding more. We exhaust our repertoire. Afterwards, a woman approaches the stage.“That was amazing!” she says. “And I feel guilty because I’m the one who started the Greek band petition.”The next morning the weather that would have put paid to our gig rolls in: heavy rain punctuates the final talk in the main tent. But the sun appears briefly at lunch, and as I sit on yet another terrace among rosemary bushes and olive trees, I think: I’m not complaining.Somewhere a few tables over, I hear my wife laughing with Simon Schama.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nearby, a police siren pierces the near-constant traffic drone. Commuters hurry past collapsing, ivy-draped fencing panels as rain clouds gather.This is perhaps the last place you expect to find a perfectly formed vineyard. But James Bayliss-Smith has managed to cultivate 40 mature vines sagging with plump mauve grapes on a rambling allotment sandwiched between a row of 1930s houses and a local rail line just north ofBristoltown centre.“I’ve seen people hiding heroin or whatever in those bushes,” says Bayliss-Smith. “But you just get on with it … and keep tending to your vines.”Bayliss-Smith, 46, a documentary cameraman who also has a kombucha drinks business, is not the only local vintner. He has pulled together a loose collective of growers who make wine from four hidden urban vineyards tucked away in back gardens and allotments across Bristol. It is too clandestine to have an official name yet, but the collective’s WhatsApp group is called Grape Expectations.View image in fullscreenJames Bayliss-Smith on his vineyard allotment.So far, Bayliss-Smith’s allotment is the only one listed in theUrban Vineyards Association’s forthcoming world atlas, which includes more famous city vineyards such as the 1,800 vines on the slopes of Paris’s historic Montmartre neighbourhood and more than 3,000 vines overlooking and within Turin. The Italian-based non-profit association is at the forefront of a movement re-establishing city vineyards in traditional winemaking countries, but has discovered them all over the world, including cities in Japan, Bangladesh and Uzbekistan.‘When I tread the grapes, all the wild yeasts come off the skins into the juice,’ says Scofield, ankle deep in a bucket of crimson juiceThe association’s president, Nicola Purrello, insists urban viticulture offers city dwellers much more than just wine. “Vineyards help cities stay greener and more diverse. They protect land from construction by establishing permanent, productive agricultural units inside cities,” he says, on a video call from Sicily. Like all wines, those created in urban areas are a product of the soils the vines grow in, the vagaries of the weather and the people who tend the grapes. “A bottle of wine represents the beauty, community, landscape and history of a city,” adds Purrello, who manages a vineyard in Catania, east Sicily.Back in Bristol, Bayliss-Smith is in a race against time to harvest the vines he grew from a plant left in his allotment by a Polish family. If the rain comes, then the pigeons may seize their chance to attack again. “This is the mystery Polish grape,” he says, as he cleans damaged and mouldy grapes on the glistering bunches. “We don’t really know what variety they are, but they’re definitely disease-resistant. Unlike noble varieties – Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and other famous French grapes – you don’t have to spray them with chemicals … this is possibly a special variety that was developed by the Soviets.”View image in fullscreenJo Scofield treads her grapes.The other members of the collective are also making the most of sunny interludes between bursts of autumn rain. On the terrace overlooking Bristol’s shimmering harbour, where medieval merchant vessels once bobbed with barrels of wine from France and Spain, Katy Grant is collecting her rondo grapes from about 50 vines. “I love the smell of these vines. It is so evocative,” she says, pausing with a basket of grapes slung over her arm. “It’s the scent of Provence when you open the car windows on holiday.”It’s very on trend, but it’s just resurrecting an old way of making wineGrant, 52, who has spent over 20 years working for humanitarian organisations in conflict zones, inadvertently inherited the vineyard when she moved back to the UK from Kenya with her family in 2018 . She felt an overwhelming duty to look after the vines in the garden of their new home. “This vineyard has already survived three different owners,” she says. “I really like the idea of natural stewardship – of passing this on to someone else so they can continue producing from this land.”A short walk away, the final two members of the collective are hard at work on the precipitous slopes of Avon Gorge. Jo Scofield has cultivated more than 150 vines perched on terraces in her wild half-acre garden, which tumbles down towards the muddy River Avon. “People are always surprised,” she says, gesturing towards the tangled vineyard. “They can’t believe they can see rows of vines in a city street.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Scofield, a wildlife and conservation film-maker who has worked on Netflix’s Great National Parks series and BBC Two’s Gardeners’ World, was inspired to plant grapes after seeing her neighbour’s vines. She’s discovered that amateurs can make interesting, enjoyable natural wine, which can sell for upwards of £7 a glass in the growing number of wine bars specialising in minimal-intervention wines. “It’s just incredibly satisfying that you can actually make good, natural wine,” she says. “It’s very on trend, but really it’s resurrecting an old way of making wine.” But don’t take her word for it: former Guardian wine writerFiona Becketttasted one of her wines this year. “She was shocked: she loved it,” says Scofield. “She said she’d drink our wine any day of the week,”View image in fullscreenKaty Grant pruning her vines.The ripe grapes are foot-stomped on the sun-dappled stone terrace of her bohemian Georgian flat she shares with her daughter and husband. “When I tread the grapes, all the wild yeasts come off the skins into the juice,” says Scofield, ankle deep in a bucket of tiny stems, pips and crimson juice. “That’s how wines were made traditionally, but industrial wineries add sulphur [dioxide] to kill the wild yeast and then add a lab-grown yeast.”I wanted to make Burgundian wines here, which is a bit bonkersA few doors down sprightly retiree Bob Reeve, who inspired Scofield to plant her vines, has gathered his friends to pick Chardonnay grapes from the 100 vines he has laid out neatly across two terraces. Reeve, a Lancashire-born PE teacher who taught at Bristol University developed a passion for wine on annual sporting trips to France. But it is a challenge to grow Chardonnay grapes in the dampness of the gorge, with cooling tides sweeping in and out from the Bristol Channel. “I wanted to make Burgundian wines here, which is a bit bonkers,” says Reeve with a smile. “Chardonnay is late to ripen and very sensitive to mildew.”The temperamental Bristol climate is not the only problem faced by winegrowers. Reeve has had to install a barrier on the steps leading into his garden to stop badgers devouring his grapes, but – perhaps in admiration for the animals’ good taste – has named his vineyard in their honour: “We called it Badger Bluff because we found a way to keep them out.”The picking, making and drinking of the wine often brings the collective together. Today, Bayliss-Smith is testing the grape juice for sugar levels, which determine the eventual alcohol content. He is keen to stress that vine cultivation can be done in any garden – and that fermenting natural wines is feasible for anyone willing to brave sometimes funky but often wonderful flavours generated by wild yeasts. “We are not wine snobs,” he adds, “we just love experimenting.”Explore more on these topicsGardensWineBristolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The strike killed the other two crew members on board, sources told Reuters on Friday.‘Trump is killing poor people’: Caribbean village mourns victim of US strikeRead moreThe US military flew the survivors to an American navy warship in theCaribbean, where they were detained until at least Friday evening. It was not clear if they had already been flown off the ship as of Saturday morning.The US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expected the survivors to eventually be sent to their home countries.In a statement on Truth Social, Donald Trump said: “It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route.”The president added that US intelligence had confirmed the boat “was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics” and “there were four known narcoterrorists on board the vessel”.“The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin,Ecuadorand Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump said.The decision to send the survivors home means that the US military will not have to grapple with thorny legal issues surrounding military detention for suspected drug traffickers, whose alleged crimes do not fall neatly under the laws of war, legal experts say.Speaking on Friday, Trump told reporters that the strike was against “a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs”.He did not comment on how many were killed or survived the strike.The Pentagon has offered no details on the attack so far and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration has said the previous strikes killed 27 people, raising alarms among some legal experts and Democratic lawmakers, who question whether they adhere to the laws of war.The strikes come against the backdrop of a US military buildup in the Caribbean that includes guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter jets, a nuclear submarine and about 6,500 troops as Trump escalates a standoff with the Venezuelan government.On Wednesday, Trump disclosed he had authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, adding to speculation in Caracas that the United States is attempting to topple the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.Maduro has denied any connection to drug smuggling and denounced the US boat strikes as a pretext for regime change, portraying them as violations of sovereignty and international law.In a letter this week to the United Nations’ 15-member security council, seen by Reuters, Venezuela’s UN ambassador, Samuel Moncada, asked for a UN determination that the US strikes off its coast are illegal and to issue a statement backing Venezuela’s sovereignty.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryEcuadorColombiaVenezuelaCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The vehicle departed from the state of Bahia and crashed in Saloá, a city in the neighbouring state of Pernambuco.Police said the driver lost control of the bus, crossed into the opposite lane and hit rocks on the roadside. He then returned to the correct lane but crashed into a sand embankment, causing the vehicle to overturn.The cause of the crash is under investigation. The driver suffered minor injuries and tested negative for alcohol, police said.The Bahia governor, Jerônimo Teixeira, said on X that his administration was supporting rescue efforts and the identification of victims. “I am following the situation with my team and deeply mourn the loss of lives, the injuries and the suffering of all the families,” he wrote.More than 10,000 people died in traffic accidents in Brazil in 2024, according to the transport ministry.In April, 11 people died, including two children, after a passenger bus flipped on its side in south-eastern Brazil.

The last time he received correspondence from the border agency was in July. “Quite simply, they have a legal obligation to bring him back.”Ahmed says that, under thesafe third country agreement, Canada is required to bring Shahriar back because he was detained by border officials within 14 days of illegally entering the US. Even if the CBSA did not invoke the agreement in this case, an exception could still apply, said Ahmed.“If you have a family member in Canada that has legal status or is a refugee claimant – which he had – you are entitled to return. And so our position is either to apply the agreement or acknowledge the exception, but the end result is the same: he needs to come back.”Ahmed has turned to the federal courts, requesting the courts compel a formal decision from CBSA in order to begin the process of a judicial review of the case, under the argument that CBSA is obliged to facilitate Shahriar’s return.He has also petitioned Canada’s public safety minister, Gary Anandasangaree, for assistance in the “unique” case.“In the past we’ve seen people from the US trying to enter Canada and border officials reject them, citing the safe third country agreement. We’re now asking them to apply those same rules of the agreement to this case,” said Ahmed.Canada’s border services agency says as a broader policy, it does not comment on specific cases and does not intervene on behalf of foreign nationals subject to immigration enforcement in another country.CBSA did say that anyone trying to enter Canada must appear at an official examination centre to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.But Ahmed said Ice will not bring Shahriar to an examination centre without prior approval from the CBSA. He says correspondence with Ice also suggests US officials have reached out to Canadian counterparts and faced resistance.Complicating Shahriar’s case is a failed refugee application in Canada. He arrived to the country in 2019 as a student and fell victim to a fraudulent immigration consultant who portrayed himself as a qualified lawyer. A fraudulent claim was made on his behalf and rejected.Under Canadian law, Shahriar is eligible to apply for pre-removal risk assessment because his failed claim was made more than a year ago. As part of the assessment, officials check whether claimants would face persecution if deported to their home country. If they face substantial risk, they can remain in Canada.“Ice has looked at his case and concluded he would face risks in Bangladesh, so they won’t send him there,” said Ahmed. “And so we want to apply for pre-removal risk assessment because we’re confident Canadian officials will see the dangers he will face if he was ever sent back.”While staying in Canada without legal status, Shahriar managed to bring his mother and sister to the country and Ahmed was able to prepare a successful claim on behalf of Shahriar’s mother.Shahriar’s mother, who has permanent residency in Canada, has been hospitalized on numerous occasions for severe mental health issues compounded by her son’s detention.“My client is in arbitrary detention. He didn’t commit any crime. He didn’t steal anything, didn’t harm anyone or cause trouble. And it’s been like this for nearly half a year,” said Ahmed, calling the case a “profoundly disappointing” situation. “He doesn’t know where he’s going. He can’t be deported to Bangladesh. He needs to go back to Canada. And so we’re asking Canadian officials to do what’s right – but also what they’re legally obliged to do.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)AmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In the popular description, they overthrew the concept of “mirror symmetry”.Before Lee and Yang questioned this fundamental principle, it was believed that the mirror image of any process displays a sequence of events that could equally well occur in the real world. In effect, there is no way to tell whether you are viewing a real event or its mirror image.View image in fullscreenChinese Nobel prize-winning physicist Chen Ning Yang in 2014.Photograph: APYang was brought up in the atmosphere of the campus of Tsinghua University, outside Beijing, where his father was a professor of mathematics, according to biographical detail on the Nobel prize website.After completing his undergraduate and a master of science at Chinese universities, he moved to the US at the end of the second world war on a fellowship at the University of Chicago.There, he came under the influence of Prof Enrico Fermi, the Italian andnaturalisedAmerican physicist renowned for being the creator of the world’s first artificialnuclear reactor.Since 1949, Yang was associated with the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where he became a professor in 1955.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsChinaNobel prizesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) has also brought proceedings against Westpac, which remain before the courts.Lenders have worked to make it easier for customers to provide hardship notices and be assessed for support over 2024-25, increasing the speed and completion rate of assessment processes, Asic reported in September.But improved access to hardship applications combined with cost-of-living pressures have resulted in a surge in hardship notices, with Victoria recording the highest number nationally, Asic found.Column graph showing number of hardship notices per quarter rising from 2022 to nowThe data from Afca’s annual review, shared exclusively with Guardian Australia before its release on 22 October, showed rising complaints regarding home loan repayment struggles were offset by declining rejections of calls for help, with complaints related to financial difficulty falling to 4,764.The ombudsman received more than 100,000 customer complaints about financial institutions in 2024-25.A financial counsellor with the national debt helpline, Claire Tacon, said borrowers who asked their lender for lenience were entitled to a response and should contact Afca if they were met with silence.“It’s really disappointing that people are coming to us after trying to resolve their issue with the banks, speaking to the hardship department there, but coming away not being assisted and not knowing what their rights are,” Tacon said.“Afca will contact the bank [then] usually it is resolved, but it’s later than it should have been, and it’s after a lot of stress and worry for the customer.”One home loan borrower, a long-term client of her bank, experienced periods of hardship in 2022 and again in 2023. She alerted her bank but the bank issued a default notice and began enforcement action that April.In 2025, Afca found the bank had no right to take that action before responding to the financial hardship requests, requiring the bank to pay $2,250 in compensation and refund any enforcement costs and default rates of interest it had charged the borrower.Explore more on these topicsBankingCost-of-living crisisAsicBusinessBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not kids bullying kids, it’s AI bullying kids, humiliating them, hurting them, telling them they’re losers … telling them to kill themselves. I can’t think of anything more terrifying than that,” Clare said.There is increasing concern over teenagers using AI.Elon Musk’s xAI accuses OpenAI of stealing trade secrets in new lawsuitRead moreIn California, the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine are suing OpenAI, the company behind the hugely popular ChatGPT platform, alleging it encouraged their son totake his own life.After the Raine family filed the complaint, the company issued a statementacknowledgingthe shortcomings of its models when it came to addressing people “in serious mental and emotional distress” and said it was working to improve the systems to better “recognise and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input”.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“The idea that it can be an app that’s telling you to kill yourself and that children have done this overseas terrifies me,” Clare said. He did not identify any particular AI chatbots.On Saturday, the minister announced a raft of new anti-bullying measures, including schools having to act on bullying incidents within 48 hours, and teachers to receive specialist training. The initiatives are part of a new national plan to end bullying.State and territory education ministers have backed the key recommendations of the national anti-bullying plan after a meeting on the Gold Coast on Friday.Teachers will be supported with extra training and tools to deal with bullying and act on it earlier, with the federal government tipping $5m into resources for educators, parents and students.‘A promising, practical solution’: Sydney’s new schools-based therapy changes how teachers and parents deal with bullyingRead moreThere will also be $5m for a national awareness campaign.The anti-bullying rapid review stated punitive measures such as suspensions or expulsions “can be appropriate in some circumstances” for bullying children.The best results, however, typically involve taking steps to help repair relationships and address underlying causes for the harmful behaviour, it said.One in four students between years four and nine have reported bullying every few weeks or more, the review said. School-age children or teens who have been bullied are more likely than their peers to experience mental health and wellbeing issues.Cyberbullying is also prevalent among young people, with reports to the eSafety Commissioner surging more than 450% between 2019 and 2024.Preventing online bullying is one of the motivations behind the federal government’s incoming social media ban for under-16s, due to come into force on 10 December.In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

Philips said they had carried out subsequent testing and found no BPA, while Sophie la Girafe said the amount found was insignificant.All three dummies were marketed as either “BPA- free” or “natural rubber”.BPA is a synthetic chemical used in the production of plastics, but it has a structure similar to the female hormone, oestrogen, which it mimics in the bodies of humans and other animals.Chloe Topping, a campaigner with Chem Trust, who was not involved in the research, said: “The health effects of BPA are extensive: breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometriosis, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, altered immune system, effects on reproduction, brain development and behaviour, including behaviour in children.”Children are particularly vulnerable “because they’re still developing, their organs are very sensitive to disruption”, Topping said, with exposure to bisphenol A at an early age or in the womb linked to reduced sperm counts and early onset puberty. “And the thing about endocrine-disrupting chemicals … is that they can act at very, very low concentrations,” she said.Researchers bought 19 baby dummies from shops in the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Hungary, and two from the online marketplace Temu, manufactured by Foshan City Saidah Baby Products. To mimic the conditions inside an infant’s mouth, they placed each dummy in an artificial saliva solution for 30 minutes at 37C (98.6F). The resulting extract was analysed to determine the content of bisphenols.Out of four dummies in which BPA was detected, the highest concentration was found in the Curaprox baby grow with love soother. Despite being marketed as “BPA-free”, researchers found a BPA concentration of 19 micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) – a breach of the 10µg limit for migration of BPA from babies’ dummies set by the EU.The second highest concentration was found in Sophie la Girafe’s “natural rubber” pacifier. Laboratory testing found a BPA concentration of 3µg/kg in the product. A concentration of 2µg/kg was found in the Philips Avent ultra air soother, also marketed as “BPA-free”, and one pacifier sourced from Temu, manufactured by Foshan City Saidah.Curaden, which manufactures the Curaprox range, said the result for its baby grow with love soother “came as a surprise”. The company carried out its own tests which corroborated the finding. “Out of an abundance of caution and in line with our commitment to quality, Curaden immediately decided to proactively remove the soothers [from affected batches] from the market and to offer refunds to all affected customers,” the spokesperson said.Vulli, the makers of Sophie la Girafe, pushed back. “We have not had any pacifiers in our catalogue for some time,” a spokesperson for the toymaker said. Thereremain pictures on its websiteof babies using the dummy, but it is no longer listed for sale. “In any case, all our products are subject to exclusive [BPA] testing before being marketed, carried out by an accredited laboratory [SGS],” the spokesperson said.“As a reminder, the regulatory limit for [BPA] migration is set at 0.04 mg/kg, and the laboratory’s detection limit is 0.01 mg/kg. The value mentioned in the article (3µg/kg, or 0.003 mg/kg) is well below this detection limit and therefore insignificant,” said the Vulli spokesperson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These tests also confirm no detectable BPA across our soother ranges, including the sample tested, and validated that they are BPA-free.”Foshan City Saidah did not respond to a request for comment.The Philips and Sophie la Girafe products are available in the UK, but the Curaprox and Foshan City Saidah products have been removed from the market.Hana Hoffmannová, the editor-in-chief at dTest’s magazine publication, said: “Pacifiers are often one of the first items parents buy, and they do not expect to be exposing their children to hormone-disrupting chemicals from day one.”The current EU regulation around BPA in dummies is ambiguous. The EN 1400 standard sets a limit for BPA migration from babies’ dummies at 10µg/l, but theEuropean Toy Safety Directive, which also covers soothers, sets a limit of 40µg/l.EU law has banned the use of BPA in babies’ bottles entirely since 2011 and these rules were widened in 2018 to include the production of food containers and bottles for children under three years old. Karolína Brabcová of Arnika, a Czech campaign group, said: “It is illogical that bisphenols are banned in baby bottles but not in pacifiers, which babies use more intensively and in some cases for long years.“We are seeing a lack of stringent regulation and it is failing consumers.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Whoever sets the agenda has an impact on what voters think and who they vote for.”While the research was focused on Germany, this normalisation effect was likely to apply to countries across Europe, said Daniel Saldivia Gonzatti, a political sociologist at the Berlin Social Science Center and co-author of the study. “You see this a lot in German and British media,” he said. “The far right says something and everybody starts talking about it for one week. And everyone is shocked by it, but it is making headlines. Even if you’re countering it, you’re repeating it.”At times, leaders had alsohardened their discourseto match that of the far right. In a 2023 interview, Olaf Scholz, the then German chancellor and leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD), said it was time to “deport on a large scale those who have no right to stay in Germany” and called for deportations to happen “more often and faster” across the country.Similar examples can be found across Europe, as the politicians of countries ranging from the UK to Franceadopt the languageof the far right, particularly when it comes to migration, creating an echo chamber thatwould have been unthinkableto many a decade ago.At the heart of the issue was the question of who was setting the tone and deciding on the topic, said Saldivia Gonzatti. “If you’re a moderate party and you are talking about what we call cultural issues – migration, integration – in a way that is dictated by the rhythm of the far right, that’s the whole idea of agenda setting.”Other political parties have gone one step further,seeking to copythe hardline agenda of the far right, even as research suggests that doing so drives voters to cast their ballot for the far right.The scope of data collected revealed that the influence of far-right parties had been gradual and had increased over time, said Völker. “Public perception doesn’t change from one day to another. But if you hear this negative framing around migration every second week, and it is being spread not only by far-right parties but also, for example, by the Social Democrats, then of course this narrative travels further.”The findings build on previous studies that have shown that the far right has been steadily normalised, whether through the decisions of mainstream parties to join forces with them incoalitions and alliancesor the attentionshoweredon them by mass media.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An exception, she said, was the Nordic countries where the far-right influence had moved into what she described as the “second stage”, extending past cultural issues to occupy a wide range of topics.“As all the mainstream parties have already adopted the agenda of the far right on some positions related to migration, they are already kind of past the point where the far right sets the agenda only on migration,” Völker said.The research highlighted the need for mainstream political parties to carve out their own discourses, said Saldivia Gonzatti, particularly when it came to topics such as migration and integration, rather than constantly trail after the far right.“It’s like a dance,” he said. “If the conductor is far-right and you’re reacting to it, you cannot decide which music should be playing.”Explore more on these topicsThe far rightGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Gaza’s civil defence agency said the family were trying to reach their home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City when the bus they were in was attacked for allegedly crossing the “yellow line” that demarcates areas of Israeli army control.“They had crossed the so-called ‘yellow line’, an imaginary boundary mentioned by the Israeli army,” said Mahmoud Basal, the spokesperson for the Gaza civil defence. “I am certain the family couldn’t distinguish between the yellow and red lines because there are no actual physical markers on the ground.”Footage released by Gaza’s civil defence agency show the bodies of the family during the retrieval mission in conjunction with the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The victims include seven children and three women.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip”, adding: “The troops fired warning shots toward the suspicious vehicle, but the vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them. The troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.”Israel and Hamas have continued to trade blame over breaches of the truce. Israel accused the militant group of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return the remains of deceased hostages. On Monday, Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but as of Saturday evening had handed back only 12 of 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins of Gaza.Turkey has deployed dozens of disaster relief specialists to help search for bodies under the rubble. Efforts to recover bodies over a week into the ceasefire continue, with the Palestinian death toll now above 68,000, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Gaza’s civil defence agency estimates that thebodies of about 10,000 peopleare trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings. The task ahead of the rescuers is immense given that there is an estimated 60m tonnes of rubble across the territory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Doctors at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis saidthe bodies showed signs of torture and execution, including blindfolds, cuffed hands and bullet wounds in the head, according to doctors’ accounts.Meanwhile, aid remains critically scarce in Gaza one week into the ceasefire, humanitarian agencies have warned, as Israel delays the entry of food convoys into the territory.The Palestinian embassy in Egypt announced on Saturday that Palestinian citizens living in Egypt who want to return to Gaza will be able to travel via the Rafah crossing starting on Monday.In a separate development on Saturday, an Israeli strike on a construction vehicle in southern Lebanon killed a man, the Lebanese health ministry reported.Israel has repeatedly bombed Lebanon despite a November ceasefire that brought to an end more than a year of hostilities with the militant group Hezbollah that culminated in two months of open war.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s foreign ministry earlier said the crossing would probably reopen on Sunday.The Israeli military said late on Saturday that the Red Cross had received the bodies of two hostages held inGazaas part of a ceasefire deal, meaning the remains of 12 hostages have now been handed over.Israel has violated ceasefire 47 times and killed 38 Palestinians, says Gaza media officeRead moreThe handover of remains is among key points – along with aid deliveries into Gaza and the devastated territory’s future – in the ceasefire process meant to end two years of war.The Rafah crossing is the only one that was not controlled by Israel before the war. It has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Palestinians to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt.Israel has beenreturning the bodies of Palestinianswith no names, only numbers. Gaza’s health ministry has been posting photos of them online, hoping families would come forward.“Just like they took their captives, we want our captives. Bring me my son, bring all our kids back,” said a tearful Iman Sakani, whose son went missing during the war. She was among dozens of anxious families waiting at Nasser hospital. One woman knelt, crying over a body after identifying it.As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel on Saturday returned 15 bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, bringing the total it has returned to 135. Meanwhile,Gaza’s ruinswere being scoured for the dead. Newly recovered bodies brought the Palestinian toll above 68,000, according to the health ministry. Thousands of people are still missing, according to the Red Cross.Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, that sparked the war.Donald Trump has warned Hamas that he would greenlight a resumption of the war by Israel if the militant group failed to return the remains of all dead hostages.Hamas has said it is committed to the ceasefire deal, but that the retrieval of remains is hampered by the devastation and the presence of unexploded ordnance. The group has told mediators that some remains are in areas controlled by Israeli troops.Hamas, in turn, has urged mediators to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza for its 2 million people. There are continued closures of crossings and Israeli restrictions on aid groups.Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Egypt is still being consulted on whether the force should be a full UN-led operation.It is not expected that European or British troops will be involved, but Britain has sent advisers to a small cell being operated by the US inside Israel that is working on implementing the second phase of the20-point plan developed by Donald Trump, the US president.The UK is stressing that the ultimate aim is a Palestinian state , which must be seen eventually as a single entity including the West Bank and East Jerusalem.The UK has already been training a Palestinian police force contingent but the international force will be given lead responsibility under the proposal.If the force proves effective, Israel will withdraw further. Israel has however been insisting it will retain a large Israeli controlled buffer zone to protect itself from freshHamasattacks.British diplomats admit that the issue of decommissioning Hamas weapons will be the most difficult and it is contributing ideas from the process in Northern Ireland, where IRA and Protestant-controlled weapons were put beyond use including through an independent verification body.It is probable that Hamas will only decommission weapons to a Palestinian-led body to ensure connotations of surrender are minimised, but third parties could be used to verify this for Israel. The process is very likely to start with Hamas’s heavy weaponry and missile launchers, with the much more fraught issue of personal weapons owned by Hamas brigades deferred.The UK seems to be fully behind the former UK prime ministerTony Blairtaking a place on a board – referred to as the board of peace in Trump’s plan – intended to oversee the work of a 15-strong committee of Palestinian technocrats.Blair, accused of destabilising the Middle East by backing the 2003 US invasion ofIraq, has won influential support from the current Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia’ al-Sudani.Speaking to CNBC, the Iraqi leader said: “Tony Blair is a person acceptable to the Iraqis and a friend, having contributed to the decision to go to war with President Bush at the time and to overthrow Saddam Hussein’s regime.“He is a great friend of the Iraqis and visits us often and I also hold meetings with him. We certainly wish him success in this mission and we will support him.”Blair’s place on the board, to be chaired by Trump, is expected to be clarified by the second week of November, when Egypt will host a majorGazareconstruction conference in Cairo trying to bring together a pool of international donors and private sector finance. The UK believes the scale of the required funds in excess of $67bn (£50bn) is so vast that private finance will have to be used as well as Gulf donors.View image in fullscreenThe scale of destruction in Gaza City poses an urgent challenge for its population.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOfficials admit that the precise relationship between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the board of peace needs to be clarified.Next Wednesday it is expected that the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague will find against Israel forending all cooperation with UN aid agenciesincluding the main Palestinian agency, Unrwa.‘It’s like a nuclear bomb has hit’: shocked Palestinians return home to desolationRead moreThe request for an ICJ advisory opinion initially brought by Norway and backed by a UN security council resolution will give the ICJ judges an opportunity once again to clarify that Israel as an occupying force had a legal duty to provide aid to the people of Gaza, and it has utterly failed to comply with that duty.The PA foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian, said the PA had learned from its mistakes and was now a state in the making. Speaking to a conference in Naples organised by IPSI the Italian thinktank, she said one of the most important changes the PA was undertaking involved the school curriculum.But she said: “If we develop that curriculum to the best standards of the world but children that are taught that curriculum continue to live under dire occupation will that give them a narrative of peace? No. What will bring them a narrative of peace, and internalise it, is when children do not experience, on a daily basis, checkpoints, a humiliation, trees being uprooted, the farms being burned and the fathers killed.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warTony BlairDonald TrumpEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

He disliked the pact, signed by one of his predecessors, Barack Obama, and was discouraged from diplomacy by Iran’s arch-enemy, Israel.As a result of the US withdrawal Tehran began stepping up its nuclear programme.European-led talks to resurrect the agreement have failed, and this summer’s bombing raids on Iran by Israel and the US left hopes for a revival at a historic low.After that12-day war in June, Iran’s parliament passed a bill torefuse to cooperatewith the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear inspectorate.That led to signatories Britain, Germany and France triggering the so-called “snapback” process, leading to the reimposition of the UN sanctions. The snapback provision allows for the rapid and automatic reimposition of all UN sanctions that were lifted under the deal if Iran were to significantly violate its nuclear commitmentsThose snapback sanctions in effect made a formality of “termination day”, which was set for 18 October, exactly 10 years after the adoption of UN security council resolution 2231.Last month, when the snapback sanctions went into effect, the British, French and German foreign ministerssaid in a joint statementthey would continue to seek “a new diplomatic solution to ensure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon”.The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said the sanctions “must not be the end of diplomacy” and that “a sustainable solution to the Iranian nuclear issue can only be achieved through negotiations”.On Monday, Trumpsaid that he wanted a peace deal with Iran, while Tehran has repeatedly said it remains open to diplomacy with the US, provided Washington offers guarantees against military action during any potential talks.Trump’s Middle East ‘peace’ pitch to Iran falls flat in Tehran and JerusalemRead moreThe three European powers also last week announced they would seek to restart talks to find a “comprehensive, durable and verifiable agreement”.Still, relations between the west and Iran remain strained. Washington had already imposed large sanctions, including trying to force all countries to shun Iranian oil. Several rounds of Omani-brokered talks this year between Tehran and Washington failed to reach an agreement.Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said last week that Tehran did “not see any reason to negotiate” with European powers, given that they had triggered the snapback mechanism.Western governments and Israel have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, a claim Tehran denies, saying its programme is energy and civil-focused.Iran is expected to mark termination day with a statement later on Saturday at the UN in New York.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIranIran nuclear dealIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

His death was confirmed in December 2023. His daughter, Nili Margalit, was also kidnapped andreturned as part of a deal in November 2023.The IDFsaidin a post on X that it had informed Margalit’s family after his remains were sent to the Ministry of Health’s National Center for Forensic Medicine in Israel.The office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that it would “spare no effort until we return all of the fallen abductees, down to the last one”.View image in fullscreenEliyahu Margalit.Photograph: Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/ReutersMargalit, a grandfather of three who was kidnapped while tending to his horses, is the 10th deceased hostage Israel has received out of 28 bodies held inGaza.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas was obliged to make best efforts in returning all the deceased hostages they held. The families of dead hostages still in Gaza have accused the government of betraying them by signing the deal on such terms. A protest will be held on Saturday night at “hostages square” in Tel Aviv.Ruby Chen, the father of the Israeli-American hostage Itay Chen, who was 19 when he was killed by Hamas in his tank and taken to Gaza on 7 October, said it was important that people turned out for the demonstration.He said: “It’s human to want to move on and have a clean slate, to go back and being happy or living a normal life – and [the families of the hostages] are now in conflict with that.“But we had a deal for 48 hostages. We have 29. don’t see that as the narrative that we want to keep and say 29 of the 48 came out.”Hamas, citing technical problems, has said it needed heavy machinery and excavating equipment to speed up the process of locating bodies buried under rubble.On Friday, two bulldozers ploughed up the earth as Hamas searched for hostages’ remains in Hamad city, a complex of apartment towers in the city of Khan Younis.Israeli forces repeatedly bombarded the towers during the war, toppling some, and troops conducted a week-long raid there in March 2024.Turkey sent a team of specialists to help retrieve remains buried under the rubble, but the group was still waiting on Friday for Israeli permission to enter the territory.“It remains unclear when Israel will allow the Turkish team to enter Gaza,” a Turkish official told AFP, noting that the team’s mission included locating Palestinian and hostage remains. A Hamas source told AFP the Turkish delegation was expected to enter by Sunday.‘We feel betrayed’: Israeli families still seeking return of deceased hostagesRead moreIsrael, insisting Hamas knows the whereabouts of the hostages’ bodies, has said the group was running out of time. Hamas has said it remains committed to the ceasefire agreement and to handing over the bodies of all remaining hostages.Israel has returned to Gaza the bodies of 90 Palestinians for burial. Israel is expected to return more bodies, although officials have not said how many are in its custody or how many will be returned.The dispute over hostage remains has cast a shadow over the ceasefire agreement – the first phase of US president Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war.At a news conference in Ankara, Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said Israel’s statements about the hostage bodies were worrying. “Will Israel use Hamas’ incapability to locate bodies left under rubble … as an excuse and break the ceasefire? There is concern in the international community over this,” he said.Earlier on Friday, Hamas called on mediators to push for the next steps under the ceasefire, includingreopening the border, letting in aid,beginning reconstruction, setting up an administration and completing Israel’s withdrawal.Fighting has largely stopped in Gaza under Trump’s plan, endorsed by mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. However, Gaza’s Civil Defence Service said on Friday that 11 people were killed when Israeli troops opened fire on a vehicle south east of Gaza City, including seven children and three women.The Israeli military did not comment on the incident, and Hamas again accused Israel of violating on the ceasefire.The 20 living hostages who were taken by Hamas along with others during its assault on Israel on 7 October 2023 werereturned from Gaza earlier this week.Israel said on Thursday it was preparing for the reopening of Gaza’s Rafah crossing with Egypt to allow Palestinians to move in and out, but gave no date as it traded blame with Hamas over violations of the ceasefire.Other unresolved elements of the plan include the disarmament of militants and Gaza’s future governance.With Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

It will also promote greater trade union recognition and collective bargaining in the clean energy sector, including when jobs are offshore.Miliband’s announcement was welcomed by unions fromUniteto the GMB, which have long been pushing for a more detailed plan for how people will switch from old fossil fuel industries to those in clean energy in the future.As part of the plan, 31 professions will be designated as priorities for recruitment and training, with plumbers, heating and ventilating installers at the top of the list with an additional 8,000 to 10,000 needed by 2030. Carpenters, electricians and welders are the next highest in demand on the list, with 4,000 to 8,500 extra of each required.Miliband said the national plan “answers a key question about where the good jobs of the future will come from”.View image in fullscreenEd Miliband, the energy secretary, says the national plan makes clear what jobs are needed for the green energy transition.Photograph: James Glossop/ReutersAs well as flagging to jobseekers what kind of green jobs are needed, the energy secretary said it would “send a signal to the mayors, regional mayors, who have lots of responsibilities in this area about where they need to be directing their further education colleges and others where the big opportunities are.“It sends a signal to industry, who have been saying … set out what are the needs going be and how are we going to fill them.”Miliband said the promise of hundreds of thousands of new roles in the renewables and clean energy sector would show that Reform UK is “waging war on jobs” bychallenging the switch to net zero.“Obviously, this is a massive fight with Reform,” he said. “Reformers said they’ll wage war on clean energy. Well, that’s waging war on these jobs … It’s all part of their attempt at a culture war, but I actually think they’re out of tune with the British people because I think people recognise that we need, that we want the jobs from clean energy.“We want the lower bills that it can bring. So let’s have the argument as a country about what we’re going to do. I’m really confident we can win this argument.”He said estimates show jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of more than £50,000, compared with the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.Other announcements in the plan include five new technical excellence colleges that will help train young people into essential roles, with skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire to be backed by £2.5m towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A meeting with Birmingham’s safety advisory group (SAG) has been set up for next week.Home Office offers extra resources in effort to undo Maccabi Tel Aviv fans banRead moreThe BBCreportedthat Villa had informed stewards they had permission to skip their duties on the day of the fixture, Thursday 6 November, before the decision to ban fans was made by police.In an email apparently sent on 3 October, stewards were told that “regarding the upcoming fixture against Maccabi Tel Aviv … we appreciate that some of you may have concerns about attending work”, the broadcaster reported.Those who were meant to work on the day were told they would “be able to submit a one-off absence request”, and this “will allow you to register your absence for this specific fixture”.Aston Villa had also made clear that “this type of absence will not affect your contractual minimum attendance of 80%”.This email was reportedly sent after a number of stewards allegedly raised concerns over safety on the day, and it is unclear how many stewards will not work on the day of the fixture. A request to not work would have to be submitted four days prior to the match’s scheduled date.West Midlands police had said on Thursday they had classified Villa’s home fixture against Maccabi as “high risk” based on intelligence. The police force also highlightedviolence that occurred during a 2024 Uefa Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi in Amsterdam, where more than 60 people were arrested over the violence that was called a “toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger” by authorities.Four local people were given short jail terms for the violence against Maccabi fans. A report by Dutch police into the disorder during the 2024 Amsterdam match found Maccabi fans had torn a Palestinian flag down from a local building and burned it, shouted: “Fuck you, Palestine”, andvandalised a taxi. Maccabi fans were also taped chanting “Olé, olé. Let the IDF win, fuck the Arabs.”The ban imposed by West Midlands police came after pressure from the local independent MP, Ayoub Khan. Khan told BBC Two’s Newsnight on Thursday: “We cannot conflate [this issue with] antisemitism when we look at what some of these fans did in Amsterdam in 2024 … We’re talking about violent fans and I think the prime minister should stay out of operational matters.”The Campaign Against Antisemitismsaidon Friday it was notifying Birmingham city council and West Midlands police of its intention to bring a judicial review against the ban of Maccabi fans, which it said was “pernicious” and had “angered the whole country”.Keir Starmer called the police force’s decision “wrong”, saying “we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets”. Uefa, the governing body of European football, has urged local authorities in Birmingham to allow Maccabi fans to travel to the match.In a statement on their website, Aston Villasaid: “The club are in continuous dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities throughout this ongoing process, with the safety of supporters attending the match and the safety of local residents at the forefront of any decision.”Aston Villa have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaWest MidlandsMaccabi Tel AvivPoliceBirminghamEuropa LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The LDRS also stated that Freeman reported the video to the police.Responding to the clip, Freeman said: “The video is a fabrication, created without my knowledge or consent, and uses my image and voice without permission. Regardless of my position as an MP, that should be an offence.”He added: “This sort of political disinformation has the potential to seriously distort, disrupt and corrupt our democracy.”View image in fullscreenA still taken from the ‘AI-generated deepfake’.Photograph: FacebookThe MP then said he did not know whether the incident was a “politically motivated attack” or a “dangerous prank”. He also said that there has been a “huge increase in political disinformation, disruption and extremism” on both the left and right in recent months.Freeman said: “I have reported this matter to the relevant authorities, and I urge anyone who sees the video to report it immediately rather than share it further.”After getting elected in 2010, Freeman served in various ministerial positions in the previous Conservative government. Most recently, he was the minister for science, innovation and technology.Norfolk police have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsConservativesArtificial intelligence (AI)DeepfakeReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Andrew announced on Friday he would no longer use the title but he will officially retain the dukedom, which can only be removed by an act of parliament.Giuffre was 41 when she died by suicide in April.She said she was abused by Epsteinfrom the age of 16 and trafficked to other powerful men. She brought a civil case against Andrew in New York, alleging he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17.Andrew made no admission of liability and has always denied Giuffre’s claims, but agreed to settle the case out of court. The Telegraph reported on Saturday that, as part of the deal, Giuffre agreed not to repeat her accusations for a year to avoid tarnishing Queen Elizabeth II’s platinum jubilee.There have been longstanding rumours that the late queen partly funded the settlement with private income from the Duchy of Lancaster, a property portfolio that has been controlled by reigning monarchs since medieval times.Maskell said: “I think we need a lot of clarity over this. I think honesty is so important. Virginia Giuffre no longer is with us, but she has family. It’s important that everyone has transparency. There is no space for obfuscation, no matter how embarrassing it is.”Andrew continues to live in the palatial 30-room Royal Lodge in Windsor, despite having no discernible income beyond a naval pension. He has a 75-year lease on the property and is responsible for maintaining it. He has reportedly resisted the king’s efforts to move him to nearby Frogmore Cottage.In a statement released on Friday, Andrew saidhe had made the decision to surrender his titlesafter a discussion with the king, where it was “concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A life he was born to replaced by a life he will hate | Stephen BatesRead moreHe will also give up use of his honours as a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. His only remaining title will be that of prince. As he was born the son of a queen, this cannot be removed.It was reported on Saturday that the Prince of Wales was not satisfied with the outcome and will take a more ruthless approach to his disgraced uncle, including banning him from his future coronation.William was consulted on the decision that led to Andrew relinquishing his dukedom on Friday, but the Sunday Times said William “knows the ‘Andrew problem’ will be in his in-tray at some point”.Maskell, who lost the Labour whip in July after rebellions on welfare policy, previously introduced a bill aimed at giving the monarch powers to remove titles of his own accord, or after the recommendation of a joint parliament committee.She said she would attempt to reintroduce the bill to parliament next week, suggesting she had support from other MPs. Maskell added: “We stand up for really high values in [York]. When there was polling on this back in 2022, 80% of residents said they did not want that title continued because of the association with our city. That’s why I have stood firm.”Last weekend, the Mail on Sunday and the Sun on Sunday reported that Andrew contacted Epstein the day after a picture of him with his arm around a teenage Giuffre was published in the press. In 2019, Andrew told the then BBC journalist Emily Maitlis that he had cut contact with Epstein by this point during his infamous Newsnight interview. The newspapers quoted from an email in which Andrew reportedly told Epstein: “I’m just as concerned for you! Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, said Andrew’s decision to surrender his titles was a “joyous moment”. He added: “I think her kids would be incredibly proud to know that their mom is an American hero. She’s an international hero. That all the years of work that she put in is now coming to some sort of justice and these monsters can’t escape from it.”The Epstein accuser Haley Robson called the news “extremely bittersweet”. She told the BBC: “I have moments of joyous tears where I’m just flabbergasted that something finally broke.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I’m not a king,” Trump said in aFox Newsinterview.Later Friday, a Trump campaign social media account mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president clothed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.At a White House event on Wednesday, Trump tried to downplay the No Kings events. “I hear very few people [are] going to be there, by the way, but they have their day coming up and they want to have their day in the sun,” he said. Trump is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.In a counter-programming move,JD Vanceand defense secretary Pete Hegseth were attending a live-fire amphibious capabilities demonstration at Camp Pendleton in California to commemorate the US Marine Corps’ 250th birthday.However, a plan to fire live artillery shells over a nearby highway drew objections from governorGavin Newsom, who said it forced the California highway patrol toclose a portion of a major interstatethrough southern California for safety reasons.“The President is putting his ego over responsibility with this disregard for public safety,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn’t just wrong – it’s dangerous.”Vanceposted a comment on Xalluding to a meeting between New York’s Democratic mayoral candidateZohran Mamdaniand Siraj Wahhaj, imam of at-Taqwa, whoappeared on a list of un-indicted co-conspiratorsin the trial of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.“I’ve been reliably informed that Democrats are opposed to any kind of political violence, so I look forward to them universally condemning Zohran Mamdani for campaigning with an unindicted co-conspirator in a terrorist plot that killed 6 New Yorkers,” Vance wrote.Fox News, meanwhile,ran a reportclaiming that organizers embedded in the global intifada to destroy the state of Israel had moved to join the No Kings protests in New York under the organizational groupings of “UAW Labor for Palestine” and “NYC Labor for Palestine”.The right-leaning outlet also reported on Friday that foundations connected to George Soros were funding the No Kings protests via a$3m grantto theorganizer Indivisible“to support the grantee’s social welfare activities”.The relative silence of Republican leaders on Saturday came in contrast with efforts last week to preview the second No Kings day as a “hate America” day populated by Hamas sympathizers and a reason why Democrats were delaying an agreement to end the government shutdown, now on its 18th day.Republican leaders disparaged rally-goers as “communists” and “Marxists”, and claimed that centrist Democrats, including the senate minority leaderChuck Schumer, who marched in New York, were being held political hostage by the far left.“I encourage you to watch – we call it the ‘hate America’ rally – that will happen Saturday,” said the House speaker, Mike Johnson of Louisiana.“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson added, listing groups including “antifa types”, people who “hate capitalism” and “Marxists in full display”.Explore more on these topicsProtests (US)Donald TrumpTrump administrationRepublicansProtestJD VanceFox NewsnewsShareReuse this content"

The closure will remain in effect from 11am to 3pm.The event in question will include a live-fire amphibious capabilities demonstration at Red Beach,according to a statementfrom the US marine corps. JD Vance, a former enlisted marine who served in Iraq, is scheduled to speak to at least 15,000 marines, sailors, veterans and families expected to attend. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth will also deliver remarks.“The capabilities demonstration will feature integrated Navy and Marine Corps operations across air, land and sea,” the Marines’ statement said.The US Marine Corps insisted that the event will comply with established safety protocols, and “no public highways or transportation routes will be closed”.The CHP said in a statement that the military event will involve “live ammunition being discharged by the federal government over the freeway” and made the call to temporarily close a portion of the freeway due to the safety risk and distractions to drivers.Earlier in the week, California governorGavin Newsomhad decried the plans to fire live rounds over Interstate 5, calling it an “absurd show of force” and “totally uncalled for ”.On Saturday morning, Newsom was concerned that the stunt could put Californians in harm’s way. “Flying live rounds over a busy highway without coordination between state, federal, and local partners isn’t just wrong – it’s dangerous,” Newsom posted on social media.The criticism underscored the growing tensions between Donald Trump and the California governor, who has frequently called out decisions by the president’s administration.This celebration was granted no exception from Newsom’s ire. “Using our military to intimidate people you disagree with politically doesn’t make you look strong,” Newsom said. “It makes you look weak. It’s reckless, it’s disrespectful, and yet another action beneath the office of the presidency.”Earlier in October, the navyhosted the presidentaboard an aircraft carrier off the coast of Virginia to celebrate the same military anniversary. Trump turned that event into a political rally.This show of force coincides withNo Kings rallies and marchesbeing held across the US, including several locations inCalifornia, aligning behind a message that the nation’s slide into authoritarian rule under Trump needs to stop.Newsomcautionedthose participating in the rallies: “I urge our nation to use this weekend’s No Kings marches as a declaration of independence against the tyranny and lawlessness currently running this country. Use your voice. ACT PEACEFULLY. Protect yourself and your community. THERE ARE NO KINGS IN THE UNITED STATES.”In a statement to the New York Times, a spokesperson for Vance, William Martin, said Newsom was misleading the public about the safety risk for the event on Saturday. He said it was routine training.“If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,” Martin said.Matt Rocco, the California department of transportation spokesperson, said: “This is all because of the White House-directed military event, that for the safety of the public, we need to shut down the freeway since they’re sending live ordnances over the freeway.”Rocco said the I5 closure could cost up to another two hours of trip time for those commuting betweenSan Diegoand Los Angeles. The freeway carries 80,000 travelers and $94m in freight through the corridor daily, according to the governor’s office. Passenger rail services running parallel to the I5 have also been canceled for the afternoon.Explore more on these topicsSan DiegoUS militaryTrump administrationCaliforniaWest CoastUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He added that his decision to step down, effective Monday, “will upset many, and delight others, but in this political climate I must keep my family safe”.Douglass had been under pressure fromVermontgovernor Phil Scott and state senate minority leader Scott Beck to step aside since Politico obtained and published the chats online.In one exchange, Douglass replied to a message about a “very obese Indian woman” by saying: “She just didn’t bathe often.” In another, Douglass was said to have described how a Jewish person may have made a procedural error. His wife, Brianna Douglass, also on the chat, responded with an antisemitic remark,Politicoreported.Other messages in the chat reflected factional infighting in the YoungRepublicansthat included calling Minnesotan members a slur for gay men and other LGBTQ+ people, Nebraskans “inbred cow fuckers” and members from Rhode Island “traitorous cunts”. There was a reference to a “fat stinky Jew” along with comments and jokes about gas chambers, torture and rape, according to Politico.In his resignation statement, Douglass said the comment “was an unflattering remark about a specific individual, absolutely not a generalization” – and said he hoped to “mend bridges to the best of my ability”.His statement also said that he and his wife, who have recently welcomed their first child, had received “some of the most horrific hate one could imagine”, including threats of violence.Political violence has been a dominant topic in the US in part because of the 10 September killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and the 14 June shootings that killed Minnesota’s former house speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounded state senator John Hoffman – her fellow Democrat – and his wife, Yvette.Douglass said he had also “reached out to the majority of my Jewish and BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color] friends and colleagues to ensure that they can be honest and up-front with me”.Douglass and his wife had earlier resigned from their positions from the Vermont Young Republicans.On Tuesday, after Politico reported on the Telegram chat, governor Scott said, “there is simply no excuse” for “the vile, racist, bigoted, and antisemitic dialogue”.He added that “those involved should resign from their roles immediately and leave the Republican party – including Vermont state senator Sam Douglass”.Trump DoJ seeks to kill Vermont law that makes big oil pay for climate harmRead moreJD Vance downplayed the exchanges as “edgy” and “offensive jokes” told by “kids”, though most members of the group were between the ages of 24 and 35. Vance pointed to leaked messages sent by Jay Jones, a Democrat running for attorney general in Virginia, who suggested a political opponent deserved “two bullets to the head”.“I really don’t want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke – telling a very offensive, stupid joke – is cause to ruin their lives,”Vance said, after in September he demanded consequences for those who made comments about Kirk’s death that he found to be offensive.On Saturday, Beck said Douglass’s resignation marked the end of a “difficult week” in Vermont.“Senator Douglass’ resignation is the first step in Vermont’s healing, and his family’s healing,”Beck told the Washington PostExplore more on these topicsVermontRepublicansUS politicsAntisemitismRacenewsShareReuse this content"

The impact speared him into Norris at speed, lifted Piastri’s car into the air and entirely sheared off one of Norris’s wheels, damage that ended both their races.It was the worst possible scenario for McLaren on a weekend when the team wanted nothing more than a clean meeting to calm the atmosphere that has begun to surround their drivers, with Piastri leading Norris by 22 points in the world championship, as they strive to manage their title fight as fairly as possible.The incident occurs only a week after Norris was told there would be “consequences” for his move in Singapore where he attempted to pass Piastri and in so doing clipped Verstappen and was skewed into the side of his teammate. Both continued but Norris was held to have been in the wrong.This far worse incident in Austin leaves McLaren once more having to address their complex management of their men. Certainly if Norris was at fault for going for a gap in Singapore, Piastri was equally to blame for cutting back at the notoriously crowded turn one in Austin, where the chances of there being more than one car inside him through the apex was very high.View image in fullscreenThe McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri after the sprint race collision.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesThe team principal, Andrea Stella, cited a “lack of prudence” on Hülkenberg ’s behalf but his real issue is how they once more try to balance the increasingly complex scales they are now employing to ensure both drivers are treated equally. The issue has refused to go away and the team’s repeated efforts to be scrupulously fair in intervening has created a torturous set of precedents from which they can no longer simply retreat.“We have lost eight points with both drivers, we just look forward to some normal racing,” Stella noted with a hint of exasperation.The team did well to repair both their cars for qualifying but without having quite the time to prepare as they would like. Norris nonetheless must consider this a good chance to make points back on his teammate but both drivers will be more than aware that neither could come even close to an imperious Verstappen.“Just don’t get hit is my plan for tomorrow,” said Norris after the travails of the sprint. “Hoping for a good race with Max, we’ve had some good ones in the past, so I’m looking forward to it again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have now shown form across a range of circuits and conditions, with the team’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko pronouncing “we are there” of the car earlier this week. Certainly they look in position to compete for wins now at every track and Verstappen demonstrated that emphatically in Austin.After the victory in the sprint he is now 55 points off Piastri and what had once appeared to be an insurmountable gap is suddenly looking to be a genuine target for the Dutchman. Before the summer break he was 97 points adrift but two wins and two second places since have given him a sniff of a chance which will have cause to focus the mind at McLaren, who have acknowledged their rivals are very much up to speed.On the first hot runs in Q3 Piastri, who did not really settle into a good single lap, opened with a marker but was swiftly eclipsed by Russell. Norris and Verstappen followed and the Dutchman was immediately quick in the first two sectors, before he claimed provisional pole by almost a full four-tenths from Norris.It was a huge gap to make up in the final laps but Verstappen had waited again to go out last and could not make the line to begin his last lap before the clock counted down. Yet for all that Red Bull had cut it too fine he had done enough. Norris went hard but could not match him, still three-tenths off the world champion’s time of 1min 32.510sec.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenRed BullLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Enough to see off Fulham, enough to avoid a row over a questionable refereeing decision and enough for Mikel Arteta’s side to increase the pressure on Liverpool before the champions look to move past their slump when they host Manchester United on Sunday afternoon.It never came close to capturing the imagination. There was the inevitable corner to decide a drab contest, Leandro Trossard popping up with an opportunistic goal just before the hour, but there was nothing memorable from Arsenal in open play. They created few openings and for all his graft there was concern about another blunt outing for Viktor Gyökeres, who returned from a troubled international break with Sweden and saw his goalless streak for club and country run into a ninth game.Manchester City’s unstoppable Erling Haaland downs Everton with doubleRead morePatience is required with Gyökeres. Arsenal could do with the big Swede’s goals making these games more comfortable but there were encouraging flashes from the former Sporting Lisbon forward. Gyökeres ran hard and there were moments when he made chances for himself with his burly hold-up play. “We were all begging for him to score,” Arteta said. “The work rate he puts in for the team is phenomenal.”The focus was on the collective as Arsenal tightened their grip on first place by moving three points clear of Manchester City and four ahead of Liverpool. The one worry, perhaps, is the analysis being coloured by the result. After all, the performance was not so different to ones that led to costly dropped points last season; then again, Arteta is entitled to point out that grinding out wins is a vital quality for any team with aspirations of winning the league.Arsenal are not a soft touch any more. They have only conceded three times in the league and have kept five clean sheets from eight games. How to break them down? Riccardo Calafiori and Jurriën Timber are unflinching full-backs while William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães give nothing away in the middle.Fulham, a neat, tidy and creative team, were not granted one shot on target. It was David Raya’s second consecutive game without having to make a save.The questions for Arteta about winning ugly were intended as compliments. Arsenal’s manager smiled and remembered his side dropping points on their previous two trips to Fulham. “The recent history wasn’t in our favour and we wanted to change that,” Arteta said. “That’s another step – having that mindset to win against difficult opposition.”View image in fullscreenLeandro Trossard applies the finishing touch after Gabriel’s near-post flick.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThere were initial complications for Arsenal to sort out. Fulham were combative, even with a host of key players missing, and they created the better chances during the opening exchanges. Raúl Jiménez and Harry Wilson both went close during a positive start from Marco Silva’s side.Arsenal responded through Calafiori, who was a shade offside when he took Trossard’s layoff and battered a shot into the top corner, but the early flow was lacking. A lot of the play was in front of Fulham. Declan Rice and Martín Zubimendi both looked jaded in midfield after their respective exertions for England and Spain.Much has been made of Arsenal’s deep squad, of how Arteta has sought to ensure injuries need not kill his team’s title challenge, but what if the wrong player drops out? The absence of Martin Ødegaard, out for six weeks with a knee injury, is a blow. The captain’s ability to take the ball and keep finding angles is a piercing weapon against deep defences. Eberechi Eze is a different kind of No 10. He is more accustomed to breaking into space but with Sander Berge sitting in front of Fulham’s back four it was not easy for Eze.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zubimendi, Ødegaard’s replacement, slapped his thighs in annoyance after fluffing a simple ball. Bukayo Saka wriggled in from the right but was tracked carefully by Ryan Sessegnon and Alex Iwobi.Short of ingenuity, Arsenal upped the pace of their passing, pressing and movement. Saka made a chance for Gyökeres but Bernd Leno saved well. Calafiori shot over. Fulham’s task grew harder when they were forced into a defensive alteration, Issa Diop replacing the injured Joachim Andersen.The pressure from Arsenal was more persistent than imaginative. They worked the same patterns over and over, repeatedly directing attacks down Saka’s flank, but the goal came from a familiar source. Saka delivered a corner, Gabriel flicked the ball on and Trossard volleyed in from close range.It was all very minimalistic. Arsenal pressed for a second. Leno denied Saka. The Arsenal winger then thought he had a penalty after being challenged by Kevin, the Fulham substitute. Anthony Taylor, though, was persuaded to overturn his decision when he viewed the pitchside monitor and concluded that Kevin had brushed the ball at the same time as bumping knees with Saka.Arsenal’s advantage remained slender, Gyökeres missing a couple of chances. However, any notion that the game was in the balance was an illusion. Arsenal were too solid for an equaliser ever to be a realistic prospect.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Ange Postecoglou was not sacked in the morning. Instead he wassacked in the afternoon. So, another small win there for Ange, even in defeat. Not to mention further proof of the notion to which he has always seemed so fatally in thrall, that he is at any given moment the smartest guy in the room. Even when, as of Saturday afternoon, he’s no longer in the room at all.The official version seems to be that Postecoglou was fired 18 minutes after hisfinal defeat at the City Ground.In reality he was fired in real time, a live-action televised touchline sacking, gone from the moment Evangelos Marinakis disappeared from his seat midway through the second half with the look of a gamekeeper required now to wring the neck of a dying pheasant.Nottingham Forest approach Dyche and Mancini after Postecoglou sackedRead moreWatching Postecoglou delay the moment after the final whistle, out there looking hollow-eyed in front of the near-empty stands, it felt entirely apt that the final image of a manager who projected himself always as a wised-up straight shooter should instead be a moment of touching naivety.No Ange, don’t wander over there. Don’t let yourself to be framed all alone beneath the words “Trent End”, a photographer’s dream, and the perfect shot of a man who always gave the impression of being able to see it all. Apart, that is, from all the things everyone else could see happening to him.This is not meant to be harsh on Postecoglou, who has been a successful coach for a very long time in various places around the world. Those who know him say he is a genuinely nice man, that it is just awkwardness that makes him conduct his press conferences in the manner of a longsuffering vice cop forced against his will to address a room full of convicted perverts, that makes him condescending in public, often to young journalists.But it is also true that Ange to Forest was always a terrible appointment. Mainly because it involved getting rid of a successful, popular and settled predecessor, bookended now by a sacking at the end of an international break.Not all mistakes have to be fatal. Postecoglou made this one into a disaster by never at any stage seeming to understand the assignment.View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou won 13 of his last 50 Premier League matches.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoThere was always something odd about the suggestion he kicked things off by saying, in effect: “Give me time and we can rebuild this project.” Forest were coming off a brilliant season. The current one had already started. Why make the job into a rebuild? Naivety, perhaps. The fatal inflexibility of the systems man. Or just not being very good at the job, paddling out of your depth at this most brutally unforgiving level.In this sense Postecoglou’s sacking seems like a double departure. He has now been fired twice in four months. Is there a league rule similar to the loan regulations that state you can’t be sacked by three clubs in a year? Sadly for Postecoglou this is unlikely to be an issue.He won’t be back here now, not without serious remedial work. And not just because of a record that reads lost 31 and won 13 of his last 50 Premier League games. There is an interesting point of order here.Postecoglou did win the Europa League.Although, some real talk: Spurs had the largest budget in the competition alongside Manchester United. The default option was winning it. The job there was in a sense not to get in the way.Outside that glorious high, Postecoglou has a fair claim, at least in those final 50 games, on the title of least effective Premier League manager ever. Yes, there have been worse win ratios than his 26% (context: 10% below Ruben Amorim). But not in charge of players of this quality. It is even incorrect to say Ange went down firing shots, that he never abandoned his principles. He often tried to play differently. It didn’t work. His teams became not just unsuccessful, but run-of-the-mill unsuccessful. By the end, the most entertaining element was his own apparently unshakable conviction that this was all somehow someone else’s fault, that he, Ange, stood alone on the heath surrounded by fools.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What was your favourite Ange episode? How about saying it’s not all about set pieces, don’t be so ridiculous, mate, before losing your next match to a set piece? How about taking the lead in five consecutive games and losing all of them? Maybe it’s the obvious one, going toNottingham Forestand outdoing Brian Clough at Leeds by taking 40 not 44 days to get the sack, like Johnson in Peep Show being so good at his 30-minute office tai chi routine that he can do it in 10.There are also poignant lessons from Ange in England. The dealings with the media may be irrelevant, but they gave a glimpse into the source of his wider struggles, not least the need to accept that, even with a track record of success elsewhere, there may actually be things to learn still, and that this place will swarm all over any weakness, however minor.Gone in 18 minutes: Postecoglou’s rapid exit leaves Marinakis rebuild in peril | Ben FisherRead moreIt always seemed deeply naive to snort and snark and deconstruct the questions he was being asked. A note to Ange. Everyone else also knows press conferences are mundane. Often those asking the questions are just being polite, giving you some soft-ball as opposed to, say, asking you why your record is so appalling.Forest will surely survive from here. Marinakis will hire a Dyche or similar. The players are good enough, the legacy of the last manager but one still strong.As for Ange, he has been fun, hard-working and gracious to opponents in defeat or victory, at least in so far as it is possible to remember that far back.In the end it was the Premier League itself that did a number on Postecoglou, both in its relentlessness and the excellence of those he was matched against. This thing will stretch you thin, will contort you into impossible shapes. If, by the end, even his struggles had become just meat in the grinder, another strand of public entertainment, this is in its own way testament to the strength, purity, and basic viciousness of the product.Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouNottingham ForestAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

And there’s a reason why he’s the greatest player on the planet.”The Dodgers will have a chance to become baseball’s first repeatWorld Serieschampions in a quarter-century after this mind-blowing night for the three-time MVP Ohtani, who emphatically ended a quiet postseason by his lofty standards. Ohtani was named the NLCS MVP essentially on the strength of this one unforgettable game.“This time around it was my turn to be able to perform,” Ohtani said through his interpreter.After striking out three in the top of the first inning of Game 4, Ohtani hit the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in major league history off Brewers starter José Quintana.Ohtani followed with a 469-foot blast in the fourth, clearing a pavilion roof in right-center.Ohtani added a third solo shot in the seventh, becoming the 12th player in major league history to hit three homers in a postseason game. His three homers traveled a combined 1,342 feet.Ohtani (2-0) also thoroughly dominated the Brewers in his second career postseason mound start, allowing two hits in his first double-digit strikeout game in a Dodgers uniform.“Sometimes you’ve got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he’s not just made of steel,” said Freddie Freeman, last season’s World Series MVP. “Absolutely incredible. Biggest stage, and he goes out and does something like that. It’ll probably be remembered as theShohei Ohtanigame.”After the Brewers’ first two batters reached in the seventh, he left the mound to a stadium-shaking ovation – and after Alex Vesia escaped the jam, Ohtani celebrated by hitting his third homer in the bottom half.The powerhouse Dodgers are the first team to win back-to-back pennants since Philadelphia in 2009. Los Angeles is back in the World Series for the fifth time in nine seasons, and it will attempt to become baseball’s first repeat champs since the New York Yankees won three straight World Series from 1998 to 2000.“That was special,” Freeman said. “We’ve just been playing really good baseball for a while now, and the inevitable kind of happened today – Shohei. Oh my God. I’m still speechless.”Following a 9-1 rampage through the NL playoffs, the Dodgers are headed to the World Series for the 23rd time in franchise history, including 14 pennants since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Only the Yankees, last year’s opponent, have made more appearances in the Fall Classic (41).Los Angeles will have a week off before the World Series begins next Friday, either in Toronto or at Dodger Stadium against Seattle. The Marinersbeat the Blue Jays 6-2 earlier Fridayto take a 3-2 lead in the ALCS, which continues Sunday at Rogers Centre.The Dodgers had never swept an NLCS in 16 previous appearances, but they became only the fifth team to sweep this series while thoroughly dominating a Milwaukee club that led the major leagues with 97 wins during the season. Los Angeles are the first team to sweep a best-of-seven postseason series since 2022, and the first to sweep an NLCS since Washington in 2019.“I’ll tell you, before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” Roberts shouted to the crowd during the on-field celebration. “Let’s get four more wins and really ruin baseball!”The NL Central champion Brewers were eliminated by the Dodgers for the third time during their current stretch of seven playoff appearances in eight years. Even after setting a franchise record for wins this season, Milwaukee are still waiting for their first World Series appearance since 1982.“We were part of tonight an iconic, maybe the best individual performance ever in a postseason game,” Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said. “I don’t think anybody can argue with that. A guy punches out 10 and hits three homers.”The Brewers had never been swept in a playoff series longer than a best-of-three, but their bats fell silent in the NLCS against the Dodgers’ brilliant starting rotation. Los Angeles’ four starters combined to pitch 28 and two-third innings with two earned runs allowed and 35 strikeouts.The Dodgers added two more runs in the first after Ohtani’s tone-setting homer, with Mookie Betts and Will Smith both singling and scoring.Jackson Chourio doubled leading off the fourth for Milwaukee’s first hit, but Ohtani stranded him with a groundout and two strikeouts.Struggling Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen allowed two more baserunners in the eighth, and Caleb Durbin scored when Brice Turang beat out his potential double-play grounder before Anthony Banda ended the inning.Roki Sasaki pitched the ninth in the latest successful relief outing for the Dodgers’ unlikely closer.Explore more on these topicsMLBShohei OhtaniBaseballLos Angeles DodgersMilwaukee BrewersWorld SeriesUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It was the fourth homer of the playoffs for Raleigh after he hit a major-league-leading 60 during the regular season.Little then walked Jorge Polanco and Josh Naylor before being pulled for Seranthony Dominguez, who hit Randy Arozarena with a pitch to load the bases with no outs.Suárez, who opened the scoring with a solo shot in the second, went deep with an opposite-field blast to right, shaking the foundation at T-Mobile Park.Gabe Speier (1-0) pitched a scoreless inning of relief for the victory, and Seattle closer Andres Munoz worked a 1-2-3 ninth in a non-save situation.Blue Jays leadoff man and designated hitter George Springer, who drove home the tying run with a fifth-inning double, had to leave the game after being hit by a pitch on the right knee in the seventh. There was no immediate word on his status for the rest of the series.Toronto took the lead in the sixth off Bryan Woo, who was making the first relief appearance of his career other than this summer’s All-Star Game in Atlanta.Woo, who hadn’t pitched since 19 September because of a strained pectoral muscle that kept him off the AL Division Series roster, was greeted by Alejandro Kirk’s double to right-center. An out later, Ernie Clement, who had grounded into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded in the fourth, lined a single to right, giving Toronto a 2-1 lead.Blue Jays starter Kevin Gausman went five and two-thirds innings and gave up one run on three hits.

One more day up and down the pitiless slide. One more day of blistered hands gripping unforgiving oars.But after more than 8,000 nautical miles (15,000km) at sea – an epic five-and-a-half-month journey across the Pacific that included close encounters with whales, failing beacons and chocolate shortages – the sea had one more challenge.A gusting 20-knot wind off Cairns kept pushing Jess Rowe and Miriam Payne’s tiny rowboat, the Velocity, from the terra firma that was now achingly close.Rowe and Payne: finish line in sight for aptly named British duo rowing nonstop from Peru to AustraliaRead moreFriends and family waited ashore as a planned midday arrival became 2pm, then 4pm, then early evening. Finally, at 6.42pm, they came alongside at Cairns Yacht Club.“Those final few hours were brutal,” Rowe said, finally standing on land.“The wind was pushing us off the channel, and we honestly thought we weren’t going to make it. We ended up outside the channel and thought we might have to swim to shore. To finally be here, after talking about it for so long, just feels incredible.“We still can’t quite believe it’s real. After so many days at sea, to finally see land, and the welcome we’ve had here in Cairns, is beyond words.”MapThe British pair – Rowe is 28 and Payne 25 – pushed off from Lima, Peru, on 5 May (an initial attempt in April was derailed by a rudder failure).Over 165 days at sea, they averaged 50 nautical miles a day, rowing in tandem during the day, one rowing alone at night while her crewmate slept a bare handful of hours in a cramped cabin.Kept alive with 400kg of mostly freeze-dried food, a water desalinator and an onboard growing unit for micro-greens, the pair have relied on a less-than-reliable solar system for a fraction of the power they’ve needed. For much of their journey across the vast Pacific, they’ve had no navigation equipment or beacon, turning them into a “ghost ship”, almost invisible to other vessels.The pair have borne 9-metre (30ft) waves, navigated shipping lanes and endured raging storms that, at times, silenced all of their electronics.View image in fullscreenJess Rowe and Miriam Payne as the row Velocity towards the Great Barrier Reef.Photograph: Brian Cassey/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd they’ve kept rowing, one stroke after another, across blazing hot days, under star-filled night skies. They have set a new record as the first all-female pair to row across the South Pacific Ocean, non-stop and unsupported.And they have raised more than £86,000 (A$179,000) for the Outward Bound Trust.The pair did their best to keep in contact with the world outside their tiny vessel. On “day 140-something”, they reported a “chocolate emergency” – down to their last two bars with still more than 1,600km (1,000 miles) to go – but allowed themselves the indulgence of breaking one open to celebrate England’s Red Roses winning the Rugby World Cup.1:02British duo approach Australia after rowing nearly 8,300 nautical miles from Peru – videoPayne, from a landlocked part of Yorkshire, had not been at sea until she rowed the Atlantic solo in 2022 in a record time. She now has a second ocean conquered. But there were moments, she conceded, when they feared they wouldn’t make it. As early as day six, a way across the world’s largest ocean felt impossible.“Our power was dropping, the water-maker pipes burst, but after nine repairs, we managed a bypass and just limped along with little power for the rest of the crossing. Every time something went wrong, we just looked at each other and went, ‘of course it has!’ But we kept going.”“It was really great to have Jess as a teammate. What was great was that we worked hard together, we problem-solved together, and we were always working towards the same goals,” she said.Rowe is from Hampshire. Before her Pacific triumph, she rowed the Atlantic, hiked England’s South West Coast Path, climbed Mount Kenya and cycled across Spain. There might still be more.“We had such a good time together, and we’re already excited to plan new adventures together as well. I wouldn’t have done it with anybody else.”Explore more on these topicsRowingQueenslandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have reunited at Turf Moor, where the club and French duo are living out their dream. It was their goals that downed Leeds and offered further proof the Clarets have a chance of staying up.Burnley have now defeated the two teams that came up with them from the Championship at home and have collected all of their seven points here. They showed they have improved since promotion, epitomised by a goal-of-the-season contender from Tchaouna to add to his old mate’s opener.Nordi Mukiele on target as Sunderland sink Wolves to continue strong startRead moreThe two joined forces more than a decade ago, before reaching their teenage years, in north-west France, moving up the ranks to the first team before separating to add Lazio and Chelsea to their collective CVs without settling. This was the first time they were on the winning side together since beating Mérignac in May 2022, when Désiré Doué and Mathys Tel were leading the line.Burnley will not be concerned about the route they took to Lancashire, but that they managed to attract young talents, offering them a platform to grow in the Premier League. Ugochukwu never looked like being a regular at Stamford Bridge and suffered through a loan spell in a dreadful Southampton team, but he is coming of age alongside Tchaouna.“Relationships and bonds that people bring together, and then you’re reconnected later on, for sure it helps,” Scott Parker said of the pair. “These players have got huge pedigree and quality. We wouldn’t have signed them if we didn’t see that.“Lesley’s coming off the back of two goals in two games, Loum will have finished the day on a high. His goal is right up there with maybe a goal in a season, so it was perfect.”View image in fullscreenBurnley’s Lesley Ugochukwu rises high to score the first goal of the game against Leeds.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAThe likelihood of this match being a classic was nonexistent in the opening stages as neither team produced any notable quality in possession. Burnley’s most promising outlet was Ugochukwu in central midfield. He was the victim of two fouls as he caused problems and Leeds struggled with his athleticism and driving runs.It would have been sensible to pay him close attention, but the Leeds defence forgot he existed. Kyle Walker was given plenty of space on the right to whip in the perfect cross and Ugochukwu was able to head home from six yards.Burnley’s survival hopes will rest finding consistent scorers. Last season, Josh Brownhill topped the charts with 18 goals from midfield and those will need replacing, especially as they do not possess a prolific striker. Ugochukwu netted once at Southampton, but this was his second in two games, showing he is finding the right positions.Liverpool are the only away team to win here in the league in the past 17 months. Leeds hit a post in the first half, but lacked creativity in midfield, making life comfortable for Burnley. They had 19 shots but only four on target, a sign of their failings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once you miss so many clear chances, the expected goals, shots on target, blocks, we were so clearly the better side.”Ceding possession and territory is a dangerous game, but Burnley are the masters. Leeds were having all the ball and should have tested Martin Dubravka when Sean Longstaff chipped a cross to an unmarked Jack Harrison, but he volleyed into the ground and wide from inside the area.Burnley did not have the ambition to attack and the second came as a surprise to everyone. Walker burst down the right to wake up the crowd and the claret-clad forwards, but no one could keep up with the right-back, who had to play it backwards. Tchaouna, who had been on the pitch 10 minutes, has shown glimpses of his ability since joining from Lazio this summer, but few expected him to pick out the top corner from 30 yards, making the moment and roar more spectacular.At this point no one was concerned about whether Burnley would hold on. Parker said: “I had a feeling with us that we’d protect our goal like our life depended on it. That’s a mentality and we did that extremely well.”Before the game, the Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin refused to join other players in taking the knee on the Premier League’s No Room For Racism weekend.

Even if that legend has lingered too long, even if he has stayed beyond the scope of his powers, coming next is an almost impossible job. David Moyes could not follow Sir Alex Ferguson. Unai Emery could not follow Arsène Wenger. Brian Clough could not follow Don Revie.When there has been a successful transition it has tended to come from within. George Allison continued Herbert Chapman’s work at Arsenal. Dave Mackay took the Derby Clough had built to another league title.Mohamed Salah in need of centre stage return for Anfield’s grand show | Andy HunterRead moreBut there are no guarantees, as Wilf McGuinness discovered trying to follow Matt Busby at Manchester United.Liverpooldid it best, the Boot Room tradition stretching all the way from Bill Shankly through Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan to Kenny Dalglish.Modern football makes such continuity extremely difficult and, unless Liverpool had decided Pep Lijnders was the man – and given his stint at Red Bull Salzburg, no one is suggesting he was – there was no obvious internal candidate to step in when Jürgen Klopp departed.How, then, could a measure of continuity be achieved? By barely changing the squad at all. The only arrival in the summer of 2024 was Federico Chiesa, who ended up playing only 108 minutes of Premier League football. (The world was very different in 1974, with transfers less frequent and no window closing at the end of August but it’s notable that as Paisley replaced Shankly, Larry Lloyd was sold and Ray Kennedy signed in the summer, with Phil Neal and Terry McDermott arriving in the autumn; it wasn’t the half-dozen signings of modern windows but that represents significant new blood).View image in fullscreenTerry McDermott (left) and Ray Kennedy (also holding the Football League trophy) were bought in the months after Bob Paisley succeeded Bill Shankly at Liverpool in 1974, along with Phil Neal (behind the moustached Tommy Smith).Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockIt would be untrue – and unfair – to say thatArne Slotchanged nothing last year. There was a greater sense of control. They may have won only six games by three or more goals, but that does not mean they were fortunate; rather that is evidence of the way they played within themselves.Eight matches were won 2-0 and in most of those Liverpool in effect shut the game down having achieved a two-goal advantage. That served not only to take the risk out of the game but also to preserve energy, which may be a reason Liverpool were so relatively unafflicted by injuries.But even allowing for the way he got the best out of Ryan Gravenberch and coaxed another great season from Mohamed Salah, this was a minor evolution. Where Slot really impressed was in the way his half-time tweaks regularly improved performance, something that began on theopening weekend at Ipswichand carried on throughout the season. Slot may have been at the wheel, but it was still essentially a Klopp car he was driving.Parts, eventually, need replacing. Rivals are upgrading constantly. Development is essential; to stand still, as Peter Reid memorably put it, is to move backwards. There had to be change, and it came this summer. It’s not clear Liverpool specifically planned it this way, but the protocol is sensible. Let the new manager settle, assess his capacities, allow him to build political capital before he starts affecting major change. Debate now focuses on the effectiveness of the revolution rather than on the new manager.Which is how Liverpool are in the position they are, undergoing major transition in Slot’s second season. In part the scale of that has been conditioned by the death of Diogo Jota, whose loss, inevitably, continues to affect players. But significant changes would have been necessary anyway. There was some scepticism last season when Jamie Carragher suggested Liverpool needed half a dozen new players, but they did bring in six as well as the 18-year-old central defender Giovanni Leoni, who would probably have been involved had he not torn an anterior cruciate ligament.Modern football being what it is, there has been scepticism about the scale of the challenge facing Liverpool this season: is this really a transitional season? To which the only answer is, yes, clearly. Arsenal, it’s true, have added seven senior players but, while Viktor Gyökeres answered a longstanding need for a centre-forward and Eberechi Eze is an obvious upgrade on the left, the function of most of the arrivals has been to strength the squad.Arsenal’s style remains essentially the same as it was last season. Players have been bought to fit into a pre-existing system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The template is no longer 4-3-3, even if the 4-2-3-1 of the opening weeks of the season has been, perhaps temporarily, abandoned. The obvious conundrum is Florian Wirtz, who has produced stats so contradictory that it’s possible to make almost any argument about his start to life in the Premier League.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Arne Slot (right) and Mohamed Salah, who is struggling under his manager’s tactical tinkering.Photograph: Murad Sezer/ReutersAlthough he is yet to register either a goal or an assist, he stands alongside Jack Grealish at the top of the list of chances created. He has been neither brilliant nor terrible, and is perhaps still adjusting to the intensity of the Premier League. But more significantly, although he has spent some time on the left this season, it seems almost certain Wirtz was bought to play through the middle, behind a central striker.It’s hard to understand how that could work with the wide forwards Liverpool have at present, at least without a much more defensive back six, and the development of the sort of “broken team” that was common in Serie A in the 90s, which would seem to go against the entire recent evolution of the sport toward universality.That perhaps glances ahead to a future withoutMohamed Salah– and it’s telling Liverpool have been linked with the far more dynamic Antoine Semenyo – but may also indicate further change to come. With Feyenoord, Slot opted to play a 4-2-3-1, but his wide forwards – players such as Yankuba Minteh, Igor Paixão and Luka Ivanusec – were far more dynamic than Salah currently is, so the formation could appear more of a 4-4-1-1.A change like that will take time and probably another window or two of significant activity. It may be necessary but it is a gamble; it is at least, though, one that Slot is making as a Premier League champion rather than a new arrival.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolInside footballArne SlotMohamed SalahFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

A meeting with Birmingham’s safety advisory group (SAG) has been set up for next week.Home Office offers extra resources in effort to undo Maccabi Tel Aviv fans banRead moreThe BBCreportedthat Villa had informed stewards they had permission to skip their duties on the day of the fixture, Thursday 6 November, before the decision to ban fans was made by police.In an email apparently sent on 3 October, stewards were told that “regarding the upcoming fixture against Maccabi Tel Aviv … we appreciate that some of you may have concerns about attending work”, the broadcaster reported.Those who were meant to work on the day were told they would “be able to submit a one-off absence request”, and this “will allow you to register your absence for this specific fixture”.Aston Villa had also made clear that “this type of absence will not affect your contractual minimum attendance of 80%”.This email was reportedly sent after a number of stewards allegedly raised concerns over safety on the day, and it is unclear how many stewards will not work on the day of the fixture. A request to not work would have to be submitted four days prior to the match’s scheduled date.West Midlands police had said on Thursday they had classified Villa’s home fixture against Maccabi as “high risk” based on intelligence. The police force also highlightedviolence that occurred during a 2024 Uefa Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi in Amsterdam, where more than 60 people were arrested over the violence that was called a “toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger” by authorities.Four local people were given short jail terms for the violence against Maccabi fans. A report by Dutch police into the disorder during the 2024 Amsterdam match found Maccabi fans had torn a Palestinian flag down from a local building and burned it, shouted: “Fuck you, Palestine”, andvandalised a taxi. Maccabi fans were also taped chanting “Olé, olé. Let the IDF win, fuck the Arabs.”The ban imposed by West Midlands police came after pressure from the local independent MP, Ayoub Khan. Khan told BBC Two’s Newsnight on Thursday: “We cannot conflate [this issue with] antisemitism when we look at what some of these fans did in Amsterdam in 2024 … We’re talking about violent fans and I think the prime minister should stay out of operational matters.”The Campaign Against Antisemitismsaidon Friday it was notifying Birmingham city council and West Midlands police of its intention to bring a judicial review against the ban of Maccabi fans, which it said was “pernicious” and had “angered the whole country”.Keir Starmer called the police force’s decision “wrong”, saying “we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets”. Uefa, the governing body of European football, has urged local authorities in Birmingham to allow Maccabi fans to travel to the match.In a statement on their website, Aston Villasaid: “The club are in continuous dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities throughout this ongoing process, with the safety of supporters attending the match and the safety of local residents at the forefront of any decision.”Aston Villa have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaWest MidlandsMaccabi Tel AvivPoliceBirminghamEuropa LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

All jokes aside, really pleased, but we can not rely on just him, we need other players. Wingers, attacking midfielders. They have to make a step up and score. The chances were clear and they have to score. At this level they have to demand themselves. Chances from Savinho and Jérémy [Doku] and Tijjani [Reijnders]. They have to do it, otherwise we can’t do what we want to do.”Leandro Trossard sinks Fulham to keep Arsenal riding high at top of tableRead moreWithout the injured Rodri and the departed Kevin De Bruyne, this Guardiola iteration does not purr along like his finest ones have. Jack Grealish was not on the sward forEvertonbecause of the parent-club rule and City’s manager may ponder the wisdom of allowing the his nous and class to be loaned away.So this was an afternoon’s work when the verdict was defined as “job done”, but City’s continuing lack of total control was visible at times.Guardiola could be content when his men repelled Everton pressure – at first. Theirs is a game of flair. Nico O’Reilly stepped up from left-back and slid a 20-yard attempt inches past Jordan Pickford’s left post, before a Phil Foden defence-splitter aimed for Doku marginally missed.City’s softness was spied. Nathan Aké’s pass out from defence went straight to Iliman Ndiaye, who cruised forward on Everton’s right and squared; Beto was close to turning the ball past a stranded Gianluigi Donnarumma.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Beto looks on with Manchester City’s Gianluigi Donnarumma after a missed chance.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThis passage preceded stodgier fare, when the players got bogged down in the middle third or, when breaking into the attack zone, overran the ball, as the usually silky Foden did.City’s answer was to go route one. This time Foden did what was needed and threaded a corner in from the right. Jake O’Brien rose and inadvertently powered a header that beat Pickford, but not his bar.With his clever feet and shoulder-drop Ndiaye has shades of Grealish, as seen when he cut in and shot, Donnarumma tipping over. In a quasi-ping-pong phase, City broke via Foden, who touched to the thus-far quiet Haaland: he stamped forward and passed left to Reijnders, whose tap in the same direction located Doku, but Pickford repelled the Belgian’s effort.Guardiola’s discontent was seen in him imploring Aké to zip the ball left rather than turn back towards goal: when his team did as their manager asked, they prospered. Foden found O’Reilly, who advanced, glanced up and crossed. Haaland’s muscular leap was followed by an emphatic header home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nearly, because James Garner was soon in City’s area and his shot struck a hand of the newly introduced Bernardo Silva. The visitors wanted a penalty, but Tony Harrington was unmoved.This scare for City was followed by joy. Yet again the left provided the incisive zone as Foden dropped the ball to Savinho, switched to the flank from the right and when the Brazilian cut the ball to Haaland, his low finish beat Pickford.In added time, the lethal marksman had two gilded chances to complete a hat-trick, but to much surprise fiddled and failed: almost a collector’s item. David Moyes had a word with Haaland at the end. “I was just telling him I wished he had been somewhere else,” Everton’s manager said, as a joke.Before the game, it appeared Beto did not take the knee unlike the rest of the players, but he refused to discuss this after the match.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityEvertonErling Haalandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Danny Welbeck’s two goals were moments of rare composure amid a slugfest of a contest. They denied the Toon Army’s latest folk hero. Nick Woltemade’s backheel flick, a speciality, had levelled the scoring.Welbeck’s first was a moment of equal delicacy, his second saw him thrash – first time – a loose ball home; his third winner against Newcastle in the last 12 months. Brighton snatched a third win of thePremier Leagueseason, each over opponents in this season’s Champions League, Newcastle following Chelsea and Manchester City. Newcastle, meanwhile, are yet to win away from St James’ Park.Jean-Philippe Mateta’s hat-trick rescues Crystal Palace in thrilling draw with BournemouthRead more“If the team plays well, then the individuals will shine,” said Fabian Hürzeler of Welbeck. “He is always there for his teammates and he’s a great goalscorer.” A flurry of Brighton chances should have killed off the contest far earlier but youthful potential will not always deliver. Step forward the striker who is 35 next month. “We saw personality, we showed character, we showed big resilience” was the Brighton manager’s overall verdict.For Newcastle, Woltemade, beginning to redefine the football cliche of decent touch for a big man – his touches are often gossamer – has provided cheer. Those around him are missing the mark. “Nick has done really well, and we’re delighted for him, but we need more from the rest of the team,” said Eddie Howe.“I really like to play here,” said Woltemade, the towering toast of the Toon. “I get balls; the players are looking for me. The gaffer trusts me.”A midfield of Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Bruno Guimarães represented a significant test for the callow Brighton duo of Carlos Baleba, 21, and Yasin Ayari, 22. The Newcastle trio have claims on being the best unit in English football, particularly when Joelinton’s muscle is in full effect and Tonali dictates play.Not that Guimarães is the lukewarm water between fire and ice; the captain finds scoring positions and should have done better with an early chance. He led his team’s thwarted revival, blazing over after the equaliser, but in the first half the youthful duo assumed near-total control. “We made the decision to go with the lads who had done the travelling,” said Howe, both Brazilians having flown back from far east friendlies. “They are brilliant players but they didn’t function well today.”Yankuba Minteh, facing the club who sold him without playing a Premier League match, was dangerous throughout, frequently surging at Dan Burn, also facing former employers. “It’s always good for us to get him in one-on-one situations,” said Hürzeler of his right-wing flyer.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade (centre) makes it four goals in four consecutive games for Newcastle with a backheel flicked strike.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAWoltemade took to his personal duel with Albion perennial Lewis Dunk. That included adeptly defending his own box at corners. He also exhibited an understanding with Anthony Gordon, less so Anthony Elanga, having a troubled start to life on Tyneside. “Anthony is going to be a great player for this football club, I am sure of that,” said Howe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I feel strong and fit so I won’t be stopping soon.”Newcastle’s listlessness brought half-time changes. “I wasn’t happy,” said Howe. Joelinton was replaced by Lewis Miley, Elanga by Jacob Murphy. Newcastle continued to struggle with Brighton’s speedy transitions. Minteh slipped past Burn, Ayari’s bending shot curled wide, Pope next asked to make a sprawling save from Maxim De Cuyper before Ayari hurried another chance.An inability to kill off opponents is a Brighton trademark, and when Murphy clanked wide, familiar anxieties grew. Howe took off Tonali and Gordon, Hürzeler concurrently took off Baleba, introducing James Milner in the hope of restoring control.Guimarães, last man standing of Newcastle’s midfield triumvirate, engineered the momentum that brought Woltemade’s goal. It would take Welbeck, a Burn tackle on Mats Wieffer falling loose, to coax Brighton to a win that might have been theirs many times over.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Andoni Iraola’s impressive side had led through two goals from the teenager Eli Junior Kroupi before being pegged back by Jean-Philippe Mateta and thought they had won it when the substitute Ryan Christie scored with two minutes of normal time remaining.Mateta, who scored on his first start for France in midweek, had other ideas as he converted an injury-time penalty to complete his hat-trick, although he missed a golden opportunity to win it at the death.Brighton’s Danny Welbeck sees off Newcastle despite Woltemade magicRead moreDefeat would still have been harsh onBournemouthand Iraola embraced his opposite number, Oliver Glasner, at the final whistle in recognition of what must rank as one of the games of the season even at this early stage. Much of the attention beforehand had focused on the men in the dugouts, with both out of contract next summer and coveted by clubs with much bigger budgets.The Bournemouth owner, Bill Foley, is due to travel to the UK this month to continue discussions with the Spaniard that will surely be even more of a priority given their incredible start to the campaign.“If we get good results, we do a good season, then we will talk to the club and we will decide what to do next season,” said Iraola, who felt aggrieved that the video assistant referee did not intervene when the late penalty was given against Bafodé Diakité, having been overruled by the referee earlier in the match. “I am upset and I am angry because of their goal in the 96th-minute, I cannot accept it. Not to win it because someone called a penalty and I think the VAR was influenced by the previous decision. That is the only explanation I can find.”Glasner, who said this week he has opened talks over a new contract but offered no assurances he will commit his future to Palace, did not agree. But this stirring comeback again illustrated the team spirit their Austrian has fostered. “We have created this in the team and in the stands, that’s why we were able to come back. It shows the character of this group,” he said.View image in fullscreenEli Junior Kroupi puts Bournemouth 2-0 up against Crystal Palace.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesThe speed with which Bournemouth’s front four pressed from the first whistle unsettled their opponents and it was from an early corner that Kroupi, starting his second league game since arriving from Bournemouth’s sister club Lorient in the summer, due to a calf injury to Evanilson, was able to head home at the back post. “We’re top of the league,” sang the travelling supporters, probably in slight disbelief.Antoine Semenyo was a constant menace as he forced Dean Henderson into a full-stretch save. An immaculate piece of control in his own half was the spark for Bournemouth’s second, with Chris Richards left for dead as he sped down the left flank and delivered a low cross. Marc Guéhi, who Glasner confirmed this week will leave on a free transfer next summer, could only divert it straight to Kroupi and Henderson was unable to prevent his volley from going over the line. It needed a good save from Djordje Petrovic to deny Mateta just before the break but there was no argument that Bournemouth deserved their 2-0 lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ismaïla Sarr was clean through when he was brought down by Marcos Senesi, although the referee, Jarred Gillett, decided that only warranted a yellow card as he felt the Senegal forward was heading away from goal. After much deliberation from the video assistant referee, the original decision was not reviewed. But Palace’s fortunes suddenly changed when the Mateta’s goal from Daniel Muñoz’s cross was initially ruled out for offside before that decision was quickly overturned. Within five minutes, Mateta had his second when he somehow turned the ball in from a tight angle after Petrovic had saved from Muñoz.Senesi escaped again when he appeared to shove Sarr over when he was bearing down on goal. Eddie Nketiah had the ball into the net and this time it was correctly disallowed for offside, then Christie rammed home from close range after a quick break, seeming to have won it for Bournemouth. But Mateta ensured that honours ended even when, to Iraola’s disgust, Diakité was ruled to have fouled Guéhi in stoppage time and the striker kept his cool from the spot.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

So he will be ready.”United are at Liverpool on Sunday, havingwon there in the Premier League oncein the past decade: a 1-0 win in 2016 via a Wayne Rooney goal.

We never know what is going to happen. We showed last year there, we can handle it. The way we start the game is more important than the environment. To do a really good warm-up. To have a feeling. To understand that it’s going to be tough in the first moments. I know they are ready.”Amorim dismissed United’s poor recent record at Anfield by saying many in his side may not be aware of it. “Football players nowadays don’t watch many games, unfortunately,” he said. “I have so many things to use [as inspiration] with our players. Like winning back-to-back games [in the league for the first time]. We have so much to win if we perform and win the next game. I don’t need to use those games in the past.”Amorim was asked about reports linking Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee with possible moves in January.

They had slipped to second afterMiddlesbrough’s victory over Ipswichon Friday night, but goals from Victor Torp and Brandon Thomas-Asante took them back to the summit. Liam Kitching should have made it three near the end but he headed over from inside the six-yard box.Frank Lampard, the Coventry manager, thought the game was a “good test for all of us”, saying: “All credit to Blackburn in the first half. They came here with an aggressive organisation about them and were happy to be man-for-man pretty much all over the pitch.“They made it difficult for us to get our usual kind of clean build and to try to get control and territory, so I credit them. We made a bit of a tactical tweak at half-time to help the players. It’s important also for our players to not expect that every game we’ll have all the possession and win by three, four or five because it doesn’t happen in football.”Sorba Thomas made the difference asStokebeatWrexham1-0 to end a run of four league games without a victory and move up to third.

A senior official informed Postecoglou of his sacking.Forest have been assessing potential successors to Postecoglou since their humiliating Europa Leaguedefeat at home to Midtjyllandbefore the international break, during which the supporters turned on the Australian manager.View image in fullscreenThe Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, leaves his seat during the defeat by Chelsea.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockPostecoglou’s departure after eight games means his 39-day spell in charge is the shortest in Premier League history among permanent managers, one day fewer than Les Reed managed at Charlton Athletic. Sam Allardyce had 31 days at Leeds in 2023, but was on a short-term interim deal.The 60-year-old said his goodbyes to players in the Forest dressing room before leaving the City Ground on Saturday, posing for photographs with supporters upon his departure. Marinakis hoped his appointment could achieve his ambition of winning major silverware at Forest.Mancini and Dyche are both out of work, while Marinakis is a longstanding admirer of Marco Silva, the Fulham manager whom he previously appointed at Olympiakos, the other major player in his stable of clubs. Silva’s Fulham contract, which expires at the end of the season, is thought to contain a buyout clause of about £8m.Forest are willing to pay compensation for a manager but are mindful of profitability and sustainability regulations after sacking a second manager in two months, plus a summer spend of about £200m on 13 new players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The new multi-club ownership body, with San Francisco’s Bay FC the first club in its portfolio, has previous in recruiting from the Football Association.The appointment this year of Kay Cossington, the influential former FA technical director,as the chief executivewas a signal of intent from Bay Collective. Cossington knows women’s football inside out and now she has assembled a leadership team with a deep understanding of women’s football history and laden with experience.WSL considers borrowing tens of millions to accelerate growth plansRead moreVan Ginhoven is the third core member of Wiegman’s setup to exit this year, with Cossington departing before Euro 2025 and the assistant manager, Arjan Veurink, leaving to become head coach of the Netherlands, but her decision came sooner.Stepping away has been a shock to the system, but “I’d taken my decision to leave the FA quite a long time ago”, Van Ginhoven says. “I had a contract for four years, just as Arjan and Sarina did. When they renewed, I had already said I didn’t know whether I would. I was already used to the whole idea that post-Euros I wouldn’t be part of England any more.”The Euros was an emotional tournament as a result. “I remember very clearly, vividly, having a conversation with Sarina where I basically told her about my decision and then we said: ‘There’s just one dream, how amazing would it be that we win the Euros?’ In life, it’s not like dreams come true every day but, absolutely incredibly,this one did.”Sitting in an orange T-shirt, Van Ginhoven has divided loyalties after her time in England, where she was part of winning back-to-back European titles and was a part of Wiegman’s staff for the Netherlands’ triumph at Euro 2017.“England will forever have a special place in my heart. So, it’s going to be tough, particularly now knowing that the players will be arriving for the international camp soon,” she says. “When England plays the Netherlands, who do I support? I’m wearing orange at the moment, but tomorrow it’s white.”Bay FC was not part of the equation when the organisational wizard was deciding it was time to move on, but the pieces fell into place at the right time. Cossington started to bring people in and their shared values were key.You can change direction and move quickly in a speedboat. In a small team like this, that’s easily done“Almost from the very first moment we met we had that click moment,” says Van Ginhoven. “You’re immediately on the same level. We have spoken at length about different things around how you grow the game and what we think is the right way.”Cossington and Van Ginhoven are not the only figures to uproot themselves from high-profile jobs in the European game for a blank sheet of paper in the United States. Atlético Madrid’s women’s technical director, Patricia González, has been unveiled as Bay Collective’s new global sporting director.“I was very attracted to that strong belief of the power of the women’s game,” González says. “I have known Kay Cossington for a long time; when I used to work at Fifa, she was the technical director of England, and it’s easy to make these decisions when you know you are going to be surrounded by people who really inspire you.”The depth of knowledge in their team sets them apart, says Van Ginhoven, with Bay Collective one of several new multi-club initiatives to launch in recent years. “That’s one of our unique selling points. It’s OK that people do things in different ways, but we definitely believe in having that football knowledge on board,” she says. “All three of us have been on a journey in women’s football, probably for the best part of our lives.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Doing that, with everyone on the same page, with no need to make the case for why you would take certain actions, is hugely liberating.“I compare it with going from a tanker to a speedboat,” says Van Ginhoven. “You’re basically driving through waters that there are no roadmaps for – that’s a Dutch saying, I don’t know if it translates – and you just need to rely on your own knowledge and expertise to make the right decision. You can change direction and move quickly in a speedboat.

For me, what we do is about influencing the game on a much broader level and that white paper allows you to do whatever you want, within the rules of the game. That’s the beauty of what we are building together.”The ambition is high, those in leading roles are saying the things players and fans want to hear and it will be interesting to follow the development of Bay Collective, Bay FC and any clubs added to the portfolio.For a flavour of what is to come, what are the key aspects of a high-performance environment? “It all starts and ends with the football and people,” says Van Ginhoven. “You can have the greatest hotel, the greatest training facility but, ultimately, it’s the people that make the difference because otherwise they are just empty shells. Having great people, good leadership and being super clear on roles and responsibilities are the main three things to create a really good high-performance culture.”González adds: “It’s very important to put the players at the centre and that every decision taken is for the good of the players and their development. A high-performance environment also needs a high level of trust. When you do that, people feel that they are in a safe environment to make decisions, to speak up, to share their opinions, and that is hugely impactful and is when special things happen.”Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballEngland women's football teamSarina WiegmanUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Glass cabinets display prototypes of weird and wonderful creations, from tiny desktop robots to a surrealist sculpture created by an AI model prompted to design a tea set made from body parts. In the lobby, an AI waste-sorting assistant named Oscar can tell you where to put your used coffee cup. Five floors up, research scientist Nataliya Kosmyna has been working on wearable brain-computer interfaces she hopes will one day enable people who cannot speak, due to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, to communicate using their minds.Kosmyna spends a lot of her time reading and analysing people’s brain states. Another project she is working on is a wearable device – one prototype looks like a pair of glasses – that can tell when someone is getting confused or losing focus. Around two years ago, she began receiving out-of-the blue emails from strangers who reported that they had started using large language models such as ChatGPT and felt their brain had changed as a result. Their memories didn’t seem as good – was that even possible, they asked her? Kosmyna herself had been struck by how quickly people had already begun to rely on generative AI. She noticed colleagues using ChatGPT at work, and the applications she received from researchers hoping to join her team started to look different. Their emails were longer and more formal and, sometimes, when she interviewed candidates on Zoom, she noticed they kept pausing before responding and looking off to the side – were they getting AI to help them, she wondered, shocked. And if they were using AI, how much did they even understand of the answers they were giving?With some MIT colleagues, Kosmyna set up an experiment that used an electroencephalogram to monitor people’s brain activity while they wrote essays, either with no digital assistance, or with the help of an internet search engine, or ChatGPT. She found that the more external help participants had, the lower their level of brain connectivity, so those who used ChatGPT to write showed significantly less activity in the brain networks associated with cognitive processing, attention and creativity.In other words, whatever the people using ChatGPT felt was going on inside their brains, the scans showed there wasn’t much happening up there.The study’s participants, who were all enrolled at MIT or nearby universities, were asked, right after they had handed in their work, if they could recall what they had written. “Barely anyone in the ChatGPT group could give a quote,” Kosmyna says. “That was concerning, because you just wrote it and you do not remember anything.”Kosmyna is 35, trendily dressed in a blue shirt dress and a big, multicoloured necklace, and she speaks faster than most people can think. As she observes, writing an essay requires skills that are important in our wider lives: the ability to synthesise information, consider competing perspectives and construct an argument. You use these skills in everyday conversations. “How are you going to deal with that? Are you going to be, like, ‘Err … can I just check my phone?’” she says.The experiment was small (54 participants) and has not yet been peer reviewed. In June, however, Kosmyna posted it online, thinking other researchers might find it interesting, and then she went about her day, unaware that she had just created an international media frenzy.Alongside the journalist requests, she received more than 4,000 emails from around the world, many from stressed-out teachers who feel their students aren’t learning properly because they are using ChatGPT to do their homework. They worry AI is creating a generation who can produce passable work but don’t have any usable knowledge or understanding of the material.The fundamental issue, Kosmyna says, is that as soon as a technology becomes available that makes our lives easier, we’re evolutionarily primed to use it. “Our brains love shortcuts, it’s in our nature. But your brain needs friction to learn. It needs to have a challenge.”If brains need friction but also instinctively avoid it, it’s interesting that the promise of technology has been to create a “frictionless” user experience, to ensure that, provided we slide from app to app or screen to screen, we will meet no resistance. The frictionless user experience is why we unthinkingly offload ever more information and work to our digital devices; it’s why internet rabbit holes are so easy to fall down and so hard to climb out of; it’s why generative AI has already integrated itself so completely into most people’s lives.We know, from our collective experience, that once you become accustomed to the hyperefficient cybersphere, the friction-filled real world feels harder to deal with. So you avoid phone calls, use self-checkouts, order everything from an app; you reach for your phone to do the maths sum you could do in your head, to check a fact before you have to dredge it up from memory, to input your destination on Google maps and travel from A to B on autopilot. Maybe youstop reading booksbecause maintaining that kind of focus feels like friction; maybe you dream of owning a self-driving car. Is this the dawn of what the writer and education expert Daisy Christodoulou calls a “stupidogenic society”, a parallel to anobesogenic society, in which it is easy to become stupid because machines can think for you?AI companies are determined to push their products on to the public before we fully understand the psychological and cognitive costsHuman intelligence is too broad and varied to be reduced to words such as “stupid”, but there are worrying signs that all this digital convenience is costing us dearly. Across the economically developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Pisa scores, which measure 15-year-olds’ reading, maths and science,tended to peak around 2012. While over the 20th century IQ scores increased globally, perhaps due to improved access to education and better nutrition, in many developed countries they appear to have been declining.Falling test and IQ scores are the subject of hot debate. What is harder to dispute is that, with every technological advance, we deepen our dependence on digital devices and find it harder to work or remember or think or, frankly, function without them. “It’s only software developers and drug dealers who call people users,” Kosmyna mutters at one point, frustrated at AI companies’ determination to push their products on to the public before we fully understand the psychological and cognitive costs.In the ever-expanding, frictionless online world, you are first and foremost a user: passive, dependent. In the dawning era of AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes, how will we maintain the scepticism and intellectual independence we’ll need? By the time we agree that our minds are no longer our own, that we simply cannot think clearly without tech assistance, how much of us will be left to resist?Start telling people that you’re worried about what intelligent machines are doing to our brains and there’s a risk that, in the not-too-distant future, everyone will laugh at what a fuddy-duddy you were. Socrates worried that writing would weaken people’s memories and encourage only superficial understanding: not wisdom but “the conceit of wisdom” – an argument that is strikingly similar to many critiques of AI. What happened instead was that writing and the technological advances that followed – the printing press, mass media, the internet era – meant that ever more people had access to ever more information. More people could develop great ideas, and they could share those ideas more easily, and this made us cleverer and more innovative, as individuals and as communities.After all, writing didn’t only change how we access and retain information; it changed how we think. A person can achieve more complex tasks with a notebook and paper to hand than without: most people can’t work out 53,683 divided by 7 in their head but could have a stab at doing long division on paper. I couldn’t have dictated this piece, but writing helped me organise and clarify my thoughts. As humans, we’re very good at what experts call “cognitive offloading”, namely using our physical environment to reduce our mental load, and this in turn helps us achieve more complex cognitive tasks. Imagine how much harder it would be to function each day without a calendar or phone reminders, or without Google to remember everything for you. In the best case scenario, intelligent people working in partnership with intelligent machines will achieve new intellectual feats and solve tricky problems: we’re already seeing, for instance, how AI can help scientists discovernew drugs fasterand doctors detectcancer earlier and more efficiently.The complication is, if technology is truly making us cleverer – turning us into efficient, information-processing machines – why do we spend so much time feeling dumb?Last year, “brain rot” was named Oxford University Press’s word of the year, a term that captures both the specific feeling of mindlessness that descends when we spend too much time scrolling through rubbish online and the corrosive, aggressively dumb content itself, the nonsense memes and AI garble. When we hold our phones we have, in theory, most of the world’s accumulated knowledge at our fingertips, so why do we spend so much time dragging our eyeballs over dreck?One issue is that our digital devices have not been designed to help us think more efficiently and clearly; almost everything we encounter online has been designed to capture and monetise our attention. Each time you reach for your phone with the intention of completing a simple, discrete, potentially self-improving task, such as checking the news, your primitive hunter-gatherer brain confronts a multibillion-pound tech industry devoted to throwing you off course and holding your attention, no matter what. To extend Christodoulou ’s metaphor, in the same way that one feature of an obesogenic society are food deserts – whole neighbourhoods in which you cannot buy a healthy meal – large parts of the internet are information deserts, in which the only available brain food is junk.Digital multitasking gives you a false sense of being on top of things without ever getting to the bottom of anythingIn the late 90s the tech consultant Linda Stone, who was working as a professor at New York University, noticed that her students were using technology very differently from her colleagues at Microsoft, where she also worked. While her Microsoft colleagues were disciplined about working on two screens – one for emails, perhaps, and another for Word, or a spreadsheet – her students seemed to be trying to do 20 things at once. She coined the term “continuous partial attention” to describe the stressful, involuntarily state we often find ourselves in when we’re trying to toggle between several cognitively demanding activities, such as responding to emails while on a Zoom call. When I first heard the term I realised that I, like most people I know, live most of my life in a state of continuous partial attention, whether I’m guiltily checking my phone when I’m supposed to be playing with my kids, or incessantly sidetracked by texts and emails when I’m trying to write, or trying to relax while watching Netflix and simultaneously doing an online food shop, still wondering why I feel as chilled-out as an over-microwaved dinner. Digital multitasking makes us feel productive, but this is often illusory. “You have a false sense of being on top of things without ever getting to the bottom of anything,” Stone tells me. It also makes you feel permanently on edge: one study she conducted found that 80% of people experience “screen apnea” when checking their emails: they become so caught up in the endless notifications that they forget to breathe properly. “Your fight or flight system becomes up-regulated, because you’re constantly trying to stay on top of things,” she says, and this hypervigilance has cognitive costs: it makes us more forgetful, worse at making decisions and less attentive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

After all, what matters to tech companies financially is not that you want to be reading what you’re reading, or that you love what you listen to or what you’re looking at, only that you are unwilling or unable to pull yourself away. This is why streaming services such as Netflix crank out bland, formulaic films that are euphemistically labelled “casual viewing” and are literally designed for viewerswho aren’t really watching, and Spotify playlists are filled withgeneric stock musicby fake artists, to provide background music, “Chill Out” or “Party” vibes, for listeners who aren’t really listening. In short, the modern internet doesn’t necessarily make you an idiot, but it definitely primes you to act like one.It is into this climate that generative AI arrived, with an entirely novel offer. Until recently you could only outsource remembering and some data processing to technology; now you can outsource thinking itself. Given that we spend most of our lives feeling overstimulated and frazzled, it’s little wonder that so many have jumped at the chance to let a computer do more things we would have once done for ourselves– such as write work reports or emails, or plan a holiday. As we transition from the internet era to the AI era, what we’re consuming is not only ever more low-value, ultra-processed information, but more information that is essentially predigested, delivered in a way that is designed to bypass important human functions, such as assessing, filtering and summarising information, or actually considering a problem rather than finessing the first solution presented to us.Michael Gerlich, head of the Centre for Strategic Corporate Foresight and Sustainability at SBS Swiss Business School, began studying the impact of generative AI on critical thinking because he noticed the quality of classroom discussions decline. Sometimes he’d set his students a group exercise, and rather than talk to one another they continued to sit in silence, consulting their laptops. He spoke to other lecturers, who had noticed something similar. Gerlich recently conducted a study, involving 666 people of various ages, and found those who used AI more frequentlyscored lower on critical thinking. (As he notes, to date his work only provides evidence for a correlation between the two: it’s possible that people with lower critical thinking abilities are more likely to trust AI, for example.)Are schools equipped to produce creative thinkers – or is the education system going to churn out mindless, AI-essay writing drones?Like many researchers, Gerlich believes that, used in the right way, AI can make us cleverer and more creative – but the way most people use it produces bland, unimaginative, factually questionable work. One concern is the so-called “anchoring effect”. If you post a question to generative AI, the answer it gives you sets your brain on a certain mental path and makes you less likely to consider alternative approaches. “I always use the example: imagine a candle. Now, AI can help you improve the candle. It will be the brightest ever, burn the longest, be very cheap and amazing looking, but it will never develop to the lightbulb,” he says. To get from the candle to a lightbulb you need a human who is good at critical thinking, someone who might take a chaotic, unstructured, unpredictable approach to problem solving. When, as has happened in many workplaces, companies roll out tools such as the chatbot Copilot without offering decent AI training, they risk producing teams of passable candle-makers in a world that demands high-efficiency lightbulbs.There is also the bigger issue that adults who use AI as a shortcut have at least benefited from going through the education system in the years before it was possible to get a computer to write your homework for you. Onerecent British surveyfound that92% of university studentsuse AI, and about 20% have used AI to write all or part of an assignment for them. Under these circumstances, how much are they learning? Are schools and universities still equipped to produce creative, original thinkers who will build better, more intelligent societies – or is the education system going to churn out mindless, gullible, AI essay-writing drones?Some years ago, Matt Miles, a psychology teacher at a high school in Virginia in the US, was sent on a training programme on tech in schools. The teachers were shown a video in which a schoolgirl is caught checking her phone during lessons. In the video, she looks up and says, “You think I’m just on TikTok or playing games. I’m actually in a research room talking to a water researcher from Botswana for a project.”“It’s laughable. You show it to the kids and they all laugh, right?” Miles says. Alarmed at the disconnect between how policymakers view tech in education and what teachers were seeing in the classroom, in 2017 Miles and his colleague Joe Clement, who teaches economics and government at the same school, publishedScreen Schooled, a book that argued that technology overuse is making kids dumber. In the years since, smartphones have been banned from their classrooms, but students still work from their laptops. “We had one kid tell us, and I think it was pretty insightful, ‘If you see me on my phone, there’s a 0% chance I’m doing something productive. If you see me on my laptop, there’s a 50% chance,’” Miles says.In essence what is happening with these technologies is we’re experimenting on childrenUntil the pandemic, many teachers were “rightly sceptical” about the benefits of introducing more technology into the classroom, Faith Boninger, a researcher at the University of Colorado, observes, but when lockdowns forced schools to go online, a new normal was created, and ed tech platforms such as Google Workspace for Education, Kahoot! and Zearn became ubiquitous. With the spread of generative AI came new promises that it could revolutionise education and usher in an era of personalised student learning, while also reducing the workload for teachers. But almost all the research that has found benefits to introducing tech in classrooms is funded by the ed-tech industry, and most large-scale independent research has found that screen time gets in the way of achievement. A global OECD study found, for instance, that the more students use tech in schools,the worse their results. “There is simply no independent evidence at scale for the effectiveness of these tools … in essence what is happening with these technologies is we’re experimenting on children,” says Wayne Holmes, a professor of critical studies of artificial intelligence and education at University College London. “Most sensible people would not go into a bar and meet somebody who says, ‘Hey, I’ve got this new drug. It’s really good for you’ – and just use it. Generally, we expect our medicines to be rigorously tested, we expect them to be prescribed to us by professionals. But suddenly when we’re talking about ed tech, which apparently is very beneficial for children’s developing brains, we don’t need to do that.”What worries Miles and Clement is not only that their students are permanently distracted by their devices, but that they will not develop critical thinking skills and deep knowledge when quick answers are only a click away. Where once Clement would ask his class a question such as, “Where do you think the US ranks in terms of GDP per capita?” and guide his students as they puzzled over the solution, now someone will have Googled the answer before he’s even finished his question. They know students use ChatGPT constantly and get annoyed if they aren’t provided with a digital copy of their assignment, because then they must type rather than copy and paste the relevant questions into an AI assistant or the Google search bar. “Being able to Google something and providing the right answer isn’t knowledge,” Clement says. “And having knowledge is incredibly important so that when you hear something that’s questionable or maybe fake, you think, ‘Wait a minute, that contradicts all the knowledge I have that says otherwise, right?’ It’s no wonder there’s a bunch of idiots walking about who think that the Earth is flat. Like, if you read a flat Earth blog, you think, ‘Ah, that makes a lot of sense’ because you don’t have any understanding or knowledge.” The internet is already awash with conspiracy and misinformation, something that will only become worse as AI hallucinates and produces plausible fakes, and he worries that young people are poorly equipped to navigate it.During the pandemic, Miles says, he found his young son weeping over his school-issued tablet. His son was doing an online maths program and he had been tasked with making six using the fewest number of one, three and five tokens. He kept suggesting using two threes, and the computer kept telling him he was wrong. Miles tried one and five, which the computer accepted. “That’s kind of the nightmare you get with a non-human AI, right?” Miles observes: students often approach topics in unanticipated and interesting ways, but machines struggle to cope with idiosyncrasy. Listening to his story, however, I was struck by a different kind of nightmare. Maybe the dawn of the new golden era of stupidity doesn’t begin when we submit to super-intelligent machines; it starts when we hand over power to dumb ones.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Britons, long-promised fully driverless cars, the answer is as ever – yes, nearly. But not quite.A landmark moment on the journey to autonomous driving is, again, just around the corner. This week, Waymo, which successfully runs robotaxis in San Francisco and four other US cities, announced it wasbringing its cars to London.The detail remains scant, but the promise eye-catching: the pioneering Silicon Valley company said it was bringing its fully autonomous service “across the pond, where we intend to offer rides – with no human behind the wheel – in 2026 … We can’t wait to serve Londoners and the city’s millions of visitors next year.”Driverless taxis from Waymo will be on London’s roads next year, US firm announcesRead moreThose millions may want an Oyster card for the London Underground, just in case. The UK government, intent on luring big tech, in the summer set out plans to speed up the introduction of driverless cars, meaning robotaxis could start operating in regulated public trials as early as spring 2026. But the rules are yet to be fully established, and testing may include a safety driver for some time.British firmWayve, in partnership with Uber, has issued the slightly more sober “plan to develop and launch public-road trials of level 4 fully autonomous vehicles in London.”While Americans sit back and enjoy the autonomous ride, Britain’s winding road to driverless cars has been marked by pledges that vanished like pedestrians in the rain. In 2018, Addison Lee – once the future – was promising, along with Oxford University scientists, to belaunching robotaxis by 2021.View image in fullscreenWaymo, which successfully runs robotaxis in San Francisco and four other US cities, announced it was bringing its cars to London.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyA year earlier, Nissanalmost managedto get one of its Leaf cars to drive itself around Beckton in east London without crashing. Chris Grayling, then transport secretary, said self-driving cars would be on the market in four years, as little pods tootled autonomously around the O2 in Greenwich. A British invention, a union jack-liveried Sinclair C5-Tardis love child,appeared in a Milton Keynes car park in 2015; then business secretary Vince Cable said 100 of them would soon be carrying passengers round town for £2 a pop.Yet abroad, particularly in America and parts of China, autonomous taxi services are now very much a reality – meaning Waymo’s arrival appears more significant than previous hype or hope.In San Francisco, Waymo’s home town, its driverless cars have become a routine part of urban life, humming along the hilly grid of streets at a cautious yet purposeful pace.US regulators launch investigation into self-driving Teslas after series of crashesRead moreSince their full launch in June 2024 they have taken their place alongside the city’s electric scooters and municipal buses. Taking a Waymo has become as much of a must-do tourist experience as riding one of the city’s historic trolley cars.The Democrat mayor, Daniel Lurie, has encouraged expansion to revitalise downtown areas, where the streets remain inhabited by many homeless people – leading to the jarring juxtaposition of cutting-edge AI-controlled robocars rolling past those in extreme poverty.With fast spinning cameras on each wing and one on the roof like a police siren, the converted white Jaguar iPace vehicles look like surveillance infrastructure. They are hailed like Uber or Lyft rides from smartphone apps – but the absence of a human in the driver’s seat, and the steering wheel turning under the control of an invisible algorithm, are reminders of the economic ructions they are causing.In 2010 Uber launched in San Francisco, upending the way taxi drivers were employed and ushering in precarious gig work. Now those Uber drivers are facing a second wave of technological disruption.View image in fullscreenIn 2010 Uber launched in San Francisco, upending the way taxi drivers were employed and ushering in precarious gig work.Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesAccording to data cited by the Economist, the number of people employed in San Francisco in taxi firms grew by 7% in 2024; and pay rose by 14%. It quoted David Risher, the chief executive of Lyft, predicted that self-driving taxis “will actually expand the market”.But not all necessarily feel that way on the frontline. In the Mission district of San Francisco, asked about Waymo, one Uber driver from Venezuela replied: “I think I’ve got about a year left in this job.”‘Delivery robots will happen’: Skype co-founder on his fast-growing venture StarshipRead moreFor a customer, to ride in a Waymo is to feel abandoned to the control and power of artificial intelligence. Once hailed via the app, the car pulls up gently, showing the customer’s initials on a digital display on the roof hub. A tap on the app unlocks the car doors; a welcoming voice reminds riders to buckle up. A screen offers a wide menu of music to cruise along to behind the tinted rear windows, in a truly private space.Tap the “start ride” button on the touch screen and the car pulls confidently away into the streaming traffic. The steering wheel, with its “please keep your hands off” sign, spins like a funfair ghost train ride.It doesn’t take long to feel comfortable, as it swerves hazards, errs on the side of caution. Screens with scrolling street maps track progress and update the arrival time while the “pull over now” button is a welcome reminder that it is possible to override the original destination instruction, although it will only pull over when safe.View image in fullscreenFor a customer, to ride in a Waymo is to feel abandoned to the control and power of artificial intelligence.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesWaymos have prompted a multitude of social reactions. When three stalled in an intersection of a busy nightlife zone in the Marina area last month – apparently confused, lights flashing – revellers whooped with delight and one man executed multiple backflips from the roof of one of them.In July, a prankster organised people to a dead end street to all order Waymos at the same time simply to create the spectacle of a cluster of 50 of the robocars. In early 2024, when Waymos were in use in more limited numbers, one was smashed, daubed with graffiti and torched during lunar new year celebrations in the Chinatown area.A similar reception could await driverless taxis here – even if not personally at the hands of black cab drivers. General secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, Steve McNamara, said: “You see kids hacking Lime bikes – how long before it becomes the latest TikTok craze to surf on the roof of a Waymo?”McNamara claims to be relaxed: “It’s a solution to a problem we don’t have. These vehicles, that work so well allegedly in San Francisco and LA – London is like nowhere else. I want someone to explain to me how this driverless car is going to go somewhere like Charing Cross Road at 11pmt, where everybody’s just walking across the road. As soon as you see the Lidar dome [sensor] on the top of the Waymo car, you’re just going to step out, or pull out in a car, because you know it’s going to stop.”Christian Wolmar, the author of Driverless Cars: On a Road to Nowhere, concurs: “We do not have jaywalking rules here – and if Google expects that we’re going to introduce jaywalking rules for the sake of their cars …”Despite the US experience, he remains resolutely sceptical that fully driverless taxis will appear here next year: “Without a human operator, absolutely zero chance.”View image in fullscreen‘London is like nowhere else’: can driverless cars adapt to a non-US traffic system by 2026?Photograph: Paolo Paradiso/AlamyWaymo, which announced its London plans partly to pre-empt sightings of test cars on the streets beginning the long mapping process, is feeling confident after some 100m miles of autonomous journeys in San Francisco – a city far from flat and orderly – and trials in a dozen more.‘Raring to go:’ the German remote-driving firm that hopes to make private car ownership redundantRead moreOperators have long maintained that regulation, rather than technology, is the challenge. Even fast-tracking has its limits: the results of a consultation that closed last month should – although not confirmed – allow the pilots to go ahead.That may have been the trigger for Waymo, but it still needs to jump through a number of Department for Transport and Transport for London hoops to get the test scheme motoring – and the wider legislation will not be in place for at least two more years. Insurers, in particular, say many questions remain about liability.Similar pre-legislative pilot schemes have left other novel transport forms in limbo: e-scooter “trials” are now set to last eight years. Tony Travers, the LSE professor of government, believes driverless cars have a better chance: “They have to obey the rules. They could lead to congestion – but not the near-anarchy that the e-scooters have caused.”But even if driverless taxis appear, the wider question, Wolmar says, is, “so what?”According to the Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana, the answer is in the cars “reliability, safety and magic”, with a big emphasis on safety. Waymo cars to date have been involved in a fraction of the incidents of human-driven cars over the same distance.It also hopes to bring a different form of autonomy to those who may have lacked it: the Royal National Institute of Blind People welcomed Waymo’s news as a dawn of “technology that can safely enable spontaneous autonomous travel”.Waymo said its entry into the UK market would mean investing in depots, charging infrastructure, and cleaning and support teams, and “human specialists” in the driving seat for now.Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, has said the impending autonomous vehicle revolution could create 38,000 UK jobs.But more evidently at risk are professional drivers: 300,000 or so who are licensed for private hire – and, further down the line, another million in HGVs and delivery. Many of Britain’s 82,000 bus drivers have recently won significant pay rises; and the 27,000 train drivers are famously well heeled.Little wonder that polling suggests public opinion in the UK is barely positive about driverless cars, in a backdrop of general anxiety over the potential for artificial intelligence to eliminate human jobs, if not yet humans.The licensing and legislation awaits. McNamara is upbeat: “Who’s going to sign it off? If I was looking for a successful career in politics I wouldn’t be putting my name on that piece of paper.”"

What’s wrong with that, you may think?The answer could be one of the biggest issues AI chiefs face as their era-defining technology becomes ever more ubiquitous in our lives.Spotify partnering with multinational music companies to develop ‘responsible’ AI productsRead moreGoogle and OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence is supposed to be just that – generative, meaning it develops novel answers to our questions. Ask it for a time-travelling doctor, you get one that their systems have created. But how much of that output is original?The problem is working out how much tools like OpenAI’sChatGPTand its video generator Sora 2, and Google’s Gemini and its video tool Veo3, rely on someone else’s art to come up with their own inventions, and whether using source material from the BBC, for example, is an infringement of the broadcaster’s copyright.Creative professionals and industries including authors, film directors, artists, musicians and newspaper publishers are demanding compensation for the use of their work to build those models – and for the practice to stop until they have granted permission.They also argue that their work is being used without compensation in order to build AI tools that create works in direct competition with their own. Some news publishers, including the Financial Times, Condé Nast and Guardian Media Group, publisher of theGuardian, have struck licensing deals with OpenAI.A key sticking point is the AI giants’ closely – guarded models, which underpin their systems and make it difficult to know just how much their tech relies on other creatives’ work. One firm, however, claims to be able to shine a light on the issue.The US tech platform Vermillio tracks use of a client’s intellectual property online and claims it is possible to trace, approximately, the percentage to which an AI generated image has drawn on pre-existing copyrighted material.In research undertaken for the Guardian, Vermillio created a “neural fingerprint” for various pieces of copyrighted work, before asking the AIs to create similar-looking imagery.For Doctor Who, it entered a prompt into Google’s popular Veo3 tool asking: “Can you create a video of a time travelling doctor who flies around in a blue British phone booth.”Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.AI Dr Who video matches 82% of Vermillio’s fingerprintThe Doctor Who video matches 80% of Vermillio’s Doctor Who fingerprint, implying that Google’s model has leaned heavily on copyright-protected work to produce its output.The OpenAI video, taken from YouTube and stamped with the watermark for OpenAI’s Sora tool, was an 87% match, according to Vermillio.Other examples created by Vermillio for the Guardian use aJames Bondneural fingerprint. A Veo3 James Bond video, created with the prompt: “Can you create a famous scene from a James Bond movie?”, had a neural fingerprint match of 16%.A Sora video, taken from the open web, had a 62% match with Vermillio’s Bond fingerprint, while images of the agent created by Vermillio using ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini model had matches of 28% and 86% respectively from a prompt citing: “A famous MI5 double ‘0’ agent dressed in a tuxedo from a famous spy movie by Ian Fleming”.View image in fullscreenAn image of James Bond created by OpenAI’s Chat GPT.Vermillio’s examples also showed strong matches with Jurassic Park andFrozenfor OpenAI and Google models.Generative AI models, the term for technology that underpins powerful tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot as well as Veo3 and Sora, have to be trained on a vast amount of data in order to generate their responses.The main source of this information is the open web, which contains a vast array of data from the contents of Wikipedia to YouTube, newspaper articles andonline book archives.View image in fullscreenAn image created by Google AI.Anthropic, a leading AI company, has agreed to pay $1.5bn (£1.1bn) to settle a class-action lawsuit byauthorswho say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.

This would incentivise copyright holders to release more data to AI companies and would give AI companies access to more interesting sets of data. Instead of giving all the money to five AI companies, there would be this amazing ecosystem.”In the UK theartistic community has launched a vociferous fightbackagainst government proposals to overhaul copyright law in favour of AI companies, who could be allowed to use copyrighted work without seeking permission first; instead, copyright holders would have to signal they wished to“opt out” from the process.A Google spokesperson said: “We can’t speak to the results of third-party tools, and our generative AI policies and terms of service prohibit the violation of intellectual property rights.”However, Google-owned YouTube says its terms and conditions allow Google to use creators’ work for making AI models. In September, YouTube said: “We use content uploaded to YouTube to improve the product experience for creators and viewers across YouTube and Google, including through machine learning and AI applications.”OpenAI said its models train on publicly available data, a process which it claims is consistent with the US legal doctrine of fair use, which allows use of copyrighted work without the owner’s permission in certain circumstances.View image in fullscreenImage created by Google AI which had a strong match to Jurassic Park.The Motion Picture Association trade group has urged OpenAI to take “immediate action” to address copyright issues around the latest version of Sora. The Guardian has seen Sora videos showing copyrighted characters from shows such as SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park, Pokémon and Rick and Morty. OpenAI said it would “work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests”.Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the House of Lords and a leading figure in the fightback against the UK government proposals, said it was “time to stop pretending that the stealing is not taking place”.“If Doctor Who and 007 can’t be protected then what hope for an artist who works on their own, and does not have the resources or expertise to chase down global companies that take their work, without permission and without paying?”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleOpenAIChatGPTChatbotsArtDoctor WhonewsShareReuse this content"

These chatbots, which are created by users, are available on Facebook, Instagram and the Meta AI app.Parents will also be able to block specific AI characters if they don’t want to stop their children from interacting with chatbots altogether. They will also get “insights” into the topics their children are chatting about with AI characters, which Meta said would allow them to have “thoughtful” conversations with their children about AI interactions.Meta faces backlash over AI policy that lets bots have ‘sensual’ conversations with childrenRead more“We recognise parents already have a lot on their plates when it comes to navigating the internet safely with their teens, and we’re committed to providing them with helpful tools and resources that make things simpler for them, especially as they think about new technology like AI,” said the Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, and Alexander Wang, Meta’s chief AI officer,in a blog post.Meta said the changes would be rolled out early next year, initially to the US, UK, Canada and Australia.Instagram announced this weekthat it wasadopting a version of the PG-13 cinema rating systemto give parents stronger controls over their children’s use of the social media platform. As part of the tougher restrictions, its AI characters will not discuss self-harm, suicide or disordered eating with teenagers. Under-18s will only be able to discuss age-appropriate topics such as education and sport, Meta added, but would not be able to discuss romance or “other inappropriate content”.The changes follow reports that Meta’s chatbots were engaging in inappropriate conversations with under-18s. Reutersreported in Augustthat Meta had permitted the bots to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual”. Meta said it would revise the guidelines and such conversations with children never should have been allowed.In April, theWall Street Journal(WSJ) found that user-created chatbots would engage in sexual conversations with minors – or simulated the personae of minors. Meta described the WSJ’s testing as manipulative and unrepresentative of how most users engaged with AI companions, but made changes to its products afterwards, the WSJ reported.In one AI conversation reported by the WSJ, a chatbot using the voice of actor John Cena – one of several celebrities who signed deals to let Meta use their voices in the chatbots – told a user identifying as a 14-year-old girl: “I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” before referring to a graphic sexual scenario. WSJ reported that Cena’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment. WSJ also reported that chatbots called “Hottie Boy” and “Submissive Schoolgirl,” had attempted to steer conversations towards sexting.Explore more on these topicsChatbotsArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaChildrenInternet safetyInstagramFacebooknewsShareReuse this content"

It is set in the futuristic World State, whose citizens are scientifically engineered to fit into a hierarchy. Eugenics, psychotropic pharmaceuticals and classical conditioning are employed to maximise stability and happiness. Huxley’s novel does not describe a conventionally authoritarian system, but one in which the desire for freedom and dignity has simply been eliminated. The World State is a radical technocracy.It’s a satire on the consequences of importing scientific thinking into the realm of social policy. The Controllers of the World State preside over a society that has rationality and efficiency as its guiding principles, and when those principles conflict with human nature, it is human nature that is required to give way. Rather than building a society that engenders happy human beings, the Controllers seek to design human beings that can function in the society into which they are “hatched”.The idea that we would invert our relationship with the world in this way strikes us as sinister, as antithetical to what it means to be human.And yet something resembling this upside-down mindset is now emerging across the globe, particularly in the debate around climate change.From Europe to China, the technology that threatened to destroy the planet is held to be the one that will save it.Having built a system that is destructive of the environment that surrounds and sustains us, we are now proposing to change … the environment! In his dystopia Huxley imagined a society that only worked when the humans within it were made into something not quite human. Today, many scientists and engineers imagine a planet that has been similarly transformed: nature itself must yield to the system. We need a technologicalfix.Driving us towards this technological fix is the damage inflicted by existing technology.The powerful datacentres needed to provide artificial intelligence demand huge amounts of energy – a demand that will increase as the white-hot rivalry between the US and China becomes hotter still. And so it is hardly surprising to find the Silicon Valley faithful at the head of a campaign to revive and reinvent the nuclear power industry, or to find that this technology – the first in human history to reconstitute nature’s basic elements – has a kind of totemic power among those who would rely on technology to address the environmental crisis. The last two years have seen a huge recommitment to nuclear energy, with more than 120 energy and tech companies, 25 countries and 14 major financial institutions announcing their support for its expansion and development.From liberal Europe to communist China, the technology that threatened to destroy the planet is held to be the one that will save it.But ecomodernism is far more heterodox, and far more radical, than this “nuclear renaissance”.AI might be creating a ‘permanent underclass’ but it’s the makers of the tech bubble who are replaceable | Van BadhamRead moreTake geoengineering, for example: the proposal to manage planetary temperatures, either by reducing greenhouse gases by sucking them out of the atmosphere and burying them deep beneath the oceans, or by reflecting sunlight back towards space. One popular proposal involves pumping sulphates into the upper atmosphere to imitate the sun-dimming effects of a large volcanic eruption, reducing the amount of solar radiation getting trapped by the greenhouse gases, but not the gases themselves. (You know the situation is serious when your proof of concept is Krakatoa.) Again, the avatars of big tech have placed themselves at the head of these schemes. And again, they are moving ahead with such technologies whether we are happy about it or not, performing sulphate experiments in the skies above California (too late for the Palisades, alas) or fertilising the oceans with iron dust in order to kickstart algae blooms that draw down carbon from the atmosphere.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhat else can we look forward to, in this technologically managed future? As biotechnology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence converge into a technoscience of remarkable power, the answer to that question boggles the mind; but even now there are signs that the future could witness an unparalleled revolution in the relationship between human beings and the non-human world.And all this is before we’ve broached the issue of mining the moon, or even asteroids, for water and precious minerals.In all kinds of ways, then, we are on the precipice of a transformation – one that will reverse our relationship with the world in a way analogous to Huxley’s great satire. In the absence of any serious discussion about social and political transformation, we are doubling down on technological innovation. We are entering a Brave New Wild.The problem with the technofix mindset is that the very thinking that brought us to this juncture is now assumed to offer a path to safety. The environmental problems we face are deeply related to technology, and yet it is to technology that we turn for solutions. The cause is re-engineered as a cure.Many scientists reject this position as simplistic. They argue (not without some justice) that it is theirresponsibleuse of technology that is dangerous, and that the best way forward is to instil a new ethos of responsibility in our future endeavours. Technologies, they say, are “only tools” and have no moral content as such. I can use a hammer to drive in a nail or bludgeon my nextdoor neighbour to death. It is my actions that matter, not the hammer itself.This is the instrumental view of technology, and it is dominant in scientific circles and even in mainstream environmentalism. But it fundamentally misunderstands the nature of humanity’s relationship to technology. That relationship is inevitable: thereisnoHomo sapienswithout technology.Having evolved from tool-using hominids, humans depend upon technology in a way that no other species does. To take an instrumental view of that relationship, however, is simplistic and ultimately dangerous, as it underplays the shaping effect that powerful technologies have on human sensibilities. If all you have is that hammer, every problem becomes a nail.View image in fullscreenThe technofix is just as much a psychosocial phenomenon as a scientific and engineering challenge. We need to ask what kind of relationship we want with the planet we call home, as well as with the technologies through which we now propose to change it.This is not an argument against technological innovation. Any response to climate change and the environmental crisis more generally will have to make use of new technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, and more efficient batteries for energy storage. But in order to make the best use of these innovations, we will need to insist on the crucial difference between approaching such technological interventions as part of a broader project of change and merely thinking technologically – and technocratically – about the problem of climate change.We need to push back against the instrumentalist, techno-capitalist worldview and do so in a language that places humanity – what itis, what itneeds– at the centre of our thinking.This is an edited extract fromBrave New Wildby Richard King, out now (Monash University Publishing, A$32.99)Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)Biotechnology industryClimate crisisextractsShareReuse this content"

You’re trying to get information out and trying to have people understand what’s safe and what’s not safe.”The company switched to Proton email and Signal while its email was compromised, Brown says. He was taking calls from companies and government agencies across the globe, including the US army and the Covid vaccine program Operation Warp Speed.“You get the world wanting verbal communication not written communication. And that is a kind of an important lesson: you can write things down, but they want to talk to the [chief information security officer],” says Brown, who spoke at Melbourne’s CyberCon on Friday.“They want to be able to hear colour around the outside of it, so very important to be prepared for that kind of response.”How the cyber-attack unfoldedThe notification about the hack came in a phone call from Kevin Mandia, the founder of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, to SolarWinds’ then CEO Kevin Thompson.Mandia told Thompson that SolarWinds had “shipped tainted code” to its Orion software, which helps organisations monitor outages on their computer networks and servers.The exploit in Orion was being used to attack government agencies, Mandia told Thompson.“We could see in that code [it] was not ours, so when we got that, it was ‘all right, this is real’,” Brown recalls.View image in fullscreenBrown says SolarWinds was not the key target of the hack but ‘a route to the target’.Photograph: Sean Davey/The GuardianThe Texas-based SolarWinds determined that 18,000 people had downloaded the tainted product, which the hackers, later attributed to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, were able to insert into Orion in the build environment where source code is turned into software.The news broke on the Sunday. SolarWinds notified the stock market before it opened on Monday.The original estimate that up to 18,000 clients could be affected was later revised down to about 100 government agencies and companies that actually were.“It would have been nice to know that on day one, but that was the truth of the matter, right?” Brown says. “We weren’t really the target. We were just a route to the target.”SolarWinds called in CrowdStrike, KPMG and the law firm DLA Piper to deal with the response and investigation.Aftermath: the heart attackSolarWinds stopped work on new features for the next six months and its team of 400 engineers focused on systems and security to get the company back on its feet.“We really took transparency to heart – how can we make sure people realise [what] threat actor models [are out there], what they do, how they do reconnaissance, how they then do an attack [and] how they then leave.”Brown says the company’s customer renewal rate fell into the 80% range in the first few months after the incident, but has since returned to more than 98%.But then came the legal implications.The Biden administration imposed sanctions andexpelled Russian diplomats in 2021, partly in response to the attack.SolarWinds settled a class action lawsuit over the attack in 2022 for US$26m. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC) then filed a lawsuit against SolarWinds and Brown personally in October 2023, accusing the company and Brown of misleading investors over its claims about cybersecurity protections, and failing to disclose known vulnerabilities.View image in fullscreenBrown has remained at SolarWinds since the cyber-attack.Photograph: Sean Davey/The GuardianBrown was in Zurich when he found out he was being charged.“When I walked up a hill, I would lose my breath. My arms would get heavy, my chest would get tight. I was just not getting enough oxygen,” he says. “I did a silly thing. I flew home … I couldn’t walk from the terminal to my car without stopping. That’s a walk I had done thousand of times.”He was having a heart attack. When he got home, his wife took him to the hospital, where he underwent surgery. He has since recovered.“Stress keeps building up and I thought I was managing it well and I didn’t proactively go to a doctor,” he says.Brown says he now advocates for companies going through similar incidents to employ psychiatrists to help staff process the stress.Cyber-attacks rise by 50% in past year, UK security agency saysRead more“The stress level was pumped up, and then it just went over the edge, but stress was building up all the time.”A confidential jointly proposed settlement with the SEC was announced in July, but has yet to be approved. The US government shutdown has delayed the finalisation of the agreement.Brown has remained with SolarWinds throughout the process.“It happened on my watch, that’s how I look at it. There are reasons why it occurred, nation state attack, et cetera, but still it happened on my watch,” he says.“I guess I’m stubborn. But it was just very important for us to get through this whole cycle, so leaving wasn’t an option until it was done.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeRussiaInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its learning model entails just two hours of focused academic work per day, during which the school says students can learn twice as fast as their counterparts in traditional schools – with the help of artificial intelligence.AI, Alpha says, is central to the school’s learning philosophy, brand and impact on students.Alpha is not alone in its efforts to incorporate AI into the classroom. Around the US, schools are experimenting with AI as a tool that can assist teachers with curriculum development, identify learning trends, and even boost student engagement.But the strong emphasis on AI in schools such as Alpha and its claims of success – as well as the eye-popping annual tuition cost of some of them – give researchers of education and technology pause, even though they agree AI has an important and inevitable role to play in the future of pedagogy.“There is evidence that AI could have exciting applications in education, but at same time, we’ve seen educational experiments that do not work well for kids in the past, including those pushed by tech folks,” said Emma Pierson, assistant professor of computer science at the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, and an affiliate of the university’s Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab. Pierson, who describes herself as a “cautious optimist” when it comes to AI, says there needs to be more critical, objective research into AI’s implications on students of all backgrounds.“Careful evaluation of these programs is really key.”Alpha School’s websitesuggests a futuristic learning model: AI tools make it so that students only need to spend two hours a day on traditional subjects such as history and math. This is done individually, on screens, using software that adapts to students’ unique paces and learning styles. The rest of the day is dedicated to learning life skills, which is done through creative activities – such as designing, permitting, and operating a food truck – that promote teamwork, social skills and financial literacy. Instead of receiving instruction from teachers, students are supervised by “guides” who coach them through an otherwise self-directed process.These elements aren’t completely novel pedagogical approaches, experts said. Take the number of hours devoted to traditional schoolwork. Between working on group projects, socializing, and taking breaks, students at traditional schools spend on average the same amount of time focussed on core curriculum requirements, explained Ying Xu, assistant professor of education at Harvard University.Self-directed learning models, too, also have long tenures. Xu herself sent her son to a Montessori school because of the adaptive, customizable, independence-fostering model it offered. “A lot of schools have been using this kind of strategy,” she said.Some of the software Alpha is using has been widely used in public and private educational settings for years to create personalized learning pathways, said Chris Agnew, director of Stanford University’s Generative AI for Education Hub. This includes programs fromIXLandMath Academy. Historically, the schools also assigned work throughKhan Academyand Duolingo.Alpha says other apps are new – it is developing and deploying new software through the network’s affiliated brand,2 Hour Learning, withmore than half of students’ app-based learning done via proprietary software.That proprietary software tracks all student learning and is able to offer students lessons at the right pace and correct grade levels, the school says, allowing it to truly tailor lessons to every kid’s needs, including by correcting learning gaps, going slower on some materials and faster on others or tailoring the learning materials towards children’s interests.They’re leading with AI because they’re riding the wave, and it’s drawing lots of attentionChris AgnewAI’s primary use therefore appears to be as a tool to help Alpha’s guides understand how – and how quickly – students are learning, so that the material they are given is at the appropriate level, the experts said. “AI is brought in as a layer that helps understand the students’ pacing and then make suggestions on what might be best next,” Agnew explained. “Most of the learning AI is not student-facing.”“It’s not exactly a non-stop conversation with a personalized ChatGPT bot,” echoed Victor Lee, associate professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education. Alpha confirmed that chatbots play no role in their pedagogy.In that sense, Alpha’s relationship with technology doesn’t stray unrecognizably far from what Americans are used to seeing in elementary school classrooms. Screens are used, but not constantly; apps are assigned, but not without supervision. Perhaps most importantly, a qualified adult is present in every classroom, fostering some level of interpersonal learning – which Agnew says should remain a vital part of the school experience. The primary difference is that whereas teachers have historically been considered subject-matter experts who direct from a podium, at Alpha, they are coaches in the field. “There are still adults in the room that know the kids,” he said.Agnew wonders whether the AI component of the school is being deliberately played up to attract parents and students who fear that their children could miss the AI boat – and to generate profit. “They’re leading with AI because they’re riding the wave, and it’s drawing lots of attention,” he said.When it comes to personnel, Alpha is well positioned to capitalize on the AI boom. The brand’s founder, education podcaster and social media influencer MacKenzie Price, is married to software executive Andrew Price. He works alongside Texas billionaire Joe Liemandt, who is principal of Alpha Schools.Hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackmanis said to be an informal Alpha ambassador. Families who send their students to the San Francisco school run in elite circles, too – by necessity, since it has thehighest tuition of any private school in the city.The2 Hour Learning websitestates that Alpha students consistently score in the top 1-2% nationally and claims that 90% of Alpha students love going to school. But Alpha’s demographics can cloud assessments of whether Alpha’s methods improve learning outcomes at a near-universal rate, experts worry. For one thing, students from such unusually affluent backgrounds likely have access to other resources that prime them for academic success. Plus, the parents having selected Alpha suggests a high level of engagement with their children’s education, which is another indicator for achievement.Alpha rejects criticisms that the school’s high achievement record is because students are from highly resourced backgrounds, and says its model has the potential to improve academic achievement for all students.Experts caution there’s a lot left to study, and that there’s no one perfect pedagogy that works for every child.At Harvard, Xu’s own research shows that learning with AI can lead to very different outcomes depending on an individual’s disposition. Children who are more self-directed and confident in their abilities are more likely to use AI to enhance their understanding of materials, she said, while those who lack confidence are more likely to use AI to generate answers and circumvent critical thinking. That means a student who is “intrinsically less motivated to learn might suffer in that setting”, she said.“Just like with Montessori schools, the format doesn’t work for all students,” said Xu. “We shouldn’t abandon direct instruction,” she said.Rose Wang, a researcher at OpenAI whose PhD looked at machine-learning applications in educational settings, raised questions about whether an app-based curriculum can serve all learners equally, especially as K-8 students are still developing foundational skills. She says those core skills – such as reading, writing, and math – are going to be extremely important for children growing up in the AI era as a means of ensuring they know how to engage with these new technologies critically and effectively.“This model for schooling would probably work really well for kids who are quite advanced already,” Wang said, noting that younger students as well as students who need more learning assistance respond well to in-person, collaborative methods, like solving a math problem on a whiteboard alongside classmates. “While our AI systems are really great in many ways, this kind of collaborative learning and teaching environments [is] really difficult to translate seamlessly into an automated interaction.”To truly know how broadly applicable the method is – and for whom it works – experts say more rigorous study is needed. Pierson, flagging risks like AI hallucinations and algorithmic bias, suggests developing a small pilot with a randomized control trial before scaling the model. (Alpha says that their proprietary apps have been developed in such a way that eliminates the possibility of AI hallucinations.)Lee calls for scrutiny into privilege and equitable access – issues that are top of mind in a city with vast wealth gaps like San Francisco. “Who gets to do it, where are the resources coming from, and what advantages are already at the back of these programs like Alpha School?” he asked.Other Alpha campuses offer financial aid, including at the site in Brownsville, Texas, where the $10,000 per year tuition is heavily subsidized. With just 10 students actively enrolled (and 25 total families having put down deposits for their children to enroll between 2025 and 2026), Alpha says the San Francisco campus can’t yet afford to offer financial aid.At the same time, experts warn against over-regulating education in a way that discourages experimentation. This is especially important at a time when technology is advancing apace, they said, and young people need to be given opportunities to engage with it in a way that is meaningful. “We do want to have the latitude to try different things, and I think that schools and teachers would like that as well,” Lee said, pointing to school districts doing just that.In Washington, Peninsula school district is investigating how AI can make learning experiences more inclusive; in Orange county, the superintendent has hired AI experts to guide schools into how best to incorporate the technology into classrooms; and across California, public schools are integrating AI literacy into their curricula within the state mandated digital media literacy requirements.“Figuring out new ways to get students excited about learning, learning better, and learning faster is something to always be welcomed,” Wang said.At the end of the day, Agnew says, improvements to the current system are necessary – and AI is inevitably going to be a part of that conversation. For educators and policymakers, the challenge will be cutting through the noise to ensure AI’s benefits in the classroom outweigh its risks.“With the barrage of products being sold … it’s really hard to make decisions grounded in what’s right for kids and what’s good for learning,” he said. “But it’s not an option for schools to ignore AI.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)US educationSchoolsSan FranciscoCaliforniaWest CoastComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s as if the company sensed that a sucker who’d spend thousands of dollars on plastic toys and electronic games had just entered the world. Actually, it’s as if the company had sensed that an entiregenerationof fools like me was about to enter the world. Which is true. That was the time to strike. We were about to be drained of every dollar we received for birthdays, Christmases and all those times our dad didn’t want us to tell our mom about something. (Maybe that last one’s just me.)Despite being slightly older than the NES, a horror I’m only now forced to face as I write this, it felt like that console had always existed in my life. I don’t have many memories from my baby years because I was too busy learning how to use my hands and eyes, but as far back as I can actually remember, “Nintendo” was a word synonymous with video games. Friends would ask if you had Nintendo (no “the”, no “a”) at your house the same way they might ask if you had Coca-Cola in the fridge.View image in fullscreenPac-Man on the Nintendo Entertainment System.Photograph: ArcadeImages/AlamyMy sister and I spent two years begging our parents to get the NES. My mom and dad weren’t concerned about the corrupting influence of video games – that would come later with Doom, Mortal Kombat and of course Stardew Valley – but they were definitely concerned about purchasing an expensive toy that only works if you buy additional expensive toys to put inside of it. Yes, the Nintendo Entertainment System was advertised in the US as an advanced piece of technology despite looking like a rejected design for a VHS cassette player, but we all knew it was meant to beplayedwith. Whereas touching my dad’s home theater resulted in a lot of yelling, this was finally an electronic device that we children were allowed to use.It’s also worth mentioning that I’m in the first generation that completely missed the Atari home consoles that dominated earlier in the 80s. Even though Atari systems were still around at the time, kids my age talked about them with the same historical distance we talked about the second world war. Even seeing an Atari felt like catching a glimpse of an ancient artefact that none of us understood well enough to enjoy. Watching a neighbour turn on their Atari was almost shocking to me: the basketball game literally used a square for the ball. No. No, no thank you. I need to sit down for a second.But the NES – oh, the NES had graphics that actually looked like the arcade games. Was it perfect? Of course not! Some of them look downright terrible now! But when you’re five years old, an accurate but slightly washed out version of Pac-Man is still Pac-Man. While my parents never let me play shooting galleries at carnivals (who’s to say why?), Duck Hunt was the next best thing. No! Better! Because we all realised almost instantly that we could just press that stupid plastic gun to the screen and nail it every time. This is a point-blank technique that you can only learn from a 40-year-old video game or by becoming a mafia hitman.The games on the NES also felt so much more open.Super MarioBros seems quaint now, but the first time that plumber went down that pipe? My mind melted down into a finer, purer substance. These were games with worlds full of surprises and mysteries. Secrets and Easter eggs had been planted in games before, but now it felt as if they weremeantto be found. They were there to help you, not as a kind of maddening inside joke for the developers. We were exploring fictional kingdoms that almost, kind of,sort oflooked like living cartoons, jumping around to find hidden, invisible “?” boxes.View image in fullscreen‘The games felt so much more open’… a NES.Photograph: Gary Hider/AlamyLet’s not forget that the NES brought us Mario in the guise we know and love him. Yeah, he’d been a construction worker trying to take down Donkey Kong. Fortunately, he switched careers to plumbing and became a character that would soon adorn every folder, every backpack, every lunchbox, every flask and every bedsheet that I and most of my friends owned. Nintendo was an inside language, long before all references became internet memes seen by billions. We constantly quoted the original Legend of Zelda: “It’s dangerous to go alone!

But the Nintendo Entertainment System solidified gaming culture, at least in America where the ZX Spectrum and other home computers never took off like they did in Europe. It was a shared language, a toy that let us explore our own imaginations – and certainly a way for my parents to get a break from their children. I still own the NES they bought us.

He is rabidlyanti-abortion, incrediblyanti-immigration, and obsequiously pro-Trump. Earlier this year, perhaps in a desperate bid to get Dear Leader to notice him, he introduced a bill, dubbed the “DON-ument Act”, which would make the wall on the US-Mexico border a national monument.In the great tradition of Republican congressmen from Florida (hello,Matt Gaetz!), it turns out Mills may also be a misogynistic creep. On Tuesday, a Florida judge granted aprotective orderagainst Mills at the request of his former girlfriend, Lindsey Langston, the reigning Miss United States. Langston, who is 19 years younger than 45-year-old Mills, told authorities she started a romantic relationship with the lawmaker in 2021, when Mills was still married but reportedly separated from his wife.According to Langston, after the breakup, Mills threatened to release nude images of her and harm any future boyfriends. The congressmanhas called the allegations “false”and hasn’t been charged with a crime, but, according to theNew York Times, the judge said he did not find Mills’ “testimony concerning the intimate videos to be truthful” and granted an order restricting Mills from going within 500 feet of his ex’s residence or referring to her on social media. The court found that Langston “has reasonable cause to believe she is in imminent danger of becoming the victim of another act of dating violence”.Langston reportedlyended their relationship in February. That month also saw news reports that Mills wasbeing investigated for an alleged assaulton a27-year-old womancalled Sarah Raviani. This wasn’t his wife, if you’re trying to keep track. Rather, according toWRC-TVin Washington, who obtained an earlier version of the police report, Raviani was his “significantother for over a year”. When the authorities turned up she had bruises on her arm and that same police report, according to USA Today, “states Mills instructed the victim to lie about how she obtained bruises on her arms”. Raviani toldthe Daytona Beach News-Journalher bruising was caused by a medical condition and Mills, who has denied wrongdoing, was not arrested orcharged with anything.Mills doesn’t just seem to have issues with these romantic partners; he seems to have quite a few problems meeting his financial obligations. Earlier this year the Republican was accused of failing to pay$85,000 in rent. His landlord tried to evict him after he failed to pay his monthly$20,833 rentbetween March and July. Most congressmen getpaid $174,000 a yearso I can understand why he struggled to pay an annual rent that was far higher than his salary. Mills, for his part,blamed an online payment problemfor the issue and said he ended up paying his back rent later. Theclaims against him were dismissed.Poor old Mills always seems to get blamed for problems that are absolutely not his fault. He is alsofacing an investigation by the House ethics committeeover allegations heheld contractswith the US government while in Congress, in relation to a weapons company hefounded a decade ago. So far, this investigation doesn’t seem to have had much impact on his career.We hear all the time about how the GOP is the party of law and order and family values. What, you might be wondering, do Mills’s colleagues have to say about all his run-ins with the law? Not much!“You have to ask Representative Mills about that,”saidMike Johnson, the House speaker, when asked about the allegations against Mills this week. “He’s been a faithful colleague here. I know his work on the Hill. I don’t know all the details … Let’s talk about things that are really serious.”Yes, let’s talk about things that arereallyserious, shall we? Because clearly being investigated for allegedly assaulting one girlfriend and then allegedly threatening torelease sexual videosof another girlfriend aren’t serious at all. Certainly nothing that might disqualify someone from being a politician in a country that is led by an adjudicated sexual predator.From Matt Gaetz to Mills toPete HegsethtoRoy Moore, the list of people in Trump’s orbit accused of sexual misconduct seems to grow by the day. And yet, funnily enough, a common theme among Republican men accused of sexual misconduct is that it’s trans people who are the real threat to women. “We must stop the lefts attack on women,” Mills wroteon X in 2022. “We must stand to protect women from biological males competing unfairly,” Millswrotein another X post. If Mills is what Republicans “protecting” women looks like, I think I’ll pass.Costa Rica’s president limits abortion to life-threatening casesFulfilling a promise he had previous given religious conservatives, President Rodrigo Chaves has limited abortion access to situations when themother’s life is in danger. Before running for president in 2022, Chaves worked at the World Bank, where he was accused of sexually harassing various women and was eventually sanctioned for misconduct. He has denied the allegations. Seems like he would fit in well with the Republican party.Virginia Giuffre on her abuse at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell“So many young women, myself included, have been criticised for returning to Epstein’s lair even after we knew what he wanted from us,” Giuffre writes in her posthumous memoir, an extract of which ispublished in the Guardian. “But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable. Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care … And then, he did his worst to them.”TikTok watches are desperate for a Crock-pot cauldronThere’s been a lot of toil and troublebrewing on WitchTokrecently, after Crock-Pot apparently reneged on its promise to make a slow cooker in the shape of a cauldron.

And for most of Trump’s supporters we’re probably known either (positively) for Crocodile Dundee or (negatively) for gun control.At a political level, it could be argued that Australia does have somewhat outsized influence in the US, largely due to our long-running defence alliance, but as all Australians who work in Washington know, that has limited currency.This is even more the case today, given the immense instability in Europe and the Middle East that is commanding attention.In Donald Trump’s game of geopolitical musical chairs, will Albanese find a seat? | Daniela GavshonRead moreFor Australia as a nation, and forAnthony Albanese, this dynamic is both a blessing and a curse.It means that Australia can fly under the radar to some degree, leveraging the pre-existing relationship through lower-level leaders and staff to get the required outcomes, on trade for example, without being so high profile that we cause Trump a domestic political headache.It also means that the US president has limited understanding, and interest, in Australia.Getting a meeting at all has been a battle, and he didn’t even know what Aukus was,remember?Yet the pact will cost Australian taxpayers at least $368bn and is supposed to sit at the centre of the future of the strategic relationship.Albanese must therefore navigate the delicate balance between getting Trump’s attention and attracting too much domestic attention to something likeAukus. Handing over subs has political risks for Trump, because it could be seen as contradictory to the president’s “America First” positioning.This was illustrated in the early days of the firstTrump administrationback in 2017 when I asked a question in a White House press briefing about the Obama-era deal for the US to accept asylum seekers from Australia and whether it would still stand.This was something both governments would have preferred had stayed out of the domestic US headlines given that it contradicted Trump’s policies of tightening borders and so-called “extreme vetting” of migrants.From my personal experience of both of them, Albanese and the Donald both talk a lot, listen lessOnce it was elevated so publicly inside the US, it blew up, leading to the leaking ofa conversationbetween Trump and then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in which Trump accused Turnbull of trying to export the next Boston bombers.“That puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad,” Trump said during the leaked call.From the point of view of the Australian government, this is a situation to avoid repeating at all costs.And arguably, carefully stepped through, the government has an opportunity to find common ground that will appeal to Trump.From my personal experience of both of them, Albanese and the Donald both talk a lot, listen less. They are not alone in this. It’s a characteristic of many politicians.To get what he needs out of this meeting, though, Albanese will need to read Trump’s cues. And giventhe stream of consciousnessthat characterises a conversation with Donald Trump, that will be no easy task. An attractive deal will have to be on the table.A deal on US investment in Australian critical minerals, for example, would push back on China’s increasing global domination in that space.Confirmation of the Aukus deal could be framed as all benefit, no cost to the American audience, given the decades-long timeframe and no-strings-attached multibillion-dollar deposit involved.No cost either to Trump, for whom self-interest is his primary if not only priority. He won’t be president when the US actually has to hand us a submarine. Someone else’s problem, among them Albanese who is facing slipping support for Aukus at home.And despite the differences in position, Australia’s support for the US-brokered Israel-Hamas deal provides cover for both Albanese and Trump. They are differentiated in the way they frame the issues for their respective bases but are on the same page in working for the common goal of peace.Indeed, while the White House hascriticised the Albanese government’s decision to recognise Palestinian statehood, Trump himself may respect it even if he disagrees. Generally, he’s a fan of decisive leadership. The prime minister could do more of that.Dealing with Donald Trump requires nose holding though, obviously.Amid increased politicisation of immigration here in Australia, for example, the prime minister will have to park his values to avoid calling out the president’s appalling, heavy-handed actions against minorities.Increasing encroachment on press and academic freedom, backsliding on climate policy, cuts to foreign aid and government services, disrespectful treatment of the Ukrainian president,claims ofnepotism in official appointments, failure to release the Epstein files and a range of other actions will have to be ignored.It’s a common theme when it comes to Trump. Even his supporters pick and choose the bits they like and the bits they don’t.But it creates risk for Albanese who will need to hold on to his integrity and stand up for Australian values in the process, as he faces the diplomatic test of his political life to attract, and hold, Trump’s attention.Zoe Daniel is a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and former independent member for GoldsteinExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionTrump administrationAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseAukusDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Super Dom! At a time of heightened worries about national security, who better thanDominic Cummingsto shine a light on the murky world of spying?The man who turned a drive to Barnard Castle into an advert for SpecSavers. The man who gave us Brexit. Which one of us didn’t vote for a 4% hit to GDP? The man who gave usBoris Johnson. Truly, Dom has enriched us all over the past 10 years.Here’s what Dom knows about Dom. Not to put too fine a point on it, Dom knows that Dom is a genius. The cleverest man in every room in which he finds himself. Though some might argue he should try finding some other rooms. He is the master of the double-double bluff. The man with the infallible strategy for winning at Traitors. Come the evening’s roundtable, vote for yourself to be banished. That’s the last thing anyone would expect a Traitor to do. Eat your hearts out Jonathan Ross and Alan Carr. Mere amateurs.So when Dom speaks, it falls on all of us to listen. Even if he has yet to take personal responsibility for anything he has done. And after giving an interview to the Times on all things Chinese early in the week, Cummings has followed this up by appearing on Robert Peston’s Talking Politics podcast. Here he goes into greater detail of lapses in national security.You can’t help but appreciate the irony in this. Because during the Brexit years and his time as chief aide to Boris, there was no one more leaky than Dom. At times he would virtually simulcast private meetings in real time to his trusted sources. Almost as if he was dictating the news agenda for the coming week. Still, you can’t argue that he doesn’t know whereof he speaks, I suppose. And better that one sinner repenteth, and all that.We begin in a bunker deep below Downing Street early in 2020. Dom is sprawled in a chair wearing his filthy trackie bottoms while Boris is on to his fourth cheese sandwich of the morning. An ashen faced cabinet secretary walks in with some terrifying news. He has just discovered that the networks used by the British security services to send top secret information around the world have, for the past few years, been operated by the Chinese-owned Global Switch. Every piece of intelligence we have sent is potentially compromised.Dom admits to being flabbergasted. Boris is so astonished he helps himself to yet another cheese sandwich and decides to do … absolutely nothing. For Dom this isn’t just another sign of Johnson’s inherent laziness. It’s a sign that Johnson and the whole of government have become unwitting spies for the Chinese. As must be Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer. They are all hopelessly compromised. Because they have done nothing to change the system by which intelligence is transmitted.At this point, you can’t help but wonder why Dom decided to keep all this to himself for the last five years. He has been privy to information he believes affects national security but has chosen to allow the Chinese to potentially gobble up all our secrets. We have been compromised for years but Dom kept stumm. Had it slipped his mind? Perhaps it’s a double-double-double bluff and Dom has also been working for the Chinese all along. Having spent years leaking secrets, he chose to keep to himself the one thing that could have protected the country. For the first time in his life, he could have done us all a favour. But no. I guess he’s too much of a genius for that.Or could it be that this was all a fever dream? Dom has seldom passed up an opportunity to put himself centre stage of a conspiracy theory of his own making. Let’s think this through. It took MI5 and MI6 several years to realise that Global Switch was owned by the Chinese. Hmm. I’m not sure it would have taken the intelligence services that long to discover information that was readily available to everyone. Perhaps they had decided it was a risk worth taking. After all it wasn’t as if our embassies were talking to one another on open networks. Everything they were sending was encrypted. Just because the Chinese potentially had access to our messages it didn’t follow they could decipher them.Next we were deep into another bunker. The one due to be built under the Chinese mega-embassy. A bunker so deep it could interfere with the London tube network. Dom wanted us to know that the Chinese were planning to spy on us even more than they already were. He said this as if it were in some way surprising rather than a statement of the obvious. We’ve known that for years. And we are also spying on them. It’s what countries that don’t fully trust one another do. Come to think of it we are probably also keeping tabs on the French and the Americans.Last, Dom had some unique insights into the recently collapsed Chinese spy trial. Dom is of the view that the prime minister regularly nobbles the director of public prosecutions and the only trials that go ahead are the ones the government has okayed. So for this case to have been dropped was a sure sign of interference. Dom personally knew everyone involved and Starmer was definitely aChinastooge. Just like every other prime minister before him. The UK was basically an overseas province of Beijing.Spare a thought for Keir at this point. Only on Thursday, he was accused of being a China stooge by Tory MPs because he had failed to nobble the DPP. He can’t win. Yet another double-double-double-double bluff. One that only Dom has the genius to see. It was time for him to slip back into the shadows. One day he would rise again. To be a light in an increasingly murky world. Let’s just hope he’s tested his eyesight.A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.On Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsDominic CummingsThe politics sketchEspionageBoris JohnsonChinacommentShareReuse this content"

He can still live in Royal Lodge, but it’s a terrible blow to his sense of entitlementSat 18 Oct 2025 07.31 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 10.04 EDTShareThe saga of Andrew Windsor, the ex-Duke, who henceforth will be known as only plain old Prince,may have finally reached its end. At least the rest of the royal family will hope so. But even that is likely to depend on what may further emerge from any more releases of Epstein files, letters, records and emails in the US. His image, such as it remains, may yet be tarnished further.It is the loss of titles that will certainly hurt him most. Andrew has not formally lost them – removal of his dukedom requires an act of parliament, which neither government nor Buckingham Palace will want, taking up as it would embarrassingly public lengths of time – and he can’t shed his princely tag since he indubitably is the son of a monarch.But he won’t be able to use them publicly or privately and that will be a terrible blow to his sense of entitlement and status. As one of his former dates told Andrew Lownie for his recent bookEntitled, he always introduced himself to her friends as the Duke of York, saying: “It struck me how impressed he was with who he is, or how impressed he wanted others to be. Every joke always ended with: ‘because I’m the Duke of York’. He tells the most pathetic jokes. He finds poo cushions funny.”Friday night’s statementrepresented the last shred of dignity in that he was allowed to pretend that he was relinquishing the use of his titles and the knighthood of the garter voluntarily, out of a belated sense of duty. He wasn’t. After at least 10 years of private wrangling among the family and personal anguish on the part of the king about what to do about the Andrew problem, and with his mother no longer around to protect him and pay his debts, there was no alternative but to cut him loose. Evidently Prince William was prepared to be more ruthless than his father. In the end it was the Windsors’ genteel version of the revolver in the locked room with a bottle of whisky.He still has theRoyal Lodge, where he lives with his ex-wife,Sarah Ferguson, (what does he need a place that big for? It’s not as if he has that many friends) and apparently spends his days watching golf on the television and taking solitary rides in Windsor Great Park.While the family firm can’t stop him going to church – as he did in attending Westminster Cathedral a few weeks agofor the funeral of the Duchess of Kent, when William ostentatiously ignored him – he won’t be accompanying the rest of the family to church at Sandringham on Christmas morning. Instead, it will be a lonely lunch at home with plain Ms Sarah Ferguson and their daughters (who retain their princess titles) and their families. The paper hats will be the nearest the eighth in line will ever come to a crown now. He will have to watch the next coronation on television as well, if he lives that long.What will he do for money? No longer a working royal, he hasn’t qualified for public funds for the last six years. There are residual savings from the sale of various properties, he still has a navy pension and presumably there will have to be private subventions from the king. Famously profligate, he and his ex-wife lacked the means to keep up with the Arab and American billionaires with whom they liked to mingle. This must have been one of the reasons he was attracted to Epstein, though the sex – which he still denies – was probably another. What he offered them pathetically in return was status and access to flummery and palaces.Now he does not even have that, locked as he is, like Mr Rochester’s first wife in the attic, in his case the 30-room Royal Lodge: nowhere to go, no one willing to see him. Poor Virginia Giuffre, whose own memoirs come out next weekafter their serialisation in the Guardian, has been denied the satisfaction of finally bringing down a prince while alive.He was an idiot, and worse: a powerful man who brought pain to others: a dark stain tarnishing the family escutcheon and rocking the institution itself.Stephen Bates is a former royal correspondent of the GuardianExplore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchyJeffrey EpsteincommentShareReuse this content"

This much needed pause in hostilities is providing children with the chance to sleep without the fear of drones above their heads, airstrikes on nearby buildings or fires breaking out in their tents. Families in Gaza are slowly returning to their neighbourhoods and trying to salvage what they can of their lives from the rubble.But crucially, what they are still not currently getting is full and sustainableaccess to aid suppliesand vital services. This is about fundamental basic rights for children in the occupied Palestinian territory, which we have been demanding and advocating for since 1953.The humanitarian situation on the ground continues to be catastrophic.Childrenand babies are still struggling with malnutrition, we are seeing increased cases of diarrhoea, scabies and pneumonia in our health clinics. Until these basic needs are met, Palestinians cannot begin to think about rebuilding Gaza.Since the pause in hostilities began, we know some UN agencies and international organisations have been able to increase the entry of humanitarian supplies, but this has been nowhere near the scale that we need to deliver consistently for children. Save the Children supplies have been repeatedly denied entry intoGazasince early March. At the bare minimum, Gaza requires at least 600 aid trucks, 50 fuel tankers and cooking gas. Children need aid that matches their needs – and there should be no cap on truck deliveries. We have been rationing existing stock as a temporary solution. But we need immediate, long-term, unimpeded access to nutrition supplies, food, water, hygiene kits including soap, shampoo, laundry detergent and sanitary pads – along with fuel, cooking gas and other essential lifesaving items.We have seen first-hand what happens when aid isn’t consistently delivered. Nazek*, 30, who is a mother of four in Gaza, was pregnant with her youngest daughter during the first year of the war, and food was so scarce that she became malnourished. At seven months, her youngest daughter, Nour*, was diagnosed withsevere acute malnutrition. With support from Save the Children’s nutrition clinic, Nour has improved but remains fragile, often surviving only on supplementary therapeutic food known as Plumpy’nut. But what she needs is high-energy, nutrient-dense food items consistently, and for a prolonged period.With winter approaching, when temperatures can drop to five degrees, shelter, blankets, and warm clothing are also a priority. The scale of devastation in Gaza goes beyond anything we could have imagined – the United Nations relief and works agency (Unrwa) reported that 92% of homeshave been damaged or destroyed. The photos and videos do not convey the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families living in rubble and bombed out buildings that are certainly not equipped for colder temperatures.Save the Children is advocating for long-term unimpeded access to be granted as well as a permanent definitive ceasefire. Ways to deliver this are being explored – with Moazzam Malik, chief executive of Save the Children UK,recently callingfor an internationally mandated mechanism to deliver aid at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. International management on both sides of the border could enable the movement of supplies at pace, and with transparent oversight.We’ve got supplies ready to go in Egypt, including 10,000 hygiene kits that include soap, shampoo, laundry detergent, sanitary pads and lifesaving medical items, including shelter and winter kits, as well as multi-purpose cash assistance. When granted access, we will work with UN agencies to expand the essential services that we’re already running, particularly scaling up our nutrition support, including prevention, screening and treatment of malnutrition. Children do not only need basic humanitarian supplies, but a range of services.We also need to address the longer-term impacts that this two-year war has had on children, which goes beyond the immediate need for aid. In 2024, the UN concluded that the occupied Palestinian territory wasthe deadliest place on Earthto be a child.Children need specialised mental health support to overcome the traumatising impacts of unconscionable violence. In a child-friendly space run by Save the Children, one child wrote: “I wish I was in heaven where my mother is, in heaven there is love, there is food and water.” Children in Gaza are also now in their third year of missing out on school. The extended period without education significantly increases the risk of students never completing their studies. With full access into and across Gaza, aid agencies can reopen temporary learning spaces to provide activities for 700,000 school-age children.Gaza also has the highest number of child amputees per capita anywhere in the world. Back in January the ministry of health reported that 800 children have had either theirupper or lower limbs amputatedsince the war in Gaza started, while the use of explosive weapons in Gaza in 2024 led to an average of 15 children a day sustaining potentially lifelong disabilities. These children need long term specialist support.Against unimaginable odds, we have been working around the clock to respond to the human-made crisis in Gaza since the war began. We have provided lifesaving support and aid to 1.6 million people, over half of whom are children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If only my TV obsession had ended a long time agoSat 18 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 12.49 EDTShareIt’s an all-too-familiar feeling. The second series of your favourite TV show has just begun streaming and your mind is full of hopeful expectation. Season one endedsoooperfectly: future plotlines were teased tantalisingly and a main character had – cliffhanger! – been offed (or had they?) In the months since the finale, you were perusing Reddit threads with other hardcores to find some Easter egg clues illuminating what would happen next.And then season two’s premiere is a damp squib. It feels like the entire writers’ room has been fired and replaced by artificial intelligence. Cut to the second episode, and your favourite cast member has done something that you and Reddit user Fishy2345 agree is totally out of character. By episode five, it’s clear that the showrunners have had collective amnesia around the storylines aggressively signposted in season one. And by the disappointing finale, you silently wish that the show had just been cancelled.Wishing for cancellation can only be retrospective; most fans protest when their favourite shows are canned before they can get off the ground. Take Kaos, a delightfully satirical take on Greek mythology featuring Jeff Goldblum,which was binned by Netflixdue to low viewing figures. But perhaps these fans will rest better with the knowledge that their enjoyment of the series won’t have been muddied by a sophomore slump.Looking back at the horror-mystery show Yellowjackets, I now wish it had been a limited series. Season one had acreatively abundant premise, and its 10 episodes were note-perfect. In 1996, a plane carrying an all-girl high school football team crashes in the middle of nowhere. Top-notch cast members (including Juliette Lewis, Lauren Ambrose and Sophie Thatcher) portrayed the team then and now. There were multiple award nominations, and the showrunners proudly announced there would befive seasonsto tell the story in necessary detail. But last week, it was announced that it would end withseason four. And as a fan, I let out a sigh of relief.View image in fullscreenGaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp in the forthcoming fifth season of Stranger Things.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe show has made narrative choices that have undermined its heart. Rather than leading with the girls’ return home and watching how they deal with their horrific new secrets, we were taken in directions that bloated the original premise. That included the show’s tiring habit of bringing in and focusing on new characters (such as Shauna’s two-dimensional daughter Callie) who did nothing for the broader story. It’s frustrating, and as a viewer, it is depressing to see your favourite show morph slowly into a hate-watch.But it’s not only Yellowjackets. Shows such as Emily in Paris, House of the Dragon, Squid Game and Stranger Things have lost the shock of the new, and fallen headfirst into expected or comfortable cliches. Sometimes shows need to quit when they are ahead.The thing is, there are joys to be had in a limited, “one-and-done” series. From Sharp Objects to I May Destroy You to Adolescence, TV creators know when to stop when the story has naturally reached an endpoint. But the game is over when shows such as Big Little Lies, originally a limited series, come back for more and more with diminishing returns. Hopefully, Adolescence’s producers have thought twice about thatrumoured season two.I wish Yellowjackets could have been a one-and-done series, living rent-free in our imaginations, cliffhangers and all. My favourite TV show of all time has played out like that. My So-Called Life, the perfect 90s teen dramedy, lasted for only one season but was cinematic in its scope: its characters were difficult and contradictory, the cinematography was perfectly autumnal, and the dialogue was untethered from the normal “teen speak written by a 35-year-old” trope. Its final episode was bitterly unresolved, but that is perfectly in keeping with the reality of never having real, definitive answers to the open-ended questions from your teenage years. After 18 perfect episodes (and one dodgy one), I was heartbroken and took to writing season two fan fiction myself to answer some of those questions. It might only live on an old hard drive, but it speaks to how deeply TV shows can chime with us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And with budgets pinched, directors say they are strugglingShaad D'SouzaSat 18 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 13.44 EDTShareThe launch ofMTV, in 1981, ushered in a new era of music. Showing music videos 24 hours a day, the television channel redefined artist marketing and launched the careers of artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna, whose public personas became inseparable from the gripping, frequently controversial clips they produced to be played on the service.Now, that chapter of music history appears to be drawing to a close, with MTV’s parent company Paramount announcing last week that its five dedicated music channels in the UK – MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV and MTV Live – will cease broadcasting after 31 December. (The flagship MTV channel, which broadcasts reality programmes such as Catfish, The Hills and Geordie Shore, will remain in operation.)For some, it represents the end of an era. Others, such as the musicianHannah Diamond, suggest that era may have been over some time ago. “The last few years, MTV has sort of transformed [into] more of a nostalgic memory,” she says. “It hasn’t been part of the conversation for such a long time that it really doesn’t surprise me that they’re ending it.” As an independent artist, she says, YouTube has always been the primary platform for music video releases.The specific shuttering of the brand’s music platforms does call into question the position of the music video in today’s industry, and whether the form still provides a viable outlet for expression and promotion. Jennifer Byrne, head of development at Academy Films – the famed production company that launched the careers of film-makers such as Jonathan Glazer through their music video work – says that “labels aren’t as willing” to invest heavily in videos as they once were. “They’re trying to spend that money on so many more deliverables than there used to be,” she says, referring to the multiplicity of online video and social media platforms. “It used to just be one three-minute video. Now it’s: how do you reach all these different audiences and can you cut it in 10 different ways?”Music video for Romeo by PinkPantheress, directed by Iris Luz.Iris Luz, a London-based director who has made videos for British pop singers PinkPantheress and George Riley, says that budgets for videos are shrinking rapidly, even for seemingly simple clips. “The number of times I’ll come up with an idea that, to me, seems easy, and people are like: ‘No, that’s gonna be 50 billion pounds,’” she says. “I’m like, that’s funny, because it’s in one house with four people. I don’t know what’s going on.”Neither Luz nor Byrne believes that the end of MTV will significantly impact music videos overall. In Luz’s mind, videos now are less promotional tools than “vehicles for relatability and branding that makes [a viewer] want to buy into the artist,” she says. “They’re just a facet in the ecosystem of a musician. Because of TikTok and the rise of independent artists, people put out music as soon as they’re done with it. So a video is designed to convey that immediacy – where they’re at in one moment – rather than make a big splash like 15 years ago.”There are also still barriers to entry for smaller artists, says Diamond. “The music videos I have made have been made through sheer luck, grafting or multiple years of work put into one thing,” she says. “I’ve become a musician in an era where artists don’t get the budget to make a music video unless they are a really big artist with a big label behind them that thinks it’s going to be a worthwhile investment.”View image in fullscreen‘MTV hasn’t been part of the conversation for such a long time’ … musician Hannah DiamondDirectors are feeling the pinch too: Byrne says that where “back in the day, an artist would have been like, ‘I like what Glazer’s doing, I’m going to talk to him,’ now, you’re pitching [to an artist] against [maybe] 10 different directors, and that’s free labour on the director’s part, creating this amazing treatment.” Plus, she says, “no one makes money out of these videos. Production companies don’t – but we still do them because they’re really important and a vital part of a director finding their own voice.”Part of the problem, of course, is that content budgets now have to stretch across short-form video, too. Luz says that while TikTok videos can be “shot on a DSLR camera; a guy with a guitar and a dream, singing on a pub stool,” they can also be just as creative and innovative as traditional videos. “Content can be an added facet to the [musician’s] world,” she says, citing her work with the band Confidence Man, which she says is “on par with their shows and music videos because they have fun with it.”Despite everything, videos can still be a pipeline to feature directing, says Byrne: “If you look at [Everything Everywhere All at Once directors]The Daniels, they started off in the music video world, and then they won an Oscar,” she says. “Music videos still allow those unique personalities to shine through and take risks.”Last month,the Wall Street Journal reportedthat Paramount was looking at ways to revitalise the MTV brand, and Diamond says that, given how volatile and changeable the industry is, it’s hard to make any assumptions about the future of videos. “Who knew that vinyl was going to make such a massive comeback, you know?” she says. Luz agrees: “It’s like an album – albums are never gonna go away, and music videos are like punctuation for an album. They’re always going to exist.”Explore more on these topicsMusicMTVPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her biographer reveals what they tell us about her unlikely rise to literary stardomCasey CepSat 18 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 04.10 EDTShareWhen To Kill a Mockingbird was published in the summer of 1960, it seemed to have sprung from nowhere, like an Alabamian Athena: a perfectly formed novel from an unknown southern writer without any evident precedent or antecedent. The book somehow managed to be both urgently of its time and instantly timeless, addressing the era’s most turbulent issues, from the civil rights movement to the sexual revolution, while also speaking in the register of the eternal, from the moral awakening of children and the abiding love of families to the frictions between the self and society.But no writer is without influences and aspirations:Harper Leehad, of course, come from somewhere and worked tremendously hard to become someone. It was only because she did not like talking about herself that her origins seemed so mysterious, and inevitably, the better To Kill a Mockingbird did – becoming a bestseller and then winning a Pulitzer prize, selling 1m copies and then 10m and then 40m – the more theories and rumours rushed in to fill her silence. In the years after the book came out, the public image of Lee swung between two of her beloved characters: she was either the living incarnation of her feisty, tomboyish heroine Jean Louise “Scout” Finch or, in her seeming reclusiveness, a version of that shy shadow figure, Arthur “Boo” Radley.How thrilling, then, to encounter a time capsule from the start of Lee’s career: a collection of some of her earliest short stories, appearing now in print for the first time, helps explain how the little girl from South Alabama Avenue turned herself into a bestselling author. Drafted in the decade before To Kill a Mockingbird, after Lee had first moved to New York City in 1949, the stories feature some of the characters and settings she would soon make famous and reveal some of the contradictions and conflicts she would spend her life trying to resolve.View image in fullscreenLee with Truman Capote in 1966.Photograph: Steve Schapiro/CorbisNelle Harper Lee was born on 28 April 1926, the last of Amasa Coleman Lee and Frances Cunningham Finch’s four children. Fifteen years younger than her oldest sibling, she grew up feeling as if she had her own private childhood in the small town of Monroeville, Alabama. Because her siblings were so much older, she watched them one by one fulfil the dreams of their parents: a respectable legal career alongside their father for her sister Alice; a loving marriage and homemaker’s life for her sister Louise; heroic military service in the second world war for her brother Edwin. For a long while, it seemed as if Lee would be the family’s one great disappointment: she dropped out of the University of Alabama a semester shy of graduation, fleeing to the disreputable north and abandoning the law degree that would have allowed her father to add an “s” to the family firm’s shingle. But while AC Lee and Daughters was not meant to be and Lee did not become a lawyer, she did eventually create the most admired attorney in the United States.Although Lee never formally studied creative writing, she spent her years in Tuscaloosa teaching herself to write. She had a recurring column in the college newspaper, The Crimson White, and contributed sketches to the student humour magazine, Rammer Jammer, which she eventually edited. Even then, her roving curiosity and intellectual range were evident on the page – in a review of recent British films, a parody of Shakespeare, a roast of the rural newspaper her father edited and owned. Lee wore blue jeans and Bermuda shorts at a time when women were discouraged from wearing anything but dresses, and once scandalised the entire campus by smoking a cigar on the hood of a car in the homecoming parade.Lee lived off peanut butter sandwiches while drafting stories at a desk she made for herself with old apple cratesLee knew approximately one person in New York City when she moved there at 23, but what a person he was: Truman Capote, who had spent some of his childhood living next door to her, and who would later serve as the model for the puny, puckish Charles Baker “Dill” Harris in her novel. The budding authors felt like “apart people”, as Capote later put it, already able to read years before their peers, playing with language the way others did dolls and footballs. The pair conspired with each other to write adventures, tall tales, and verses of the sort they so liked reading, from the Bobbsey Twins to Beowulf and the Rover Boys to Rudyard Kipling, clattering away at the typewriter that AC Lee had given his bookish youngest daughter.In lieu of college, Capote had gone directly to work as a copy boy at the New Yorker. A few years later, Lee landed her own job in publishing, for the monthly magazine of the American School Publishing Corporation, a trade rag called the School Executive. Eventually she left that day job for another, this one as an airline reservation clerk, which was less literary but theoretically more glamorous. The same could not be said of the rest of her life back then: around the edges of her nine-to-five work, she lived off peanut butter sandwiches while drafting stories at a desk she made for herself with two old apple crates and a door she found in the basement of her building.Writing on that shaky surface, Lee gradually steadied her hand. “I do believe that my greatest talent lies in creative writing,” she wrote to her family, confidingly and confidently, “and I do believe I can make a living at it.” Like so many aspiring authors, she initially turned to that family and her own early life for material, and the first three stories in the new collection shuffle through a series of young narrators to explore the social mores, tiny transgressions and moral confusion of what, in one of her later stories, she calls “childhood’s secret society”. The stakes of The Water Tank, The Binoculars and The Pinking Shears, all written before she turned 30, are profoundly circumscribed – the approval of one’s parents and the acceptance of one’s peers – and the antagonists aren’t very grand either: teachers, siblings, schoolyard cliques.The next three stories, by contrast, are all set in New York, with adult narrators, and one senses Lee trying to keep up with the Salingers and Cheevers. Still, that trio – A Roomful of Kibble, The Viewers and the Viewed and This Is Show Business? – does show her moving beyond incident and toward plot, while simultaneously experimenting with different narrative voices.Characters taken directly from Lee’s own life appear throughout these tales. One sports her own nickname, Dody; others bear the names of her siblings, Edwin, Alice and Louise; some are thinly disguised or entirely undisguised versions of her friends, including future Monroeville mayor Anne Hines. Lee’s oldest sister, Alice, known to the whole family as “Bear”, is here transformed ever so slightly into “Doe”, but remains instantly recognisable despite the name: “She loved only three things in this world,” Lee writes, “the study and practice of law, camellias, and the Methodist Church.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

By the last of the stories that appear in this collection, Miss Finch has officially become “Jean Louise”, though she’s not yet Scout. Those who knew Harper Lee best all summon her blistering intellect, and one of the pleasures of this final story is seeing that brilliance unleashed on the page.Lee is funny and formidably smart on the simultaneous comfort and claustrophobia of returning as an adult to one’s childhood home. By the time she wrote The Land of Sweet Forever, she was well versed in such returns. Two years after she moved to New York, in the summer of 1951, her father had called from the Vaughan memorial hospital in Selma to say that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer of the liver and lungs. Before Lee could even arrange for travel home, he called again to say that Frances had died of a cardiac episode only a day after being diagnosed.Six weeks later, that first dreadful phone call was followed by another, this one informing her that her beloved brother, Edwin, the inspiration for Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird, had died of a brain aneurysm at the air force base where he was stationed in Montgomery, leaving behind a wife and two young children. Lee flew home again, her already considerable grief and shock now overflowing. She was just 25 years old, but capturing her childhood had never felt more urgent, partly because, as she describes in one of these stories, The Cat’s Meow, her father and oldest sister soon sold the family home where she’d been born and raised, moving into a more modern house on the other side of town.View image in fullscreenLee with Mary Badham on the set of  To Kill a Mockingbird.Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty ImagesThe move did not help the pair of homebodies escape the ghosts of South Alabama Avenue, and Lee, too, was haunted by memories of her mother, her brother and the world as it had existed before they died. She worried over her father and returned home often to help Alice with his care. She began writing stories that attempted to reconcile her chosen home with her childhood one, merging the subjectivity of her Manhattan stories with the setting of her Monroeville stories, a kind of integrative work she was attempting both on and off the page.At the time, Lee’s politics were still taking shape. Her hometown was strictly segregated, with schools, churches and restaurants divided by race. In college, she had written about the horrors of racial violence and made herself comfortable among the radicals on the student newspaper. Upon arriving in Manhattan, however, she settled into a society more diverse than any she’d ever known.For a long time, the stories she wrote during those early years in Manhattan were just tantalising titles typed on a smudged and stained index card in the archives of her agents, Annie Laurie Williams and Maurice Crain. None was published, and for decades scholars and biographers alike wondered what had become of them. Four of them finally appear in The Land of Sweet Forever; together with the other four, they were found in the last of the novelist’s New York City apartments, this one at 433 East 82nd Street, where she moved the year To Kill a Mockingbird was published and where she lived another four decades until a stroke sent her home to Alabama for good.View image in fullscreen… and with Gregory Peck.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveHappily for posterity, Lee was a pack rat: when that apartment was cleaned out, there amid piles of her correspondence and practically every pay stub, telephone bill and cancelled cheque ever issued to her, were her notebooks and manuscripts, including the eight stories and eight nonfiction pieces. The essays, which were published in the decades after To Kill a Mockingbird, make clear that Lee enjoyed the career she’d always wanted, even if her fans never got from her the career they expected. Her masterpiece was adapted into a wildly successful and award-winning film, has never been out of print and was translated into dozens of languages. But she never wrote the sequel or second novel that so many of her admirers yearned for, and when, at the age of 89, she did finally publish another book, it was Go Set a Watchman, the first one she’d ever written, originally submitted to publishers the same year as The Binoculars.“I am more of a rewriter than a writer,” Lee once said, explaining that she generally worked through at least three drafts of any given piece of writing. Some of that hard work is visible here, not only on the physical manuscripts themselves, but on comparing the early stories to her published novels. The Binoculars, for instance, was abridged and adapted into the pedagogical standoff in the second chapter of To Kill a Mockingbird, when Scout’s first-grade teacher gets frustrated with her for knowing how to read. Similarly, The Land of Sweet Forever became a set-piece in the seventh chapter of Go Set a Watchman, when Scout returns home to Maycomb from New York City.Between the title pages and her literary agency’s records, we know that Lee spent seven years writing and revising these short stories and then, after they caught her agent’s eye and he encouraged her to try for something longer, spent another three years turning those stories into chapters, and those chapters into novels – first Go Set a Watchman and then To Kill a Mockingbird.All this would have taken even longer had it not been for an extraordinary gift Lee received, which she describes in one of the best essays collected here, Christmas to Me. Among her closest friends in New York were a husband and wife, Michael and Joy Brown, who had long championed her career. It was Michael Brown, a celebrated lyricist and composer, who had first introduced Lee to her literary agents, shortly before Thanksgiving in 1956, and he and his wife both delighted in her stories and in the remarkable letters she sent them from back home in Alabama – small masterpieces of the epistolary form, specific and funny, sociologically astute, surprisingly tender.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harper Lee LLCThe Browns and Lee were in the habit of spending Christmas together, and they had developed a tradition of trying to see which of them could give the least expensive yet most outrageous gift. That year, Lee had spent 35 cents on a portrait of an obscure English cleric for Michael and acquired a bargain copy of the complete works of a slightly less obscure British aristocrat for Joy. When it came time for the Browns to present the novelist with her gift, they pointed to an envelope on their tree. It seemed appropriately modest from the outside, but in fact, they had radically broken with tradition: inside was a note that read, “You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.” That month, and nearly every month thereafter for the next year, they wrote her a cheque for $100, five times her rent, insisting they wanted nothing in return.For decades, that gift has seemed shocking, an act so generous it bordered on the preposterous. Now, though, with the rediscovery of these stories, we get to see what Lee’s friends saw all those years ago: a lawyer father not yet named Atticus but already modelling high-mindedness and teaching his single-digit children civil procedure; a small-town versifier who feuds with the local newspaper printer over the propriety and theological permissibility of publishing obituaries for cows; a daughter of the south trying to map its mores on to her own emerging morals; glimpse after glimpse after glimpse of genius. No wonder the Browns gave Harper Lee that gift; it was no more lavish than her own.The Land of Sweet Forever by Harper Lee, with an introduction by Casey Cep, is published by Hutchinson Heinemann.

And everywhere – from the lights illuminating the Greek revival architecture, to the carpet on which guests arrive, to the glamorous outfits they are requested to wear – a very particular shade of pink.When theBritish Museumthrows open its doors on Saturday evening for its first “pink ball”, it will not only be hosting an enormous and lavish party, but also inaugurating what its director, Nicholas Cullinan, has called a “flagship national event” that he hopes will become as important to his institution’s finances as it will to the London elite’s social calendar.Eight hundred invited guests have each paid £2,000 to party alongside some of the world’s most sensational artefacts and aroll call of bigwigsfrom the worlds of fashion, art and culture: Naomi Campbell and Alexa Chung, Miuccia Prada and Manolo Blahnik, Sir Steve McQueen and Sir Grayson Perry and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas.As well as glitz, however, there will be brass. The event is co-chaired byIsha Ambani, a multi-hyphenate Indian “businesswoman, philanthropist and arts patron”, who also happens to be the daughter of Asia’s richest man.Mukesh Ambani’s energy and petrochemicals conglomerate, Reliance Industries, sponsored the museum’s current (pink-hued) exhibition onAncient India.View image in fullscreenIsha Ambani (left) has co-chaired the event and her father, Mukesh Ambani (right), owns the petrochemicals congolmerate Reliance Industries. The Ambani family’s association with the British Museum has drawn criticism from campaign groups.Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/ReutersAmbani and Cullinan, a celebrated networker, have mined their contacts books: also listed as “committee members” for the event are Kumar Mangalam Birla, the billionaire chair of the Indian manufacturing conglomerate Aditya Birla Group,Rajeeb Samdani, a Bangladeshi industrialist and art collector, and the “lifestyle entrepreneur” Eiesha Bharti Pasricha, the daughter of the Indian billionaire industrialist Sunil Bharti Mittal.It is they, alongside a long list of other business people, arts patrons and investors, who organisers hope will bid heavily on auction lots including a pet portrait painted by Dame Tracey Emin, a museum trustee, or an exclusive tour of Coco Chanel’s apartment at 31 Rue Cambon in Paris. About 70% of those attending have no previous relationship with the museum, Cullinan has said; something he would surely love to change.Where previous museum directors might have been more circumspect about the grubby business of raising dosh to keep the lights on, Cullinan has been frank that the financial needs of the museum “require you to be pretty flexible in your thinking, and pretty entrepreneurial”.It’s an acute challenge for all institutions, given the18% plummet in core fundingfor arts and cultural organisations between 2010 and 2023. The funding climate is “really, really bad”, according toLeslie Ramos, a philanthropy adviser working with arts organisations. “I don’t think that a ball or a series of galas is going to be enough to solve the issue,” she said.View image in fullscreenArt and glamour: Naomi Campbell is one of the stars on the British Museum’s ball committee.Photograph: Theo Wargo/Getty for Karl LagerfeldThat said, Cullinan is a “brilliant fundraiser” who has carefully staged his ballat the end of Frieze art fair, when London is teeming with arts investors, she added. “When you are studying history of art, you don’t necessarily know that you will also need to learn fundraising skills if you want to run a museum. It’s rare to have that dual expertise, but they are now needed more than ever.”Thomas Marks, a strategy consultant who works with museums, agreed. “It’s certainly imperative these days that museum leaders and senior leadership teams embed a development mentality in their organisations,” he said. “Ultimately, the conversation about funding is one that is going to be front and centre in the day-to-day work of any museum at this point.”Cullinan’s “flexibility of thought”, however, has inevitably attracted criticism. The museum already has a£50m, 10-year deal with its longstanding partner BPto help fund a redevelopment “masterplan”, and the campaign groupCulture Unstainedhas criticised the association of the Ambani family, “whose wealth comes in large part from the fossil fuel and petrochemical projects of Reliance Industries”.A spokesperson for the museum said: “We are not immune to the changing conversations taking place around sponsorships and in part that is why the ball is so important, because it moves us into a different environment and makes us more dynamic and viable for our future needs.”They said funds raised by the event will be spent on international programmes, including partnerships in Ghana and Iraq andbringing the Bayeux tapestryto the museum.This time next year, the tapestry will be in place – an obvious inspiration for the theme of next year’s ball, Cullinan said, confirming the event is here to stay.

We already know exactly which spin-off we want too!Frances RyanSat 18 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareFor a while, it seemed as if the romcom as an art form died and had been replaced by Marvel sequels and issue-led dramedies. Rachel and Ross were a distant memory (and not just because it was 20 years ago). Luckily, the genre – and our collective broken hearts – has been given CPR by a flurry of new releases. Few have been more affecting thanNobody Wants This(Netflix, from Thursday 23 October), the stomach-flipping story of rabbi Noah and relationship podcaster Joanne.When the first series appeared on Netflix last year, the success was somewhat unexpected. With the streaming giant focused on content viewers could watch after a lobotomy, few expected a mega hit that would create a genuine emotional connection. Then we met Noah (millennial nostalgia-fix Adam Brody) and Joanne (Kristen Bell) and the combination of acting, lovable characterisation and tight writing saw critical acclaim, Emmy nominations and – most importantly – old-fashioned longing. The internet had a new boyfriend. Fleabag’s Hot Priest was old news.Hot Rabbiwas here to save us. And he was a really good listener who could also cook pasta.Inspired by creator Erin Foster’s experience of converting to Judaism for her husband, Nobody Wants This boils faith, family and modern dating into 26 tightly packed minutes. On top of ex-girlfriends and formidable mother-in-laws, our two lovers have a central obstacle to overcome: if he wants to be head rabbi, Noah needs to marry a Jewish woman.When we last saw the couple, they were at a crossroads: Noah had been offered his dream job and Joanne had done the selfless act of leaving him so he could take it. The final scene of the two reuniting and kissing in the street perfectly set up a second season and with it pressing questions. Will Joanne convert? Will Noah quit his vocation? Will Noah’s mum murder Joanne when she finds out?It says something about the snail pace of modern television that it feels a real treat to be getting a second series only 13 months after the first. All 10 episodes were available for preview but we were sworn to secrecy about the finer points. This included a PDF that had bullet points listing seven specific plot points that could not be disclosed, as well as a veto on naming the characters certain guest actors are playing. (Fans will already know thatGossip Girlalumna and Brody’s real-life wife Leighton Meester has joined the cast, as hasSeth Rogen.) I couldn’t help but wonder if there are state secrets hidden behind Brody’s beard. Still, in an age of spoilers being posted online as soon as a series has dropped, you can only applaud Netflix’s commitment to the art of surprise.Without giving too much away, I can say this new series will find the couple facing reality. It’s not that the honeymoon is over – the chemistry between Brody and Bell is as engaging as ever – but now the romantic reunion is done, they must get on with the day-to-day challenges of a relationship with differing cultures, religions and friends.One of the strengths of this show from the beginning was the brilliant supporting cast, most notably Joanne’s sister Morgan (Justine Lupe in a career-best role), Noah’s brother Sasha (Veep’s Timothy Simons) and sister-in-law Esther (Jackie Tohn). So it’s a pleasure to see each of them get more screen time. Fresh from finding out her husband had been platonically texting “whore number two”, Esther gets a chance to show some vulnerability and expand on the slightly 2D depiction of battle-axe wife we saw in season one.As the two families start to blend, the upshot is that different members of the cast get to interact with one another. I would happily watch a spin-off that consists entirely of Noah talking to Joanne’s newly out and self-obsessed father. The writers even manage to give Morgan and Noah’s mother a scene together. By the time half the family are squashed in a shed in episode three, you find yourself wishing it was 2008 and we got 24 episodes a year.Here’s hoping Netflix delivers season three in record time – and starts commissioning other smart, heartstopping romantic comedies. Everybody wants more of this.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But then a ska cover taught me life doesn’t have to be serious all the timeRhys ThomasSat 18 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareMy anxious disposition means I think about death a lot. But a cluster of people I loved dying in 2023, and most of them unexpectedly and within a few months of each other, was enough to shake my nervous system up pretty significantly. Five funerals is too many. The first was my nan: she was the family matriarch. The oldest person in the family, so there was a level of acceptance among the sadness. But soon after it was her son, and then her granddaughter (my cousin). The latter two were shocks, completely upending my nervous system, one compounding the other. From there, two more followed. Death was all around. It wasn’t just a part of life by that point – it was something to expect soon and often.At first I seemed fine. Despite concerned friends and partners asking if I was hiding anything, I didn’t think I was. But soon I retreated from fun, becoming very fixated on things like my resting heart rate and body fat percentage. I skipped social events for high-intensity interval training sessions followed by the sauna followed by meditation – not a bad thing, but not a balance, either. I cut out caffeine, including dark chocolate. When I didn’t stick to my new routine, I would have a panic attack, which I’d assume was a heart attack, which would lead to more frequent episodes of panic.I was suffering from grief-based panic disorder, as well as a high dose of health anxiety. Something in my mind had switched my nervous system into overdrive, and left me believing that impending disaster was around every corner; that I was constantly on a tightrope of mortality. Then, at the fourth wake, a song came on that managed to help me heal and reframe my entire world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They helped me form my opinions on everything from fashion to politics. For the two-tone ska band, this song is on the cheesier side – a good stretch away from bleak socio-critical tracks such as Rat Race or Ghost Town.In fact, as an angsty teenager it was the only song I didn’t like by the Specials. But when it came on, hearing the jovial and rough sound of the Specials was enough to lift my spirits. As I continued to listen to the song, the a simple switch flipped inside me. I realised that I was living a life set up to be miserable and fearful. The chorus painted a better picture: “The years go by, as quickly as you wink / Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it’s later than you think”.My cultural awakening: Ratatouille helped me overcome my insomniaRead moreLife doesn’t have to be serious all the time; it doesn’t have to be drastic. The future doesn’t need to be the extreme version that I worry will occur. On a psychological level, the song acted as a mantra which I used to snap out of the spirals and neurotic fixations that kept building up. It said quite simply “enjoy yourself” – and I listened. It cautioned that life is precious and fleeting, and that I was wasting it.I did at one point push the balance too far the other way – said yes to too much, stayed out too late, definitely spent too much money – but it was better than being stuck in a cycle of doom. Better still is the balance I am striking now. Today, enjoying myself, in the song’s words, means being in touch with myself and my needs; saying yes and saying no. Not feeling guilty for lying on the couch once in a while. My disposition berates me into being disciplined and self-critical, and this song helps me to let go. I’ve even quit jobs and moved countries since. All in all, I regret very little.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

If only my TV obsession had ended a long time agoSat 18 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 12.49 EDTShareIt’s an all-too-familiar feeling. The second series of your favourite TV show has just begun streaming and your mind is full of hopeful expectation. Season one endedsoooperfectly: future plotlines were teased tantalisingly and a main character had – cliffhanger! – been offed (or had they?) In the months since the finale, you were perusing Reddit threads with other hardcores to find some Easter egg clues illuminating what would happen next.And then season two’s premiere is a damp squib. It feels like the entire writers’ room has been fired and replaced by artificial intelligence. Cut to the second episode, and your favourite cast member has done something that you and Reddit user Fishy2345 agree is totally out of character. By episode five, it’s clear that the showrunners have had collective amnesia around the storylines aggressively signposted in season one. And by the disappointing finale, you silently wish that the show had just been cancelled.Wishing for cancellation can only be retrospective; most fans protest when their favourite shows are canned before they can get off the ground. Take Kaos, a delightfully satirical take on Greek mythology featuring Jeff Goldblum,which was binned by Netflixdue to low viewing figures. But perhaps these fans will rest better with the knowledge that their enjoyment of the series won’t have been muddied by a sophomore slump.Looking back at the horror-mystery show Yellowjackets, I now wish it had been a limited series. Season one had acreatively abundant premise, and its 10 episodes were note-perfect. In 1996, a plane carrying an all-girl high school football team crashes in the middle of nowhere. Top-notch cast members (including Juliette Lewis, Lauren Ambrose and Sophie Thatcher) portrayed the team then and now. There were multiple award nominations, and the showrunners proudly announced there would befive seasonsto tell the story in necessary detail. But last week, it was announced that it would end withseason four. And as a fan, I let out a sigh of relief.View image in fullscreenGaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp in the forthcoming fifth season of Stranger Things.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe show has made narrative choices that have undermined its heart. Rather than leading with the girls’ return home and watching how they deal with their horrific new secrets, we were taken in directions that bloated the original premise. That included the show’s tiring habit of bringing in and focusing on new characters (such as Shauna’s two-dimensional daughter Callie) who did nothing for the broader story. It’s frustrating, and as a viewer, it is depressing to see your favourite show morph slowly into a hate-watch.But it’s not only Yellowjackets. Shows such as Emily in Paris, House of the Dragon, Squid Game and Stranger Things have lost the shock of the new, and fallen headfirst into expected or comfortable cliches. Sometimes shows need to quit when they are ahead.The thing is, there are joys to be had in a limited, “one-and-done” series. From Sharp Objects to I May Destroy You to Adolescence, TV creators know when to stop when the story has naturally reached an endpoint. But the game is over when shows such as Big Little Lies, originally a limited series, come back for more and more with diminishing returns. Hopefully, Adolescence’s producers have thought twice about thatrumoured season two.I wish Yellowjackets could have been a one-and-done series, living rent-free in our imaginations, cliffhangers and all. My favourite TV show of all time has played out like that. My So-Called Life, the perfect 90s teen dramedy, lasted for only one season but was cinematic in its scope: its characters were difficult and contradictory, the cinematography was perfectly autumnal, and the dialogue was untethered from the normal “teen speak written by a 35-year-old” trope. Its final episode was bitterly unresolved, but that is perfectly in keeping with the reality of never having real, definitive answers to the open-ended questions from your teenage years. After 18 perfect episodes (and one dodgy one), I was heartbroken and took to writing season two fan fiction myself to answer some of those questions. It might only live on an old hard drive, but it speaks to how deeply TV shows can chime with us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m lucky to be alive because of organisations like amfAR,” the foundation’s incoming CEO, Kyle Clifford, said.“I had an Aids diagnosis, and nobody in my life knew that until recently, including my family. But I decided when I took on this role that I would come out about my diagnosis so that people who are HIV-positive know that the person leading the organisation is 100% committed. I live it every day.”View image in fullscreenJoely Richardson hosts the amfAR London 2025 gala in London.Photograph: Lia Toby/Getty for amfARAmfAR galas are known as some of the most lavish parties on the international social calendar, bringing together celebrities and philanthropists to raise money for biomedical research. Figures like Jeff Bezos and Leonardo DiCaprio are regulars in Cannes, while Richard Gere and Eva Longoria attended the Venice event.Now, amfAR is bringing a slice of that glamour to the UK having hosted its inaugural London gala at the luxury Chancery Rosewood hotel on Friday to coincide with the arts fairFriezeand the BFI London film festival.To mark the occasion, it honoured the artistTracey Eminwith a special award.“We believe London could 100% compete with Cannes and Venice,” Clifford said. “The interest we’ve received this week since being in town from different generations has been tremendous.“It became obvious very quickly that honouring Dame Tracey Emin was the most authentic way of expressing London’s DNA. Not only is she one of the most creative female contemporary artists, but she’s also been a voice for the voiceless, and a supporter of [the fight against] HIV and Aids since the late 80s.”The London gala was hosted by the actorJoely Richardson, with musical performances from Grace Jones and Jess Glynne. This year, amfAR raised $17m (£12.7m) at the Cannes gala, $3.4m in Venice and $3.1m in Dallas.Clifford said: “HIV is still a global health issue. At the moment, you have around 42 to 44 million people living in the world with HIV. Over 10 million of those do not have access to medication that can keep them alive. That’s like the whole population of London.”View image in fullscreenGrace Jones performs on stage.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockHe said the organisation had “big plans for growth” in the capital. “We want to make amfAR the biggest event at Frieze, and hopefully the biggest event in the city. We’re going to have over 300 people in the room for the inaugural event.”AmfAR was formed in 1985 by the actor Elizabeth Taylor and the research scientist Mathilde Krim, among others. “They realised there was an opportunity during major artistic events to bring everyone together for a good cause. I always say people come for the party and stay for the cause,” Clifford said.“We’re in Palm Beach around March. Then we go to Cannes, then Venice, then Dallas, now we’re in London, and we’ll finish out the year in Vegas. We have raised nearly a billion dollars for our research programmes and awarded more than 3,800 grants to research teams worldwide. I believe London can bring us closer to a cure.”Explore more on these topicsCultureLondonAids and HIVGrace JonesJoely RichardsonJess GlynneTracey EminfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s as if the company sensed that a sucker who’d spend thousands of dollars on plastic toys and electronic games had just entered the world. Actually, it’s as if the company had sensed that an entiregenerationof fools like me was about to enter the world. Which is true. That was the time to strike. We were about to be drained of every dollar we received for birthdays, Christmases and all those times our dad didn’t want us to tell our mom about something. (Maybe that last one’s just me.)Despite being slightly older than the NES, a horror I’m only now forced to face as I write this, it felt like that console had always existed in my life. I don’t have many memories from my baby years because I was too busy learning how to use my hands and eyes, but as far back as I can actually remember, “Nintendo” was a word synonymous with video games. Friends would ask if you had Nintendo (no “the”, no “a”) at your house the same way they might ask if you had Coca-Cola in the fridge.View image in fullscreenPac-Man on the Nintendo Entertainment System.Photograph: ArcadeImages/AlamyMy sister and I spent two years begging our parents to get the NES. My mom and dad weren’t concerned about the corrupting influence of video games – that would come later with Doom, Mortal Kombat and of course Stardew Valley – but they were definitely concerned about purchasing an expensive toy that only works if you buy additional expensive toys to put inside of it. Yes, the Nintendo Entertainment System was advertised in the US as an advanced piece of technology despite looking like a rejected design for a VHS cassette player, but we all knew it was meant to beplayedwith. Whereas touching my dad’s home theater resulted in a lot of yelling, this was finally an electronic device that we children were allowed to use.It’s also worth mentioning that I’m in the first generation that completely missed the Atari home consoles that dominated earlier in the 80s. Even though Atari systems were still around at the time, kids my age talked about them with the same historical distance we talked about the second world war. Even seeing an Atari felt like catching a glimpse of an ancient artefact that none of us understood well enough to enjoy. Watching a neighbour turn on their Atari was almost shocking to me: the basketball game literally used a square for the ball. No. No, no thank you. I need to sit down for a second.But the NES – oh, the NES had graphics that actually looked like the arcade games. Was it perfect? Of course not! Some of them look downright terrible now! But when you’re five years old, an accurate but slightly washed out version of Pac-Man is still Pac-Man. While my parents never let me play shooting galleries at carnivals (who’s to say why?), Duck Hunt was the next best thing. No! Better! Because we all realised almost instantly that we could just press that stupid plastic gun to the screen and nail it every time. This is a point-blank technique that you can only learn from a 40-year-old video game or by becoming a mafia hitman.The games on the NES also felt so much more open.Super MarioBros seems quaint now, but the first time that plumber went down that pipe? My mind melted down into a finer, purer substance. These were games with worlds full of surprises and mysteries. Secrets and Easter eggs had been planted in games before, but now it felt as if they weremeantto be found. They were there to help you, not as a kind of maddening inside joke for the developers. We were exploring fictional kingdoms that almost, kind of,sort oflooked like living cartoons, jumping around to find hidden, invisible “?” boxes.View image in fullscreen‘The games felt so much more open’… a NES.Photograph: Gary Hider/AlamyLet’s not forget that the NES brought us Mario in the guise we know and love him. Yeah, he’d been a construction worker trying to take down Donkey Kong. Fortunately, he switched careers to plumbing and became a character that would soon adorn every folder, every backpack, every lunchbox, every flask and every bedsheet that I and most of my friends owned. Nintendo was an inside language, long before all references became internet memes seen by billions. We constantly quoted the original Legend of Zelda: “It’s dangerous to go alone!

But the commodification ofPierre-Auguste Renoirand his fellow impressionist painters has been missing something.Renoir was an accomplished draftsman who produced a distinguished but largely unheralded collection of drawings, pastels, watercolours and prints.More than a hundred of these works are now on display in a new show,Renoir Drawings, at the Morgan Library & Museum inNew York. Tracing the entire arc of the artist’s life and career, it is the first exhibition in more than 100 years devoted entirely to Renoir’s works on paper.The French Impressionists rediscovered: ‘They didn’t know their works would be masterpieces’Read more“Because they are works on paper, they are not exhibited permanently in any institution,” saysColin Bailey, director of the Morgan and curator of the show.“Having access to watercolours and pastels and red chalk and white chalk expands your knowledge of the artist. While these will seem very Renoir-esque, they will be less familiar.“Also, because we are showing his work decade by decade, you get a real sense of how he develops and the different stylistic moments in his career.”Born in Limoges in south-western France in 1841, Renoirgrew up in Parisand began his career decorating porcelain. He fell under the influence of Gustave Courbet and met fellow artists such asClaude Monetand Alfred Sisley – figures who would later help defineimpressionism. By 1869, Renoir was painting alongside Monet on the banks of the Seine, experimenting with a brighter palette and a lighter touch that hinted at the new style to come.View image in fullscreenLandscape, Autumnal Effect, ca 1885–86.Photograph: Collection of David LachenmannThe oil paintingLa Loge (The Theatre Box), shown at the first impressionist group exhibition in Paris in 1874, andLuncheon of the Boating Party(1880-81) have become star attractions of the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and the Phillips Collection in Washington, respectively.Bailey, one of the world’s leading Renoir scholars, says:“It was a struggle at the beginning. They all had a language that now is so beloved and familiar but it was initially highly transgressive: the high tone, the visible brushwork, even the subject matter from contemporary life.“At the same time we see in the show, after he’s able to travel to Italy and returns in the 1880s, he becomes less interested in Parisian social life, more interested in the female nude, where he is undoubtedly one of the great exponents, and this comforting world of young women, of families, his own family, where it’s a very Arcadian image of a world detached from the struggles of urban life. That is one of the reasons why he is so appealing to an audience.”View image in fullscreenStudy for Dance in the Country, 1883.Photograph: Yale University Art GalleryBut works on paper lie at the heart of his artistic practice, influencing the paintings for which he is best known. Renoir Drawings, presented in collaboration with theMusée d’Orsayin Paris – where the exhibition will travel next year – brings together early anatomical sketches, lively glimpses of Parisian and rural life, refined pastel portraits of his circle and illustrations made for literary works such as Émile Zola’s L’Assommoir.Bailey explains: “As the show developed, we were trying to both represent the range of his works on paper in different media – not only pencil and crayon, but also pastel and watercolour – then also to try and do this as a chronological survey, from the early few academic drawings as a student to the late works, and then finally to make constellations around certain major pictures for which preparatory and related drawings exist.”At its core, the exhibition explores a pivotal moment in Renoir’s career – his renewed engagement with preparatory drawing – when he developed extensive series of studies that laid the groundwork for his ambitious, large-scale compositions.Dance in the Country(1883) andThe Great Bathers(1886-87) are featured alongside their related sketches and figure studies, providing a rare chance to see painting and preparatory material reunited.Indeed, this is the first time the painting The Great Bathers will be shown inNew York. Its loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art was made possible by a recent change in lending restrictions.Bailey says: “Until now, if you wanted to study the gestation and the growth and the genesis of that large, important and beautiful painting, you had to go to Philadelphia. This is extremely generous of the Philadelphia museum. But it’s now lucky for us that a change of restrictions has allowed us to bring all of the large drawings around The Great Bathers, including the drawing that was given to us in 2018.”It was The Great Bathers that proved the catalyst for the show. In 2018, when the Morgan trustee Drue Heinzdied aged 103, the museum was invited to choose a work from her collection. It selected Renoir’s monumental red-and-white chalk preparatory drawing for The Great Bathers.“Her estate was very happy for us to have this and this spurred the possibility of doing a full-scale retrospective of his works on paper,” Bailey says.View image in fullscreenStudy for The Great Bathers, ca 1886-87.Photograph: The Morgan Library & MuseumAmong other standout works in Renoir Drawings are delicate pastel portraits such as Portrait of a Girl (Elisabeth Maître) (1879), borrowed from Vienna’s Albertina museum. There are also intimate late-period studies of Renoir’s wife, Aline, and their young sons, capturing familial warmth with characteristic sensitivity.For Bailey, mounting his first exhibition as a curator since becoming director 10 years ago, a personal favourite isRenoir’s pastel portraitof his friend and fellow artist Paul Cézanne. He says: “With Cézanne, he’s deeply connected from the beginning. Renoir travels to L’Estaque to work with Cézanne. He admires him.“He and [Edgar] Degas are very good friends as well, except at one point because Renoir sells a pastel that had been given to him by Degas because he’s in need of some money. Degas is so angry that he returns a Renoir to Renoir and they don’t speak for a couple of years. These artists are very close in the late 1860s and 1870s and some of them remain close throughout their careers.”The exhibition concludes with the plaster sculptureThe Judgement of Paris (1914), created in collaboration with sculptorRichard Guinoafter arthritis severely limited Renoir’s use of his hands, which he was forced to bandage. For Bailey, it is a demonstration of Renoir’s resilience and resourcefulness.“Arthritis doesn’t stop him from painting ambitious large nudes and landscapes and the mastery in some of these late drawings is complete. In a way, like Monet’s cataracts and Degas’s blindness, artists have a sort of muscle memory and they can continue to create.View image in fullscreenThe Judgment of Paris, 1914.Photograph: Rene-Gabriel Ojeda/Photography by René-Gabriel Ojéda“In Renoir’s case, he certainly couldn’t model plaster or marble but through his designs and his guidance for Guino, he was able to create very beautiful sculpture. We have a suite of drawings that relate both to the sculpture and the painting that is also part of that series. In some ways drawing for him almost transcends media at the end. He can work in sculpture, he can work in paint, he can work in chalks and it’s the same world.”The last comprehensive exhibition devoted to Renoir’s drawings was at theGalerie Durand-Ruelin Paris in 1921. Bailey believes there will be much to learn. “Drawings help you see the germ of ideas,” he says. “They also help you see the artist at work and because they’re fragile, because they’re either in museum storage or in private collections, they’re not constantly visible.“I’m hoping that this chance will amplify people’s understanding of Renoir’s productivity and they will see what an interesting and accomplished artist he is in different media on paper, not just charcoal but also these beautiful watercolours that will come as a surprise to people because they seem like very much likeMatisseandBonnardbefore their time.”Renoir Drawings is on display at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York until 8 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsPierre-Auguste RenoirExhibitionsDrawingSculptureArtNew YorkMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A reasonable reaction since not so long ago I was shopping on crutches following a hip replacement. My sister’s friends were more concerned: “How old are you? 80? I don’t think this is a good idea. You’ll fall and break something.” My brother, Andrew, 86, decided it was better not to tell anyone.For at least two decades I’d had a half-buried wish to experience one more ski trip. A final fix of blue sky, frosty air and the exhilaration that comes with finding yourself still intact at the bottom of a snow-covered slope. I was never much good, and hadn’t skied for decades, but that wasn’t the point. At 83, I needed to see if I could still do it. And if I could do it, how about inviting my sister, Kate, one-third of our Old Crones group who encourage each other to do parkrun each week? Then I remembered that, as teenagers, Andrew had joined me on my first ski holiday. That was 67 years ago, but Andrew used to be quite good, so I invited him too. My friend Penny, who is so absurdly young (67, so she says) that she doesn’t really count, was also allowed to come and try her luck with the oldies and practise her German. We all made an effort to get as fit as possible, but none of us had skied for at least 40 years.View image in fullscreenSeefeld, in Tirol nearInnsbruck, was our chosen destination, as it offers a variety of winter activities – assuming we’d survive our two-hour lesson on the first day (which, to be honest, was all the downhill skiing we had planned) – and is wonderfully free of après-ski malarky. It attracts families rather than partying youngsters, and is typically Austrian, with onion-domed churches and chalet-type houses. Our base was the friendly, family-runHotel Helgaand we ate at a different restaurant each evening.“We call thisKaiserwetter,” said Janina, our guide, when I remarked we couldn’t believe our luck at waking each morning to cloudless skies, warm sun and plenty of snow for early March. We were all pretending just to be excited, not worried at all, as we took a bus to the ski area. It was full of young people and families carrying skis and glowing with vitality. I thought I caught the young man helping us with our boot and ski hire rolling his eyes at the challenge.I was sure I’d fall over as soon as I moved. But I didn’t. None of us didOur instructor Ulrich, who had been pre-warned of our ages, smiled bravely as we stomped towards him. We were talking a bit too loudly, smiling too broadly, perhaps trying to postpone the moment when we had to clamp our feet on to the skis. Inwardly, I was sure I’d fall over as soon as I moved. But I didn’t. None of us did. Ulrich was very patient, giving us enough time at each stage of the lesson to gain in confidence.View image in fullscreenHilary Bradt (right) with her brother Andrew and sister KateModern skis are much easier to manage, I discovered – shorter, lighter and rounded at the front – than the long, cumbersome things I remember from the 60s that always made me fall off the ski lift. We knew we would not be trusted on a lift of any sort, so assumed we would laboriously herringbone up the hill and slide down, falling over in the process. That’s how it was in 1958. But here there was a wonderful new device, a “travelator”, or moving walkway, that conveyed us effortlessly to the top of the gentle beginners’ slope, which was cluttered with fearless children. We were the only adults.Two hours later, we hadn’t even fallen, had all managed some decent snowplough turns and even a sort of parallel turn. We were euphoric. “That was just amazing!” said Andrew, who isn’t given to hyperbole.Could we have managed a whole week of skiing? Possibly, but the variety of activities Seefeld offered was more enticing. There were hikes around various lakes, buses giving us access to ridiculously picturesque villages, and the “winter hike to the Hämmermoosalm, 4.6km (and sled back down)”, as the information pack casually described it.Having watched the Winter Olympics, Kate and I knew all about sledding. You run behind, pushing the sled, then leap on and hurtle down on your belly at speeds rivalling a Formula One car. Janina was reassuring. Nothing to worry about: we’d sit on the sled and steer with our feet. But we did worry. Andrew decided it wasn’t for him but we three plugged on.View image in fullscreenHilary Bradt hits the slopesAs a 12-year-old it had been tiring hauling my father’s homemade toboggan up Gold Hill common in Buckinghamshire in our snowy childhood, and as an 83-year-old it was tiring hauling an admittedly lighter toboggan uphill in oxygen-depleted air (Hämmermoosalm, a traditional alpine mountain hut and farm with dining rooms, is at 1,410 metres) for nearly 3 miles (5km). I lagged behind, muttering to myself about being too old for this. The glühwein andGulaschsuppe(goulash) in warm sunshine at the restaurant at the top were restorative, but the descent couldn’t be postponed for ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I followed cautiously, getting off to pull the toboggan over bare gravel and mud, but soon realised I was wearing a broad grin: it was exhilarating. Halfway down I thought I’d wait and take an action photo of Kate. A man in a scarlet onesie skidded by, shouting something over his shoulder that seemed to be to do with Kate. No point in waiting, and I certainly wasn’t going to plod uphill again to check on her. If she were actually dead or injured, surely the chap would have told me?“How did you keep control on those icy bits?” Kate demanded when we finally reassembled at the bottom. “My toboggan hit a bank and I was thrown off. As I lay there swearing, a man stopped, stared at me, and asked: ‘How old are you?’ I walked the rest of the way.”In contrast, cross-country skiing delighted everyone: no slopes, no feeling of helplessness.Family ski trips are etched deep in my memory. So I took my grandkids to the snowRead moreWe also did some proper hikes around lakes with views of pines and snowy peaks, and tried the localswimming pool and sauna. Having never had a sauna before, I thought I ought to give it a go. It was all very strange and a bit alarming, with mixed-sex naked saunas the order of the day. I hired a towelling dressing gown and went exploring. In an apparently empty room, opaque with very hot steam, I sat down gingerly in my nakedness and took in my surroundings. It was like peering through a sweltering old-fashioned London fog, but I could just make out alcoves around the walls occupied by ghostly Greek-style statues. Rather impressive. Then one moved.On our last day, after plenty of adrenaline-fuelled experiences, we finally began behaving like sensible pensioners, opting for a carriage ride, wrapped in rugs behind two enormous grey horses that clip-clopped through the still snow-covered landscape. And sampled the local cuisine and drank plenty of glühwein, of course.What a wonderful, eye-opening and adventurous four days it had been. On the back of the Old Crones’ T-shirts is the message: “We do because we can”. Unless you try it, you don’t know what you can do.The trip was provided byVisit TirolandSeefeld.

I also love marshmallow root tea, which is great for the mucous membranes.”Try the carrot trick!Tailor your food-based remedy to the type of cough you have. “For a dry, tickly cough, honey in warm tea – lemon or peppermint – is very soothing,” says José. “Another remedy I’ve always liked is shredding carrots, covering them with sugar and leaving them overnight in the fridge. By morning they release a sweet syrup; a spoonful coats the throat and helps calm down an irritating cough.” For a chesty cough, “warm liquorice root tea and foods with bromelain such as fresh pineapple may help reduce mucus thickness”.Get the juices flowingEmeritusprof Ron Eccles,former director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University, goes for warm foods. “Anything tasty such as tomato soup, chicken soup or a curry – I like chicken tikka bhuna – promotes salivation and mucus secretions in the airway and helps to soothe a cough. You could also suck a lozenge as this has a similar demulcent [irritation-relieving] effect and makes you swallow, which inhibits the cough reflex.” Macciochi takes a similar approach. She says: “I lean on warm broths with garlic, ginger and shiitake mushrooms, which are rich in immune-supportive compounds and easy to digest.”When you have ...a stinking coldTurn to turmericAsma Khan, chef and owner ofDarjeeling Express in London, says: “My mother gave me haldi doodh, or turmeric milk, as a child and it’s still my go-to. The curcumin in turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory, and when you combine it with the fats in warm milk, it becomes much more bioavailable [easily absorbed]. It’s not some trendy wellness drink to me – it’s what my family has used for generations to soothe a sore chest and ease the body back into balance. Bring a mug of full‑fat milk to the boil, let it cool slightly, then stir in one teaspoon of ground turmeric. Drink warm before bed.”Whip up brothSpecialist dietitianSophie Medlinfocuses on “soft, nourishing foods. Soups are great; ideally a blend of different vegetables cooked in bone broth for protein and nutrients. We also want some additional protein, so some shredded roasted chicken or tofu.” José tucks in to a bowl ofcanja,“a traditional Portuguese soup that my family always made when someone was sick. It’s prepared with chicken, rice and a light golden broth, garlic and finished with fresh mint. The chicken provides protein for repair, the rice is gentle on the stomach and provides energy from carbohydrates, the broth is hydrating, the garlic antibacterial, and the mint acts as a natural decongestant.”Thomasina Miers, co-founder ofWahacaand author ofMexican Table(Quadrille, £28) also loves broth. “I findAsian brothparticularly soothing, with its garlic and ginger and a few grains of rice. I often go to the butcher’s purely to buy bones for stock and will roast the bones while using the oven for something else. We have a roast chicken once a fortnight, so I rescue bones from everyone’s plates for the stockpot. The flavour and goodness is transformative.”Not a broth fan? “I crave warming, easy-to-digest meals such as soups with orange veggies like pumpkin, rich in beta-carotene, a form of vitamin A, which supports immune function, and spices such as turmeric to regulate inflammation,” Macciochi says.Sip soothing teasJosé drinks plenty of water and “warm tea with strips of lemon peel, turmeric and manuka honey before bed. The lemon helps relieve congestion and adds a little vitamin C, turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties, and honey soothes the throat while offering antiviral and antibacterial effects, particularly manuka honey.” Macciochi says she prioritises hydration, vitamin C and zinc-rich foods to support her immune system. “I’ll often make a citrus and ginger shot with lemon, orange, grated ginger, and a pinch of cayenne and black pepper.”When you have ...a nasty sore throatCold comfortFor Medlin, “smoothies can feel soothing. I would use frozen mixed berries and kefir for bonus gut health benefits.”Eccles recommends “ice‑cream or an ice lolly to soothe the pain and irritation of a sore throat”. José agrees that “soft ice-cream can numb the throat and give some relief”, while dietitianPriya Tewlikes “plain Greek yoghurt, as it can be cooling and soothing”.Raid the tea (and booze) cupboardWarm drinks also get lots of votes. Medlin is “a fan of hot honey and lemon as the honey can have antiseptic qualities and lemons have vitamin C, which can help to shorten the duration of a virus”.Macciochi likes “awarm herbal tea with marshmallow root, honey and slippery elm, which helps coat the throat”.Meanwhile, Miers says: “Hot toddies are our mainstay for a sore throat – with honey and lemon for the children and glugs of whisky for us.”Stick to softJosé focuses on textures that heal. “When my throat hurts, I stick to soft foods such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and smoothies, as they go down easily without scratching or irritating the tissue.”Sip on spicesKhan, on the other hand, rustles up a strong masala chai with fresh ginger and crushed black pepper. “The warmth of the tea soothes the throat, but the ginger and pepper do the real work – increasing circulation, clearing the sinuses and helping fight off infection. In a pestle and mortar, grind four or five cardamom pods, three or four cloves and a quarter of a teaspoon of black peppercorns. Add to a pan with a grating of fresh ginger (to taste), one mug of full-fat milk and half a mug of water. Add two teaspoons of loose black tea. Bring just to the boil, then strain and drink hot.”When you have ...a bout of fluFocus on fluidsEccles says it can be difficult to eat anything at first. “During flu I often have little appetite and lack energy, so I have energy drinks, coffee and tea to pick me up and get going.” Macciochi sips “coconut water or an electrolyte-rich herbal tea for hydration”, followed by “clear bone broth or veggie broth with garlic, miso and greens, when I can tolerate them”. José goes back to his staple, canja, “along with warm lemon tea with manuka honey”. He  reiterates that “hydration is absolutely essential”.A bowl of comfort“Flu knocks you out,” says Khan, “so I always want khichdi, the ultimate comfort food. It’s gentle, nourishing and easy to digest. Made with rice, moong dal [mung beans], a little turmeric and a touch of ghee, it gives your body the fuel it needs without overwhelming the system. It’s soft, warm and full of love. Wash half a cup of rice and half a cup of moong dal. In a heavy pan, combine with four cups of water, half a teaspoon of turmeric and a pinch of salt. Simmer until the grains soften and break down to a porridge-like consistency. In a small pan, heat one teaspoon of ghee, and add half a teaspoon cumin seeds and a little grated ginger. Stir into the khichdi and serve warm.”Strength-building suppersOnce you’re ready to eat, it’s time to get your strength back. Medlin knocks up “a pasta bake with plenty of veg and some protein such as chicken or cheese, which means you have something to reheat easily when you start to have an appetite again. The more veg, the better, as different vegetables have different benefits in terms of vitamins and antioxidants.” For Eccles, it’s all about “foods to build me up, such as porridge and tasty meat stews with lamb or beef, and plenty of vegetables such as carrots, onions or potatoes”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Then I build it up slowly, eating drier, plainer foods such as crackers.” She adds that it’s worth avoiding dairy for a few days, “as it can make you feel more nauseous and sometimes the body can struggle more with it after a bug”.Brews to sootheSimilarly, Macciochi stops eating and focuses on fluids at first, “cooled ginger tea or plain water with a pinch of sea salt and a splash of apple cider vinegar”. Dr Emily Leeming, a scientist, dietitian and author ofGenius Gut(Penguin, £18.99) agrees that “staying hydrated is important, so I’ll sip water or herbal teas. If I’m feeling nauseous, ginger tea can help to settle the stomach.” While for Khan, “the only thing I trust is ajwain [carom seed] tea, or sometimes saunf [fennel seed] tea. Both seeds are used in Ayurveda [an Indian holistic system of medicine] for digestion. For either tea, boil a teaspoon of the seeds in one and a half cups of water for five minutes, strain and sip slowly while still warm.”Nibble cautiouslyOnce over the worst, Leeming says: “I tend to focus on eating very plain foods such as toast, rice or bananas, a little but often. They’re gentle on the gut, give some energy without being too heavy and provide some nutrition to help support your body on the mend.” Medlin also keeps it bland with “toast, oatcakes, rice cakes and fruit purees – any fruit will do”. For Khan, “once things settle a bit, I eat some plain rice with yoghurt, but no spices. It’s about letting the healing happen gently.”Restore your microbiome“Once I’m up and about again, over the course of a day or so, I start adding back in foods for my gut microbiome,” says Leeming. “Live yoghurt or kefir and fibre-rich foods such as oats and stewed apples can be a gentle start, working up to adding in a range of different-coloured fruit and veg, whole grains and a handful of nuts and seeds.” Medlin also aims to recover gut health by “getting plenty of plants back into my diet; soups and smoothies can feel like an easier way to do this”.When you have ...a splitting headacheMagnesium-rich morsels“Cluster-headache patients are typically unable to eat during an attack – it would be akin to asking what I’d like to eat when a hot steel rod is being driven into my eyeball,” says Tom Zeller Jr, author ofThe Headache(Mariner, £22). “That said, during a period when the attacks are coming, but between individual headaches, I gravitate toward green vegetables – particularly spinach – peanuts, bran cereals and other foods rich in magnesium, which someevidencesuggests might be helpful in reducing attacks. That’s not to suggest supplementation with magnesium is a cure, but any potential port in a storm, as they say.”When you have ... general lurgyPut fire in your bellyWhen feeling generally run down, chefAnna Jones’s cure-all “fire honey” comes into its own. “It’s pleasing, bright-orange sunshine in a jar,” she says. “Peel the zest of a lemon and an orange, finely chop a red chilli and 50g ginger, add the lot to half a pot of good-quality, runny honey. Grate 30g of fresh turmeric into the honey (or a tablespoon of ground turmeric) and mix. It can sit in your fridge for up to two weeks and see you through the whole winter.” When you need a boost, “pop a tablespoon in a mug and top it up with hot water. You could add an extra slice of lemon or orange, too.”Spice up your lifeMiers keeps a spicy remedy on hand all winter. “I make a fire cider and put it in the fridge,” she says. “It’s a simple ferment I learned about in Mexico, which helps gut health and is deliciously thirst-quenching. Essentially, you flavour vinegar with ginger, chilli and your favourite seasonings – I love rosemary and star anise – then sweeten with honey or agave, and add sparkling water. For one 400ml jar, finely slice two jalapeño chillies, a thumb-sized piece of ginger and another of fresh turmeric (optional). Place in a sterilised jar with two rosemary sprigs, a cinnamon stick, two tablespoons of honey, the zest and juice of an orange, and 350ml of apple cider vinegar. Leave in the fridge for at least a week – the health benefits peak after three weeks – and the vinegar will last for six months in the fridge.”And once you’re feeling better ...Once on the road to recovery, Macciochi focuses on “rebuilding strength and supporting my gut – think slow-cooked stews, fermented foods such as sauerkraut or kefir, and plenty of colourful plants”. José takes a similar approach. “I return to a balanced diet with a good amount of protein (for example, eggs) to support healing. If antibiotics are needed, I bring in probiotic foods such as natural yoghurt or kefir to help restore gut balance.” Tew, meanwhile, picks soups. “I make a vegetable and lentil soup, but if you’ve had the flu you aren’t likely to have the energy to make soup, so a shop‑bought one would be fine,” she says.When you have ...a stinking hangoverJuice, water- then a fridge raid!When the malady is more self-induced, Miers first loads up on vitamin-rich liquids. “Celery, parsley and apple is the green juice of choice in Mexico, and it always makes me feel better. They add cactus and pineapple – local ingredients over there – but I sub in ginger for some fire and oomph. Then it’s lots of water, a good strong coffee and, when I can face it, grilled sourdough with a fried egg, crispy chickpeas, a few leaves, a grating of good cheese, and chilli oil normally does the trick – and whatever other delicious things I have in the fridge.”Explore more on these topicsFoodHealth & wellbeingHealthVegetablesSoupChickenCurryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today’s test confirmed my conviction that knowing where your food comes from is among the most effective actions consumers can take. This means buying from farmers’ markets, butchers or directly from farms (online or in person). Some supermarkets also now work with independent family farms to provide better levels of transparency (although, do beware of fake farms, because somesupermarkets have been known to make up fictional brands).The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.After roasting today’s chickens, it was abundantly clear to me that birds from independent family farms are leagues above supermarket own-brand chickens, even organic ones. It’s generally accepted that properly slow-grown, free-range and organic chickens develop firmer, more flavourful meat from the exercise they get by scratching around outdoors. Feed matters, too: pasture, herb and corn-fed birds have much more complex flavours and often sweeter, more buttery flesh.I roasted all the birds, seasoned simply with sea salt and sunflower oil, on a high heat at first for colour, then low and slow to finish. I then rested them under clean tea towels for at least 10 minutes, to ensure maximum tenderness.I tasted the breast and leg meat from each bird, not least because the latter is far more succulent and characterful; the breast, meanwhile, tends to be pretty neutral in flavour.The chicken’s raw condition is probably the clearest marker of quality: dry, blemish-free skin not only signals good welfare and careful handling, but also roasts to a rich, golden finish. Nearly all the best birds arrived dry and pristine. By contrast, chickens that were damp with red marks, excess feathers or wrinkled skin often betray poor treatment, rushed processing and evidence of “plumping” (water injected to inflate weight), all of which often mean more disappointing results.The tasting spanned price points from £6 a kg for entry-level free-range up to £11 a kilo for premium organics. But price isn’t everything: ultimately, slow-grown, pasture-raised and transparently farmed chickens were superior in flavour and condition, and often better value than premium supermarket options. Which is yet more evidence that better farming and good eating go hand in hand.The best supermarket chickenBest overall:Packington free-range medium whole chickenView image in fullscreen£15.84 for 1.75kg at Ocado (£9.05/kg)★★★★☆Slow-grown and with strong transparency onanimal welfareandsustainability. The flavour is outstanding: sweet, rich and umami, and really delicious. The raw condition is blemish-free, with pale-yellow skin, strong yellow fat and dark breast meat.Two-star Great Taste Award, too.Best bargain:Thoughtful Producer free-range whole chickenView image in fullscreen£19.55 for 2.3kg at Ocado (£8.50/kg)★★★★☆A slow-grown chicken raised on open pasture atCopas Farms. A complex, savoury flavour with herbaceous, mineral notes, and nicely presented in a large bag with blemish-free, pale, yellow-white skin and dark-ish breast meat. Farm managementappearsstrong, but I couldn’t identify any published impact targets. Still, excellent value with solid transparency.And the rest …The Black Farmer organic whole chickenView image in fullscreen£22.20 for 2kg at Ocado (£11.10/kg)★★★★☆Reared on small farms with 24-hour access to the outdoors. Cooked, the taste is excellent; raw, the appearance is very clean and blemish-free with yellow skin. Top-of-the-range price, but one that really delivered, which is why this would be my best splurge.Herb Fed free-range whole chickenView image in fullscreen£19.13 for 2.25kg at Ocado (£8.50/kg)★★★★☆Slow-grown in small flocks on Yorkshire pasture with shed access, these birds are fed herb trimmings from a nearby farm. The flavour has a complex, umami depth and creamy texture. Nicely presented raw, too, with moist, blemish-free, pale skin. The farm shows independent, transparent practices. Excellent value for its quality and provenance, andGreat Taste Awards-starred.M&S free-range corn-fed whole chickenView image in fullscreen£14.03 for 1.65kg at Ocado (£8.50/kg)★★★★☆Slow-grown andRSPCAAssured. This caramelised beautifully, and scored very highly on flavour, with distinct depth and a rounded sweetness. It arrived in excellent condition, too, with clean, pale-yellow skin and darkish breast meat.

Sweet, mineral and full-flavoured, with good depth and a buttery texture. Its raw condition was excellent, with clean, corn-yellow and nicely dry skin. A decent price per kilo for a solid roaster in great condition.Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference free-range whole chickenView image in fullscreen£13.28 for 1.7kg at Sainsbury’s (£7.81/kg)★★★☆☆Slow-reared and RSPCA Assured. Site says the chickens are raised in sheds and fields, with access to woodland – a major bonus because it’s the birds’ natural habitat. The flavour has subtle, gamey, mineral notes and a creamy texture. Raw, it has pale, yellow-white skin with a few small blemishes and feathers, but nothing of concern, though it was a bit moist. Overall, good value for the quality.Tesco organic whole chickenView image in fullscreen£15 for 1.5kg at Tesco (£10/kg)★★★☆☆Described on the packaging as “free to roam and play”, which may or may not indicate less outdoor access than standard free-range birds. The flavour is sweet and mineral-rich, while its raw condition featured moist, white skin with a couple of minor blemishes. Greater transparency and clearer provenance would improve confidence, though.Duchy Organic free-range whole chickenView image in fullscreen£12.49 for 1.45kg at Waitrose (£8.62/kg)★★★☆☆Rather scrawny-looking, but with a sweet, mineral and earthy flavour. Its raw condition was excellent – dry, pale-white skin and outstretched legs, suggesting careful hanging. Very expensive for the size, though I’m sure you’ll find better value by selecting a larger bird in store (and with a better meat-to-bone ratio).Asda organic free-range whole chickenView image in fullscreen£14.85 for 1.6kg at Asda (£9.28/kg)★★☆☆☆The flavour is sweet, savoury and full-bodied, but the raw bird was in poor condition, with red blemishes, moist skin and wrinkled patches from the packaging, all of which caused slightly uneven roasting. Disappointing for an organic bird.Explore more on these topicsChickenThe FilterFoodMeatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t have to mean cooking banana peel. To me, it means finishing a bag of potatoes before they grow eyes, and making the most of that last awkward bit of cabbage. Even finding a cheeky new way with the sauces and condiments already in the fridge. Using ingredients you’ve already got to make a new recipe is, in my opinion, the most “no waste” of them all. So here’s permission from me to make substitutes – herb for herb, veg for veg, or anything you’ve already got – to make this recipe work for you.Jacket sweet potato with smoked tofu, slaw and crispy chilli mayoIf you are making substitutes, you could use ordinary firm tofu instead of smoked, a teaspoon of sugar instead of mirin, white cabbage instead of red, any chilli oil instead of the peanut or tofu version (use to taste, because the heat will vary) and any soft herb instead of coriander. Of course, it won’t taste exactly the same, but it will still work well.Prep15 minCook50 minServes44 medium sweet potatoes(1kg)5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 tsp fine sea salt450g smoked tofu, cut into 2cm cubes2 tbsp light soy sauce2 tbsp mirin400g red cabbage(ie, half a small one)Juice of 3 limes, to get 5 tbsp100g mayonnaise, vegan if need be1 tbsp chipotle en adobo4-6 tbsp peanuts in chilli oil, or peanut, kohlrabi and tofu chilli crisp30g fresh coriander, leaves and tender stalks, choppedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Wash the sweet potatoes, put them in a bowl, then rub all over with a tablespoon of the olive oil and a half-teaspoon of sea salt. Put on a baking tray and roast for 25 minutes.In the meantime, put the tofu in a medium bowl, add two tablespoons of oil, the soy sauce and mirin, and toss to coat. When the sweet potatoes have had 25 minutes, add the tofu to the tray and roast both for a further 15 minutes, until the tofu is golden and the sweet potatoes are crisp.Finely slice the red cabbage, put it in the empty tofu bowl, then toss with five tablespoons of lime juice, the last two tablespoons of olive oil and a half-teaspoon of salt. In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise and chipotle.To serve, split open the baked sweet potatoes, spoon a quarter of the tofu mix in each one, then top with a dollop of chipotle mayonnaise and a handful of slaw. Finish with a generous spoonful of peanut chilli crisp and a good sprinkling of coriander.Join Meera Sodha at a specialeventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou Be The Judgelive.

But the prices have made people gulp. I taste-tested all five to find out what is good value – and what’s best to avoidTim JonzeSat 18 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 18 Oct 2025 00.09 EDTShareLike Tesla cars and the ending of the Sopranos, Charlie Bigham ready meals seem to be rather divisive. On the one hand, people clearly love them: about 31m dishes were sold in the past year alone. On the other hand, they generate a heap of mockery. The critique seems to be that only a gullible idiot would shell out up to a tenner on an oven-ready fish pie, chilli con carne or – as one commentator once memorably labelled it – a tray of “Tory slop”.Those critics will be sharpening their kitchen knives because Bigham, who is a kind of Tim “Wetherspoons” Martin for centrist dads, has just announced the launch of his Brasserie range: deluxe versions of his meals with prices that fetch up to … wait for it … £30! Thirty whole English pounds!With a menu consisting of venison bourguignon, coq au vin, confit duck (all at £16.95) and two wellingtons (salmon for £19.95 and beef at £29.95), these creations are clearly not trying to compete with your common-or-garden Tesco lasagne. Bigham is obviously aware that these days you have to remortgage your grandma in order to afford a meal out, so he’s attempting to take on the restaurant experience itself. Why go out to mingle with strangers in the fresh evening air, he’s saying, when you can sit in your kitchen surrounded by children’s felt-tips and a half-eaten box of Shreddies instead? To add to the dining-out vibe, Bigham recommends a specific Waitrose wine for each meal, which we duly buy.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Tim Jonze, Helen Jane and friends Lliam and Nick trying the coq au vin.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianLook, if anyone is going to fall for this wheeze, it’s me, because my culinary confession is that I do quite like a bit of Tory slop from time to time. Eating out is difficult with two young children, and so we invite Charlie into our house, figuratively speaking, to serve us a lasagne or a chicken tikka masala (both tiny, both tasty). It’s as good as a takeaway, much cheaper and seems vaguely healthier.Still, that’s the standard range. Can any prepared meal really be worth these latest prices? Time to get my foodiest friends over – including a former chef, no less! – to test them out …Coq au vinView image in fullscreenCoq au vin with potatoes dauphinoise and Tim’s green beans.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianBigham dislikes the term “ready meals”. It implies something loaded with chemicals that you can whiz up in the microwave in minutes, whereas his creations require baking and even involve a touch of proper cooking – the new wellingtons can be enhanced by brushing the pastry with a beaten egg, and it’s advised that the coq in this coq au vin is taken out of its sauce and placed on a separate tray to crisp up. It works – sort of – and the chicken is delightfully juicy. Guests are impressed by the potato and celeriac dauphinoise, but when it comes to the sauce of chestnut mushrooms, chantenay carrots and bacon, the sumptuous depth of flavour that comes from simmering chicken bones in a load of wine for ages is definitely lacking.Wine pairingDominique Piron Beaujolais Villages, £14.40Rating6/10Confit duckView image in fullscreenConfit duck with potatoes dauphinoise and Tim’s green beans.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Guardian“Oh my God, this is delicious,” declare at least three of my guests. Sadly, they’re talking about the chianti we’re having with the duck rather than the duck itself, which emerges from the oven looking perfectly appetising but is disappointingly dry beneath the garlic-parmesan crumb. It comes with a smudge of lentil sauce and some sliced potatoes with nutty browned butter, both of which impress my guests more than the meat itself.Wine pairingVilla Cafaggio Chianti Classico, £16, on offer for £11 until 28 OctoberRating4/10Salmon wellingtonView image in fullscreenSalmon wellington.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianI was hugely sceptical about this. Yes, “sashimi-grade salmon” sounded promising – but could it survive being baked at 200C for 50 whole minutes? Surprisingly, it could! This was the night’s showstopper. It came out extremely well browned but the pastry was crisp, the salmon succulent and the whole thing was complemented by a gorgeous mushroom duxelles with gentle notes of fennel. Ex-chef Lliam, the kind of man who would normally sooner burn his kitchen down than demean himself with a ready meal, had to concede that this was good stuff. Without wanting to get sued for giving anyone salmonella, we agreed it would probably be even better if you knocked five or 10 minutes from the cooking time.Wine pairingChapel Down English Rosé, £16, on offer for £14 until 28 OctoberRating9/10Venison bourguignonView image in fullscreenVenison bourguignon.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianPreconceptions be damned! Just as the salmon surprised me, so did this – and not in a good way. I thought a casserole would translate most easily to the ready meal experience, but something has gone seriously wrong here. The meat may well be “wild-caught from the Scottish Highlands”, but it’s also terribly dry and the sauce is too scant. The whole thing lacks the indulgent comfort of a classic bourguignon. Perhaps I miss the experience of cooking one, too, which can be a pleasure in itself – from sauteeing the tiny onions in heart-attack quantities of butter to decadently tipping a half-decent bottle of burgundy into the pan. It’s time-consuming but not particularly tricky – and you end up with something infinitely more appetising than this. Things are rescued slightly by the mash, which is buttery with a crisp exterior, and the crunchy Pinot pairing, which goes down rather too quickly.Wine pairingCave de Lugny Bourgogne Pinot Noir, £17.50, on offer for £14.50 until 28 OctoberRating2/10Beef wellingtonView image in fullscreenBeef wellington.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianThis is the meal that has been generating all the “£30 for a bloody ready meal!” headlines. The thing is, a proper wellington isn’t really a ready meal by any standard definition. It’s essentially a piece of fillet steak with some pastry and mushrooms thrown in. Itshouldcost a lot. Or, to put it another way, the last thing you want to be eating is a beef wellington that costs a tenner.It takes 50 minutes to prepare this meal well done, but as we are not complete philistines we stick it in the oven for 30 minutes to get it “medium rare”. It emerges nicely crisped and gloriously pink inside. Despite needing a good crack of salt – and the distraction of various children wandering in asking if they can please go to bed now as it’s a school night – it’s generally agreed that this isn’t bad at all: tender, succulent, blah blah …OK, look, by this point critical faculties are a little impaired. All five bottles of wine have been consumed, the planned pairing system has gone out of the window and the conversation is giddily veering from botulism in South Africa (always a great accompaniment to a beef course) to the most impressive cast members of the West End musical Operation Mincemeat. Everyone does, at least, seem drunk and happy. Maybe Ihavereplicated the dining out experience, after all.Wine pairingThe Hedonist Shiraz, £15.50, on offer for £11.50 until 28 OctoberRating7/10Explore more on these topicsFoodFast foodWinefeaturesShareReuse this content"
