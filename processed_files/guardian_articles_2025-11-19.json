When you see up to six times the price [being charged] on the resale market, people can’t afford that.”Over the past decade, the Guardian has repeatedly investigated and exposed the tactics that led to this kind of exploitation. They include fraudulent practicessuch as “speculative selling”and theuse of specialist software such as “bots”to hoover up tickets and flip them for top dollar.Touts who fleeced fans of Lady Gaga and Ed Sheeran using such methodshave even been jailed, in the rare cases where fraud could be proved. Yet, when urged to act, previous government demurred.Speaking in 2011, a year after the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson first proposed a ban on touting, the future Tory chancellor Sajid Javid described touts as “classic entrepreneurs”. The erstwhile business minister Kevin Hollinrake said he had “quite happily” used Viagogo.The new legislation, whose implementation date is yet to be confirmed, flips this attitude on its head. It will prohibit for-profit resale on specialist platforms as well as on social media, with a carve-out for special situations,such as the Wimbledon tennis tournament’s debenture model.According to government estimates, consumers could save up to £112m a year – or £37 a ticket – as a result.Sites will be monitored by a recentlybeefed-upCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) and will be liable for penalties of up to 10% of turnover, about $180m for Viagogo’s US parent company.The scale of fines may not matter, because banning touting threatens to snuff out the resale sites’ business model altogether.They rely, to a large extent, on fostering relationships with a handful of super touts, sometimesproviding them with specialist tools to help themmaximise sales, and sharing a cut of the profits made when tickets are sold for huge mark-ups.Sites such as Twickets, which allow fans who can’t attend to recoup what they paid or pass a ticket to a friend, charge only service fees. That low-margin model is unlikely to be an attractive consolation prize for resellers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their platforms may charge hefty markups on certain tickets but they offer guarantees. If something goes wrong and your ticket never materialises, you get a refund (albeit not for any transport or hotel costs you may have incurred).If they are forced out of the market, the sites argue, fans will still pay over the odds but will do so via illegitimate platforms or outright fraudsters, where they will be scammed.Banks, which would have to process the chargebacks in such cases, have also warned that fraud could increase.Such warnings have repeatedly referred back to a report, written by the public affairs consultancy Bradshaw Advisory, suggesting that fraud rates are four times higher in Ireland and the Australian state of Victoria, both of which restrict resale.Longtime anti-touting campaigners, such as the music industry funded group FanFair Alliance, have been sceptical. They point out that the Bradshaw report contains no data from before resale bans came in and cannot, therefore, draw conclusions about cause and effect. They also point out that the Bradshaw report was commissioned by StubHub.Government officials are understood to have consulted with overseas counterparts on whether resale caps have fuelled fraud. “We’ve not seen any evidence [of that],” said Dearden. “What we do know that is that the current system is ripping off fans.”Reg Walker, a ticketing and security consultant, is reserving judgment until the detail of the policy is clearer. He fears loopholes that could leave room for touts to prosper.“The government needs to make sure the legislation applies across borders, as it did for the London 2012 Olympics, so that it really does protect consumers,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTicket pricesMusic industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

Set your alarms and gird your loins, this one’s not just big, it’s positively BrobdingnagianRob SmythWed 19 Nov 2025 15.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 15.01 ESTShareWhy have so many people in England set the alarm for 2.30am on Friday?Either it’s the start of the 2025-26 Ashes or Fred Dibnah’s Age of Steam on BBC Four is more watchable than we realised.What’s all the excitement about?England’s coach, the New Zealander Brendon McCullum, whose vibe is usually somewhere between Gen X slacker and Buddhist hippy, has called it “the biggest series of all our lives”. It could be career-defining for England – and career-staining for a great Australia side. All Ashes series are big; this one is positively Brobdingnagian.Don’t England always get thrashed in Australia?Well, England’s record on the last three tours is W0 D2 L13. The last time they won in Australia was 15 years ago. And the last time they regained the Ashes (as opposed to retaining them) away from home was 55 years ago.Why will it be different this time?It probably won’t. At this point we’re contractually obliged to recite that old quote from the film Clockwise. “It’s not the despair, Laura. I can stand the despair. It’s the hope.”What’s the form of both teams like?England drew 2-2 at home with India in the summer, a series they should have won but could have lost. More broadly, they have stolen Pakistan’s unofficial title as the world’s most mercurial team. Australia lost the World Test Championship final to South Africa in June but beat India 3-1 at home a year ago. In the International Cricket Council’s rankings it’s 1st v 2nd – the first time that’s been the case in the Ashes since 2006-07.What happened then? An epic struggle for the urn and world supremacy? One for the ages?Australia won 5-0.Oh. Why has there been so much chuntering over England’s preparation?England are simultaneously the best- and worst-prepared team ever to tour Australia. They’ve been planning for this series since McCullum, Ben Stokes and Rob Key took over in the spring of 2022, building a bespoke team they hope will be more Ocean’s Eleven than The Usual Suspects. But they’ve been heavily – some might even say tediously – criticised for playing only one warm-up game, at Lilac Hill near Perth, last week. This England team prepare differently, and so far it has worked. In the Bazball era they have won the first Test of all five overseas series.How important is the start of the series?Important enough, if you’re an England fan, to turn your heart into a drum-n-bass track. Not one of those melodic, soulful ones either. The last time England came from behind to win in Australia was 1954-55, and Ashes tours can spiral out of control at dizzying speed. Realistically England need to be level or ahead after two Tests.Why should England fans fear Matthew Hayden walking naked across the Melbourne Cricket Ground?All right-thinking persons should fear such a surreal violation – as should Hayden, given it carries a maximum six-month prison sentence under Victoria state legislation – but for England fans it would be especially painful. Hayden, a former Australia opener, says he will embrace a hitherto dormant naturist side if Joe Root doesn’t score a century in the series. Despite a decent overall record, Root has never reached three figures in a Test in Australia.Who are England’s key men?All of them, because a) cricket is a squad game now and b) you can probably afford two passengers at most in Australia. But Root, Stokes (the batter), Stokes (the bowler), Stokes (the captain), Harry Brook – statistically the most attacking batter in Test history – and Jofra Archer stand out.What are the main areas of concern for England?Two of the top three, Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope, have modest records and tend to deal in feast or famine. Their only specialist spin bowler, the 22-year-old Shoaib Bashir, will be targeted without a scintilla of mercy. And England’s fast bowlers are vulnerable to injury. The fastest-growing pastime in England, doomscrolling in bed in the morning, may take on new meaning over the next few weeks as cricket fans process another overnight medical bulletin.Is Australian run-machine Steve Smith still the bane of England’s existence?At the age of 36, Smith has plummeted to the ranks of merely brilliant batters. Since the last Ashes his Test average is just 41. But in the past year he has, from an English perspective, looked chillingly close to his best. When he captains against England – as he will in the first Test – he averages 112.Any weaknesses in the Australian side?They are without Josh Hazlewood and their captain, Pat Cummins, two of the fabled pace trio who between them have over a thousand Test wickets, for at least the first Test. They picked a bloated 15-man squad, reflecting an uncertainty around the top three in particular. And only one of that squad, Cameron Green, is in his 20s. Depending on which social media rabbit hole you have the misfortune to stumble down, the age of Australia’s squad is proof they are hardened champions or wheezing has-beens waiting to be put of their misery.Why have Australian pitches changed?Blame Sir Alastair Cook. His endless 244 not out at Melbourne in 2017-18 catalysed a change in the balance between bat and ball. In Test cricket, the 2020s are the most bowler-friendly decade in Australia since the 1950s. The first two games of this series, in Perth and Brisbane, could be dramatically low-scoring.Why do the Australian press hate this England team so much?Like 99.94% of humanity, Australians prefer having the moral high ground to themselves. After decades of sneering at England for being crap and boring, they can’t really do either – though the C-word will be back on the table if England assume the traditional role of Poms to the slaughter.Make the case for Australia winningThey’re the better team, they have home advantage. Most of all, they’re Australia.And England?They’ve put all their eggs in this basket. Hell, they even made the basket out of the same terracotta as the Ashes urn. Australia are traditionally most vulnerable when teams attack; England’s team are custom-designed for that. Most persuasively, some things are just meant to be. Right?If England win, where would it sit on the MBE-ometer?Just below 2005 – but with less free booze and nobody watering the garden at No 10 Downing Street. An England win would complete the Bazball arc with a narrative neatness that borders on schmaltz. It would also cement Stokes – who has already won a World Cup final, performed umpteen acts of super-heroism, captained with empathic, intuitive genius and redefined the alpha male in English sport – as England’s greatest ever cricketer.So, the dream is 5-0 England?That’s the fantasy. For two-eyed supporters on both sides, the dream is for the series to be 2-2 going into the final Test in Sydney. Should that happen, half of England will be living on Australian time – and it won’t be to watch Fred Dibnah’s Age of Steam.Explore more on these topicsThe AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamBen StokesAshes 2025-26Australia sportCricketexplainersShareReuse this content"

Or, to be accurate, a dead man and a dead woman walking. Ghosts of Christmas parties past, haunting the dispatch box. Cast your mind forward to a year from now. It’s more than likely that prime minister’s questions will look very different. A change of cast. If not a change of fortune.Keir Starmer may not even make it much further than the end of May. The budget chaos and No 10’s curious briefings against itself have left many Labour MPs in despair. The government can’t even get the basics right these days. Cabinet ministers can barely be trusted to dress themselves.The May local elections could be the last straw. Only on Wednesday’s BBC Politics Live show, Clive Lewis was saying he would be happy to give up his seat to make way for Andy Burnham’s return to Westminster. Whether Andy would be happy to swap Manchester for Norwich is another matter, but you get the picture. Over on the government frontbench, Wes Streeting was looking even more pleased than usual as he gossiped with his old mucker from Treasury select committee days,Rachel Reeves. The wagons are circling.As for Kemi, what can one say? Her position as leader of the Tory party may be looking slightly more secure than it was a couple of months ago. But that’s not saying much. It’s just that she’s got a little less accident prone. Slightly less likely to self-destruct at a moment’s notice. But still on the wrong side of basic competence.Even when Starmer has a horror show, she can only occasionally come out ahead. A no-score draw ranks as an achievement. If she does survive the next year, it will be because none of her challengers reckon it’s worth making a move. Why show your hand when there’s no chance of glory? Let Kemi drive the Tories further on to the rocks.All of which explains why the Commons chamber was an energy-free zone for prime minister’s questions. MPs on both sides have long since whizzed through the five stages of grief. From denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Many now find themselves in a hitherto unknown sixth stage. Sullen resignation. They have been ground down. The fight beaten out of them. They are here because they are here because they are here.Normally, PMQs is a time for backbenchers to make some noise. To behave like the antisocial adolescents so many of them are keen to put away. When politics is at its most tribal. But now it is as though there is a truce. No one dares to make much of a noise for fear of waking their neighbours. They are only in the Commons because the whips have bullied them into turning up. All they can manage is a collective guttural groan. A primitive Pavlovian response. A remembrance of things past.View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch could not get the date of the budget right.Photograph: House of Commons/UK Parliament/PAFor Kemi, this was all a dry run for next week’s budget. A rehearsal of her best lines. Or her lines, at any rate. She’s going to have to come up with something a lot better than this if she hopes to make much of an impact. Why was his government the first to float tax rises and then cancel them after the budget, she began.Er … I know it feels like this budget thing has been going on for the last six weeks. And we know the Tories are not so secretly gutted that Reeves has decidednot to go aheadwith the 2p rise in income tax despite spending weeks telling everyone she would in code. But you would have thought she could have managed to get the date right. Starmer laughed in relief. He had been dreading this and it was now clear it wasn’t going to be as bad as expected.For her next five questions, Kemi went on and on about stealth taxes. How Reeves would be stealing our money by reneging on a promise not to freeze income tax thresholds. Yet again disappearing into her own space-time continuum. One where any number of realities were possible at the same time. When the Tories froze thresholds for seven years in 2021, raising £40bn in the process, despite a manifesto pledge not to do so, it was a sign of fiscal prudence. WhenLabourdoes the same it is the ultimate betrayal. As for the country? We just suck it up. We expect nothing different.“I have a golden rule,” Kemi went on. Cue sniggers from the few MPs still awake. Badenoch and her shadow chancellor are the only two people in the world to take her golden rule seriously. And even they aren’t entirely sure exactly what it is. Everyone else zones out. Information overload. With so much else going on, there’s no point finding out about something that was clearly a drug-induced psychosis and is never going to happen. If the bond markets really thought the Melster was going to be the next chancellor there would be a global panic.As it was, Starmer gave a series of non-denials. We all know thresholds will be frozen. He was no more convincing than Kemi and the final exchanges descended into a series of personal slanging matches. You’re more crap than me. No, you’re more crap than me. You were a useless Treasury minister and an even worse leader of the opposition. It was hardly edifying. Or reassuring.The session ended with Lee Anderson accusing Labour of dog-whistle politics with its new immigration policies. Weirdly, he seemed to think this was a bad thing. Given that Reform have turned dog-whistle politics into its specialist subject, you would have thought he would be cheering from the rooftops. Or maybe he’s just narked that Starmer is treading on his patch. Oi, Keir. Yes, you. Back off.Lee went on to boast about the success of the Reform-led councils. Again, you wondered whether he was aware that most of the councils were in chaos, hadfailed to find any significant savings– services have already been cut to the bone – and were planning on increasing council tax by the maximum 5%. Starmer just assumed Anderson was having a laugh and talked through Nigel Farage’s timelines.Last week Nige had been too busy to condemn Sarah Pochin for sayingtoo many black faces drove her mad. Fair enough. Kemi has been too busy to condemn Robert Jenrick for saying there weretoo many black faces in Birmingham. There must be something in the Westminster water.Keir also wondered if Farage would like to apologise for the racist remarks he is alleged to havemade while at school. It turned out he wouldn’t. Apparently, if you said something a long time ago it may not actually have happened. Words can literally die on the lips. There are two quantum realities. One in which things happened. Another in which they didn’t. And politicians are free to take their pick.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ahead of a tour as himself, the actor and Instagram cookery guru looks backWed 19 Nov 2025 11.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 14.42 ESTShareFew actors are more indelibly associated with one role than Gregor Fisher – and few comic characters (although Alan Partridge leaps to mind) grow with their audiences over decades rather than years. “Somebody pointed out to me the other day,” says Fisher of his most famous alter ego, the unemployed Glaswegian alcoholicRab C Nesbitt, “that it’s 40 years since he first appeared on the telly”. Fisher wore the string vest on and off for 30 of those years, weaving himself into Glasgow folklore – but backing himself into a casting cul-de-sac too. Now 71, he’d love you to bear in mind the other roles he can play – not least that of Gregor Fisher, in which out-from-behind-the-mask persona he is soon to set off, for the first time, on a UK tour.You might imagine that an actor stepping out as himself after years in character(s) could be scary, or exciting, or a chance to set the story straight. But Fisher is not, as I discover when meeting him in Glasgow on the eve of his tour, a man apt to self-dramatise. Ask him about his career and he’ll toss the word back at you in scare quotes. Ask him about Nesbitt and he’ll tell you: “It’s just a part. It’s gossamer wings. It’s nothing.”‘I was due to turn on the Glasgow Christmas lights – but the council leader said no’Ask him about An Evening With Gregor Fisher – cooked up with his friend, the theatre director Nigel West (a neighbour in France, where Fisher lived for 10 years until his recent homecoming) – and he’ll give you this: “There’s no lines to learn. We can maybe have a laugh. We might make a couple of quid, and we might not. But it’ll be a painless exercise. There’s no crucifixion involved.” Who said that romance was dead!?View image in fullscreen‘Why are we portraying this nutcase?’ … with the cast of Rab C Nesbitt in 1990.Photograph: Bbc/AllstarAh, but this is the face Fisher presents to the world – and not the whole story. For a start, he delivers all this stuff with the twinkle of a man who, asthe Guardian once said of him, “could make reciting the alphabet uproarious”. And then there’s the palpable affection with which he recalls the passerby who, way back when, apprehended him mid-filming in public to offer his curt appreciation of Fisher’s life and work. “I saw this wee guy coming up the street. The light was fading, he’d obviously just finished work. And he clocked me, and I thought, ‘He’s going to say something.’ And he went …” – and here Fisher grabs my arm, with arresting intensity – “‘Thank you very much, son.’” It’s not much, but between two Scottish males, it’s plenty. “It meant a lot,” says Fisher. “It’s nicer to be liked than not.”Nesbitt, along with Fisher’s other identifiable alter ego, the combover king and Hamlet cigar salesman known only as the Baldy Man, started life on the 80s sketch showNaked Video. Fisher, who was separated from his birth siblings and given up for adoption aged three, had grown up on Glasgow’s outskirts, and cut his acting teeth at the Dundee Rep theatre in the late 70s. As Nesbitt, a street philosopher with a skanky headband, he touched a nerve in his native land – and far beyond: Fisher points out that the vast majority of the viewers of the eponymously named comedy, which ran on and off on the BBC between 1988 and 2014, lived south of the border.View image in fullscreenAs Baldy Man in an advert for Hamlet cigars in 1986.Photograph: cdpIndeed, he was somewhat resistant at first to playing a character who he worried perpetuated stereotypes of boozy and aggressive Scots. “I thought, ‘Why does it have to be this? Why are we portraying this nutcase brandishing a rolled-up newspaper?” But the character caught on – probably because Fisher’s performance (andIan Pattison’s scripts) fleshed out the cartoon of sozzled Scottish masculinity into something smarter, more lovable and more complex.Watching back episodes of Rab C Nesbitt now – including one that teases at his home town’s 1990 glow-up into a Europeancity of culture– you can interpret Nesbitt as a spirit of Glasgow incarnate, reassuring us that, at a time of tumultuous change, there remained some constants we could hang on to. But, for all that the series was more innovative than it’s given credit for (with direct address to camera decades before Fleabag – not to mention a very early TV appearance for the young David Tennant), Nesbitt remained, in Fisher’s phrase, “a Marmite character”.He tells me about the time he was invited to turn on Glasgow’s Christmas lights – only for the invitation to be rescinded when the leader of the council “got wind of the fact, and didn’t think [I was] a suitable person to represent the city”. Mind you, Nesbitt was always loved, says Fisher, where it mattered most: “Nancy Banks-Smith[in the Guardian] was always a great fan. I always used to think if Nancy likes it, it must be not too bad.”It did, however, typecast for a while an actor who would later star alongsideAl Pacino in The Merchant of Venice, not to mention his role as Bill Nighy’s manager inLove Actually. “People would say to me, after I’d done an audition, ‘Well that’s absolutely marvellous, I didn’t realise you could speak properly.’ These people don’t know what acting is.”View image in fullscreenAcclaimed …  Fisher in Yer Granny, for the National Theatre of Scotland.Does Fisher regret that Nesbitt pigeonholed him as a comic turn? “Well, I was never going to play Romeo,” he says. “Maybe on the wireless.” As for fretting about his career path, well, “Your career is your career is your career. We’ve all got bills to pay.” It all comes down, he says, to “casting directors who say, ‘We’d like him to do this, and we’re no’ interested in him doing that’” – and to your financial circumstances at any given time. “I’ve had some scripts sitting on my shelf for months,” he says, “until the tax bill comes in. I’ll be thinking, ‘This is crap’, but then suddenly it’s, ‘Oh thanks, I’d love to do it. Yes, I’ve got a window for that.’ That’s how a career works.”If he’s never exerted much control over it, Fisher is chuffed with how the most recent chapters of his working life have panned out. The last decade has seen an acclaimed stint with the National Theatre of Scotland in thestage comedy Yer Granny; an unlikely new direction, orchestrated by his grownup daughter Cissie, as an Instagram cookery guru (“I get people stopping me in the street saying, ‘I made yer potato scones.’ It’s just nuts!”); and acclaim for his role alongside Greg McHugh inthe BBC sitcom Only Child, about a son looking after his ageing dad.

Frustrated by the national federation’s financial problems, he deferred starting until January 2024, when the problems were resolved and players paid, paving the way for a historicWorld Cupqualifying campaign.Curaçao will be the smallest nation – by land area and population – to play at the World Cup after their0-0 draw in Jamaicaon Wednesday. The Caribbean island has a population of 156,000, sinking the previous record holders, Iceland, which has about 400,000 inhabitants. Last month Cape Verde were confirmed as surprise tournament debutants but the African nation is almost 10 times bigger by area than the former Dutch colony, indicating the level of achievement by Advocaat and his squad.World Cup 2026: which countries have qualified and how did they do it?Read more“It’s an impossibility that is made possible,” the winger Kenji Gorré says from the team hotel in Jamaica after two hours’ sleep. “It’s literally impossible for such a small island, such a small 150,000 population, and now to go to the biggest pinnacle of football is unbelievable.”Advocaat initiated contact with Curaçao about the job, knowing that by the time the tournament came around he would be 78. That could be another bit of history because Advocaat may become the oldest coach in the tournament’s history, surpassing Otto Rehhagel, who was 71 years and 317 days old when he oversaw Greece’s third and final group game in 2010. Although Romania’s coach Mircea Lucescu is hoping to make it through the playoffs and take charge in North America at the age of 80.“He’s been fantastic,” Gorré says of Advocaat. “As soon as he came in he brought a lot of experience with him. For him to believe in us and believe in our dream as well just shows also the potential that he saw, and I’m just really grateful that he said yes to the job and trusted his feeling on it. Now we’re walking in the destiny of what we’ve called.”Advocaat was joined by his long‑time assistant Cor Pot but there was also a desire to maintain some local knowledge. The former Huddersfield and Barnsley midfielder, and Kenji’s father, Dean Gorré was kept on the staff, having worked as the interim head coach.View image in fullscreenCuraçao supporters in Willemstad, the capital, watch as the national team secure World Cup qualification.Photograph: Angel Batta/AFP/Getty Images“It’s been amazing,” Kenji Gorré says. “To experience going to the World Cup with my dad being the coach and my dad leading us to the World Cup, it’s something that was only a dream. These are things that were dreamt of when I was young.“With God all things are possible and you can see that even with a faith of a size as a mustard seed, you know, God can do a miracle. And even just for my family, like my mum, who is from Curaçao, and her mum, my grandma, and they’ve got so much family in Curaçao as well that I’m just proud. And that just does something to my soul.”Advocaat was unfortunately absent from Kingston, having returned to the Netherlands to deal with a personal matter. When he arrived last year he set about making the national setup more professional and instilling a desire to avoid defeat at all costs. Few know better how to run camps and qualifiers.This is Advocaat’s 10th spell in charge of a men’s national side, his previous appointments being the Netherlands (three times), the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Belgium, Russia, Serbia and Iraq.His compatriots Patrick Kluivert and Guus Hiddink previously held the Curaçao role but neither had the impact of Advocaat. A key part of Advocaat’s plan to take Curaçao to the next level was to integrate members of the diaspora. In years gone by the Netherlands internationals Patrick van Aanholt, Gregory van der Wiel and Jetro Willems were eligible to play for Curaçao, and the current Netherlands players Jurriën Timber and Justin Kluivert have Curaçaoan heritage.Most of the squad were born in the Netherlands, including the starting XI from the decisive draw on Tuesday night. Many of Advocaat’s charges featured for Netherlands age-group teams.There is plenty of experience. The defender Armando Obispo has played in the Champions League for PSV, as has the striker Jürgen Locadia, who cost Brighton £15m in 2018 but is unemployed after leaving the Spanish fourth-tier side Intercity in the summer. Three of the squad play in the English Football League, including the former Manchester United midfielder Tahith Chong, the only squad member born on the island, who moved to Sheffield United from Luton in August. The former Ajax youngsters Ar’jany Martha and Sontje Hansen play for Rotherham and Middlesbrough respectively, the former PSV full-back Joshua Brenet moved to Livingston in September, and Shurandy Sambo of Burnley is on loan at Sparta Rotterdam.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their first international was in 2011, having previously played as the Territory of Curaçao until the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved. In three previous World Cup qualifying campaigns Curaçao won six of 18 matches.In the opening group phase this time they had a 100% record, defeating St Lucia, Aruba, Barbados and most notably Haiti, who will also be in North America next summer. In the third round the more established nations of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago stood in their path in a group that also included Bermuda. Kenji Gorré scored in the crucial 2-0 home victory against Jamaica last month and Bermuda were thrashed 7-0 last week to boost confidence going into the decider.Fortitude got them through, even though there were nerves when Jamaica were awarded an injury-time penalty that was overturned after a video assistant referee consultation. Curaçao finished top of group B and delirium greeted the final whistle.“All the emotions were flying up in the air. He goes to the VAR and he says ‘no penalty’,” says Kenji Gorré. “My heart just dropped again and we were like, wow, we are actually going to the World Cup. This is destiny.

This is a new lowJodie GinsbergJamal Khashoggi was dismembered in a Saudi consulate. The president says ‘things happen’Wed 19 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 12.12 ESTShare“Things happen.” Just two words. That’s all it took forDonald Trumpto effectively dismiss what is probably the most infamous journalist killing of the last decade – and in so doing plumbed a new low in his contempt for journalists, for journalism – and for the truth.The US president’s dismissal of the murder of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi came in a press conference with the Saudi crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman– a man whom the CIA found in a 2021 report had orchestrated the kidnap and killing of the Washington Post columnist in 2018. (Prince Mohammed has denied involvement.)The US intelligence services were not the only ones to conclude the murder – which took place in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and in which the 59-year-old Khashoggi was drugged and dismembered – was signed off at the highest levels. An investigation led by then UN special rapporteur, Agnès Callamard, reached similar conclusions.For a brief period, governments were unified in their condemnation of Saudi Arabia’s actions. The US imposed sanctions and visa bans in 2021 over the killing, although it stopped short of sanctioning Prince Mohammed himself. Since then, the kingdom has been slowly rehabilitating itself – and the crown prince’s visit to Washington seemed to be the final confirmation of that redemption.Critics of the regime had roundly condemned the visit. But what was on display at the White House was worse than could have been imagined. Not only did Trump fete Prince Mohammed but he effectively rewrote history – and then blamed the victim. Prince Mohammed, Trump asserted when asked, knew nothing about the killing – in direct contradiction to what his country’s own intelligence services concluded four years ago. Moreover, Trump said: “A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about, whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen.”This marks a new and abject low for a president who has made little secret of his contempt for the truth – or for the press. Trump has smeared journalists (he called ABC news, whose reporter asked the question about Khashoggi at the Saudi press conference “fake news”), berated them in public (he called one a “piggy” this week for asking about his relationship with the convicted sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein), sued news outlets for eye-watering sums of money in vexatious law suits, and called for news outlets he doesn’t like to lose their licenses.He has forced veteran news services out of the White House press pool for refusing to use language of his choosing, and he has gutted funding for essential public media at home and vital independent media abroad.All of that has created an environment in which journalists are manifestly less safe in the US, but one in which their targeting – and indeed killing – becomes not just unimportant (“things happen”) but acceptable (“a lot of people didn’t like that gentleman”).It is no surprise that 2024 was the deadliest year on record for journalists in the more than 30 years the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has been documenting this data: a persistent failure to hold those responsible for journalist killings has created a culture of impunity in which journalists’ killers are literally able to get away with murder and so continue to do so.Nowhere is this more evident than in Israel, which is responsible for the killing of more than 200 journalists in the past two years.The impact on society is profound. Attacks on journalists are attacks on the truth. They are attacks on facts. They are attacks on our rights to know and on our freedom to live freely and safely.On Thursday, CPJ gathers for its annual International Press Freedom awards. My message there is the same as my one for Trump: these things may happen. But it is our responsibility to make sure they do not.Jodie Ginsberg is CEO of the Committee to Protect JournalistsExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionMohammed bin SalmanJamal KhashoggicommentShareReuse this content"

Last week his leader said he didn’t have time to condemn the racist comments of his fellow MP for Runcorn,” the prime minister said, referencing Sarah Pochin’s complaint last month about TV adverts being “full of black people, full of Asian people”.“He also said he didn’t have time to condemn his party calling children in care evil. He didn’t have time. I wonder if we could ask his leader next door to him whether he’s got time for his explanation for the stories in today’s papers.”View image in fullscreenThe Guardian spoke to more than a dozen of Farage’s Dulwich college contemporaries who said they had witnessed racist behaviour by him.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe prime minister’s spokesperson added: “These are disturbing allegations and it’s vital thatNigel Farageurgently explains himself. You’ve heard the prime minister speak just this week about Farage’s weakness in the face of divisive politics in Reform’s ranks.“He’s still not condemned the language or taken action against one of his MP’s racist comments, refused to condemn them when asked last week. Reform is dragging our politics into a dark place. This Labour government stands for our patriotic British values of decency, tolerance and importantly, unity. So, it’s for Nigel Farage to explain.”A spokesperson for Farage reiterated the Reform leader’s denial of him ever being racist and antisemitic at school. He questioned why some of those who had given testimony had not made the claims before.“Our statement was very clear that these allegations date back 45 years. And I think that at any point in time, when Nigel was leader of Ukip, when he stood in the 2010 general election, the 2015 general election, during Brexit, maybe in the 2019 general election, you would have to ask yourself, why didn’t this come up before?”Asked if Farage therefore believed those who made the allegations were inventing them, the spokesperson said: “I’m saying there is no primary evidence. It’s one person’s word against another.”‘He used to say things like “Hitler was right”’: Farage faces more allegations of racist behaviour at schoolRead moreAsked if someone would be blocked from standing as a candidate if they had made similar comments, a spokesperson for Reform said they would if there was “some hard evidence”.John Woodcock, an adviser on political extremism to the last Conservative government as a cross-bench peer, said testimonies reported by the Guardian appeared credible and the Reform leader’s response would be concerning to many.Contemporaries accused Farage of targeting minority ethnic children for abuse during his time at Dulwich college, singing a “Gas ’em all” song that referred to the killing of Jewish, black and south-east Asian people, and burning a school roll in a year when there were said to be more Patels than Smiths.When faced with claims from Channel 4 in 2013 about his conduct at school, Farage admitted saying “some ridiculous things … not necessarily racist things … it depends on how you define it”.In response to the fresh allegations, a spokesperson for Reform, which is leading in the opinion polls, told the Guardian they were “entirely without foundation”.Woodcock,ennobled as Lord Walney in 2020, suggested a prospective prime minister should not seek to brush off such claims. He said: “These detailed testimonies from Mr Farage’s contemporaries appear credible and describe a degree of extremism that cannot be summarily dismissed as irrelevant simply because it was alleged to have occurred when he was a teenager. Many people will readily accept that young people can espouse offensive or extreme views that should not define their character as an adult.“They will be more concerned by the fact that Mr Farage is apparently now completely denying he ever said anything racist or antisemitic as a child, despite several public statements to the contrary from people who say they were on the receiving end of it from him.“This suggests a man not at ease with his past – a troubling characteristic for someone who is seeking to govern the country.”Among those who have accused of Farage of racist behaviour at Dulwich college was the Bafta- and Emmy-winning director Peter Ettedgui, 61, who claimed Farage would sidle up to him him and growl “Hitler was right” or “Gas them”.In anew testimony, Jean-Pierre Lihou, a former friend of Farage’s at school, who said he once stayed over at his house, said he also recalled the abuse of Ettedgui.“He used to say things like, you know, ‘Jude’, to Peter, which is the German for Jew, in the way it was said in the 1930s, a long ‘u’ in a menacing way, you know?”, Lihou said. “It’s pretty awful and he’s a bloody nice guy … Peter would become quiet, I think he originally said ‘sod off’ because he’s a fairly robust guy. But he eventually basically went into himself and tried to ignore it. It would subdue him.”Not all of the school contemporaries who spoke to the Guardian recalled racist behaviour or felt that Farage was bigoted. But a number of those who did experience such behaviour said they had been motivated to speak out by Farage’s failure to show contrition about his past.Georgina Laming, the director of campaigns at Hope Not Hate, said: “These revelations are sadly no surprise. Nigel Farage has consistently expressed anti-immigrant and intolerant views and shown voters who he really is.”The allegations were described as “disturbing” by the chair of the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism.The Labour MP Joani Reid said: “I am sure they have caused concern amongst Britain’s Jewish community, which is facing an unprecedented rise in antisemitism.“I cannot comment on the veracity of these claims, only on how they make me feel. I think it essential that Mr Farage makes it clear he would not tolerate anyone in his party expressing such views at any time, and that these are not views he would ever express. Neither hatred of Jews nor any other racist opinion should be tolerated in Reform or any other party in parliament.”Sunder Katwala, of the integration thinktank British Future, said while people who “would never trust”Reform UKwould see the claims about Farage’s schooldays “as a gotcha”, others would regard the allegations as “from a different culture, that we now understand as toxic.”But the allegations brought into “sharp focus” the “significant” question of Reform’s reputation on race and how far it can be trusted, Katwala said.Simon Woolley, the founder of Operation Black Vote, said that people might ask whether Farage’s alleged “toxic early views never disappeared at all” and may have “merely shifted focus to other groups, including Muslims and black people”.The Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson, Max Wilkinson, said: “A lot of people say stupid and offensive things at school, but most grow out of it. Sadly, in Nigel Farage’s case he’s made a career out of it instead.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The plan is likely to be viewed as surrender in Kyiv.0:47Moment Russian missile strikes apartment block in Ukraine – videoThe two men have formed an important but unofficial backchannel between Moscow and Washington, and it was unclear whether the Trump administration had formally backed the plan.The Financial Times and Reuters reported that the proposal would require Ukraine to cede territory it controls in the east of the country and halve the size of its military, conditions that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has in the past called non-starters. Other conditions include limiting US military assistance and categories of armaments used by the Ukrainian military.The existence of the 28-point plan, which appears to be inspired by a similar proposal the Trump administration developed to end the war in Gaza, was first reported by Axios. The White House did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for more detail on the proposal.Washington has repeatedly suggested that it is close to a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but the proposals have failed because they would have granted Russia most of its demands while requiring Kyiv to make painful concessions.On Wednesday night, US secretary of state Marco Rubio appeared to respond to reports of the plan by saying that a durable peace would require “both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions.”“That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict,” Rubio wrote on X.The leaked reports came as Russia launched a massive attack in western Ukraine targeting several multi-storey buildings in the city of Ternopil, as well as energy facilities in Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv. Russia is engaged in a systematic campaign to destroy Ukraine’s civilian power infrastructure ahead of winter.View image in fullscreenFirefighters tackle a blaze caused by a Russian strike on Lviv.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOleg Hrytsyshyn, who lives on the sixth floor of one of the damaged apartment blocks in Ternopil,said that the smoke instantly cut off evacuation routes, leaving him trapped in his home.“There were several loud explosions. When I tried to get dressed, there was thick black smoke in the entrance. It was burning,” he said. “It was impossible to get out, although I tried twice. The windows in the apartment were not broken. I knocked on the neighbors’ doors but no one answered.”The man was rescued and doctors treated him for high blood pressure.Avideo clip on social mediaappeared to show the moment a missile hit the building.Ukraine’s interior ministry said 25 people, including three children, had been killed in the strike, with another 73 injured, among them 15 children.A witness, Yaroslav Teslyuk,said the strike happened at about 5.30am, when most people were asleep.“I heard a loud rumble. It was followed by the noise of ‘shaheeds’ and several more rockets, and then explosions,” he said. “A fire started. I was told some people burned alive in their apartments because the strike happened when everyone was still asleep. The bodies were covered up. Some have already been taken away.”Zelenskyy, who met the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Wednesday in what he described as an effort to “reinvigorate negotiations” and secure a “just peace” for Ukraine, urged Kyiv’s allies to intensify pressure on Russia to end its nearly four-year invasion, including by providing more air-defence missiles.View image in fullscreenRecep Tayyip Erdoğan greets Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ankara.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“Every brazen attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “Effective sanctions and assistance to Ukraine can change this.”Potential peace talks have largely stalled in recent months as a result of Russia’s maximalist demands. Zelenskyy is expected to meet a senior delegation of US military officials on Thursday.The US army secretary, Daniel Driscoll, arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday to hold talks with Ukrainian officials and “discuss efforts to end the war,” the US Embassy said in a statement.Kyiv and Moscow have not held direct negotiations since the summer, and efforts to revive a diplomatic track have largely frozen since the last meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.Despite Kremlin claims that it is open to talks on ending the war, Moscow has shown no willingness to scale back its far-reaching demands.Zelenskyy finds himself in an increasingly difficult position at home and on the battlefield. Russian forces have recently advanced into the strategically important city of Pokrovsk and are pressing forward elsewhere along the front, while a widening corruption scandal in the energy sector has erupted into Ukraine’s most serious political crisis since the start of the war.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied on Wednesday that any significant progress had been made. “So far there are no innovations on this that can be reported to you,” he said.Russia’s foreign ministry also said it was unaware of any new US peace proposal. Its spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said Moscow had not received any draft agreement on Ukraine “of such a level” from Washington.“If the American side had come up with proposals, they would have been communicated through the established diplomatic channels between our two countries,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In sum, Huang said, there’s a major transformation happening in AI andNvidiais foundational to that transformation.“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” said Huang. “From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI from pre-training to post-training to inference.”Huang said that there are currently three huge platform shifts: a transition from general purpose computing to accelerated computing; a transition to generative AI and a transition to agentic and physical AI, eg robots or autonomous vehicles.“As you consider infrastructure investments, consider these three fundamental dynamics,” Huang said. “Each will contribute to infrastructural wealth. Nvidia … enables all three transitions and does so for any form or modality of AI.”Demand for the company’s chips continues to grow, Huang said.“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” said Huang in a press release. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference – each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast – with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”The company surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in nearly every regard, as it has for multiple quarters in a row, a sign that the financially enormous AI boom is not slowing down. Nvidia reported $1.30 in diluted earnings per share on $57.01bn in total revenues beating investor expectations of $1.26 in earnings per share on $54.9bn in revenue. Sales are up 62% year-over-year.The company reported $51.2bn in revenue from data-center sales, beating expectations of $49bn.The company is also projecting fourth- quarter revenue of around $65bn; analysts had predicted the company would issue a guidance of $61bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As investors worry that mounting CapEx will force companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is not optional, but rather the central need for every tech business in the world.”Analysts and experts said that although they were largely confident Nvidia would beat Wall Street expectations, they were anxiously awaiting the earnings call for morenews on the status of industry demand for the firm’s AI chips.“There is still no doubt that Nvidia is far and away the leader for AI-focused chips,” David Meier, senior analyst at investment websitethe Motley Fool, wrote. “So, I expect revenue, margins, and cash flows to be pretty close to analysts’ estimates. But the valuable information is more likely to come from the commentary about where management sees its markets headed, whether it’s in the AI market or [a] new market the company is currently pursuing.”Shares in Nvidia have been down 7.9% in November after major investors dumped their stocks in the firm. Peter Thiel’s hedge fund,Thiel Macro, sold off its entire stake in the chipmaker in the last quarter. His holdings would have been valued at about $100m, according to a Reuters report. Softbank has also sold off its $5.8bn holdings in the company, further boosting fears of an AI bubble.“I do not believe that Nvidia’s growth is sustainable long-term,” said Forrester’s senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. “AI demand is unprecedented, but if there is a market correction due to supply meeting demand or a slowdown in the pace of innovation/businesses getting used to the pace, I expect that the continued growth in Nvidia share value will slow down.”Explore more on these topicsNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)Quarterly resultsStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

And that has now resulted in them having to pay more for security checks because they’re using a very, very old version of Windows.“I just wonder how much scrutiny and attention is given to what seems like a good contract in the first instance, getting locked in with a single provider then ends up essentially ripping off the taxpayer.”Murray replied to her that it was a “good question”, but did not address the claim that Microsoft had “ripped off the NHS”. He said that the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) was trying to coordinate digital strategy and buying of digital services across the government.“We know there is real serious fragmentation in the £21bn the public sector spends every year on technology,” added Emily Middleton, the director general for digital centre design at DSIT, who was also giving evidence in the committee’s inquiry into the “digital centre of government”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We know we’re not getting the value for money that we should be.”Emily Darlington, the Labour MP for Milton Keynes Central, asked Murray why the UK relied on US companies such as Palantir, which has a £330m contract to provide a federated data platform for the NHS, rather than UK companies.“We know that we are the second most cyber-targeted country in the world,” she said. “Building our UK industry and capability is great for our economy, but also is really important for public confidence and really important for our security.”Murray said the answer was to build greater capabilities here in the UK and to avoid situations where “you’re stuck with Microsoft all the way through”.“There’s more to be done in terms of procurement,” he said. “There’s more to be done in terms of making sure the smaller companies are not locked out of the process.”Explore more on these topicsNHSPublic services policyMicrosoftComputingOutsourcingnewsShareReuse this content"

One teenager, Devonte Cantrill, 19, committed the fatal stabbing, butseven defendants were convicted of murder, and four of manslaughter, under the“joint enterprise” law.Lawyers for the men argued in their 2023 application to the CCRC that the “gang narrative” advanced at the trial was based on racist stereotypes of black boys and young men, and that the convictionsresulted from “institutional racism”by the police, prosecution and judge.The GreaterManchesterpolice (GMP) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) presented a rap music video and selected images from the defendants’ mobile phones as evidence that they were members of a the gang called Active Only, or AO. The judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, directed the jury that they could infer gang “membership or allegiance” if a defendant had the rap video on their mobile phone.Joint enterprise holds all participants in a violent incident, however minor their individual actions, equally guilty if they are found to have intentionally “encouraged and assisted” a person to commit the most serious violence. Accusing people involved in an incident of disorder of being gang members can be crucial to establishing a joint enterprise charge, as it alleges that all had a common motive.A series ofreviews and academic researchhas found that black boys and young men are disproportionately portrayed as being in gangs and subjected to joint enterprise prosecutions.The Moss Side defendants were accused of being members of AO and to have collectively killed Hafidah because he was a member of a rival gang who strayed into their area. The rap video, in which some of the defendants participated, was portrayed in the trial and referred to by Openshaw as a “gang video”.In 2021, the Guardian reported that the video wasrecorded at a local youth centre, which was publicly funded, and that GMP supported initiatives there. Young people, including some of the defendants, took part in activities that included being encouraged to make rap music as a constructive activity.No criminal activity such as drug dealing was alleged to have been carried out by the AO gang, five of the 11 convicted had no criminal records and Openshaw said three other teenagers’ minor convictions were not relevant. Most were studying at college and had good character references. The men and their families have always argued they were not in a gang and did not intend that Hafidah be killed.The application to the CCRC, submitted in 2023 by Keir Monteith KC and Darrell Ennis-Gayle of solicitors Hodge Jones and Allen, argued “there was no violent criminal gang by the name of AO”, and that the convictions are a “gross miscarriage of justice” influenced by institutional racism.Lucy Powell, deputy leader of the Labour party, MP for the constituency in which Hafidah was killed, supported the application to the CCRC. She has repeatedlycriticised the joint enterprise prosecution, saying that gang narratives “seem to be more effectively deployed against young black men from places like Moss Side where underlying preconceptions and prejudices come into play”.The CCRC said the new evidence and arguments presented on behalf of Goodall, Walters and Wilson “undermine the ‘gang narrative’ relied on by the prosecution at trial”. “There is a real possibility the court of appeal will find the fresh evidence materially undermines the prosecution case,” it said.The CCRC chair, Dame Vera Baird KC, said: “This referral highlights the need for safeguards to protect defendants against the risk of unfairness from a too readily adopted gang narrative, based on inappropriate labelling.“It is possible that there are other cases which would benefit from guidance on this issue, where the fear may be that stereotypes can be wrongly introduced as evidence.”Monteith said he hoped the court of appeal would reach a decision by the end of next year at the latest.“The use of joint enterprise laws and gang narratives by the CPS has resulted in too many racist miscarriages of justice,” he said, arguing the system needs urgent reform. “These prosecution tactics are overwhelmingly targeted at young black men and reinforce harmful racial stereotypes that undermine trust in our justice system for racialised and marginalised communities.”Ennis-Gayle said: “The CCRC decision reflects what we have been arguing for five years: that our clients were convicted because of the colour of their skin.”A CPS spokesperson said: “We note today’s CCRC referral and will carefully consider our next steps.”Mary Goodall, Durrell’s mother, said of the CCRC referral: “This is amazing news we have been waiting a long time for. There is still a long way to go for our boys to get justice and for us to get them home, but this is a step in the right direction: they are innocent.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterCourt of appealCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

And it’s hard for any storyline to break through the administration’s “flood the zone” strategy, much less one like this. Nothing seems to stick. But the “quiet, piggy” clip has taken off, several days after the admonishment occurred on Air Force One last Friday, and without much help from the media itself.“I don’t know why the ‘Piggy’ thing is bothering me so much,” wrote Hank Green, a YouTuber and author. “It’s one more unforgivable thing in a list of 20,000 unforgivable things, but I’ve been mad about it for like 12 straight hours.”Trump is going through a string of losses: Democrats dominating in off-year elections, having to reverse course on the Epstein files, Republicans refusing to get rid of the filibuster to end the shutdown, a faltering economy. There’s a possibility that he’s losing his air of impenetrability, and his grip on the right could maybe, just maybe, be loosening.The anger he displayed in the clip could be a sign of someone on the back foot, overreacting to a question Bloomberg correspondent Catherine Lucey was asking about why Trump was fighting against releasing the Epstein files “if there’s nothing incriminating in the files”. The files related to the child sexual abuser released so far by Congress show that Epstein communicated regularly, and derogatorily, about women with a host of prominent friends.0:19Trump tells reporter 'quiet piggy' after Epstein question – videoLashing out at a female reporter with a derogatory insult amid a news cycle dominated by politicians splitting hairs over a man who ran a sex-trafficking outfit – it was pretty on the nose.But the clip also pinged around the internet in the same news cycle as Trump telling another female reporter it was rude to ask Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist whom the CIA determined was killed at the direction of the crown prince.“You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,” Trump said of Khashoggi, responding to a question from ABC News’s Mary Bruce. “A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him, or didn’t like him, things happen. But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that. You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.”The combined force of two outbursts at female journalists in a single news cycle – for asking about a child sexual abuser and a murdered colleague – went beyond the standard-fare Trumpian attacks on the media.Part of the collective ire could be that no one in the press gaggle jumped to Lucey’s defense in the video, underlining that those attacked by Trump often stand alone while others fear becoming next on his list; the media backbone that stiffened in his first term has wilted, under exhaustion and at the hands of Trump-friendly owners, in his second. The condemnations of Trump and accolades for both journalists came after the fact.“These incidents are not isolated; they are part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility – often directed at women – that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press,” the Society of Professional Journalists said in astatementWednesday.The White House, meanwhile, has doubled down on the comment, saying Lucey had “behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way towards her colleagues on the plane”, providing no details on what that meant. “If you’re going to give it, you have to be able to take,” they said.Beyond the clip’s power to outrage, though, is a sign that the leftwing media ecosystem and its creators are starting to command attention and elevate stories that media outlets aren’t jumping on.BBC should not pay Trump any money, says former director general Tony HallRead moreAs Democratic digital strategist Parker Butler pointed out on X, the “quiet, piggy” clip grabbed millions of views on online accounts four days after it happened, saying: “It got almost NO coverage when he said it … A viral post can shape an entire news cycle.”And some Democrats who’ve taken the strategy of being Trump back to Trump, including California governorGavin Newsom’s press office, are using the clip to bully the president back, Photoshopping Trump’s face onto pigs and repeatedly tweeting “quiet, piggy”.In Trump 2.0, you never know which affronts to decency will stick in people’s minds. This one, though, has a symbolism that seems to be resonating.“Portland has reclaimed the frog as a symbol of its resistance to Trump’s efforts to militarize the city,” former US attorney and commentator Joyce Alene wrote on X. “Perhaps women should claim the glamorous, sassy Muppet Miss Piggy, a known diva with a fierce karate chop, as their own symbol.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGenderWomenUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

After playing at a pre-game gig near Hampden on Tuesday, Morgan watched the match in a city centre pub, hearing the crowd belting out his ironclad hook.Morgan reveals he has been working on a new song for the World Cup but insists he will only release it “if it feels right”.View image in fullscreenJoseph, with friends Euan, Fraser and Sam, all students at Caledonian University, says the win brings the country together.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianStill a little dazed from the night before, Morgan declares it was “a real ‘where were you?’ moment”. He remembers rushing home from school as a teenager to watch Scotland play Brazil in their last World Cup, in 1998. (They lost 2-1.) “Now this is reaching a whole new generation. It’s unbelievable, a great time to be Scottish.”“It will definitely inspire boys and girls to play and keep playing,” says Laura Montgomery, the chief executive of – and former medal winner with – Glasgow City FC, who has been instrumental in the development of the flourishing national women’s game. Montgomery is speaking from Portugal ahead of Glasgow City’s match against Sporting CP on Wednesday night in the round of 16 of the inaugural Uefa women’s Europa Cup.“It’s great financially for the SFA, and that cash injection should benefit the whole ecosystem of men, women’s and youth teams,” she says, pointing out that elite youth provision for girls has “nowhere near the equality of funding” it deserves.In Glasgow city centre, fans were still reaching for adequate descriptors to capture the enormity of the win. “A miracle,” says Joseph, beaming down Buchanan Street with three student pals. All 18, this will be the first time they’ve seen their team compete at this level.“I much prefer it to Rangers and Celtic,” says Fraser, “because it brings the country together. It crosses over any religion or politics.”“If we play well, it does,” his friend Sam says, offering the crucial qualification.By Wednesday midday, the unashamed cashing in had begun in earnest, with Barrhead Travel urging fans to book ahead from its range of tailored World Cup packages.View image in fullscreenRachel Breen is considering buying tickets for the World Cup off the back of Scotland’s success in qualifying.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“There’s definitely a buzz around town this morning,” says Rachel Breen, who doesn’t usually consider herself a football fan but admits she is currently pricing tickets to Miami. “That’s the thinking now but I might calm down later. It was a really exciting game.”“I had nothing to base my hope on,” admits Daniel Zanieri, who works in tech sales, “but it felt like something special was going to happen.“I walked into an office this morning where only 30% watched the game but every single person was talking about it. One hundred per cent it brings people together.

Do they – including a huge collection of explicit sketches – reveal truths about the elusive man?Jack SealeWed 19 Nov 2025 17.00 ESTShareThe hook for Turner: the Secret Sketchbooks is meant to be that many of the 37,000 sketches left behind by the great British painter JMW Turner have rarely been seen and never been filmed; therein may be hints at the nuances of his elusive character that his main oeuvre kept hidden. Equally remarkable, though, is the documentary’s bold choice of contributors. As well as the art historians and present-day British artists who would dominate a standard art film, there are famous laymen, from the obviously somewhat qualified –Timothy Spallplayed the artist in Mike Leigh’s biographical film Mr Turner; Chris Packham is well placed to comment on Turner’s reverence for the natural world – to the more surprising hire of Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones.Neither the sketchbooks nor the celebs turn the documentary format upside down, but they add something to a distillation of Turner’s life and legacy that balances accessibility with analytical muscle. Will a previously uninitiated viewer now be more likely to attend a Turner exhibition? Yes. Can existing Turner experts finesse their knowledge? Yes. Job done.Having been brought up adjacent to the most vivid realities of adult life in the centre of Georgian London, Turner suffers a devastating bereavement at the age of eight when his younger sister dies. His mother’s mental illness, which eventually sees her confined to a nightmarish asylum where she perishes – unvisited but surely not forgotten – when Turner is still in his teens, is a second dark spot on the soul of a young man who soon displays signs of febrile genius. Turner’s early sketches show him capturing buildings in obsessive detail, which leads to the programme’s first headline-worthy statement: Packham, who is autistic himself, describes Turner as “hyperfocused” in a way that “maybe speaks to his potential neurodiversity”.View image in fullscreen‘He’s enthralled by that rawness of nature’ … Chris Packham in Turner: The Secret Sketchbooks.Photograph: BBC/Passion Docs/Jim PetersenTurner enrols at the Royal Academy and flourishes there despite being, as an empatheticTracey Eminpoints out, a working-class voice at a time when “art was for the wealthy”. He is a success, but in work of that era such as his painting of Dolbadarn Castle, the structure high on a hill with a forlorn human figure tiny in the foreground, there is trauma: the clinical psychologist Orna Guralnik wonders if Turner is the man and the institution housing his mother the distant castle.Not all the comments from celebrities are worth hearing.Ronnie Wood, whose contributions have the air of an interview from which little was salvageable, puts forward an unenlightening comparison between paintings starting life as sketches and rock songs developing from smaller musical ideas, before offering a review of Turner’s 1806 stunner Fall of the Rhine at Schaffhausen that probably won’t have the Tate ringing up to ask Wood to write their pamphlets: “It’s the epitome of drama. It’s very dramatic.” But if the programme hadn’t let celebrities in, we wouldn’t have Packham enthusing about how a sojourn in the Alps gave Turner’s view of nature an adrenalised new clarity: “He’s enthralled by that rawness of nature, its uncontrollability, its supreme power, and before it our imperceptible nothingness. This defined the sublime for him.”If the sketchbooks don’t help with a particular part of Turner’s career, they are temporarily discarded, but on occasion they prove extremely helpful. Turner’s working-class roots are there in the way he uses pen and paper not just to capture images, but to set out his own finances, including plans for reducing the price of unsold paintings: wealthier artists, comfortable within the establishment, would feel no need to fret about their future.The archive’s biggest revelation does, however, come from Turner’s private drawings, specifically those of humans having sex. The wild, unhappy young Turner generates a massive collection of pencilled pornography, with the sexual organs of participants in startling detail and everything else a hastily sketched blur. Later in life, when he finds happiness with Margate landlady Sophia Booth, she inspires pictures that are explicit but now more tenderly erotic: the naked people have become fully rounded humans. You can’t get that sort of glimpse of the artist’s intimate inner life from The Fighting Temeraire, no matter how long you stare at it.As it discusses Turner’s majestic but, at the time, underappreciated late period, The Secret Sketchbooks has one final insight of note. Contemporary relevance can be found in the way Turner understood climate change, not of course in the way we see it but in his awareness that the Industrial Revolution constituted a human-made force powerful enough to taint the sublime. The star of the show,Chris Packham, says: “This is where we start to brutalise nature … what was his final mission with those paintings? Was he saying, progress at your peril?” If Turner was a man ahead of his time, this programme helps us see him afresh.Turner: The Secret Sketchbooks aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewJMW TurnerChris PackhamTracey EminTimothy SpallRonnie WoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet much of his work has been stuck in limbo for decades – until a determined fan stepped inJude RogersWed 19 Nov 2025 11.15 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 11.17 ESTShare‘It felt to me as if the world had forgotten about the Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley of folk, or a singular figure in the mould of Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash or Richard Thompson.” So says Colin Harper, curator of a slew of new releases celebrating the stunning music of Scottish musician Dick Gaughan. Harper had recently reconnected with his music after several decades, “and I couldn’t believe the quality of it. His singing and guitar playing were astonishing – he performed traditional songs and championed social justice so powerfully.”But if you haven’t heard of the 77-year-old Gaughan, it’s not surprising: much of his work has been unavailable for years, the rights to it having been claimed by the label Celtic Music, who have not made it available digitally. Gaughan doesn’t recall receiving a royalty statement from the company in 40 years. He is battling for ownership and, in turn, hopes to help other veteran folk artists regain control of their catalogues. “To find that the music I made, that I put a lot of work into, is just not available – it’s like your life isn’t available,” he says.View image in fullscreenDick Gaughan, far left, with Boys of the Lough in 1972Born in Glasgow in 1948, and raised in Leith in an impoverished musical family, Gaughan became a jobbing musician at 22, later recording 12 solo albums and multiple collaborations. Capable of both stunning delicacy and fiery spirit in his performances, he recorded nine sessions for John Peel (solo and in groups), who said during one of his 1977 shows: “He’s a singer so good that prolonged exposure to him could drive you daft.”Gaughan became a much-loved regular at folk clubs up and down the country. Later in his career, he brilliantly led Emmylou Harris, Kate and Anna McGarrigle and Kate’s 21-year-old son Rufus Wainwright on folk ballad Wild Mountain Thyme, on a 1995 episode of Scottish TV show Transatlantic Sessions. “I was so lucky to work with Dick Gaughan at an impressionable age,” says Wainwright. “His ability affected my singing for the duration.”Richard Hawley also saw him in the 2000s at Greystones folk club in Sheffield. “It was very quickly apparent to me that this man was a force to be reckoned with,” he says. “It was a night of powerful song that I’ll never forget.”View image in fullscreenDick Gaughan in February 2025.Photograph: Ian McCalmanGaughan’s most successful album, 1981’s Handful of Earth – a mixture of political songs and tender ballads recorded after he recovered from a breakdown – is still startling. Hawley calls it “another league away from most things in any genre of music I’ve ever heard”. It was a significant influence on Billy Bragg, who loved Gaughan’s version of The World Upside Down, which he re-recorded and still performs regularly live. On the cover, Gaughan stands dressed in black like a Gaelic Johnny Cash, knee-deep in golden wheat, with a hulking cement works brooding behind him.Harper, an author, composer and box-set compiler, was shocked to discover that only a 2019 CD remaster of this album, an introductory CD on Topic Records (gleaned from only three albums Gaughan released for that label) and a live recording from 1982, had been reissued in the last 20 years. “This is someone with a similar cultural standing in Scotland as Bert Jansch or Christy Moore in Ireland,” he says. “I felt that the universe was telling me I had to do something about this.”So he assembled a team (working for nothing, like him, or at “ultra mates’ rates”) to license, promote and create a lavish seven-CD and DVD package, complete with liner notes and archive interviews, after several reissue labels rejected his approaches.Crowdfundinghad facilitated other folk projects, he noticed, such as the forthcoming film about folklorist Doc Rowe, and the publication of fRoots magazine editor Ian A Anderson’s memoir, Alien Water. When Harper’s crowdfunding campaign launched in March, “we hoped that we might be able to raise £28,000 from fans within a month”. He remains shocked at what happened next. “We got that amount in a day.”He raised £91,985 in total. It prompted him to curate other collections including Live at the BBC: 1972-79, released this month. But the Dick Gaughan Legacy Project, as it is now called, has not been without hurdles. Harper tried and failed to license material from Celtic Music, the entity that acquired several legendary folk labels in the 1980s, including Trailer and Leader (which had gone bankrupt).Today, Celtic Music claims ownership of eight albums featuring Gaughan’s work, from his 1972 debut album No More Forever to 1995’s Clan Alba, a LP by a folk supergroup, including Patsy Seddon and Brian McNeill, which Gaughan led and produced. None are available to stream. All have been unavailable on CD for decades, except Clan Alba, which can currently be bought from Celtic Music Distribution on Amazon Marketplace for £32.Despite initial contact in which they referred to unspecified “inaccuracies” in points put to them by the Guardian, Celtic Music did not respond to a list of detailed questions.View image in fullscreenAly Bain and Dick Gaughan live in the Netherlands, 1972.Photograph: Ghenne RumsteGaughan is now living a quiet life in Edinburgh, partially sighted, and having retired from performing in 2016 after suffering an earlier stroke. The renewed interest in his work has moved him. “At the time, I did the gigs and the records without worrying too much about how it was received, because that was never my primary intention,” he says. “It’s been wonderful to realise all that actually meant something to so many people.” But, he adds, the battles with Celtic Music over the years have been “frustrating and very depressing”, and he says it’s not about the money.View image in fullscreenLast Night from Glasgow’s R/evolution box-set cover.Illustration: Dave Peabody/RedfernsCeltic Music is not listed on Companies House. Nor is Northworks, the publishing entity affiliated with Celtic Music, which claims 100% mechanical royalties (payments made whenever a song is sold physically, downloaded or streamed) to 61 of Gaughan’s works, and from whom Gaughan says he has never received a royalty statement. In July, emboldened by the interest in his music, Gaughan formally registered challenges to the companies’ claims to his publishing with the Performing Right Society (PRS): the contested works were frozen in September, the royalties held until the dispute is resolved and the rightful owner can be established.On behalf of Gaughan, Harper alsolaunched a GoFundMe campaignto help him raise £45,000 to cover legal fees to test Celtic Music’s claims: to date, the total has reached 90%, and supporters include Woody Guthrie’s daughter, Nora Guthrie, and multimillionaire music industry investor Merck Mercuriadis, who has also “made himself available to give generous advice and contacts”, says Harper.If successful, the effects of Gaughan’s actions will be far-reaching in the folk world. Other artists who have made albums claimed but not yet reissued by Celtic Music include Nic Jones (whose performing career was cut short after a car accident in 1982), Martin Simpson, Barbara Dickson and Barry and Robin Dransfield. Celtic Music also won a case against Domino Records in 2018, blocking sales of a 2017 reissue of Lal and Mike Waterson’s critically acclaimed 1972 album, Bright Phoebus, put together after the death of Celtic Music’s founder, Dave Bulmer. In a press release after the court hearing, Celtic Music promised a “programme of rereleases”, which remains eagerly awaited seven years on. Bright Phoebus is currently unavailable on Amazon. “I’m delighted that Dick Gaughan is testing the legal grounds around the continued Celtic Music claiming and hoarding of so much music from the past that people care about,” says Marry Waterson, daughter of the late Lal.‘Together in creativity for peace!’ Sain, the indie label pushing Welsh music forward for 56 yearsRead moreThe enthusiasm with which people have received the Dick Gaughan Legacy Project, however, gives Harper hope. He has already been able to give Gaughan a substantial amount of money from the Kickstarter campaign; “his first real earnings from music for years”, he says. “We’ve shown there’s an audience for Dick’s music, and so many people want to correct what I call this legacy gap in folk.”Gaughan expresses his feelings more simply, with his trademark, gentle power. “I never wanted to sing into a vacuum. I wanted to sing my songs to real human beings who are listening.”Dick Gaughan: Live at the BBC 1972-79 is out now on CD and digital on Talking Elephant, and on vinyl on Last Night from Glasgow later this year. Re/volution 1969-1984 is released via Last Night from Glasgow and will be available in record stores in early 2026.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicMusic streamingCrowdfundingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In it, she detailed what she describes as an emotional affair withRobert F Kennedy Jr, who she calls “the politician”.Not to be outdone, Nuzzi’s ex-fiance and former Politico correspondent Ryan Lizza self-published an essay dishing on the day he found out Nuzzi was cheating on him, he claims – not with RFK Jr, as one might have expected, but withanotherformer presidential candidate, Mark Sanford.The mudslinging between two of the more polarizing personalities in a profession filled with egos delighted a media class that revels in navel-gazing, schadenfreude and generally messy behavior. Over the course of four days it had a lot of material to work with.First came a glamorousprofileof Nuzzi in the New York Times Style section on Friday, in which she mugged for the camera while driving a convertible down the Pacific Coast Highway, and was described by the writer Jacob Bernstein as “a Lana Del Rey song come to life” and the “modern iteration of a Hitchcock blonde”. The profile provided some details of her “digital affair” with RFK, according to Nuzzi: how the now US health secretary told her he would take a bullet for her, how they never slept together, how sheadvised him on campaign issues (most notably thedead bear carcassstory).Then, on Monday, Nuzzi’s memoir excerpts werepublishedin Vanity Fair, the glossy that appointed her west coast editor in September. She wrote about feeling anxious about Kennedy’s reported brain worm, and said the scion soothed her after a doctor who saw his brain scans told him he was fine: “Baby, don’t worry.” She mused: “I did not have to worry about the worm that was not a worm in his brain.”The latest entry into this unfurling drama came when Lizzapublisheda “Part 1” of his side of the story on Monday night, using the metaphor of invasive bamboo growing behind the couple’s townhouse in Georgetown to describe Nuzzi’s secrecy in concealing an alleged affair with Sanford. Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and US representative who had weathered his owncheating scandalyears prior, wasprofiledby Nuzzi for New York magazine during his short-lived 2020 election challenge to Trump. According to Lizza, Nuzzi became “infatuated” with the candidate after interviewing him.Lizza placed this piece of information as a cliffhanger; presumably we must tune into an impending “Part 2” to read Lizza’s recounting of Nuzzi’s affair with RFK Jr.Journalism has a trust problem, and the fact that all this dirty laundry is getting aired is not going to help thatPatrick R JohnsonKennedy is married to actor Cheryl Hines, who hasher own memoirout this month. He has denied Nuzzi’s claims of a sexual or romantic relationship, saying they only met once for an interview. He has not commented on the memoir excerpts. Nuzzi, Lizza, Kennedy and Sanford did not respond to requests for comment.All of this makes for grade-A gossip. But while Nuzzi and Lizza are not household names outside the Beltway and New York media circles, their story has wider ramifications. Trust in the US press is at an all-time low; a recent Galluppollfound that just 28% of respondents expressed a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in newspapers, television and radio to report the news fairly and accurately. (That’s down from 31% in 2024 and 40% five years ago.)“Journalism has a trust problem, and the fact that all this dirty laundry is getting aired is not going to help that,” said Patrick R Johnson, an assistant professor of journalism at Marquette University. “Because two people with significant followings are behaving in this way, other people, everyday individuals, are going to make assumptions that more journalists are behaving this way, even though they aren’t. And that’s news literacy 101: people are making assumptions based on what they can see, whether or not that is what is happening.”The real victims of Olivia Nuzzi’s affair with RFK Jr are other female journalists | Moira DoneganRead moreThe image of a female journalist sleeping with her source titillates Hollywood (see: House of Cards or Clint Eastwood’s Richard Jewell, which portrayed a real-life but since deceased journalist bedding an FBI agent for tips, much to theangerof the journalist’s family and colleagues), the trope is mostly the stuff of fiction. It is also a majorethical violation, for obvious reasons – it creates a conflict of interest and a too-close relationship between reporter and source. As Moira Doneganwrotefor the Guardian last year, revelations like the one about Nuzzi and RFK Jr only make it “harder” for the reporter’s peers to do their jobs and “cast all female professionals under the suspicion of corruptibility and unseriousness”. (The trope apparently once bothered Nuzzi herself; in 2015, shetweeted: “Why does Hollywood think female reporters sleep with sources?”)Nuzzi, who is 32, burst on to the New York Twitterati scene as an intern in Anthony Weiner’s 2013 mayoral campaign and published an account of her experience in the New York Daily News. She parlayed this into a staff position at the Daily Beast while she was still a Fordham University undergraduate.Nuzzi covered Trump’s political rise and went on to serve as New York magazine’s first Washington DC correspondent, filing gossipy profiles of people like Donald Trump, Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen that often co-starred herself. Ahead of the 2024 election, she wrote about Joe Biden’s cognitive state, andprofiledRFK Jr when he was but a long-shot independent candidate.NuzzileftNew York magazine when their entanglement, whichviolatedthe publication’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures, was revealed shortly before the election. Shewrotein a statement that the relationship “should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict”, and apologized to her colleagues. She and Lizza broke up.Lizza, who is 51, has his own baggage: in 2017, he wasfiredfrom the New Yorker after a sexual misconduct allegation emerged in the early days of the #MeToo movement. He denied the claims and went on to write for Esquire and Politico. The couple were supposed to publish a book on the 2020 election together that never materialized.In the wake of their breakup, Nuzzi filed for a protective order against Lizza, claiming blackmail and harassment. Lizza denied her allegations, and Nuzziwithdrewher request for protection last November.In his essay, Lizza painted himself as a casualty of a mercurial ex’s “betrayal”. “It’s almost as if he’s hurt that he was the victim of her decisions” regarding RFK Jr and Sanford, said Johnson, the journalism professor. “It’s as if he’s on this weird tour to fix his image from before.”It certainly fuels the disdain that so many Americans have for journalists not being objective, not being neutralMark FeldsteinMark Feldstein spent 20 years as an on-air investigative correspondent at CNN, ABC News and other local affiliates. He is now the chair of broadcast journalism at the University of Maryland. He described the Nuzzi-Lizza story as “self-immolation on both their parts”.“This takes journalism self-branding to a crazy and extreme extent,” Feldstein said. “It certainly fuels the disdain that so many Americans have for journalists not being objective, not being neutral. This confirms the stereotype of journalists as self-promoting vultures wallowing in the gutter.”Feldstein recalled Geraldo Rivera’s 1991 memoir, Exposing Myself, which chronicled the journalist’s sexual exploits and was written off as unprofessional. “It was met with universal horror at the time among journalists, because it was such an outlandish, self-promoting, degrading publicity stunt,” Feldstein said.However, in the era of the attention economy, Nuzzi and Lizza’s tell-alls are all but expected. As Feldstein puts it: “It’s like they’ve opened their trench coats and exposed to all of us what they’re hiding underneath. It’s not a pretty sight.”Explore more on these topicsMediaRobert F Kennedy JrUS politicsTrump administrationMagazinesNewspapers & magazinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s clear whyMohamad BazziAutocrats like Prince Mohammed are eager to benefit from Trump’s brazen effort to use the presidency to enrich himself and his familyWed 19 Nov 2025 16.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 17.03 ESTShareSaudi Arabia’s crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman, visited the US this week for the first time in seven years – and Donald Trump rolled out the red carpet for his favorite Arab autocrat. On Tuesday, Trump hosted the prince for lunch and talks at the White House, followed by a black-tie dinner that included members of Congress, business leaders and top administration officials. The next day, Trump and the prince appeared together at a US-Saudi investment summit at the Kennedy Center.It’s all part of a rehabilitation tour for Prince Mohammed, years after US intelligence agencies concluded thathe had orderedthe assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and Saudi dissident. In October 2018, Khashoggi was ambushed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member hit team, who dismembered his body with a bone saw. For a time, the killing turned Prince Mohammed into an international pariah. But Trump never wavered in his support of the Saudi leader, and during his first termprotected the princefrom US sanctions and pressure from Congress.Prince Mohammed later repaid the favor to Trump: after a mob of the president’s supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, several US banks and other businessescut ties withthe Trump Organization, which was already reeling from financial losses that hammered the tourism industry at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. But Saudi Arabia stood by Trump and his family business, expanding variousreal estate dealsand golf partnerships that helped Trump at one of his lowest points. During his years out of power, the kingdom and its crown prince became one of the most importantsources of new dealsfor the Trump brand, which had become toxic for many US businesses and consumers after the Capitol riot.Trump has now rewarded Prince Mohammed with a victory tour of the US, along with new American security guarantees for the kingdom anda planned saleof billions of dollars in advanced US fighter jets. But Trump was also eager to repay the prince’s loyalty with an extravagant welcome that is usually reserved for the closest US allies. “I just want to thank you,”Trump toldthe prince at the White House on Tuesday in front of reporters and cabinet members. “We’ve been really good friends for a long period of time. We’ve always been on the same side of every issue.”Aside from heaping praise on his friend, Trump also fiercely defended the prince when a reporter asked about Khashoggi’s murder. “Things happen,”Trump saidof the assassination and then insisted that Prince Mohammed “knew nothing about it” – despite US intelligence agencies concluding otherwise during Trump’s first term.The president’s treatment of Prince Mohammed underscores his corrupt and transactional approach to governing, and the ways that wealthy autocrats have learned to exploit Trump by supporting his extensive business interests. The prince and his advisers know that Trump views the world in terms of deals won or lost – and they’re eager to cultivate a closer relationship with the president by boosting his family business, along with deals to buy US weapons and make investments. Days after Trump began his second term in January, the prince pledged he wouldinvest $600bnin the US economy over the next four years. On Tuesday, he promised to increase that pledge to $1tn, although the details of exactly how Saudi investments would reach that levelremain hazy.For Prince Mohammed, the primary goal of his visit, aside from being lavished with Trump’s praise, was to secure a defense cooperation agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia. That deal falls short of theformal defense treatythat the kingdom has sought for years, but such a treaty would require approval from Congress. For now, Trump offered an agreement to extend US defense guarantees, boost weapons sales and increase intelligence sharing. (In September, Trump signed a similarexecutive orderfocused on Qatar, which promised the US would come to the emirate’s defense if it is attacked.)The prince also signed a deal for Saudi Arabia to buy dozens of F-35 stealth fighter jets, America’s most advanced warplane.Pentagon officials are worriedthat, if the sale goes through in the coming years, China might be able to acquire the plane’s technology through espionage or its security partnership with the kingdom. For his part, Trump tried to persuade the Saudi leader to establish diplomatic relations with Israel now that the US administration has brokered a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza. Trump dreams of securing a Nobel peace prize by negotiating an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but the prince has vowed not to sign a deal with Israel until it commits to the establishment of a Palestinian state.Even if Prince Mohammed did not relent on a normalization deal with Israel, he has amassed more goodwill with Trump than most other world leaders. And much of that benevolence is rooted in Saudi Arabia’s support for Trump’s golf resorts and other businesses when he was out of office. After the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the PGA of America cancelled its 2022 major championship at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “It’s become clear that conducting the PGA championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand,”the group’s presidentsaid at the time.But Trump soon convinced a rival group, the LIV Golf league, which is financed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund that is controlled by the crown prince, tohost its tournamentsat his golf courses. The tournaments brought Trump’s properties back into the professional golfing circuit after the Trump Organization had lost the PGA championship, one of golf’s four major competitions. The LIV Golf tournaments, which have been held at Trump courses in Bedminster, Miami and Washington, providedmillions of dollarsin revenue for the Trump family business.And the Saudi-backed league is still paying to use Trump’s properties for its tournaments, even after his reelection. In April, Trump’s golf club outside Miami hosted athree-day tournamentfor the LIV Golf circuit, an event that was almost entirely funded by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. LIV Golf paid the Trump Organizationa site rental feeof around seven figures, which doesn’t include revenue generated by hotel room rentals, restaurants and other services. In 2023, Trump calledthe incomehis businesses receive from deals like those with LIV Golf “peanuts”. Butgovernance watchdog groupssay the Saudi-backed league’s payments to Trump’s golf courses violate the constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which prohibits the president from receiving gifts from foreign powers.In Trump’s first term, his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, cultivated a close relationship between the president and Prince Mohammed, who at the time was consolidating power as the kingdom’s de-facto ruler under his ailing father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. After Khashoggi’s assassination in 2018, the prince became more dependent on Trump and Kushner, who worked to protect him from fallout over the journalist’s murder.As members of Congress demanded sanctions against the crown prince, Trump maintained his support for the Saudi leader and pressed forcontinued weapons salesand business deals with the kingdom. Prince Mohammed eventually blamed rogue Saudi operatives for the gruesome killing. But aUS intelligence report, which Trump refused to make public, concluded that the crown prince had ordered the assassination.The report, which was released by Joe Biden’s administration a month after it took office, noted that since 2017, Prince Mohammed “has had absolute control of the kingdom’s security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the crown prince’s authorization”.Days after Khashoggi’s killing, Trump was asked by reporters in the Oval Office whether he would cancel billions of dollars in US weapons sales to Saudi Arabia if its leaders were implicated. “We don’t like it even a little bit,”Trump responded. “But whether or not we should stop $110bn from being spent in this country… That would not be acceptable to me.”At the time, Trump’s comments about the loss of arms sales struck many as a crass attempt to justify Khashoggi’s assassination. But Trump had dropped any pretense of concern for human rights and political freedoms, which past US presidents used to obscure decades of American military support for repressive regimes likeSaudi Arabia. Trump stripped the US-Saudi alliance down to its transactional core: Washington protects the House of Saud in exchange for the Saudi regime keeping global oil prices stable and buying a steady supply of US weapons.With little restraint on his powers, Trump has expanded that corrupt and transactional method of governing in his second term. And autocrats like Prince Mohammed are eager to benefit from Trump’s brazen effort to use the presidency to enrich himself and his family.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpMohammed bin SalmanSaudi ArabiacommentShareReuse this content"

Given the track record of the mega-rich, it may do the oppositeWed 19 Nov 2025 10.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 10.21 ESTShareSit down and pay attention, because this column might change your life. I bring you tidings from theNazi-filledwilderness that is now X, whereMaga-adjacentbillionaire Bill Ackman has generously decided todispense romantic adviceto the masses. Online culture, Ackman notes, has “destroyed the ability to spontaneously meet strangers”. The antidote to this, he suggests, are four simple words.“May I meet you?”That’s it. That’s the strategy. Ackman used this pickup line throughout his youth and, he says, it served him well. He didn’t even have to put “I’m a billionaire,” in front of the sentence – it was the syntax that women found sexy.“I think the combination of proper grammar and politeness was the key to its effectiveness,” Ackman mused. “You might give it a try.” And by “you”, he explains, he means everyone, not just young heterosexual men. “I think it should also work for women seeking men as well as same sex interactions,” Ackman proclaimed.View image in fullscreenBill Ackman speaks at the Wall Street Journal digital conference in Laguna Beach, California, on 17 October 2017.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersA real man of the people, Ackman took time out of his busy billionaire schedule to add a little more context to his advice, which he explains is motivated by concern about the “next generation’s happiness and population replacement rates”. Per Ackman, you should try to be in motion while chatting someone up. This strategy “works much more effectively when you are moving”,he noted. “So on subways, elevators, escalators, airplanes, buses, and even walking down the street, it is most effective.”I have debased myself for numerous columns (just Google “Arwa Mahdawi accidental laxatives” or “Arwa banana”) but I do have my limits. Walking around the streets of Philadelphia asking women who set off my gaydar “may I meet you?” being one of them.But while I haven’t tried the Ackman approach myself, the advice has gone viral and various other people aregiving it a whirl. It’s too early to do a quantitative assessment of its effectiveness but I hope that some enterprising social scientists are applying for funding for a future study. It’s perfect material for a futureIg Nobel prize.Young people might go out on the town more if the cost of living hadn’t become so expensive, and they had more disposable incomeWhile we wait for a peer-reviewed analysis to come out, I must confess that I have my doubts that imposing yourself on strangers in the subway is going to do much to help “population replacement rates”. This may be a wild take but it’s possible that not supporting genocidal wars (Ackman has been abig cheerleaderof Israel’s actions in Gaza) that have made prenatal carevirtually nonexistentand killed an average ofa child an hour, might be more effective when it comes to population replacement. That’s assuming we think all populations are equal, of course.Doing something about the exorbitant price of childcare, and the dire state of public schools in affordable areas of the US might also encourage more people to have kids. Since I’m churning out the hot takes over here, it’s also possible that young people might go out on the town more if the cost of living hadn’t become so expensive, and they hadmore disposable income. In short: solving underlying social issues that wealth-hoarding billionaires have exacerbated might prove more effective than a grammatically interesting pickup line.But what do I know, eh? I’m not a billionaire. Far better if plebs like me keep quiet and listen to our social and economic betters. So, in that spirit, and in the hopes of solving the population crisis, I have put together a few bits of relationship advice from the rich and infamous:1Putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing: avoid at all costsOnce you have found your future spouse through the May-I-Meet™ method, you should try to hold on to them. According to our great leader Donald Trump that means avoiding a working relationship. “If you’re in business for yourself, I really think it’s a bad idea to put your wife working for you. I think it’s a really bad idea. I think that was the single greatest cause of what happened to my marriage with [first wife] Ivana,” Trump toldABC newsin 1994. RIP Ivana, who is now dead andburied under the first holeof Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.2 Sabotage your co-worker’s carFox News host Jesse Watters is not a billionaire like Ackman or Trump, but he lives in amansionso is still worth listening to. During a 2022 episode of the panel series The Five, Watters boasted that he “let the air out of“ now wife Emma DiGiovine’s tires when he “was trying to get [her] to date” him. “She couldn’t go anywhere. She needed a lift, I said, ‘Hey, you need a lift?’ She hopped right in the car,” Watters recalled. The Fox news host was 43 at the time, by the way, and DiGiovine, who is his second wife, was 29 and anassociate producer on his showat Fox News. After some backlash about “Deflategate” he claimed this tactic, which he said “works like a charm”,was a joke.Jeffrey Epstein’s emails reveal a disdain for morality among the elite | Moira DoneganRead more3Cozy up to a sex offender (DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT)The latest batch of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents to be released reveal that Harvard professor and economist Larry Summersspent years discussingrelationship advice with the convicted pedophile. In one 2018 email, Summers forwarded Epstein an email from a woman and asked for advice on when to write back. “Think no response for a while probably appropriate,” Summers said. Epstein agreed: “she’s already beginning to sound needy :) nice.” In another email Summers complained that attitudes to dating had become too woke. The “American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard,” he wrote to Epstein. “But hit on a few women 10 years ago and can’t work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”4Offer your sperm to strangers over supperIf one is simply concerned with increasing the population rather than meeting a life partner you can always go the Elon Musk route and donate your sperm willy-nilly. According to a2024 New York Times report, Musk has “offered his own sperm to friends and acquaintances”. The same piece notes: “At a dinner party held at the home of a well-known Silicon Valley executive [in 2023] Mr. Musk offered to provide his sperm to a married couple he had met socially only a handful of times.” (Musk has denied this.) Or, if that sounds too exhausting, you can be like Russian-born billionaire Pavel Durov andfund free IVF treatmentsfor women who use your sperm. Durov now hasmore than 100 biological childrenin 12 countries via sperm donation. Perhaps, in the future, one of Durov’s children will bump into one of Musk’s many children and ask: “May I meet you?”Explore more on these topicsThe super-richOpinionDatingDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinElon MuskUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Drops and brandy don’t touch the sides – but thanks to a friendly singer, I’ve learned a more extreme regime for countering the snufflesWed 19 Nov 2025 12.43 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 14.41 ESTShareThis time last year, I was on a TV programme with three singers. There was a rapper of Ghanaian heritage, a big pop star, and a famous mezzo-soprano. It was deep midwinter. The night before, I’d been at an old friend’s 60th birthday, crammed into the function room of a pub somewhere in Surrey. It had been a good night, but now, just for something to say, I wondered how it was possible to avoid catching a cold when half the people at the party were players in a symphony of coughs, sneezes, snuffles and nose-blows. By the way, how come some people have nose-blows like trumpets, and others don’t? A question for another day.At mention of my night out, this trio of troubadours in the TV green room did two things. First, they shrunk away from me slightly. Second, they engaged in a feverishly enthusiastic discussion on how to avoid catching colds which, naturally enough given their line of work, was something of an obsession for them. I get that, but I have skin in this game too – I must avoid colds at all costs because the colds I get are worse than anyone else’s. I don’t have a medical certificate to confirm this, but I know it to be true. My colds last longer. My nose is more blocked, my throat is scratchier, my coughing fits are louder, barkier and apparently endless. My family, wise to the couple of quick throat-clearances which herald the coming storm, either kick me out of the room, or clear the room themselves. Back when I presented football on ITV, my poor colleagues in the studio gallery grew attuned to the warning signs. “Cans off!” the studio director would holler to his team, before I deafened them all, blowing the wiring in their headphones.As for my blocked noses, don’t start me. Sprays, drops, even the electric shock of fumes of boiling plum brandy my mum prescribes … they all work for a while before admitting defeat. And there’s nothing as pitiable as the sound of a Birmingham accent spoken without the benefit of air passing through the nostrils. I mean, it sounds a bit nasally restricted at the best of times. At least this elicits sympathy, which isn’t always a good thing. In my first year away at university, away from my mum and her medicinal brandy, the cleaner in our halls of residence took pity on me. “I’ve got just the thing for that, you poor thing. I’ll be back in a minute.” She was very lovely, very Irish, and very insistent that I ate the peeled, raw onion she brought to my sickbed. She stood and watched me do so. Bless her. Didn’t achieve anything, I’m afraid, apart from sending my guts into raptures and making my breath smell terrible.So no, I hate colds and am quite sure that prevention is better than the cures which, onion-based or otherwise, don’t work. I paid close attention then, along with the rapper and the pop star, when the mezzo-soprano walked us through her cold avoidance regime. With forthcoming bookings to sing for her supper over Christmas, she clearly took it all very seriously. She commanded us to apply hand sanitiser on the hour, every hour (all winter long, as far as I could deduce) and, in addition to this, there were special precautions required when it came to parties and what not. Ahead of any such engagement, she recommended a couple of blasts of Vicks First Defence (other brands are available) up each nostril – whether you felt a cold coming or not.Extreme. I like it. And, get this, she insisted on following it up after the party with another couple of squirts of the same stuff.I was in. And I have to say, I snuffled not once all last winter. There were downsides: the countless bottles of First Defence I bought, mislaid, bought again, found, etc. And that dispiriting moment you realise you’ve sat on the little vessel of hand gel you left in your back pocket and it’s now splurging everywhere. Still, all a price worth paying. And now winter’s upon us again, I’m re-armed to the teeth with the mezzo-soprano’s recommended ordnance. I’m ready for battle.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCommon coldHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

My mother answered the phone which sat on a bench in a book-lined downstairs room we reverentially called “the den” which included a special shelf for the White and Yellow Pages (remember them?). Mum gave this caller the third degree – who was she and what did she want? – before eventually summonsing me to the phone to name the “very forward” girl asking to speak to me.Kill me now. Just the memory …That was the thing about the landline. It pretty much ensured that parents and siblings could glean way too much about any fledgling romantic and social interactions just as we learned a lot about our parents because of a) the people who called them, and b) what we deliberately or otherwise overheard them talking about over the landline.I know – smartphones have done all sorts of evil to our own and our kids’ brains. They have also totally changed the way phone calls are made and received.Back home in the late 1970s when the phone rang in the den it was a family moment. You’d answer formally –Hello, 8361 …(this was part of our actual number and its entirety is burnt into my memory along with the home numbers of some of my closer cousins and friends),Paul speaking.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsIf it was someone I knew (an aunt or uncle who seemed to call Mum every day, one of Dad’s business associates or a friend of my sister) some polite conversation would ensue before the intended recipient was notified.Similarly, when I’d ring a mate I might first have to speak to one of his siblings or his parents about the weather, the Collingwood football club’s malaise, my beach holiday, schoolwork, or what I was reading or listening to lately.Thebrnng-brnngof the phone was always a household moment. Was it ringing for me or was it a portent of bad news about an elderly relative … or maybe just something prosaic from the dry cleaner, the vet or the mechanic? Regardless, the landline was uniquely integral to the (semi-)open book of family life.It would ring totally without warning. Now, when our smartphones ring unexpectedly with an actual unheralded phone call, we are startled. Many people text to presage voice calling someone else and they get anxious before ringing strangers about administrative matters.Anyway, nobody actuallyringsordialsany more (I remember decades ago when our son was startled by the dusty old rotary dial phone in my parents’ garage as if it were some instrument of torture or intergalactic messaging device).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

My adult kids’ romantic lives, for instance, have pretty much always been completely opaque to me until they’ve wanted them otherwise.I’m not saying this is good or bad. It just is.To illustrate how things have changed I could tell them, perhaps, about the girlfriend I had at 17 whose tyrannical father, if he answered, would convey to me no matter when I’d rung that that my call was “intrusive and inconvenient” before hanging up on me.But I’m not sure they’d quite believe it. It would be as alien to them as that rotary dial landline in their grandparents’ garage.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsTelecomsOpinionFamilyAustralian lifestyleSmartphonescommentShareReuse this content"

As a marker of social pariahdom, Holocaust denial is up there with – or perhaps even more potent than – a conviction for sex offences, and I turned around and walked out; not through any particular moral superiority, but because I thought “notoriety” as a criteria for inclusion on a guest list was stupid and offensive. As I left, I remember looking across the room at the host and thinking: you silly bloody bint, I’m embarrassed for you.I thought about that party and Irving this week while reading, with grim amusement, the absolute scramble currently under way in the US among media and other public figures seeking toexplain, justify, downplayand generally paddle away as fast as they can from their social interactions with Jeffrey Epstein. I’m not talking about the men alleged to have joined the late paedophile in abusing trafficked girls, but rather the apparently endless list of notable figures – mostly in New York, but also reaching down to Washington DC, and acrossAmerica’s Ivy League campuses– who enjoyed his hospitality, appeared with him at parties, and exchanged cordial emails with the man long after his true nature was known. As the Senatevoted this weekto release the Epstein files, the chorus of “we didn’t know!” from certain corners grew so loud it might’ve been Germany in 1946.For those who associated, however glancingly, with Epstein, the major stumbling block to an effective claim of ignorance is, obviously, the paedophile’s 2008 conviction and subsequent prison sentence for soliciting an underage girl for sex. That phrase – “soliciting underage girls”, along with its sister phrase, “sex trafficking of minors” – has a sanitised, legal air that, back in the 2010s, would’ve allowed more moral wriggle room among those wanting to remain in contact with Epstein than, say, words along the lines of, “child rapist”.And so claim ignorance they did – and still do. This week, new names from the Epstein email dump triggered a wave of new denials,including one from Deepak Chopra, the so-called guru of spiritual enlightenment, shown to have been in frequent email contact with Epstein after his conviction, and whose advice he sought on various matters. In a vague, nothing-to-see-here statement, Chopra said, “in this case, I hope that all of the truth comes out after ongoing and proper investigations. I’m happy to share whatever I know with authorised officials”. Per Chopra’s teachings, let’s hope karma is indeed a bitch.Or Katie Couric, a woman we can confidently say would turn up to the opening of an envelope, who attended a dinner at Epstein’s house in New York in 2010, two years after his first conviction. Couric has yet to surface in this round of Epstein coverage, but in 2023, while publicising her memoir,she said: “I didn’t know anything about Jeffrey Epstein at the time … I should have done a little more research … but a lot of the stuff about him hadn’t come out yet.” This echoed the justifications made by George Stephanopoulos, present at the same Epstein dinner as Couric – the then Prince Andrew was there, too – whotold the New York Times, “I should have done more due diligence”.Since then, the potential cost of being found to have been friendly – or even to have been invited to dinner – with Epstein has become far steeper. An enjoyablepiecein the New York Times at the weekend set off a relay race of panicked denials as one prominent figure threw the stick of dynamite to another, starting with the publicist Peggy Siegal, who was in frequent and apparently friendly email contact with Epstein and offered to help him out with a PR thing.Actually, Siegal told the newspaper, she hadn’t helped him at all. “People say things just to get people off the phone,” she said referring to an offer she’d made to take an email of Epstein’s that showed him in a good light, and “cut and paste and send it to Arianna Huffington”.Huffington must’ve been furious with Siegal for bringing her name into it, and promptly told the New York Times: “I was never contacted.” Meanwhile, Tina Brown was busytellingthe same newspaper that an invitation to dinner at Epstein’s was so offensive to her that she had an outburst in the Daily Beast newsroom “What the hell is this – the Predator’s Ball?”, Brown said on the phone to Epstein’s publicist, she recalled. In the current climate, it may not be enough to have turned down an invitation to Epstein’s for dinner; simply to have been asked – to have been considered someone who might’ve said yes – requires repeated and strenuous rebuttal.The reason for these very emphatic denials is not merely because so many people said yes to Epstein long after his conviction, but because of who they were, upmarket hacks who love to be at the centre of the story, whatever that might be. This is the weakness Epstein played on, the vanity of those who like to be on the inside and think a well-curated dinner party with important, famous or wealthy guests is the greatest thing on Earth – greater, perhaps, than any other consideration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It could be his last day on Earth,” David Haye tells Sky News, with the sort of apocalyptic glare I try to give my children when they want to jump in a muddy puddle.Yes, this week everyone appears to be deeply concerned for the wellbeing of 28-year-old YouTube celebrity Jake Paul. The announcement of his fight againstAnthony Joshuanext month has generated a flood of foreboding prognoses, and fair enough. Stepping into the ring with a two-time world heavyweight champion when a) you’re not even a heavyweight, b) your record consists almost entirely of novices and geriatrics and c) you still fight like a marmoset trapped in an empty crisp packet: on some level, we all know how this might go.Here’s how it’s actually going to go, if it even happens. Jake Paul is going to be fine. Jake Paul: structurally unharmed. Jake Paul will gurn for the celebrities at ringside – maybe Lionel Messi, maybe Snoop Dogg – and at one point he will almost certainly drop his arms to his sides and dare Joshua to hit him. Jake Paul will hang in there.Obviously Jake Paul will eventually lose, and there may even be some cartoon blood spat in the process. But at the end they’re going to hug and Joshua is going to call Paul a warrior, a true fighter, and the pair will hoist their arms skywards, and most importantly Jake Paul’s name will be everywhere, and Jake Paul will live to grift another day. Not to spoil anybody’s fun, of course. But while I do not profess to be any great analyst of boxing, I do happen to know a thing or two about the internet. And what we essentially have here is the ultimate collision of these two worlds, these two kinds of fame and power, the pure athlete and the performance artist, the puncher and the prankster, meeting on weird middle ground. Is this sport or stunt? And is it still even meaningful to distinguish the two?View image in fullscreenAnthony Joshua celebrates victory over Andy Ruiz Jr.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesThe first thing to note is that the danger is the point. Or rather, theperceptionof danger. The idea that Paul may get seriously hurt as a result of this fight, or even die, scandalises many lovers of the sport. Which is exactly why it must be invoked as often and as gruesomely and as gratuitously as possible. This is the stuff that turns the wheels, sells the tickets, outrages the traditionalists. A dead Jake Paul: even to read these words will feel to some of you like a thrilling incantation, awful and alluring in equal measure, one that may just persuade you to watch on Netflix.And, of course, Paul has always known this. Part of his macabre genius is his ability to intuit – on some deep and shameful level – what you really, truly want, and then to pump it into your bloodstream and keep pumping. This is a guy who, along with his older brother Logan, has been chasing YouTube fame since he was a child. This is an algorithm native: a man steeped in hard numbers, dark desires, white lies and the unfailingly lucrative relationships between them.To revisit Paul’s YouTube feed, which goes back to 2014, is basically to witness a kind of real-time machine learning. At the start a lot of his videos have titles like “I Graduated High School” and “Fireworks In The Park!” This does OK, but soon enough he works out what does even better. And so over time the wholesome teenage stuff gives way to the confrontations, the clickbait, the madcap stunts. “Hanging From 300ft Cliff”. “Here’s How I Lost $300,000 dollars [sic] in 10 seconds”. “I Spent 24hrs BURIED IN SOLID CONCRETE”. And if big-time boxing is all about creating suitable matches, internet culture thrives on the outlandish mismatch. A man tries to put an iPad in a blender. One Jew debates 500 Nazis. Ordinary bloke tries to last eight rounds with Anthony Joshua wearing regulation 10oz gloves. This is basically sport as elaborate viral hoax, and to harrumph about things like veracity or integrity is about as fatuous as wondering whetherDerren Brown really had bulletsin his Russian roulette pistol.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of his pranks are so blatantly staged that it’s hard not to imagine that the joke is tacitly on the audience. Even his marriage to fellow content creator Tana Mongeau in 2019 was later revealed to be a sham for content. I watched the concrete video all the way through. He doesn’t spend 24 hours buried in it. He bails after about six. Personally, I’m sceptical it was more than about 15 minutes. “This is America,” Paul brags on his reality TV show. “The currency isn’t being liked. It’s attention. What can you do with attention? The answer is anything.” Well, almost. Attention might earn you the Joshua fight in the first place, but it’s not going to stop a crushing straight right from rearranging your dentistry. Or can it? Does the fight even happen in the first place? “I don’t believe a single thing until I see them in the ring,” said Tony Bellew. “Even if they come together for a presser. It won’t happen. It can’t happen.” And even if it does, will Joshua even bother training properly? Does he decide to carry Paul for a few rounds, as Floyd Mayweather essentially did with Conor McGregor in 2017? If the killer angle opens up does he take it, or switch down to the body? Why go to the trouble of maiming the biggest payday in the sport?One of the reasons I find celebrity boxing so interesting and alarming is that it is one of the few prototypes of modern sport articulating exactly what it wants. This is sport stripped of the niceties, the trappings and inhibitions. The only true worth here is fame and bluster, money and eyeballs. It’s a grift and you will happily watch us grifting, because you want this. And even if you don’t want this, we will force-feed it into all the places you get your sport, your favourite websites and your social feeds and your betting apps, until you do want it. It has often been said that the death of a sport comes when the viewer can no longer believe what they are seeing.Boxinghas always required its audience to accept a little incredulity as part of the bargain, and yet the runaway success of its algorithmic late-capitalist form hints at a stage beyond. Where you don’t believe what you’re seeing, and you no longer care, and you watch it anyway.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuacommentShareReuse this content"

As 2025 draws to a close, a moment of reckoning has arrived.According to EUestimates, Ukraine will need more than €70bn in extra financial assistance next year to keep defending itself against Vladimir Putin. That money won’t be coming from Washington, where Donald Trump hasrefusedto seek new funding for military aid from Congress. Yet Kyiv’s ability to negotiate an acceptable peace depends on its capacity to withstand Mr Putin’s relentless war of attrition, which is designed to drain Ukraine of the resources necessary to resist, and to weaken the resolve of its European allies.The International Monetary Fund, currently in negotiations with Kyiv over new loans reportedly worth about $8bn, haswarnedthat its own decisions will depend on what the EU decides to come up with. The threat of a disastrous cash crunch by the spring, which could lead to a drying up of funds for basic social infrastructure as well as the military, is real. The risk of potentially catastrophic damage to morale, and Ukrainian bargaining power, is obvious. But until now, the urgency of the situation has not been matched by a swiftness of response in Brussels.After months of debate – and wrangling at a European Council summit in October – the idea of a €140bn “reparations loan” to Ukraine underwritten by frozen Russian assets has still to be agreed. If Belgian legal reservations – the money is held in a Belgium‑based financial institution – cannot be overcome, a possible alternative would involve EU member states raising the cash themselves through the issuance of common debt. That would be unpopular with the so-called frugal countries of northern Europe. But as the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen,pointed outthis week, “perfect or simple solutions … do not exist”.The prevarication needs to have ended by the time EU leaders meet in December for the last council meeting of the year. Thesabotageof Poland’s rail network, attributed by Warsaw to Ukrainian citizens working for Russian intelligence, again raised fears over the extent to which Moscow is prepared to use hybrid warfare in Nato countries to advance its aims. To invest in the protection of Ukraine is also to invest in Europe’s future security, as Mr Putin seeks a carve-up that would allow him to cast a long and menacing shadow over the EU’s eastern flank.This week, Mr Zelenskyy was once againtouringEuropean capitals, seeking to bolster Ukrainian defences as a fourth winter of war approaches. His lobbying task has been complicated by a new corruptionscandalinvolving kickbacks at Ukraine’s nuclear energy body. As Kyiv seeks to push forward in talks on EU accession, that is a damaging blow. But a year that began with a dismal turn of events in Washington for the Ukrainian president needs to end with good news from Brussels. Mr Putin believes he is able, if necessary, to outlast Ukraine and the EU to achieve his revanchist goals. He must be disabused of that notion.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Net migration has in fact been falling since beforeLabourcame to power last July, and yet there has been no end of demand for ever tighter controls and no end of government acquiescence.New figures published this week by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),adjusting historical datafor methodological changes, show that net migration was 944,000 for the year ending March 2023 – about 40,000 higher than had previously been thought. The drop since then has also been steeper. The number for the year ending December 2024 is now thought to be 345,000 – lower than the earlier count by 86,000.The fact that the initial figures were wrong raises difficult questions for the ONS. Ministers making policy should have access to reliable data. Political arguments should be predicated on numbers that voters can trust. But even before revision, the downward trend in data was clear. Net migration spiked in 2022, in part because of population flows connected to the easing of pandemic restrictions, but also because Britain welcomedlarge numbersof people seeking sanctuary from the Ukraine war and fleeing Chinese repression in Hong Kong.These were one-off events. Meanwhile, the systematic tightening of visa conditions has, as intended, limited the volume of arrivals. The number of people leaving the UK has grown – mostly recent immigrants returning to their countries of origin, plus longer-established nationals emigrating. If these trends continue as expected, the net figure will keep coming down.Recent analysis by the thinktankUK in a Changing Europeforecasts a drop to between 70,000 and 170,000 in 2026. That is still a positive sum and unacceptable to radical rightwing parties that demand zero immigration and the removal of people already settled in Britain. And while such rhetoric is encroaching into mainstream politics, the practical implications of such an extreme agenda – the brutality of forced expulsions, the violence inflicted on Britain’s social fabric, the economic sabotage involved in wilfully shrinking the labour force – would not be palatable to the vast majority of people.Even a less drastic change, with migration patterns simply following the current trajectory, involves significant consequences that are not being addressed. Provision of social care, already a struggling sector, faces a mounting recruitment crisis in the absence of migrant workers. Without a steady supply of overseas students, many universities, already with precarious finances, will be pushed over the brink. Migration tends to boost the proportion of working-age adults in the labour market. As thatratio changes, growth is harder to achieve and Treasury revenues shrink, with painful fiscal consequences.None of these forces has shaped political debate in the run-up to the budget. Instead, the Home Office has announced anotherset of measuresdesigned to signal ever more ferocious intent to control the nation’s borders.The government’s immigration policy has been devised to placate – and, all too often, to mimic – the irate chorus that fulminates against perceived inundation by foreigners. That attitude would be cowardly and shortsighted even if net migration were not falling. That it continues as the numbers decline reveals a worrying political monomania increasingly detached from economic reality.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Such large‑scale redundancies are bound to create problems.There are other threats to the delivery of NHS services too. The privatisation of the NHS is happening in plain sight. Last month, the governmentproudly announcedthat “A total of 6.15 million appointments, tests and operations were delivered by independent providers for NHS patients this year”, an almost 500,000 increase on last year, which it says is “helping to cut waiting times [and] free up NHS capacity”.How can this be so? There’s a finite number of doctors, nurses and surgeons in the country. If medical staff increase their work in the private sector, they decrease their availability forNHSwork.Moreover, overwhelmingly it’s the NHS, not the private sector, that trains future NHS staff. In 2002-03, only 0.1% ofNHS hip replacementswere done by the private sector; by 2017-18, that figure was 30%.Newcastle University researchers have found that the private sector is now substituting for, not adding to, NHS capacity, and that this is leading to “reduced in-house provision” and “longer waits for all”. The government should be urgently seeking to put an end to the use of the private sector, not promoting it. If it fails to do so, who will train the surgeons of the future?Margaret GreenwoodFormer MP for Wirral WestHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I am a retired consultant anaesthetist who worked in the NHS for 40 years. Throughout my career, I felt that I was totally underpaid for my work.As a junior doctor in the 1970s and up until my consultant appointment in 1991, I was paid a pittance for working excessive, unsafe hours – often 80 to 100 hours a week. Accommodation and catering were minimal. Overtime was paid at a much lower rate.Historically, various governments have failed to recognise our commitment to patients. We’re basically cheap labour. I feel that we have been taken advantage of for decades, and it’s about time that this historical abuse was recognised. A correct and up-to-date pay rise would go some way towards recompense.Goodwill and a true vocation kept us going. Some of the consequences will never be known or acknowledged by the public or the various governments in power. We lost a lot of good people because of the high pressure and stress during this time. It won’t help me now, but I fully back the resident doctors.After 40 years as a doctor, and eventually as a senior consultant, my final year’s salary, before tax, was just over £101,000. A bit pathetic, don’t you think? And I didn’t do much private practice – so little that it didn’t justify the time, effort and insurance. I can wholeheartedly say that my aim was to make all my patients’ lives better, every day. Most days, I think I did.Elizabeth TaylorNorton, South YorkshireAs a paediatric NHS consultant, I would like to state that I am not a member of the British Medical Association and would not consider striking. I believe I have an extremely well-paid job with a good work-life balance, and I am immensely grateful to be able to do the job I do. Unfortunately, no matter how many of us resign from the BMA, there doesn’t seem to be an alternative voice that is heard.Dr Natasha de VereWakefield, West YorkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromMoira RobinsonWed 19 Nov 2025 12.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 14.42 ESTShareJohn Harris correctly identifies that the UK is hopelessly unprepared for flooding, but is wrong to suggest that the public is not told about the threat (Flooded and forgotten: the UK’s waters are rising and we’re being kept in the dark, 16 November). In fact, the UK has some of the most detailed and accurate flood-risk information in the world. The Environment Agency publishes comprehensive flood-risk maps and impact information that is searchable by address, and regularly undertakes public-information campaigns.The north-east of England has also pioneered community flood-resilience officers, whose sole purpose is to engage with at-risk communities and to encourage the development of “community resilience”, a model increasingly being mirrored in other regions.What is puzzling is that these efforts, alongside extensive coverage of flooding in the media, have had little or no impact on enhancing the metrics of community awareness or preparedness. A2016 pollby the Environment Agency indicated that only 45% of people living in at-risk areas appreciate their risk and only 7% identify any risk to their own property.Exactly why the UK public fails to appreciate the scale of the flood-risk challenge is a complex issue, but the extensive centralisation and technocratic dominance of engineers and infrastructure-based solutions in flood management (and in environmental management more broadly) plays a strong role.In a context where the public is largely excluded from any role in environmental management or decision-making, simply expecting people to protect themselves is naive. Why would they when there is an expectation that someone else will do it for them?Root-and-branch reform of how flooding is managed is needed to reconnect people to their watery environments and improve public understanding and engagement with flooding as a societal challenge. Critically, this must include the devolution of flood-management powers to local and regional levels, not through theEnvironment Agencybut via effectively funded and revitalised local authorities.Our priority must be building trusted and effective relationships between risk-management authorities and communities, helping to develop unified understandings of risk, and working with them to manage risk and build resilience by combining infrastructure, nature-based solutions and community activity.Dr Ed RollasonKelloe, County DurhamThe illustration by Nathalie Lees accompanying John Harris’s article would have been an apt front cover for Ian McEwan’s new book What We Can Know, in which he lays out, in supposedly fictional terms, the result of flood waters rising.

Their manager was delighted to end that long wait, especially as he believes it has harmed the nation’s football development. “This should stimulate or motivate young players to go out and become Scotland internationals in the future,” said Clarke. “Hopefully there is a legacy from this group of players to the younger generations and we don’t wait so long to go to the next tournament and the next tournament.Scotland’s wild World Cup moment was built by collective will and individual brilliance | Ewan MurrayRead more“By the way, it is more difficult to qualify for the World Cup than it used to be. If you look at the stats, it is really difficult to qualify. It is incredible, even [versus] when the boys went to France ’98. There were 15 European teams in a 32-team tournament. That is almost 50%. But this one is 16 out of 48, almost a third. You see the World Cup getting bigger and you think: ‘It must be easier to get there.’ But it is not, it is more difficult to get there.”Despite a lengthy career at Chelsea, Clarke was overlooked for the World Cups of 1990 and 1998. He used that lingering disappointment not only as personal motivation but also to inspire his players in the team hotel before the game against ­Denmark. “The manager’s speech was ­unbelievable,” said Andy ­Robertson, the captain. “He went into a little bit about his life and the lads were quite emotional.

The case law on scheme benefits, deliverability, relevance, material considerations and irrationality merits review.”SWP maintains that the expansion plans will create a “tennis industrial complex”, which will damage the environment and has failed to properly listen to the community. It is also fighting its legal battle with the All England Club on two other fronts, including a separate court case in January, where a judge will consider the possibility that the golf course could be subject to a “statutory trust” and thus be reserved for public recreation.It is also considering whether to go to court to challenge a “restrictive covenant” given by the AELTC committee in 1993 in which it promised never to develop the land.“This is a David and Goliath struggle,” Save Wimbledon Park said in a statement. “The AELTC is a rich and well-connected corporate developer which has worked for decades to take over a substantial part of this highly protected public Park for its own purposes.”Christopher Coombe, a local lawyer who opposes the plans, said: “SWP has never been anti-tennis. We believe that it is high time for the AELTC to recognise the raft of legal and principled problems with its proposals and sit down and talk constructively with SWP and the local community.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The jury is outRead moreDaly has not played any competitive rugby since breaking his armagainst the Queensland Redson the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia, but Borthwick has wasted no time reinstating him on the left wing and believes the versatile Saracens three-quarter still has plenty of international rugby in him.“I think he is in as good a shape as I have ever seen him,” Borthwick said, having announced a reshuffled selection with Henry Slade, Ben Spencer, Asher Opoku-Fordjour, Ellis Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie restored to the starting XV. “I think he hit very close to his fastest speed ever the other day in training … he can’t wait to go. So I’ve no doubt [about] the next couple of years until the World Cup. Somebody who reads the game as well as him can go even beyond that.“I always think those smart players can keep playing even later in their careers, because they have such intelligence about the game. I think Elliot’s in that category.”Add Daly’s Lions Test experience and 73 England caps, his ability to play multiple positions, his high‑ball aptitude plus a raking left boot and the basis for Borthwick’s faith is understandable. It is less uplifting news, however, for the clutch of younger players who might conceivably have hoped to benefit from the injuries to Tom Roebuck and Tommy Freeman. For now Henry Arundell, Cadan Murley, Noah Caluori and Adam Radwan will have to remain patient.If they are looking for a positive role model in that regard they need only turn to Slade, who has not had a sniff this autumn despite his outstanding club form for Exeter. Now, following aninjury to Ollie Lawrence, he is finally back in England’s midfield alongside Fraser Dingwall with the head coach singling out both his attitude and enduring ability for praise. “When he played the first Test in Argentina in the summer, I thought it was one of the best games he has played for England,” Borthwick said. “I thought he was absolutely fantastic.”Elsewhere the team to face the Pumas reflects the management’s desire to continue developing depth in certain positions. Joe Heyes has been excellent for England over the past six months while Will Stuart has been good off the bench but, for this game, Borthwick has handed the tighthead jersey to Sale’s Opoku‑Fordjour, who is still just 21.Quick GuideEngland team to play ArgentinaShowEngland v Argentina, Allianz Stadium, 4.10pm GMT, Sunday 23 NovemberSteward (Leicester); Feyi-Waboso (Exeter), Slade (Exeter), Dingwall (Northampton), Daly (Saracens); Ford (Sale), Spencer (Bath); Genge (Bristol), Cowan-Dickie (Sale), Opoku-Fordjour (Sale), Itoje (Saracens, capt), Coles (Northampton), Pepper (Bath), Underhill (Bath), Earl (Saracens).ReplacementsDan (Saracens), Baxter (Harlequins), Stuart (Bath), Ewels (Bath), Curry (Sale), Pollock (Northampton), Mitchell (Northampton), M Smith (Harlequins).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At scrum-half, Spencer has been invited to show he can be as influential from the start as he is for Bath, with Alex Mitchell shifting to the bench.

We shrugged our shoulders, just as clueless as they were. A few of the girls laughed about it and then one of the other players came over and handed my friend and me some bananas, saying, ‘Here, have these.’ That was the cherry on top,” she said.“Since leaving Montpellier, my friend and I have spoken about that moment a few times. Not receiving flowers was one thing, but as two of only six black girls in the squad, receiving bananas wasn’t something I could laugh off and forget about. Was it an accident? Was it the only thing in the dressing room she could give us? Did she mean well by it?“I’ve tried to justify it in many different ways, trying to find any indication that it was an honest mistake. But when I add in the many other times at the club when we were left feeling a similar way, it was hard to see it as merely a simple error. No matter what the intentions were, it left us feeling taken aback and upset.”The incident marked the end of a largely unhappy time for Fowler in France. She also alleges club staff accused her of feigning chest pains, even though they had been notified of a possible health issue by Matildas staff.A Montpellier physio who spoke English passed on to the teenager that other members of the staff believed Fowler was feigning injury to avoid playing.“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Frustrated, I told him I wasn’t making it up, that I’d never make up something that could be related to my heart. He informed me that it wasn’t his opinion – he believed me – but all the coaching staff thought I was making it up so that I could get out of playing in our match the next day.”She says she subsequently raised the issue with a coach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He wasn’t showing any empathy at all. I ended the conversation by saying: ‘If you’re not going to look after me then I’m going to look after myself. I’ll be at the game, but I won’t be putting my boots on.’”Montpellier was contacted by the Guardian for comment.Fowler was ultimately allowed to miss the game, and the club did provide her with checks afterwards that cleared her of a heart condition.“I’ve still experienced it in recent years, but after even more extensive heart checks, we’ve come to the conclusion that it’s most likely a muscular or skeletal issue,” she said.“I’m very grateful that it’s not something that ended my career.”Explore more on these topicsMatildasWomen's footballAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

In February, Arsenal were accused of delivering an“outrageous” snubto the ­Congolese ­government by not meeting the ­foreign minister, ­Thérèse ­Kayikwamba Wagner, to ­discuss the deal.VisitRwandais an arm of the Rwanda Development Board, a ­government department, and it is widely believed Arsenal signed and stuck by the partnership in order to grow their fanbase in Africa. The arrangement has now, however, come to an end after both parties “mutually agreed” to go their separate ways.“Together, Arsenal and the Rwanda Development Board have exceeded the original goals of the partnership – promoting conservation and sustainable tourism, inspiring millions of supporters to discover the country, and creating a lasting foundation for tourism growth,” read an Arsenal statement. “The ­partnership has also supported Rwanda’s ambition to become an international sporting hub in Africa and host more global sporting events whilst delivering grassroots football initiatives that have helped hundreds of young players and coaches develop their skills and inspire greater participation in sport across the country.”Richard Garlick, Arsenal’s chief executive officer, described the ­partnership as a “significant ­journey” and claimed it had been “driving ­forward” the club’s ambitions. But that is not how a section of Arsenal’s fanbase viewed the arrangement, with the campaign group Gunners for Peace protesting outside the Emirates Stadium during thefirst leg of the Champions League semi-final encounterwith Paris Saint-Germain in late April with a banner that read “Drop Visit Rwanda”. They also ­distributed armbands to cover up the Visit Rwanda logo on kits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ministers had originally proposed capping secondary ticket sales for sport, music and arts events at 30% above the face-value price of a ticket, but have now settled on limiting any resales to the original cost price in an attempt to combat touts.While football was not included in the details of the draft legislation released yesterday on the grounds that secondary ticket sales are already outlawed under the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, government sources have indicated they would oppose any moves by United to introduce a secondary market for seat licences.United began consulting fans over introducing seat licences this year in a survey conducted by the commercial research company CSL International, the largest piece of market research ever undertaken by the club. The survey is understood to have been sent to hundreds of thousands of season-ticket holders and United members, with different questions asked of different groups of fans.Buying a PSL would give fans the right to buy a specific seat at the new ground for a set period, although they would have to pay separately for their season ticket. Such licences have become commonplace in American sport, often as a means of part-funding new stadium builds. In the NFL, in particular, there is a strong secondary market for the licences themselves, with the resale of PSLs generating significant profits.United sources have disclosed that the PSL model being explored by CSL included the possibility of reselling the licence, although they added that the consultation process was still at an early stage. While a prohibition on resale at a profit is not necessarily a dealbreaker for PSLs, it may make them less attractive investments and lead to United lowering prices.It is envisaged that PSLs would only be sold for the most exclusive, premium seats at the new stadium, with other areas being reserved for ordinary fans. Licence holders would also have a guarantee of remaining in the same seats every season, as many long-term season-ticket holders have been angered by being relocated by the club in recent years. But should they fail to buy a season ticket, they would automatically lose the licence.A PSL differs from the debentures available at Wimbledon and Twickenham as they are interest-free loans made to the All England Club and Rugby Football Union in return for the right to buy tickets. The nominal value of Wimbledon debentures is repaid after a five-year period, while Twickenham debentures are repaid to the holder or their family estate after 75 years, with the latter considerably cheaper as a result. Some Twickenham debenture holders have been asked to forgo future repayments in a “Debenture Donation Campaign” to help raise funds for the RFU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They don’t listen to the players, we would have liked to start in Brisbane, too.”England’s Gus Atkinson said that though “there are no scars for me” from his country’s previous failures in Brisbane given he is a first-time Ashes tourist, “history would say it’s probably a good thing we’re not starting at the Gabba”.Shoaib Bashir a surprise inclusion in England squad for first Ashes TestRead moreBut Isaac McDonald, the chief curator at Perth Stadium, defended the decision, saying that the city’s relative proximity to England makes it a sensible first stop, and adding that he is enjoying the extra attention that comes with hosting the first game of a marquee series.“We’ve actually opened the last four summers here,” McDonald said. “So we’ve been the first Test of the summer for the last four years. You get all the first-game hype regardless who it is – I thought last year with the Indian touring team that it was crazy but this is a whole new level, being in the Ashes.“In some ways it’s pretty cool that we are the first because it does have that extra little hype, but being a direct flight from the UK to Perth it kind of makes sense that it is the first one. Just being around town you can tell there’s a lot of travellers here that have come from the UK to watch this game, so it’s going to be really cool to kick it off.”One complication for McDonald is that the first Test starts less than three weeks after Perth Stadium hosted a concert by the rock band Metallica, held just days after the drop-in wicket had been installed.“The wicket came out of the concerts unscathed, with no scarring, and having the run-in after the ­concert leading into this game was perfect timing – it gave us enough time to get moisture back through the profile and get us into a really confident spot leading into the first day of preparation.”View image in fullscreenCameron Green bowls during an Australia cricket team training session at Perth Stadium.Photograph: Dave Hunt/EPAAustralia have won four of their five games at Perth Stadium, which replaced the nearby Waca as host of Western Australia’s Test matches after the 2017 Ashes, with their only defeat coming against India last year, when 17 wickets fell on a chaotic first day before the wicket flattened.“I miss the Waca,” Starc said. “The ­Fremantle Doctor [the cooling afternoon breeze] comes in.

Last year we saw lots of wickets on the first day. There’s been a fair bit made about the colour of it, that it’s going to be a green mamba – it’s all good and well to look at the wicket, but until both teams have played on it we’re not really sure what it’s going to do.”McDonald has moved all his preparations this year forward 24 hours in an attempt to avoid the scenes witnessed on the first day last year. “The curator, no matter what the outcome of the game, always reflects and on reflection maybe I was a day late on the prep,” he said of that India game. “So we’ve knuckled down and we started a day early to ensure that the firmness is there and the characteristics of our Waca pitch, the pace and bounce, are going to be there on day one.”The first Ashes Test will be contested on the same drop-in pitch that was used in the India match and all five previous Tests here, which has spent the winter recuperating just outside the ground. “It just seems to have the best characteristics, so why change something that’s working really well?” McDonald said.Despite the wildness of the first day, last year’s pitch was rated as “very good” by the InternationalCricketCouncil, the highest possible ranking. At the time Cricket Australia’s head of cricket operations said: “We don’t look to prepare wickets that favour the home side or suit our situation in a series. What we seek is a good contest between bat and ball and pitches that are likely to produce a result.”View image in fullscreenPerth Stadium’s curator, Isaac McDonald, said he would not know how the pitch would play till the match started.Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAPMcDonald insisted he had received “absolutely no directives from anyone ever – that just doesn’t happen” and is fully focused on delivering the seam-friendly conditions that Tests at the Waca and at Perth Stadium are known for. “Low and slow is just not possible – West Test is pace and bounce and that’s what we’re gonna stick to,” he said. “I’ve really knuckled down with ensuring that’s spot on from day one to ensure that even battle.”But the 28-year-old admitted that, as Starc suggested, he would not be sure how the pitch would play until it had been played on, forcing him to endure a tortuous wait for validation – or ignominy. “Friday morning is the slowest,” he said.“I get here normally around 5.30am on matchdays, so that’s a slow, slow five-hour sit-around for me. Once the toss is done and I can’t roll any longer or take any more grass out I park myself up, and the national anthems seem like they go on for minutes and minutes. It’s probably more excitement than dreading what’s coming, but you can be as confident as you like, until you’re an hour into actual play you just don’t know.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

They could offer more finance, and technology.”Amid squabbles, bombast and competing interests, what can Cop30 achieve?Read moreThis does not necessarily involve an increase in the headline amount of money to be provided directly from rich world coffers,set last year at $300bn (£230bn) a year by 2035. It could also come from better use of existing finance, Corrêa do Lago added.“You don’t need more money. You don’t need public money from developed countries. You need to leverage more dollars from each dollar that you have,” he said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian as the talks entered their crucial stage.“They can offer not only more resources in banks, in multinational development banks; put more public money in funds like the green climate fund or the global environment facility, but there are an increasing number of alternatives like debt-for-nature swaps and other [instruments].”The divide over the “transition away from fossil fuels” has emerged as the biggest faultline at the Cop30 talks, now entering their final days in Brazil. On Tuesday,more than 80 countries demanded a roadmap to the transitionas a key outcome of the summit, in what some campaigners described as a “turning point”.But they are likely to face stiff opposition from petrostates such as Saudi Arabia and others who are dependent on fossil fuels. Decisions at “conference of the party” meetings require consensus, so even a handful of states could scupper the roadmap proposal.“Not only is [the divide] binary, but it is two extremes: one very favourable [to a phaseout] the other very unfavourable. There aren’t many countries that are indifferent,” said Corrêa do Lago.View image in fullscreenA demonstration at Cop30 in Belém calling for an end to the use of fossil fuels.Photograph: Fraga Alves/EPABut countries could still come together, he added. “Like most of these negotiations, it is less binary than it looks,” he said, if countries could recognise their own internal contradictions, and face up to the global need for climate action.Some oil-producing countries oppose the fossil fuel phaseout, but so do some consumer countries. “Some countries, because oil is a very important source of revenue, and other countries because they evaluate that they still need to use coal for more years, have shown very clearly that this proposal is not acceptable to them,” Corrêa do Lago said.Oil-producing countries also had hard truths to face up to. “They have to decide by themselves how they interpret the transition [away from fossil fuels],” he said. “They are already doing it. There is one statistic that shows that the use of oil will be reduced inevitably in the years ahead. [Electric vehicles are] reducing significantly the demand for oil, for gasoline and diesel.”He urged all countries toexamine their future in the context of the climate crisis. “All countries could engage in this exercise, which is to find its own path to transition towards net zero, which is what we have committed to,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Brazil embodies this: the country has recently become amajor producer of oil and gas, but its president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has repeatedly insisted, at Cop30 and the summit of world leaders in Belém that preceded it, on the need to “move away from dependency on fossil fuels”.Countries should face up to these opposing internal forces rather than try to hide them, Corrêa do Lago urged. “This Cop is happening in a country that is at the same time a nouveau oil producer and exporter, and the champion of renewables.“The country where you have the largest tropical forests in the world and the country that has the largest meat producer in the world. Brazil is a microcosm of the world: we have many successes, and we still have great challenges [with poverty] and many things to do to improve the life of our population. We understand the challenges of wealth and the challenges of poverty. [Brazil] reminds us that every country in the world has contradictory circumstances.”Lula is expected to return to Belém on Wednesday in an attempt to draw conflicted countries together. Corrêa do Lago said this would be done by listening to all countries’ concerns. “Brazil doesn’t want to do a top-down negotiation – Brazil wants to hear from countries which solutions they propose,” he said.Corrêa do Lago is a pragmatist, a climate diplomat since 2002 who believes the annual talks must evolve fast to keep up with the speed at which global heating is altering the planet. Arguments over the precise wording of promises and resolutions that have been rehearsed many times before can distract countries from the need to pursue action in the real world, he says.“The sense of urgency is what drove us to insist on implementation, because I think at this stage it’s irrelevant to be right. What is relevant is really to advance and make progress in implementation,” he said.That could mean countries pushing ahead with “coalitions of the willing” to take immediate action, rather than waiting to gain consensus at a Cop.Brazil has drawn up an “action agenda”of issues that do not need formal Cop approval to go ahead.Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisFossil fuelsBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaGreenham CommonGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The use of cluster munitions is widely banned as up to 40% of submunitions do not explode upon impact, posing a danger to civilians who might later stumble upon them and be killed when they explode.To date, 124 states have joinedthe convention on cluster munitions, which forbids their use, production and transfer. Israel is not a party to the convention and is not bound by it.“We believe the use of cluster munitions is always in conflict with a military’s duty to respect international humanitarian law because of their indiscriminate nature at time of use and afterwards,” said Tamar Gabelnick, the director of theCluster Munition Coalition. “Their wide area impact means they cannot distinguish between military and civilian targets and the cluster munition remnants kill and maim civilians for decades after use.”The Israeli military neither confirmed nor denied its use of cluster munitions but said it “uses only lawful weapons, in accordance with international law and while mitigating harm to civilians”.Israel’s war with Hezbollah which started in October 2023 and killed almost 4,000 people in Lebanon and about 120 people in Israel, left the Lebanese militant group devastated. Much of Lebanon’s south remains in ruins and Israelstill carries outnear-dailyairstrikes in the country, despite a ceasefiresigned last year.Lebanon in particular has a painful history with cluster munitions. Israel blanketed Lebanon with 4m cluster bombs in the final days of the 2006 war, with an estimated 1m failing to explode. The presence of unexploded cluster bombs continues to make life in south Lebanon dangerous, with more than 400 people killed by unexploded bomblets since 2006.The huge number of unexploded cluster bombs in Lebanon was a main driving factor for the drafting of the cluster convention in 2008.Despite not being a party to the convention, Israeli officials condemned Iran’s use of cluster munitions in Israel during this summer’s12-day war. “The terror regime seeks to harm civilians and even used weapons with wide dispersal in order to maximise the scope of damage,” said the Israeli military spokesperson, Brig Gen Effie Defrin, after an Iranian strike used cluster munitions in populated areas in southern Israel.Images of the remnants of the first cluster munition, a 155mm M999 Barak Eitan advanced anti-personnel munition produced by the defence contractor Elbit Systems in 2019, were verified by six different arms experts, including Brian Castner, the head of crisis research at Amnesty International, and NR Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, a technical intelligence consultancy specialising in arms and munitions analysis.Elbit Systems did not respond to a request for a comment.Each M999 artillery shell releases nine submunitions which explode into 1,200 tungsten shards, according to aUS army primeron the weapon.View image in fullscreenThe second munition’s remnants were said by two analysts to be from a Ra’am Eitan guided missile. The yellow diamond markers indicate that the shell contains high-explosive submunitions.Photos of the second munition’s remnants were identified as a cluster bomb by five different arms experts, though most were unable to identify the exact model owing to a lack of open-source materials on this specific rocket.Jenzen-Jones and a separate weapons analyst said the weapon was a 227mm Ra’am Eitan guided missile, a new type of cluster munition developed by Elbit Systems. This specific shell was produced in 2017, evidenced by its lot code.Israeli mediadescribedthe Ra’am Eitan as guided missiles that hold 64 bomblets each, which “scatter in a large radius and kill everyone present”. According to apress releaseby the IDF in February 2024, Israeli troops operating on the country’s northern border were equipped with the Ra’am Eitan in preparation for a fight with Hezbollah.The legality of cluster munition usage for non-signatory countries is dependent on the circumstances of the strikes they were used in, as well as the intentions of the military personnel involved in their use. The Guardian does not have information about the strikes the shells were used in, as the remnants were found after the fact.The remnants were found in heavily forested valleys in south Lebanon, which Israel accusedHezbollahof exploiting during the war to provide cover from aerial bombing and surveillance.Cluster munitions, due to their wide spread, could be useful against soldiers spread out across large, wooded areas. US forces used cluster munitions in a similar way in Vietnam, carpeting dense jungles where Vietcong soldiers were located.According to Israeli media reports, both of the cluster munitions found had been developed in recent years to leave fewer unexploded munitions behind, with claims that the Ra’am Eitan had a“dud rate” of 0.01%. Israel developed the munitions after its use of cluster bombs in the 2006 Lebanon war triggered outrage abroad and at home – seeking a way to continue using cluster bombs while minimising civilian harm.Gabelnick and other arms experts warned that dud rates advertised by arms companies were often many times higher in the field. Israel Military Industriesclaimeda 0.06% dud rate for the M85 cluster munition used in the 2006 war; lateranalysissuggested the rate was about 10%.Human rights groups have said that it is impossible for cluster munitions to be used in a way that minimises harms to civilians.“Cluster munitions are banned internationally for a reason. They are inherently indiscriminate and there is no way to employ them lawfully or responsibly, and civilians bear the brunt of the risk as these weapons stay deadly for decades to come,” said Castner.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We will find you. And you will be accountable and held to justice for your crimes,” she said.Authorities also announced the arrest of the Ontario lawyer Deepak Paradkar, who allegedly advised Wedding to murder the FBI witness, Jonathan Acebedo-Garcia, a Canadian citizen who was shot dead in a restaurant in Medellín in January.FBI offers $10m reward for ex-Olympic snowboarder turned drug kingpinRead moreBill Essayli, first assistant US attorney at the central district of California, told reporters that Paradkar was one of a dozen individuals who were recently arrested in an “international takedown”. He said the well-known Brampton lawyer told Wedding: “If you kill this witness, the case will be dismissed.”Police inCanadaalso arrested Atna Onha, a Montreal man, and charged him with murder conspiracy in the killing of Acebedo-Garcia, a former member of Wedding’s organization.“Make no mistake about it: Ryan Wedding is a modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said. “He’s a modern-day iteration of El Chapo Guzmán.”The state department also increased its reward for Wedding’s capture and conviction from US$10m to $15m.Wedding, 43, grew up in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and competed for TeamCanadain the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic games, where he placed 24th in the parallel giant slalom event.Four years after the Games, Ryan Wedding was named in a search warrant investigating a marijuana-growing operation in British Columbia, but was never charged.In 2010, Wedding was convicted of drug trafficking after attempting to buy cocaine from a US government agent and was sentenced to four years in prison.Described by mediaat the time as a 2010 “Olympic hopeful”, Wedding sought to dismiss the charges, alleging “outrageous conduct” by US authorities, suggesting they used a “violent former KGB agent” as an undercover operative.But in the years since, he has emerged as a powerful and ruthless transnational narcotics trafficker.The RCMP commissioner, Mike Duhame, was also present at the press conference and told reporters that seven Canadians have been arrested. Duheme said Wedding’s organization probably makes more than $1bn a year.On Wednesday, the US treasury department also announced sanctions on Ryan Wedding and nine other people linked to his criminal organization.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMexicoDrugsDrugs tradeSnowboardingOlympic GamesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

MI5 said the two accounts, posing as recruiters, were trying to obtain “insider insights” into British politics.The spy agency said the profiles under the names of Amanda Qiu, from BP-YR Executive Search, and Shirly Shen, from InternshipUnion, were using LinkedIn to “conduct outreach at scale”. Both accounts have since been deleted.A LinkedIn spokesperson said: “Creating a fake account or misrepresenting your identity is a clear violation of our terms of service. We remain focused on detecting state-sponsored abuse and will continue to enforce our policies against fake accounts.”View image in fullscreenThe LinkedIn pages of Shirly Shen and Amanda Qiu.Composite: LinkedinThe Commons speaker,Lindsay Hoyle, has invited MPs to a cybersecurity and resilience briefing with the GCHQ director, Anne Keast-Butler, and the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, Richard Horne, next week.In its espionage alert,MI5said operatives sometimes preferred to move conversations to encrypted platforms, and those targeted included thinktank employees and geopolitical consultants.Bryn Harris, the chief legal counsel at the Free Speech Union, told the Guardian he received three approaches this year over email from individuals purporting to be interested in his work on academic freedom.The messages began a few months after one of the FSU’s members, the University College London professor Michelle Shipworth, wasinvolved in a high-profile rowon the subject. Shipworth said she had been banned from teaching a “provocative” course involving China to protect the university’s commercial interests, triggering an investigation into her allegations by UCL.Harris was contacted by a Gmail account under the name of Lala Chen in June, another belonging to Ailin Chen in July, and a third under the name of Emily Emily in October. A private threat assessment concluded the senders were in the Asia-Pacific region despite purporting to be based in the US.In an email on 22 June, Lala Chen said she was interested in the FSU’s views on “the balance between academic freedom and campus management power in the current higher education environment”.On 10 July, Ailin Chen claimed to work for an IBM research centre and praised the FSU’s “invaluable” written submission to the higher education bill. Both suggested moving the conversation to WhatsApp.In an email on 13 October, Emily Emily said she worked for Google’s AI division and complimented Harris’s research papers. “We hope to establish a long-term partnership with you, with you serving as a full-time technical advisor. We will then sign a formal contract,” she wrote.Harris said the personalised nature of the emails convinced him they were “more than a random phishing attack”. He has reported them via the MI5’s online risk logging portal and worked on an assessment with UK-China Transparency, a charity that conducts research on UK-China relations.In issuing its alert, it is understood MI5 was not responding to a single incident involving Qui or Shen, but the volume of their recruitment efforts was such that they felt a rare semi-public warning was necessary.The goal was to give people “information they need to identify risk” in the hope that politicians and those working with them would reflect on their online activity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Approaches to parliamentarians will make up a relatively small proportion. It’s a lot of covert approaches to academics by the Chinese state, as well as companies who have some sort of stake in national security, whether that’s IP or UK infrastructure.”The government’s approach to China has come under scrutiny over security concerns after thecollapse of a high-profile trial involving two men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China. Both deny any wrongdoing.Before prosecutors decided to drop the charges in mid-September, a meeting was held in Whitehall to discuss the implications that the trial would have on the UK-China relationship. Ministers have stressed this did not discuss the government’s evidence in the trial, and was held on the assumption that it was going ahead as planned.Among those present were the national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, the cabinet secretary, Chris Wormald, the head of MI5, Ken McCallum, and several senior Foreign Office officials including Dan Chugg, the director for north-east Asia and China.The Guardian can disclose that Chugg is leaving his role in the coming months having taken voluntary redundancy. It is understood that he did not want to sign up for the required three more years, having done the job for four-and-a-half years. The Foreign Office is restructuring and reducing its headcount.A government spokesperson said: “It is longstanding policy not to comment on individual staffing cases.”Explore more on these topicsMI5LinkedInChinaSocial mediaGCHQUK security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

Climate change is increasing the severity of droughts in the Hawaiian Islands, which correlates with an increased likelihood of wildfires.The power went out at about 5.30 that morning. It was knocked out all day; there were power lines and trees down across the roads. The first day of school was scheduled to be the very next day. I was at work. Teachers were getting their classrooms ready to welcome kids.View image in fullscreenRyan Kirkham, the principal of Maui Prep school, in once of the classrooms that Lahaina fire evacuees slept in on the night of the fire.Photograph: Akasha Rabut/The GuardianThis was August, the middle of hurricane season. There was a big hurricane passing a couple hundred miles south of Hawaii. There were hurricane-force winds down in town. We had volleyball practice; we had enough daylight to practise in the gym. During practice, at about 3.30pm, I received a call from a parent at the school. She said: “Ryan, there’s a fire in town. We’ve lost our house. We barely got out alive.” Theirs was one of the first houses to go.Then I received another call from another family. “Ryan, our whole neighbourhood just went up in flames.” Lahaina is small, but those houses are in different parts of Lahaina. In between those homes were several hundred other homes. I just went: “What is going on down in town?”We sent the kids home. Just after, around 5pm, all our cellphones went out. There’s still no power, no communication, no information. I came home, slightly aware of what was starting. Before the phones went out, a few families had called and asked if they could come to our house. As we went to bed, they showed up. They were like: “We got evacuated. It was just precautionary. We think we’ll be able to go back in the morning, and everything will be there.” So they didn’t have much stuff packed.We were setting up mattresses, and people were getting ready to sleep on couches. We had candles going everywhere. There was chatter about what was happening in town. We had five different sets of families in our house that night.I was in bed, and at about 10.30pm, one of our kids came in and said: “Hey, Dad, there’s a police officer at the door and he wants to talk to you.” I went to the door. He said: “Hey, are you Ryan, the principal of Maui prep?” I said yes. He goes: “We got to open your school right now. We have to set it up as an evacuation centre because there’s buses on their way up to the school. You need to open everything up.”View image in fullscreenKirkham flips through a binder full of the names of those who checked in the night of the fire. He set up a table for people to write their time of arrival and numbers down so friends and family could locate each other.Photograph: Akasha Rabut/The GuardianI hopped in the car and drove up to the school, roughly 1km away, out of the fire zone. The police officer had his lights going and I was following. Everything was just black. There’s still no power. But, at one point, you could see this big, orange, arching glow over the whole town. The stark contrast: this bright orange glow with pitch black sky. Feeling the weight of knowing something tragic was going on but not having any idea of the scale of the devastation.There were several cars and a bus waiting. The police officer and I opened up the gates and as many classrooms as we could. All these city buses started arriving full of people covered in smoke and ash and soot. They were just black head to toe. People were injured. Some were in their clothes. Some were in their pyjamas. Some were soaking wet.The fire started up in the mountains and was getting to the highway. People were abandoning their cars and the only place they could keep going was the ocean. I remember carrying a little 80-year-old Japanese lady off the bus and she was drenched because she had spent a few hours out there. People were trying to find her some dry clothes or a towel and trying to get her out of the wind.The buses just kept coming. An influx of people and buses. Maui prep families started showing up to the school to help. Our school is only 300 kids. That night, we had 800 people on our campus.Everything just felt muted. People were so in shock, just laying on the floors of our classrooms, sleeping on our gym floor.Families huddled up together having quiet conversations. Our only sources of light that night were emergency gas-powered floodlights on our outdoor basketball court.The only time anything was loud was if someone was injured. We had a little triage centre set up in one of our classrooms. I don’t recall any major injuries but people had bumps and scrapes, some of them were burns, sprained ankles. People were crying or expressing a great deal of pain. In the night, someone would be moaning.View image in fullscreenThe Lahaina fire memorial along the highway above the town.Photograph: Akasha Rabut/The GuardianI remember the sun coming up the next morning. A mother drove up to the school, saw me standing out in the driveway and said: “Ryan, have you seen my girls? We don’t know if they got out of the fires or not.” I coached her girls in club volleyball. I said: “Sorry, I haven’t seen them. They aren’t up here.” I think she was hoping they had somehow made their way up to the school in the night.I remember we couldn’t cook anything. There’s no power. We had a little concession area. We started handing out all of our bags of Cheetos or ice-cream. We had some bottled water. Tourists, visitors and residents started dropping off food, water and clothes. These weren’t county officials. These weren’t government officials. These were families from other parts of Maui that had gone to Walmart or Target in central Maui, bought as much stuff as they could with their own money, drove it out to us and unloaded truckloads of supplies at the school.We gave as many as we could to the evacuees and we still had all these supplies. We said: “We’ll serve as a food, water, clothing distribution site.” We let four cars in at a time. A volunteer would come and say: “Hey, what are your needs?” “Oh, man, it would be great if we could just get some water.” Here’s a whole crate of water. Next car comes in. A line of several hundred cars parked down the hill, out to the highway.I remember this one gentleman who had everything he had in his car. I asked him how he was doing and what he needed. He just said: “I lost everything. I lost my son in the fire. Do you have any water for me?” He was in a state of shock, non-emotive, factual. His son was one of the only kids who died in the fire. I remember my heart breaking for him and feeling helpless. There’s nothing you can do.View image in fullscreenA Lahaina memorial on campus.Photograph: Akasha Rabut/The GuardianIt was in the lineup where I saw that mother and her two girls. They drove up to the school and the two of them piled out of the back of their minivan. Their mom was beaming ear to ear. That was such a massive sense of relief and joy. We gave each other big hugs. I knew those girls were OK.Because the power was out, we had restaurants bringing up food. One family took it upon themselves to feed all 200 of the volunteers. They brought propane grills, cooking breakfast burritos or sausages and bacon and eggs. They cooked up some expensive steaks. I remember those smells and going: “Boy, this is the best-tasting and smelling piece of bacon I’ve had in my life.”Four or five days after the fire, power miraculously came back on. We thought it was going to be out for a month. There are five other schools on West Maui: two burned down, three were shut down. Five of the schools on West Maui had burned down or shut down so we were like: “Let’s figure out a way to start school.” We met as an administrative team and said: “How can we serve these kids? How can we get as many kids in as possible?” Our teachers said: “Ryan, we don’t care how many kids. You fit as many kids to our school as you can.” We had over 1,000 applications in four days. We brought in 150 students in that admission period. Unfortunately, we couldn’t bring all those kids just because we didn’t have enough space.About the seriesThis is climate breakdown was put together in collaboration with the Climate Disaster Project at University of Victoria, Canada.Read more.Production teamWe had first day of school on 21 August. Normally, it’s a fun, celebratory time, our mascots out there waving signs and taking pictures with kids. But it wasn’t like that. It wasn’t sad. It wasn’t celebratory. It was trying to create a warm, welcoming environment for kids.I remember telling teachers: “If you’re assigning chapter 1, page 13, questions 10 through 30 in the math textbook on day one, you’ve missed the mark.” We’re not here to add to their stress. We are here to give them some anchor in the storm. We’re here to support them emotionally. Some of these kids were living in hotel rooms. Some were living with three other families at a friend’s house. I remember “normalcy” being used quite a bit then, and I remember feeling sick of using this word.Six months after the fire, we were sitting in school and the power goes out. Immediately, the question was: “Are we going to be safe? Is there going to be another fire?” It was so fresh among a lot of our younger students. That trauma is still present for a lot of people. A year and a half out, homes are now being built in Lahaina. The fire continues to be the foundation on which our daily lives are built.View image in fullscreenKirkham high-fives students as they leave campus.Photograph: Akasha Rabut/The GuardianThere is a general sense of frustration that the federal government only provided $700 for people who lost their homes. It would’ve been great for there to be a higher level of support. Having more, better evacuation routes is part of the conversations Lahaina residents are having as they rebuild.What we learned afteris that initial wave of responseis not some relief organization or government. It’s people helping.This seems to be typical of disasters. The devastation to the community is well documented. On one side of the coin, we saw devastation. On the flip of it, we saw the positive nature of humanity shining through in how people supported other people.It’s a little bit funny, but for the next six months or so, we’d be walking around town and we’d see a little elderly lady walking around in a Maui prep uniform. We knew that there was a good chance she was up at the school that night and that was someone who we were able to help and support.We got to bear witness to this side of humanity that was so giving and so supportive. Seeing the generosity of others willing to support our community in such a time of drastic need. Seeing the resilience of everyone who lived through that experience, however big or small. I think that instills a lot of hope for me and our community.Design and development byHarry FischerandPip Lev.Picture research by Jim Hedge"

The goal inches past the UK’s landmark 81% target for that year and races ahead of the EU’s rather wide goal of 66.3% to 72.5%.Those numbers may seem strange to celebrate given that most countries the UN classifies as developed have already promised to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century. But climate scientists have long warned that the path to a clean economy matters as much as the exact end date. Delay too much action till the 2040s, as cash-strapped governments are wont to do, and even those who go fully green by 2050 will risk having already pumped out too much pollution.Despite these warnings, announcements such as Denmark’s are a rarity among the European ministers attending theCop30 climate summit in Brazilthis month. Governments across the continent have attacked green rules with increasing ferocity over the past two years, rolling back existing policies and watering down new ones – all while professing their commitment to existing climate targets.The EU, meanwhile,is energetically “simplifying”(read: rolling back) ambitious climate policies under the banner of increasing the bloc’s competitiveness.Thebeating that Europe’s famous Green Dealis taking at home has begun to undermine its pleas for urgent climate action on the world stage. European countries are some of the biggest historical polluters of greenhouse gas, but have long championed stronger action at UN summits. Last week, as negotiators converged on the Amazonian city of Belém, situated on the edge of the beleaguered rainforest, theEuropean parliament voted to weaken a lawto stop deforestation in supply chains and to restrict the scope of its green business rules.View image in fullscreenA demonstration for climate justice in front of the EU parliament in Brussels last year.Photograph: Frederic Sierakowski/EPAThe blow to the corporate sustainability directive – the first of several “omnibus” deregulation packages pushed by the commission – attracted anger from green groups for removing an obligation on companies to create climate transition plans. These would force firms to explain how they are aligning business practices with the 1.5C global heating target, which countries agreed at a landmark climate summit in Paris 10 years ago.Adding fuel to the fire, the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) voted with the far-right – who centrists have traditionally shunned – to win the vote. The surprisebreakdown of the EU firewallcomes one month after the frayingcordon sanitairegave way in France, and in a year in which Germany’sBrandmauerhas been chipped.Alberto Alemanno, a law professor and founder of the Good Lobby, whichlast week launched a trackerto monitor centre-right collaborations with the far-right, said the vote “not only dismantles the Green Deal, but also redefines the political majority governing Europe from now until 2029”.“For the first time in EU history, the pro-EU centrist parties that have built and governed the EU since its inception are being sidelined,” he said. “And they bear responsibility for their own demise.”The positions adopted last week will still need to be negotiated with the 27 EU governments and the commission before final versions of the laws come into force. And while the political firewall may be cracking,Europehas not abandoned its efforts to stop heating the planet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It aims for a 90% drop in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 from 1990 levels – the minimum that its scientific advisers recommend – though it leaves the door open for 5% of those cuts to come from foreign carbon credits that scientists and journalists have repeatedly found to be junk.The inclusion of such “flexibilities” – a compromise to win over member states reluctant to sign off on a high headline figure – meant that the EU did not turn up toCop30empty-handed. That in itself puts it ahead of other big polluters such as China, which has become a clean energy powerhouse but refuses to commit to ambitious targets, and the US, which did not even show up.To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.View image in fullscreenMette Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, and Keir Starmer, the UK’s prime minister, meeting in London in October.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeDenmarkCop30Climate crisisnewslettersShareReuse this content"

And it is not all plain sailing.By operating at a reduced speed, and chasing the wind, the Neoliner Origin’s goal is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared with an equivalent diesel-powered cargo ship – and in the process, chart a course to decarbonise the notoriously dirty shipping industry.It is being powered primarily by the two semi-rigid sails made from carbon and fibreglass and a backup diesel-electric engine.Onboard are eight passengers, more than a dozen crew and 1,204 tonnes of cargo, including 500,000 bottles of Hennessy cognac, container-loads of refrigerated French brioche, a dozen forklifts and eight hybrid Renault cars.I accepted the invitation to sail on the Neoliner Origin because, as an environmental writer, its first transatlantic journey happened to align with my own goal: to travel from my home in Berlin to visit my family in Canada without flying, in a bid to reduce my carbon footprint.Roughly80% of goods traded worldwideare transported by ship, and the industry accounts for about3% of global carbon emissions. If shipping were a country, it would be theworld’s sixth-largest emitter. Much of the shipping industry also uses one of the dirtiest of all fossil fuels: called heavy fuel oil, or bunker fuel, it is the tar-like sludge found at the bottom of a barrel of refined oil.To do something real for the planet – it’s the dream of my lifeAntonin Petit, captainWind-powered cargo ships could even offer an alternative to flying, one of the most carbon-intensive activities. Though only10% of the global population flies, aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions.“I’ve been dreaming about being captain on this ship for 15 years,” says one of the Neoliner Origin’s captains, Antonin Petit, who grew up sailing off Brittany with his family, collecting rubbish from the sea as they went along the French coast.Two sails made of carbon and fibreglass power the Neoliner Origin, with a backup diesel engine.Two semi-rigid sails made of carbon and fibreglass power the the ship, which also has a backup diesel engine. Video: Arthur Jacobs/Neoline“To do something real for the planet by not burning any fuel oil into the atmosphere to carry goods by sea – it’s the dream of my life,” he says.Onboard, the days soon find their own rhythm: breakfast, lunch and dinner with the other passengers and crew in the dining room, meals often inspired by French cuisine, and always followed by a cheese plate. We entertain ourselves with card games in the passengers’ lounge and whale-watching from the top deck, where we spot fin whales and dolphins, as well as seabirds of all shapes and sizes.We are invited up to the bridge, where we learn that the engine is only being used at 20% to 50% of its capacity, which means the sails are doing their job and reducing fuel consumption.But three days into the journey, things take a turn. The top panel of one of the carbon sails cracks and then shatters, rendering it unusable – suspected to be due to a flaw in the design and dimensions of the panel.View image in fullscreenDolphins were seen on the voyage, as well as fin whales.Photograph: Arthur Jacobs/NeolineThe sail cannot be repaired until we arrive in the tiny archipelago ofSaint-Pierre and Miquelonoff Canada’s coast a week later, when a team of five technicians fly in from France and painstakingly reconstruct the sail in a makeshift workshop in the cargo hold over the next five days.The front sail is still usable, so onward and westward we go. But this single sail throws the ambitious fuel and emissions reductions goals for the journey into disarray. The crew are forced to rely on the 4,000kW engine for the next 12 days of the crossing until Baltimore.It is also bad timing. We have navigated towards a low-pressure system, hoping to use the powerful winds to propel us. But the winds do not behave as the weather-forecasting software has modelled – a gap between prediction and reality that crew members say is becoming more common thanks to the effects of climate breakdown.View image in fullscreenAntonin Petit, one of Neoliner Origin’s captains.Photograph: Arthur Jacobs/NeolineInstead, the depression stops right on top of the ship and stays there for a day and a half, resulting in the slip-sliding dinner and leaving me relieved I remembered to pack sea sickness tablets.The new ship is still in its pilot phase, fresh from the shipyard, the crew reminds us, so hiccups are to be expected. For now, adventure is part of the cost of the journey.So is this really the future of transport and travel?According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), 90% of shipping decarbonisation will require a switch from dirty bunker oil to greener fuels – renewable hydrogen, ideally – with the other 10% including efficiency improvements such as retrofitting sails to ships for wind-assisted propulsion.Bryan Comer, marine programme director with the ICCT, says: “There is an opportunity for wind-assisted propulsion to reduce fuel consumption and costs, which is useful because renewable hydrogen will be three to four times more expensive than fossil fuels.”For passenger ships, however, there is an additional cost – that of a ticket: a two-week crossing from Saint-Nazaire to Baltimore on Neoline costs €3,200 (£2,800).For cargo ships, using wind is not as simple as adding two sails, however. A cargo ship with sails must either be built from scratch – the Neoliner Origin cost €60m to build – or undergo an expensive retrofit.View image in fullscreenNeoliner Origin prepares to depart on its maiden voyage from Saint-Nazaire in Brittany.Photograph: A Jacobs/NeolineThere is also the question of size: the136-metre-long roll-on, roll-off Neoliner Originis the largest of a new wave of sailing cargo ships, but small compared with the 400-metre Suez canal-blocking behemoths used in international shipping.Wind propulsion can have a greater impact for smaller ships, but it would “require more of those ships to move the same amount of cargo,” says Comer.“So that doesn’t seem like a realistic pathway for international shipping, where things are just getting bigger and bigger.”View image in fullscreenMichaela onboard Neoliner Origin.Photograph: Arthur Jacobs/NeolineDespite the broken sail and low-pressure system, we arrive at the port of Baltimore only a day later than planned. Though Neoline will not publish its first set of data on its fuel consumption for another six months, estimates from the captain suggest that the ship reduced its fuel consumption by nearly half of what a conventional cargo ship would use, relying on just one sail and the engine. Neoliner Origin has sold more than 100 passenger tickets for further journeys over the next few months.Shipping is one of the world’s dirtiest industries – could this invention finally clean up cargo fleets?Read moreAfter two weeks of adventure, I am happy to be reunited with terra firma. And the final accounting for my journey from Berlin to Ottawa without flying wound up as 22 days travelling over 9,500km (5,900 miles), through nine cities, with 30 hours spent on trains and 15 days on one very low-carbon and exciting cargo-ship crossing of the ocean.It was the end of my journey, but Petit sees the Neoliner Origin’s first crossing as not just the beginning of the ship’s life, but the culmination of decades of work. “I’m so proud to finally be here,” he says.To align his personal convictions with his professional life was worth waiting for, he says. “It’s a reconciliation of two parts of my life that were previously separate. Neoline allows me that – and we’ll try to strengthen that and make it last.”The land-based reporting for this story was supported by theHeinrich Böll Foundation.

Some participants in the event said they were exposed to a second wave of traumatising treatment when their claims for compensation were rejected by Home Office employees.Campaigners highlighted the relative speed with which compensation had been paid out to victims of the Post Office scandal, and they called for urgent reform of the Windrush redress scheme. They expressed mounting frustration at the refusal by successive governments to launch a formal Hillsborough-style inquiry into the causes of the Home scandal.In the absence of official action, campaigners said they planned to launch a “people’s inquiry” early next year, arguing that the need to examine the Home Office’s culture and ongoing failures of the compensation scheme had become so pressing that those affected could not wait for a formal inquiry.The architect of the Windrush compensation scheme in 2018, Martin Forde, announced he was ready to help campaigners suggest a radical redesign of the way compensation payments are made, noting that he felt officials had displayed a “woeful lack of commitment” to his scheme.“We have been too passive for too long,” he said, adding that it was time to “shame and embarrass” the Home Office into paying those affected the compensation they are owed.Clive Foster, the Windrush commissioner, who started work earlier this year, said that in the first 100 days in his role he had met more than 700 people affected, in church halls and community centres across the UK, to listen to their experiences.“I’ve also had the opportunity to address thousands of Home Office staff directly with a simple message: compassion and humanity must guide every policy and casework decision,” he said.“Seven years on, sadly the Home Office Windrush scandal is not in the rear-view mirror. Every conversation I’ve had since taking up this role reinforces the need for urgency. Survivors shouldn’t have to be retraumatised by the very process that’s there to serve them justice.”One Londoner described a 13-year period spent battling to persuade the Home Office that it had wrongly classified him as an illegal immigrant. He had moved from Nigeria as a young child in 1978, attended primary school, boarding school, got an undergraduate degree and an MBA in the UK and launched a successful career as a software engineer before being told he faced deportation.“It’s so difficult living when you’re trying to tell the truth and nobody believes you,” he said, asking for his name not to be published.Hetticia McIntoshtravelled from Barbados as a young child to join her mother in the UK, who working here as a nurse, having been hired as part of Enoch Powell’s NHS recruitment drive. She was serving in the British army in the 1970s when her UK status was revoked because of a Home Office mistake. Her husband, Vanderbilt McIntosh, who had made a similar journey, also lost his UK status as a result of similar errors.Despite both having attended school in the UK, worked in Britain for years and brought up three children here, they were classified as immigration offenders and obliged to relocate to St Lucia, away from their parents and siblings in the UK, and were stuck there for decades.“We lived here, we grew here, we worked here. We got no answers,” she said. She and her husband were refused compensation three times between 2021 and this year. She said there was “no humanity in the process”. “We need systemic change,” she said, calling for legal aid to be allocated to applicants.The Home Office minister David Hanson was unable to attend the meeting but sent a letter stating: “The government is determined that justice is delivered for the Windrush generation and their defendants.” He said the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, was committed to embedding “cultural change within the Home Office”.Explore more on these topicsWindrush scandalHome OfficeCommonwealth immigrationImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Mrs Justice McGowan adjourned sentencing until Thursday.The defendant, formerly of Stevenage in Hertfordshire, was found guilty of five counts of indecent assault relating to the girl in the late 1980s.During the trial, jurors heard how Carrick abused a young girl for about 18 months before she told her mother what was happening.He confessed in a letter recovered from his medical records that was signed “Dave”. He wrote that the girl was “not crazy” and that her account was true, and that he had stopped his behaviour about four months earlier.He wrote: “I know how [the girl] must feel. That’s why I stopped and promised I would never go near her again and I have kept that promise and I always will.”Det Supt Iain Moor, who led the Hertfordshire police investigation, suggested the course of events would have been very different had Carrick’s offending been picked up in 1990.“It’s very difficult to apply today’s standards back to the 1990s. Obviously, we have multi-agency safeguarding hubs now. We have mechanisms for reports to come in from GPs, from medical professionals,” he said.“But I think had something occurred and the police became aware back in 1990, then it is possible that the offending could have been picked up at that point and then the future looks very different. It’s difficult to say exactly what that path would be, but I’m sure it’d be different to the one that we have today.”In a police interview, his victim described Carrick as “very sly” and manipulative. After she told her mother about the abuse, the matter was “brushed under the carpet like it was nothing”, she said.Giving evidence in court, she told jurors: “When I heard he was a Metropolitan police officer, the words I have always used were: ‘God help anyone with him with a warrant card.’”The second victim met Carrick on a dating website and was aware from the start that he was a police officer. She said he was charming, witty and sarcastic, and acted like “everyone’s best friend”.But during their relationship he became controlling and raped her on numerous occasions. She told jurors she had been traumatised and that Carrick had ruined her life and tainted her views on sex and relationships.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

He added that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) had mishandled the situation and suggested the Cabinet Office or an external adviser with experience of complex media transactions should take control instead.The Conservative peer Michael Forsyth suggested the government should turn to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to pursue a “proper auction and have normal order restored”.Lady Twycross said the government was “acutely aware” that the protracted sale had left the Telegraph and its staff “in limbo for too long”, but added that the DCMS would continue to control the process.She said: “The secretary of state has adhered to the letter of the law and diligently carried out her quasi-judicial responsibilities. There is no basis to the suggestion that the decision should be made elsewhere. Securing a swift outcome in the public interest is a priority for her.”Nandy could refer Redbird IMI’s bid to the CMA to investigate whether it breaches laws on foreign state ownership, using new powers under the Foreign State Influence (FSI) regime.If the CMA were to deem the bid unlawful, Nandy could order an independent sale of the titles at a market-led price, potentially run by the regulator and supervised by the independent directors who have overseen the Telegraph during the protracted process.Another option could be to coordinate the process through the Cabinet Office.However, IMI, which is controlled by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, has said that while it purchased an “economic interest” in the Telegraph it has never sought to influence or control the titles.The newspaper group has been in limbo for two and a half years after Lloyds Bankput it up for sale, having seized control from its former owners the Barclay family over unpaid debts.RedBird IMI, whichtook control of the titles in late 2023, was forced toput them back on the marketafter new legislation banned foreign states from owning UK newspapers. It has been unable to find a buyer at the £500m price it is seeking.Most media analysts believe that the titles are worth about £350m.Any move to force a sale, especially one resulting in a significant loss for RedBird IMI, which would anger the UAE, would be politically unattractive for the government.Becket McGrath, a partner at the law firm Euclid Law, said: “The mechanism [to force a sale] seems to act as a sword of Damocles here. Government can force a sale by initiating a process but the current owners are looking to sell anyway. So it would just trigger a lot of bureaucracy and forces a bigger loss on them. It is not tempting for the government.”RedBird Capital’s aborted bid, which could have been referred to Ofcom and the CMA on public interest grounds, would also have included small stakes from the owner of the Daily Mail and billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik.A new sales process could revive interest from GB News investor Sir Paul Marshall, whoacquired the Spectator in September 2024 for £100m, and Lord Rothermere’s Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT).However, a bid from DMGT, which already handles the Telegraph’s printing and advertising sales, would spark regulatory scrutiny over competition concerns.Lord Saatchi and Lynn Forester de Rothschild also tabled a bid last August for £350m, plus a promise of further payments dependent on performance, which was also rejected by RedBird IMI.Explore more on these topicsTelegraph Media GroupNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

An individual who is segregated from others and deprived of the usual activities available to prisoners (education, work, communal prayer) will inevitably suffer isolation and an element of distress and anxiety. What the claimant experienced was much more severe than that: he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, brought on (at least in part) by the segregation.”He said that his judgment did not mean that the same segregation regime would contravene article 3 in the case of a prisoner with an ordinary level of resilience, but the “claimant was not such a prisoner, given his history of trauma and associated mental health needs”.The judge said he would consider whether damages were necessary at a later date.In a witness statement, Abu said he suffered “paranoia and flashbacks” in the separation system, and in segregation “[my] mental health has deteriorated to the point that I am experiencing constant thoughts of suicide and self-harm”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have asked for an immediate investigation.”Italy has long tried to fight against the huge global market in “Italian-sounding” products – that is, food items that give the impression they are made in Italy when they are not.The own-label sauces Lollobrigida referred to are sold by the Belgian supermarket chain Delhaize and have an Italian flag on their packaging.Under EU regulations, a food product could be deemed to be misleading consumers if its labelling distorts its actual country of origin.Reports in Brusselssaid the sauces were not claimed to be made in Italy and did include Italian ingredients. The Guardian has asked Delhaize to comment.The episode comes as Italy eagerly awaits the outcome of its application for Italian cuisine to be included in Unesco’s intangible cultural heritage list. A decision is expected in early December.Italy’s biggest agribusiness association, Coldiretti, said the “scandal of fake Italian products” cost the country €120bn (£106bn) a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The experiment was conducted three separate times: once with 7.2% THC cannabis, once with 3.1% THC cannabis and once with 0.03% THC cannabis, which was considered a placebo.A major component of the study was the replication of a real-life bar, complete with dark lighting and drinks on tap.Jane Metrik, a professor of behavioral and social science at Brown University who led the study, stressed the importance of authenticity for participants,telling NPRthat “we wanted to make sure that when given the opportunity, you would be really driven to drink”.The results revealed that participants’ alcohol consumption fell by 19% after smoking cannabis with 3.1% THC. The drop was even more significant after smoking the higher-potency 7.2% THC cannabis – participants ended up drinking 27% less alcohol than the placebo.Expanded legalization efforts have led to a major surge in marijuana usage – its consumption has doubled over the past 10 years, according to a2024 Gallup survey. Alcohol consumption is ata record low, with many turning to alternatives such as weed. Of the participants in the Brown trial, however, 40% met the criteria for alcohol use disorder.While cannabis could serve as a potential solution to heavy drinking, Metrik acknowledged that there is still more research to be done.“We’re not ready to tell people seeking treatment for alcohol, ‘Go ahead and substitute cannabis, and it will work out for you,’” she said.Explore more on these topicsCannabisAlcoholAlcoholismMedical researchCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

No casualties have been reported.More than 300 residents in the three villages most at risk in the district of Lumajang were evacuated to government shelters, said Abdul Muhari, a spokesperson for the national disaster mitigation agency.He said increased activity of the volcano on Wednesday afternoon prompted authorities to widen the danger zone to 8km (5 miles) from the crater. People were advised to keep away from an area along the Besuk Kobokan River, which is the path of the lava flow, as searing gas flowed down Semeru’s slopes.Videos on social media showed a dense cloud of ash sweeping through a forested valley to a river beneath a bridge. Residents, some with faces smeared with volcanic dust and rain, fled to temporary shelters or left for other safe areas.Local media reported that authorities were struggling to rescue about 178 people stranded on the 3,676-metre mountain at the Ranu Kumbolo monitoring post. The group included 137 climbers, 15 porters, seven guides and six tourism officials, according to an official with the Bromo-Tengger-Semeru national park (TNBTS).“They are currently safe at Ranu Kumbolo monitoring post,” Endrip Wahyutama, a TNBTS spokesperson, said in video statement. He said the post was located 4.5km from the crater on the northern slope of the mountain, which is not in the path of the hot cloud flow that was observed moving to the south-southeast. Bad weather and rain forced the group to spend the night there, he said.Semeru, also known as Mahameru, has erupted numerous times in the past 200 years. Still, as is the case with many of the 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, tens of thousands of people continue to live on its fertile slopes.Semeru’slast major eruptionwas in December 2021, when 51 people were killed and several hundred others burned and villages were buried in layers of mud. The eruption forced the evacuation of more than 10,000 people from their homes.Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 280 million people, sits along the Pacific “ring of fire”, a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines, and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaVolcanoesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

However, this was partially offset by food inflation accelerating to 4.9%.UK inflation forecast to show decline from recent peak of 3.8% – business liveRead moreThe decline matched City economists’ forecasts and was below the 3.7% rate predicted by the Bank, but was still well above the government’s 2% target.Reeves has vowed to cut living costs in her highly anticipated tax and spending statement on 26 November, includingmeasures to bring down the inflation rateto smooth the path for the Bank to cut interest rates.The chancellor said: “This fall in inflation is good news for households and businesses across the country, but I’m determined to do more to bring prices down.“That’s why at the budget next week I will take the fair choices to deliver on the public’s priorities to cut NHS waiting lists, cut national debt and cut the cost of living.”On Tuesday evening, Reeves said she had asked the UK competition watchdog to look into the rising cost of private dental treatment amid growing concern about soaring prices. The chancellor is also understood to be considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on domestic energy bills, a move that could save bill payers about £80 a year and cost £2.5bn to introduce.Last week, the Bank opened the door to a post-budget cut in borrowing costs in December after itsignalled inflation had probably peakedamid mounting fears over the strength of the economy.Threadneedle Street forecasts inflation is on track to ease to about 2.5% next year, before returning to its 2% target over the course of 2027. After the release of the latest figures, the pound fell by about 0.2% against the dollar to $1.31 as traders raised bets on a December rate cut.Financial markets shifted to reflect an 85% chance of a quarter-point cut from the current level of 4%.Strengthening the case for a reduction in rates from as early as next month, core inflation – which excludes food and energy and is closely watched by the Bank – fell from 3.5% in September to 3.4%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “Inflation has been above target every single month since Labour’s last budget, leaving working people worse off.”Highlighting the pressure on families, rising prices for bread, cereals, meat and vegetables drove up annual food and drink inflation from 4.5% in September to 4.9% in October.Economists said it was possible the headline inflation rate could rebound in November. However, rising unemployment and slowing wage growth is expected to encourage the Bank to cut rates, depending on the outcome of the budget.Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “Though the conditions for a December interest rate cut are falling into place, the budget is a last obstacle as rate-setters will want to gauge the effect of the policies announced before authorising another rate reduction.”Explore more on these topicsInflationBank of EnglandEconomicsBudget 2025UK cost of living crisisInterest ratesBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

The moves come after the WIE partnered with Oxford University during the summer to publish research on Uber driver pay.Theacademic paper found that many Uber drivers were earning “substantially less” an hour– while the company was taking a significantly higher share of fares – since the ride hailing app introduced a “dynamic pricing” algorithm in 2023. Dynamic pricing variably sets pay for drivers and fares for passengers and is a later iteration of Uber’s “surge pricing”, which increased fares during periods of peak demand.The Oxford University research said: “Our findings suggest that post-dynamic pricing, many aspects of Uber drivers’ jobs have gotten worse. Average pay per hour on the app is stagnant, and is lower in real terms in the year following the introduction of dynamic pricing.”The WIE argued that Uber had trained its algorithms “by using the drivers’ own historic personal data by observing their working practices.“Underthe GDPR, drivers are entitled to demand that Uber stop using this technology, revert to the previous method of transparent pay-setting with a human in the loop, and compensate the drivers for their losses.”An Uber spokesperson said:“Drivers choose Uber because we offer flexibility over where and when they work, and transparency over every trip they take – including the fare, destination, and their own earnings, before they decide whether to accept. The study WIE collaborated on is not accurate and relies on incomplete and selective data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are proud that thousands of drivers continue to make the positive choice to work on Uber as passenger demand and trips continue to grow.”The WIE alleges that, while Uber announced dynamic pricing in 2023, the “legal harm” commenced in 2020 with “upfront pricing” – where a passenger would be quoted a set fare for a trip.The workers’ foundation added that if Uber failed to comply with its “demands to cease these practices and compensate affected drivers”, it intended to “bring collective proceedings before the Amsterdam district court under the Netherlands’ collective redress law”.Explore more on these topicsUberArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

We see this as a show of goodwill. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the Chinese authorities.”The Dutch minister said he had moved to take effective control of Nexperia, which is headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen but owned by China’s Wingtech Technology, to ensure Europe was not locked out of chip production “in an emergency”.He said the decision, made after consultation with the European Commission and others, had been the “right step” to prevent Nexperia from moving intellectual property and physical assets from its factory in Hamburg and its corporate HQ in Nijmegen.“The Netherlands has considered it the right moment to take a constructive step by suspending the order under the Goods Availability Act, in close consultation with European and international partners. The Netherlands will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the Chinese authorities in the period ahead,” Karremans added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the European car manufacturers association (ACEA) said it was still concerned about continuity of supply.“For us the situation remains critical and we need a workable contingency agreement to ensure supply in both directions,” said Jonathan O’Riordan, ACEA’s international trade director.The Netherlands has remained a party to a related case that led to the removal of Nexperia’s former chief executive, the Wingtech founder, Zhang Xuezheng.The Chinese owner of Nexperia urged the Dutch government to end its legal action completely rather than simply suspend it, arguing that if ministers were acting with “sincerity” they would submit new filings with the court involved in the original ministerial order, the enterprise chamber of the Amsterdam court of appeal.Wingtech said: “Minister Karremans justified his actions by accusing Nexperia’s CEO of various acts of alleged mismanagement. Wingtech strongly rejects these accusations and points out that, to date, no proof has been provided.”Karremanstold the Guardianlast week he had no regrets about the extraordinary move to take supervisory control of Nexperia under the Goods Availability Act, a never-before-invoked cold war law designed to protect European production in emergency or war situations.The Chinese commerce ministry responded to the interview by expressingits “extreme disappointment” in the minister.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorInternational tradeAutomotive industryGlobal economyChinaNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

It came shortly after thesale of its high street business, which has since beenrebranded as TGJonesby its new owners.WH Smith shares climbed by more than 7% on Wednesday after Carl Cowling’s departure was announced, although they are still trading substantially below the levels seen before the August sell-off.Cowling, who had been group chief executive for six years, will be replaced on an interim basis by the company’s UK chief executive, Andrew Harrison, until a permanent replacement is found.WH Smith’s US adventure is now stuck in an accounting hole | Nils PratleyRead moreAn independent investigation by Deloitte said it had found “shortcomings” in the retailer’s North American division that exaggerated supplier income, leading the group to overstate profits at its US business by as much as £50m.The review found weaknesses in the composition of the US finance team, as well as insufficient systems, controls and review procedures for supplier income in its commercial and finance teams. It also found the group had limited oversight of US finance processes.Annette Court, the WH Smith chair, apologised and said the company recognised “the importance of strengthening controls, governance and reporting procedures across the group”.She said:“Our priority now is to rebuild trust and credibility and to improve the performance and profitability of our North America division. We are confident that the actions we have taken and will continue to implement over the months ahead will ensure a strong foundation for the business going forward.”Cowling said: “Whilst the issues identified in the Deloitte review arose in our North American division, I recognise the seriousness of this situation and as group CEO feel it is only right that I step down from my position.”WH Smith, which is now focusing on its travel business and branches in airports and railway stations, had previously identified North America as a growth opportunity.It warned that it expected profits for its US arm for 2024-25 to be between £5m and £15m, down from the £55m originally forecast and below the £25m announced on 21 August when the accounting blunder was first revealed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company said it would look to new leadership to “implement the remediation plan” and take the company through the next phase of its strategy to focus on its shops at global travel hubs.Dan Coatsworth, the head of markets at the broker AJ Bell, said it was unlikely any chief executive could have survived a “catastrophic” episode in which nearly £600m was wiped off a company’s share price overnight.He said: “Even if Cowling hadn’t resigned, his credibility at WH Smith was shattered by the scale of value destruction straight after selling the UK high street business. That strategic shift was meant to be a defining moment for the company, but it has gone down in history for the wrong reasons.”Explore more on these topicsWH SmithRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

That book grew from intimate involvement with the sorrow and pity of war-torn Europe: a “measureless ocean of tears and blood”.She developed a unique gift for converting the memory of trauma – not just in her family’s background, but that of others too – into exuberant fiction. Its warmth, fun and sympathy embodied a conviction that humour “sees us through hard times and keeps us in touch with our essential humanity”.After her award-winning debut in 2005, five further novels united comic skills with serious themes. They not only charmed and entertained readers but revealed the “hidden worlds” of global upheaval behind the everyday business of multicultural Britain.Lewycka began life as a refugee. She never lost her curious outsider’s eye, or sense of being “a bit of human flotsam washed up on a faraway shore”. Her Ukrainian parents, Peter and Halyna – father an engineer and inventor, mother a trained vet – had gone to Germany as forced labourers under the Third Reich. Marina was born in a “displaced persons” camp run by British authorities in Kiel shortly after the second world war.Accidents of birth meant that her parents qualified to come to Britain. First they lived in “idyllic” East Sussex withRosalind Dobbs– sister of the social reformerBeatrice Webb, mother-in-law of the writer-broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge – before moves to Oxfordshire and South Yorkshire.At school Marina “badly wanted to be an English girl”, but spoke Ukrainian at home. As a bilingual child, she recalled, “you listen carefully”. Her father worked for the International Harvester tractor company in Doncaster (his expertise wittily informs her breakthrough novel).She attended grammar schools in Lincolnshire and Oxfordshire, acquired a lifelong love of poetry, then studied English and philosophy at Keele University. After a BPhil at York, she embarked on a doctorate at King’s College London, devoted to the radical writings of Levellers and Diggers in the English civil wars. However, present-day activism distracted her (she had joined CND as a teenager): tension between the narrator’s leftwing values and the staunch anti-communism of the parents generates a running battle in A Short History ...Lewycka taught in adult education, for the Open University and as a supply teacher. In 1975 she met her future husband, the New Zealand-bornDave Feickert, who became a mining safety expert and trade unionist. They had a daughter, Sonia, and married in New Zealand in 1987. Sonia became an epidemiologist.View image in fullscreenMarina Lewycka’s book A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, which drew on aspects of her family history, was a million-copy bestsellerLewycka and Feickert lived inSheffield, where he worked as research officer for the National Union of Mineworkers (and later for the TUC in Brussels). She taught extra-mural classes at Sheffield University, then joined Sheffield Hallam University as lecturer in journalism and public relations: she called PR “the art of making fictions in the real world”; after her literary success she retained a part-time post, keen “to listen to the way young people speak”, and lectured until her retirement in 2012.In the 1990s and early 2000s she wrote carers’ manuals for the charity Age Concern and persisted with fiction, more “modernist” and “philosophical” than the books that later won her fame. Her unpublished writing gathered 36, carefully preserved, rejection slips.A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian emerged from a creative-writing MA she took at Sheffield Hallam; it counted as a “staff development” course. Teachers such as the poetSean O’Brienand the novelistJane Rogersencouraged her, and fortune smiled when the external examiner turned out to be the literary agent Bill Hamilton.The deal he struck with Penguin led to an “almost overnight transformation”. An author who had planned a sombre saga of European displacement won prizes – notably the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse award – for comic fiction. With the novel also shortlisted for the Orange prize, she carried a gag-rich version of Ukraine’s tortured, fractured past into the bestseller charts.A Short History ... drew on aspects of Lewycka family history, with its tale of an octogenarian engineer who, after his wife’s death, falls for a much-younger Ukrainian woman. Lewycka had planned a memoir, taped interviews with her mother, but soon realised that “I was going to have to make stuff up”. As she, uproariously, did.Around 30 translations swiftly followed, but Ukrainians in Ukraineobjected to what they viewed as stereotypes. Yet behind the wit, merriment and farce stood grief, pain and division: notably between the narrator Nadia, a “peacetime baby” brought up amid kindness and plenty, and her older sister Vera, the “war baby” who has seen “the darkness that lurks at the bottom of the human soul”. That polarity would recur in subsequent books.After the novel’s triumph, Lewycka travelled in Ukraine andmade contact with long-lost relatives. She played tapes of her late mother’s voice to an aunt who had heard nothing of her sister for six decades. Back in Sheffield, she adjusted to professional authorship – “It was your dream, and it became your job” – while refusing to act as the “arrogant and selfish” literary celebrity. Interviewers would find themselves treated to a warming bowl of borscht.Later novels grew into a sort of comic unofficial history of postwar Britain, seen from its ragged sidelines. Her humour sounded both homely and bizarre, pitched between the worlds of Alan Bennett and (Ukraine-born) Nikolai Gogol.Two Caravans(2007) takes eastern European migrant workers on a satirical, Chaucerian underclass pilgrimage, whileWe Are All Made of Glue(2009) tries to connect Jewish and Palestinian hopes and fears through the fate of a London house.“I get excited about what bonds people together,” one character says. Lewycka’s fiction sought to bind clashing outlooks via its special brand of verbally inventive, historically informed sitcom. Her novels express the cheerful resilience of a “peacetime baby” raised in the welfare-state culture celebrated inThe Lubetkin Legacy(2016): “paternalistic maybe, but untainted by cynicism or self-interest”.Lewycka wrote some of her fiction at Feickert’s house in New Zealand, but the couple separated (he died in 2014). She formed a relationship with the historianDonald Sassoon. In later years she became estranged in another way, as the rare neurological condition multiple system atrophy progressively affected her speech, balance and movement. It could make her stumble“like a drunk”and slur her words.As she wrote, to have a degenerative disease was “scary, lonely and socially unacceptable”. But the idealistic “peacetime baby” found that“people’s spontaneous kindness often brings tears to my eyes”. A final novel,The Good, the Bad and the Little Bit Stupid(2020), added Brexit to its satirical pick-and-mix, glued together not so much by plot as by tone: defiantly warm-hearted and high-spirited in the face of calamity, great or small.As withZadie SmithorHanif Kureishi, her work rejoices in the rival voices and visions of a mixed-up, fast-changing country and, on the page at least, resolves its conflicts into uplifting comedy.She is survived by Donald and her daughter.Marina Lewycka, novelist, born 12 October 1946; died 11 November 2025Explore more on these topicsFictionUkraineTeachingSheffieldobituariesShareReuse this content"

This loving doc asks why – but leaves some questions unansweredPeter BradshawWed 19 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 06.01 ESTShareThis documentary is probably, as they say, one for the heads – for connoisseurs who appreciate a great musician who was never a star. But the flaw of this film, admirably detailed and celebratory though it is, lies for me in the fact that it never pauses to wonder why exactly he was never a star, and what that precisely means. Does star quality consist, in some mysterious way, in a lack of formal musicianship?Nicky Hopkins was a superbly accomplished pianist who played on records by the Who, the Kinks, Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles (plus solo albums by all four ex-Beatles) and many more. His brilliant work meant he was admired and even hero-worshipped by musicians and producers on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a classically trained Englishman (like Elton John at about the same time, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music) yet sounded as if he learned piano in the Mississippi Delta. And all this was while Hopkins was dealing with serious ill-health; he hadCrohn’s diseaseand later issues with drink and drugs. The latter were at least partly due to a need to dull the pain, in order to keep up with tough recording and touring schedules; it all contributed to his heartbreakingly early death at the age of just 50.So why is this amazing figure not world famous? Partly it was his refreshingly ego-less approach (although he had no false modesty, and only half-jokingly called himself the reincarnation of Chopin). His humility made him loved, and made him a great collaborator. The session musician’s life – free of the star’s burden of leadership – unlocked his creativity. He was also no snob; to the bemusement of some interviewed here, he worked on David Soul’s solo album. Yet real stars are perhaps also immodest and obnoxious in ways alien to Hopkins: they may not have his technique and his artistry, but have some raw originality and inspiration that Hopkins arguably didn’t. Art isn’t fair and life isn’t fair.In fact, Hopkins did release some solo albums, which are respectfully namechecked here, and yet nobody talks about the unmentionable subject of why they didn’t take off – perhaps because of a need not to sound disrespectful. I would have liked to hear some frank discussion of this, but there are still valuable insights here.The Session Man is in UK cinemas from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPop and rockThe BeatlesThe Rolling StonesThe KinksThe WhoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nevertheless, their content conveyor belt rolls on, offering treats about as substantial and enduring as cotton candy beginning in mid-November.A Merry Little Ex-Mas review – Netflix’s season of cheapo festive fare begins with a shrugRead moreLike American chocolates that no longer, in fact,contain real chocolatebut sell like gangbusters on Halloween anyway, the Netflix Christmas movie, like rival holiday movie master Hallmark, is relied upon, even beloved, for its brand of badness, for its rote familiarity (nostalgic casting, basement-bargain budgets, Styrofoam snow, knowingly absurd premise) and uncanny artificial filler, for its ability to deliver hits of sugary pleasure while still somehow under-delivering on expectations. At worst, these films are forgettable train wrecks (last week’sA Merry Little Ex-Mas); at best, they are forgettable fun, such as the Lindsay Lohan comeback vehicleFalling For Christmas, of which I remember nothing other than cackling with my friend on her couch. (Actually, at best they are memorably ludicrous, such as last year’s impressively unseriousHot Frosty.)Champagne Problems, Netflix’s latest Christmas concoction, disappears into the vast middle of the forgettable spectrum. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, a former studio writer whose last Netflix-core romcom,Love in the Villa, was so disposable I forgot I had even reviewed it, it goes down like cheap bubbly, appropriately flat and situational.It begins, naturally, with what one imagines an AI-generated ad for drugstore brand champagne would look like, should US drugstores be legally allowed to market their own champagne. The commercial, it turns out, is actually the pitch of one Sydney Price (Minka Kelly) to her colleagues at the Roth Group, a private equity fund (without, of course, saying the words private equity) looking to take over a legacy champagne brand. With perpetual TV curls and an endless supply of luxe coats, Sydney is the construction paper cut-out of a career woman – underestimated, obsessed with her phone, ambitious to the detriment of her personal life and, in fact, any personality at all. So much so that when her ogreish boss (Mitchell Mullen) selects her to fly to France and close the deal over Christmas, her sister Skyler (Maeve Courtier-Lilley) makes her pinky promise: she must take a single night in Paris to actually live for herself.Of course, there’s no place like Paris to wrest one away from Google Maps, even when the city is laden with below-grade CGI snow. And at an absurdly cutesy bookstore, Sydney meet-cutes with Henri Cassell (Tom Wozniczka), who does the wresting of her beloved Google Maps. As demanded by the genre, Sydney at first resists this absurdly perfect man for silly reasons (work, a briefly mentioned divorce, just because).Equally as expected are movie mechanics proceeding at abrupt quarter turns, just as one rotates the ageing champagne bottles in the cellars of Chateau Cassel, the champagne vineyard Sydney hopes to acquire. The catch? Henri is the heir to Chateau Cassel, as reluctant to run it as he is resentful of his father Hugo (Thibault de Montalembert) for selling it – and, in perhaps the film’s most salient contribution to the genre, extremely judgmental of private equity. The conflict? Sydney sincerely believes she’s not stripping this family-owned company for parts, and is competing for the acquisition with three caricatures: a severe French grand dame (Astrid Whettnall), a severe blond German man (Flula Borg), and severely delusional gay billionaire (Sean Amsing, admirably if annoyingly unhinged). The twist? Sydney’s skeevy co-worker Ryan (Xavier Samuel, who has more chemistry with Kelly in a single scene than Wozniczka does in the whole movie), shows up unannounced. The grist? Henri and Sydney look yearningly at each other in holiday pyjamas, across a vast chasm in economic worldview.The gift and the curse, of course, is that none of this sticks for longer than a bubbly buzz on an empty stomach. And there is no real absorbent filler here – Kelly, still best known for playing a deceptively sharp cheerleader in Friday Night Lights, goes for strictly serviceable, all sweet surfaces and gestures of care, more a maternal presence than a romantic lead. Wozniczka, too, provides exactly the dollop of French charm with mild self-torture and nothing more. The gimmicks are unfunny, the romance inoffensive, the happy-ever-after straightforward. For all its waxing poetic on the specific luxury of champagne, no one is pretending this is anything other than a mass market item; the things to hate are also the things to like. One might call a critic’s feelings about it a champagne problem.Champagne Problems is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsNetflixComedy filmsChristmasComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a surrealist film whose surrealism resides not merely in the bizarre parched landscape of the Sierra Morena mountain range with its bleached skulls, hanged bandits, crows and mysterious inns in which seductive encounters are to be had, but also simply in the bewildering juxtaposition of individual tales and anecdotes, stories which grow out of each other. The surrealist effect (and the comedy) is in the jolt from one micro-narrative to the other, and the realisation that the overall story is thwarted and undermined.The premise is that in the Spanish town of Saragossa during the Napoleonic wars, one officer tries to arrest another, who is apparently reading an old book – but is then distracted by the fact that this book is about his own grandfather, the nobleman Alfonse Van Worden. (Later we discover that the passages about this grandfather have been added by hand, in pen-and-ink, hence Saragossa Manuscript.) Then we flash back to the this preening aristocrat-soldier himself, played by prominent Polish actor Zbigniew Cybulski.While travelling on horseback through the wilderness in the blazing heat, Alfonse encounters a grim gallows with two dead men, and has an erotic interlude with two Muslim princesses who require him to convert. Is it a dream? We get another flashback showing the life of Alfonse’s father, a proud blueblood and insatiable duellist, Alfonse is later arrested by the Spanish Inquisition – which he didn’t expect – and encounters a hermit, a scholar of the occult and a mathematician, tale-tellers and raconteurs all, and a stylish Gypsy in whose own reams of garrulous stories Alfonse’s father is to reappear.It is pure narrative chaos, a kaleidoscope in which meaning and resolution always appear to be just around the corner or just over the horizon. The Saragossa Manuscript is like Cervantes or Borges, but also very much like Alejandro Jodorowsky (those hanged men and princess are like the tarot cards beloved by Jodorowsky) andTerry Gilliam. The farcical encounters could be sketches by Monty Python or even plays by Mr Ernie Wise. And it is all shot on crisp, clean monochrome which makes watching it feel like binging on dozens of episodes of some cult countercultural TV comedy from 1960s Poland.“I no longer know where reality ends and fantasy begins,” whimpers Alfonse at one point. The thing to be savoured about The Saragossa Manuscript is its lack of irony and self-awareness; there is a kind of innocence and even refinement in the drama, even as it outrageously swerves off the beaten track of conventional storytelling.The Saragossa Manuscript is on Klassiki from 20 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsPolandComedyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

This documentary narrated by Imelda Staunton tells the story of the campaign to hold the Irish government to account for its role in the laundries, mother and baby homes and industrial schools for children. A key figure in that campaign is Maeve O’Rourke, an impressive young Irish human rights lawyer whose master’s thesis at Harvard Law School served as a key legal submission in the legal fight for justice.O’Rourke had plans for a career in international human rights law until she watched a survivor speaking in a debate on Irish television. We see that footage here, of Michael O’Brien, a former mayor and survivor of rape and torture by priests at a residential school, as he blasts a government minister, white-hot with fury, his trauma raw. It takes your breath away. This thorough documentary hears from campaigners, historians and survivors – including Philomena Lee, forced to give up her son, who was trafficked and sold to rich Americans. Lee was later portrayed on screen by Judi Dench.The scale of scandal is at times overwhelming. There was the mass grave found at the St Mary’s mother and baby home near Tuam in Galway – the bodies of 796 babies and children dumped in a septic tank. The spitefulness of the abusers is a recurrent theme, such as a nun throwing baby clothes at a young mum, who had knitted them for her baby – removed from her for adoption just minutes earlier. The expressions of remorse from the religious organisations are best described as carefully drafted. Legally, they are untouchable. But the film ends on a triumphant high, a lunch in Dublin for survivors, honoured like celebrities by crowds outside cheering, waving banners, celebrating their courage; it left me in floods of tears.● Testimony is in UK cinemas from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIrelandCatholicismChristianityEuropeReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

His masterwork isPalestine, a collected volume of single-issue comic books he created in the 1990s, documenting the violence in Gaza. His technique is to embed as a journalist in a war zone and interview people on the street, telling their stories with pictures. Lessons on global politics emerge from ultra-local conflict and depictions of day-to-day life.Palestine propelledSaccoto fame, drawing comparisons with Maus,Art Spiegelman’stwo-volume saga about Polish Jews during the Holocaust with Nazis portrayed as cats, and Jews as mice. These works are sold prominently in bookshops, not in musty basements packed with racks of polyethylene-sheathed superhero comics. Alongside a couple of others, Maus and Palestine signalled that graphic novels, as they became known, could be serious works of fiction, nonfiction and journalism. Palestine itself is as depressingly relevant today as it was in the 1990s. In December 2023, it was reprinted for the first time in a decade, after selling out following the 7 October attacks.The historical backdrop to Sacco’s work is colonialism. Just as Palestine charts the long-term ramifications of the Balfour declaration, this new book explores the legacy of the disastrous and inherently violent act of Indian partition in 1947. It’s a history told through the lens of a seemingly small-scale, parochial conflict in a very rural part of Uttar Pradesh, northernIndia, more than six decades after the British imposed a chaotic division of the country along very poorly devised religious lines. Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy of British India, lacking any humility or foresight, declared: “I shall give you complete assurance. I shall see to it that there is no bloodshed and riot.”Sacco’s focus isthe Muzaffarnagar riotsof 2013, but he spends time documenting the history of the region and the tensions that foreshadowed them. Their exact cause is disputed: a Jat Hindu woman was “eve-teased” – a grim euphemism for public sexual harassment – by a Muslim man, who was then killed by her brothers, who were subsequently killed themselves. Or was it a traffic incident that spiralled into sectarian scrapping, escalating into murder by rampaging gangs?If the trigger remains a mystery, the outcome is well documented: clashes between two communities, dozens killed, hundreds injured and tens of thousands displaced. At every juncture, politicians and religious leaders fail to maintain peace and control.View image in fullscreenA page from The Once and Future Riot.Photograph: The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Jonathan Cape, £20).And so this becomes a story of the uneasy relationship between democracy and sectarian politics, and the brutality that constantly lurks in the shadows. It charts how rumour and misinformation fuel chaos – a video on Facebook purporting to show a local Jat boy being lynched was pivotal in igniting feverish violence, though it turned out to be years old and from Afghanistan.The riots lasted a few days, with the army eventually brought in to quell the violence. Sacco chronicles its aftermath in camps the dispossessed – both Jat and Muslim, but mostly Muslim – were forced into, and the attempts at reparations, which were inept and possibly corrupt.The “future riot” of the title invokes the idea that violence is a perennial feature of democratic processes in India. Prime minister Modi’s rise was at least partly fuelled by riots in Gujarat in 2002, after a train containing Hindu pilgrims was set on fire and Muslims were blamed. Anti-Muslim prejudice following the Muzaffarnagar riots themselves benefited Modi’s Hindu nationalist BJP. A decade later, the atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh, and the wider country, remains volatile. In the concluding pages, Sacco turns to a question of global significance: does a democracy that foments violence risk being overwhelmed by it?There’s wit and realism in the panels and art. It’s dynamic and clear, and the people seem less like caricatures than in Palestine. Vox pops punctuate the narrative, a reminder of the subjective experience of people on the street, in the midst of the action. There is, however, a strange phenomenon I’ve not seen before in 40 years of reading comics. The skin tone of all of the protagonists is dark, and the shading is done not by cross-hatching, but by parallel horizontal lines. Once I noticed it, it became distracting, like TV interference on every character’s face, and I couldn’t unsee it. This may seem like a pathetically trivial point, but comics are a visual medium, and you have to get on with the art. Get over it, I told myself, because the story is important and compelling, but it niggles.Above all,Joe Saccois a journalist, and this is journalism. The format, of which he is almost the only exponent, has a subjectivity absent from traditional approaches. The memories of the protagonists are sometimes contradictory, but Sacco includes them nonetheless. The graphic novel – a wholly unsatisfactory descriptor – can contain all the complexity of a tumultuous politics. In an era when long-form journalism is under pressure, and political analysis filleted to morsels, Sacco’s work is a lifeline.The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).

From Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway to more recent offerings such as Sarah Gilmartin’sThe Dinner Partyand Teresa Präauer’sCooking in the Wrong Century, an intimate soiree provides the perfect recipe of claustrophobia and choreography into which a novelist can sink their teeth. The preparations are usually unduly stressful, the guest list dynamic unpredictable, the quantity of alcohol borderline obscene – in short, as a device it has all the ingredients for total, delicious carnage.The latest entrant to this literary Come Dine With Me is Viola van de Sandt, whose debut The Dinner Party centres on Franca, a shy young woman from the Netherlands tasked with hosting a meal for her English fiance Andrew and his two male colleagues. To make matters more challenging, it is the hottest day of the year, the menu is rabbit (despite Franca’s vegetarianism) and her sous chef is their often violent pet cat.Before we get to all this, though, the novel begins with the words “Stella says I should write a letter”, adding two further literary devices into the mix. For Stella is Franca’s therapist, with whom she now meets regularly to unpack the repercussions of that disastrous evening a year ago, while the entire novel is framed as a correspondence addressed to the enigmatic “Harry”.Through this letter, and these therapy sessions, Franca’s backstory is revealed, from her grief-stricken childhood to her lonely student days in Utrecht, where she meets first Harry and later the handsome Andrew. Very soon she persuades herself that none of her problems “would matter if I became part of this beautiful, privileged man’s life”, so she drops out of university and follows Andrew back to the UK. There she half-heartedly applies for some internships, then spends her days lounging around his Kensington flat drinking and watching episodes of The Crown.The queasy smells, unctuous textures and ‘nameless dread’ are like something from a horror storyThere are echoes here of Natasha Brown’s astonishing debutAssembly, a searing examination of race and class, as well as Olivia Sudjic’sAsylum Road, in which a young Bosnian woman tries to outrun her traumatic past by immersing herself in the wealthy world of her British boyfriend. That said, the class politics are never really interrogated, while Franca’s “otherness” is barely remarked upon. Andrew, at least before the dinner party, seems a bit arrogant but broadly fine, while Franca gives little sense of what she would like to be doing instead – there are vague references to becoming a writer, though as Harry says: “I can’t work out if it’s something youreallywant, or if it’s what youwantto want.”If the themes and characterisations are slightly muted (at one point Franca refers to herself as “bland, beige béarnaise”), the novel is much bolder in its repeated references to the dinner party’s climax, or as Franca puts it to Stella: “the culmination, the denouement […] That business with the knife.” Meanwhile, the party itself is described in intensely visceral prose, from the cannellini beans that resemble “fat maggots” to the rabbits whose “flesh glistens, seems to crawl”, everything pungent and putrid and rotting in the heat: “The fridge is dead: the butter is swimming in its dish, and the milk has curdled. The knife lies on the counter.”It is here that Van de Sandt is at her strongest, the queasy smells, unctuous textures and “nameless dread” like something from a horror story. The description of Franca stuffing a cavity is positively grotesque, while, over the course of the evening, Franca’s own body is slowly torn apart – first shredded by the cat’s vicious scratches, then blistered by a dropped cigarette, then violated by a terrible act.The tension builds and builds to its bloody climax; by contrast, the present-day sections see Franca – thanks to her sessions with Stella – slowly building towards a new sense of calm, finding solace in the mundane pleasure of refurbishing her one-bedroom Berlin flat. The combination is sometimes jarring, like two different recipes spliced together, but this formidable debut offers plenty to savour.The Dinner Party by Viola van de Sandt is published by Headline (£20).

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 19 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 10.01 ESTShareArc Raiders is, by all accounts, a late game-of-the-year contender. Dropped into a multiplayer world overrun with hostile drones and military robots, every human player is at the mercy of the machines – and each other. Can you trust the other raider you’ve spotted on your way back to humanity’s safe haven underground, or will they shoot you and take everything you’ve just scavenged? Perhaps surprisingly, humanity is (mostly) choosing to band together, according to most people I’ve talked to about this game.In areview for Gamespot, Mark Delaney paints a beguiling picture of Arc Raiders’s potential for generating war stories, and highlights its surprisingly hopeful tone as the thing that elevates it above similar multiplayer extraction shooters: “We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I’ve ever played.”But, but, but, but … There is a small irony to Arc’s depiction of humanity united against the machines. The game uses AI-generated text-to-speech voices, trained on real actors. (The game also uses machine learning to improve the behaviour and animation of its robot enemies, a different type of “AI”, which video games have been using for ever.) Games writer Rick Lane found this to be so ethically compromising that he couldn’t look past it. “For Arc Raiders to ride the wave of human sociability all the way to the bank, while also being so contemptuous of the thing that makes us social animals – carving up human voices and reassembling them like a digital Victor Frankenstein – demonstrates a lack of artistic integrity that I find impossible to ignore,”he wrote for Eurogamer.Generative AI in video game development is becoming a red-line issue for many players (although it’s impossible to tellhowmany – neither social media outrage nor Steam forum sentiment are reliable predictors of how most people actually feel). It gives a lot of people, myself included, the ick. Last week, the new Call of Duty alsocame under fire(sorry) for using supposedly AI-generated art; people absolutely hate it. Proponents of the use of generative AI in games often say that it empowers smaller developers to do more with less, but Call of Duty is a multibillion-dollar franchise. Activision can more than afford to pay artists to draw something. Given Arc Raiders’s success, you could say the same about its AI voice lines.It is an existential issue for video game workers – artists, writers and voice actors particularly, but also coders – who may be at risk of losing out to this technology. Many believe that gaming’s corporate overlords would be thrilled to replace expensive, inconvenient humans with machines that generate inadequate but functional work. Take EA, which is mandating that its employees use the company’s internal suite of AI tools, even thoughthey are apparently widely hated. And then there’s Krafton, which proudly declared itself an AI-first game developer before offering its Korean employeesvoluntary redundancy.View image in fullscreenUnder fire … Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been called out for using AI-generated art.Photograph: ActivisionIndeed, most of the people rushing to defend the use of generative AI in games are not everyday players or on-the-ground developers, but the corporate class. Epic’s Tim Sweeney – net worth $5bn, give or take – posted on X a series of replies to Eurogamer’s Arc Raiders review, beginning with the familiar, facepalm-inducing entreaty to keep “politics” out of video game reviews (“Political opinions should go into op-eds folks.). Sweeney argued that generative AI could “transform gaming”, evoking a dystopian vision of the future: “Instead of games having a few dozen or hundred lines of prerecorded dialogue, how about infinite, context-sensitive, personality-reflecting dialogue based on and tuned by human voice actors?”Personally, I do not want a machine constantly generating things it thinks I want to hear. I would rather have characters speak lines written by humans with something to say, performed by other humans who understand that meaning. As the award-winning video game actor Jane Perry put it in an interview withGamesIndustry.biz: “Will a bot scuttle up to the stage at the Games awards or the Baftas to accept an award for best performance? I think most audiences prefer a real human performance; however, the creative drive of the tech elite is incredibly strong, especially when the name of the game is to replace humans with machines.”In my many years covering this beat, I have noticed that what happens in the video game world often happens in the wider world. A few years ago, there was a rush of investment in Web3/blockchain-driven games that bought into the idea of NFTs – digital “artworks” that people could own and trade, all of which were just unbelievably ugly, all rad skulls and gurning computer-generated apes smoking cigars; thankfully,that bubble burstspectacularly. When the big tech world suddenly latched on to theidea of the “metaverse”a few years ago, gaming companies had already been building much better versions of that idea for decades. And Gamergate provided a blueprint for the weaponisation of disaffected young men that directly influenced the Trump campaign playbook and set the template for the now omnipresent culture wars. This is why anyone interested in the impact of AI on work and culture should be looking at the ripples that that technology is making among developers and players. It can be an interesting predictor.What we’re seeing play out looks like a familiar struggle between the people who actually make things, and those who profit off that labour. We’re also seeing players question whether they should pay the same money for games that include lower-quality, machine-generated art and voices. And we are seeing new lines being drawn around which uses of AI are culturally and ethically acceptable, and which are not.What to playView image in fullscreenA plot less travelled … Goodnight Universe.Photograph: Nice Dream/Skybound GamesFrom the people behind the devastating Before Your Eyes comesGoodnight Universe, a game in which you playa super-intelligent six-month-old baby with psychic powers.

But soon he develops telekinetic abilities and the power to read minds, attracting unwanted attention. If you have a webcam, you can play it with your eyes, by looking around and blinking. This game packs an emotional punch and the plot also goes places I wasn’texpecting.

In his latest,The Phoenician Scheme, a man is casually split in half in an aircraft crash. InThe Royal Tenenbaums, the patriarchal protagonist feigns a terminal illness in order to weasel his way back into his estranged and dysfunctional family. InThe Grand Budapest Hotelthe “heroic” concierge Monsieur Gustave is essentially a killer and the fictional Republic of Zubrowka is in the tightening grip of a fascist regime.All this is played for knowing comedic effect (the splatted bisection resembles a Tom and Jerry cartoon; Zubrowka is a brand of Polish bison grass vodka), while lavishly sugarcoated in a set dressing of eccentric curios, outlandish costumes and saturated colour. Anderson aficionados will be familiar with the drill, a bit like finding a gnat in a cupcake, delivered in a series of perfectly composed vignettes.AfterStanley KubrickandTim Burton, the Design Museum’s fascination with film directors has now alighted on Anderson, with an expanded version of a show devised in association with the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, where it was first shown. The format is by now familiar, featuring a curated trove of archive material arranged film by film. Among the 700 objects exhumed from a warehouse in Kent are costumes, wigs, sketches, models, fictional books, fictional art, a tent, a typewriter and dozens of stop-motion puppets.View image in fullscreenUpper-class elites … costumes from The Royal Tenenbaums on display.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty ImagesThe 30-year cinematic arc begins withBottle Rocket, an unlikely mid-90s homage to Scorsese’s Mean Streets, and ends with The Phoenician Scheme, released earlier this year to mixed reviews. Ab Rogers created the exhibition design, with rooms decorated in various shades of red, starting with post-box and terminating in maroon. The Anderson quirkfest fairly zings out from this incarnadine backdrop.Wesophiles will doubtless relish poring over the spoils, such as the implausibly intricate scale model of the Darjeeling Express, or the luxurious red velvet and mink number worn by Tilda Swinton as the desiccated dowager, Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis, in The Grand Budapest Hotel. There is also the actual Grand Budapest Hotel, a towering pink confection resembling a monstrous marzipan wedding cake, along with maquettes of the mutant sea creatures that populateThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, and an array of furry, diddy, stop-motion puppets fromFantastic Mr Fox, lined up like a vulpine identity parade.Known for his snappy dressing, Wes had a suit made from the same corduroy as Mr Fox, who was voiced by George Clooney, exemplifying Anderson’s A-list pulling power. Stellar ensemble casts are another recurring feature; blink and you may miss Swinton or Tom Hanks. Wider creative collaborators include graphic designerErica Dornand Italian costume designerMilena Canonero, whose first major screen credit was on A Clockwork Orange.View image in fullscreenFantastic … Mr Fox models his corduroy suit.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPALess committed cineastes might find the insistent “Wesness” of it all somewhat overwhelming, like being trapped in a branch of Oliver Bonas crammed with hyper-twee gewgaws. The tone of object fetishisation is set from the get-go as the show opens with a vitrine full of identical, spiral bound notebooks, filled with preternaturally neat and precise handwriting outlining ideas for each film. Wes is, and has always been, a details man.The pervading impression is of a creative finickiness verging on the obsessive. Supreme pains are taken, whether it’s auditioning left-handed children to achieve the right kind of 1960s handwriting for a five-word note on screen for seconds inMoonrise Kingdom, or employing the exact type of ink favoured by the Japanese yakuza for a tattoo on the back of Mayor Kobayashi, a puppet character fromIsle of Dogs.The laborious technique of stop-motion animation, which requires models to be manipulated between 12 and 24 times for each second of film, must take the biscuit. Fantastic Mr Fox took two years to make and the animators, who are more like performers, are required to make the puppet model act and feel like a real person.Less cosy and less discussed is what American criticJonah Weiner has describedas “the clumsy, discomfiting way Anderson stages interactions between white protagonists – typically upper-class elites – and non-white foils, typically working-class and poor”. This was especially apparent inThe Darjeeling Limited, featuring three white men blundering haplessly around “exotic” India, a reminder of the absence of real-world politics in Anderson’s films. Concentrating on the minutiae of their art and craft conveniently swerves any knotty issues.Yet for all the tantalising stuff on show, there’s something fundamentally disconcerting about deconstructing the kinetic medium of film in order to reframe it as a collection of static objects. It’s like pulling back the curtain to find the scenery creaking and the mystique, if not exactly dissolved, then certainly altered. Invariably, there’s a certain reductive lifelessness about it all.Nonetheless, Anderson’s idiosyncratic, deadpan hipster view of the world continues to attract an appreciable following. It has even spawned an extensive fan website,Accidentally Wes Anderson, to which devotees can submit Andersonesque tableaux of kooky buildings and landscapes. Scrolling through colour-coded Alpine chalets, darling launderettes and the odd Crochet Museum, it would would appear that there really is no escaping Wes World.Wes Anderson: The Archivesis at the Design Museum, London, 21 November to 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsDesignWes AndersonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mm-mm. Mmmmmwwwwwmmm. MMM. Sometimes sexy and sometimes sleepy, sometimes like a kid making airplane noises or doing an impression of a creaking door or maybe a whale, the sound of Harold Offeh humming and ummming fills the lobby of Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge. Mmm, he goes, mmm-mm-mm. He up-speaks and mumbles and wrings a whole world of feeling out of this disembodied overture. The title of Offeh’s show, including that Mmm, is a quote,from a song on Portishead’s 1994 album Dummy. “Gotta try a little harder / It could be sweet,” runs the lyric, which is also printed in big gloopy lettering on the gallery walls, behind Offeh’s video screens, his photographs and other graphic interventions. The show blares and jostles with life, with song and dance, with skits and routines, with public moments and private performances on the loo and in the bathroom.For more than two decades Offeh has been a moving target. Here’s the Ghanaian-born Offeh as Haroldinho, in Rio de Janeiro in 2003, shuffling samba steps and wearing typical, Brazilian blue worker’s overalls, his adopted name appliqued on the back. Dancing in the streets and on the beach, he sways and smiles, an object of mild curiosity to passersby. In Rio, people often assumed he was Brazilian. Here he is again, now on the streets and shopping centres of Walsall, Oxford, Liverpool and Chester, in Stockholm and Banff, in the shadow of the Canadian Rockies, wearing a Victorian-era magnifying lens in front of his face, which distorts and exaggerates his features. Given the suspicious looks he gets on the British streets, you worry for his safety.View image in fullscreen‘The artist as reclining soul singer’ … Harold Offeh’s Lounging.Photograph: © Harold OffehSometimes a smile will see you through. A closeup of Offeh’s face, maintaining a sardonic rictus-like grin fills the screen. He’s listening, over and over again, to Nat King Cole and the Nelson Riddle Orchestra’s 1954 version of the Charlie Chaplin-composed Smile. Made in 2001, when Offeh was still a student, Smile is the earliest work here. He went on to mimic the exaggerated facial expressions and closeup reaction-shots of black actor Hattie McDaniel in her role as Mammy, the enslaved house servant in the 1939 movie Gone With the Wind. Subjected to racism and discrimination throughout her life as a blues singer and the first Black recipient of an Oscar in 1939 (as best supporting actor in the same movie), McDaniel becomes Offeh’s model as he runs the gamut of her on-screen performance. Hair done-up in a white scarf, eye-rolling, eyebrow-raising, lip-curling and cheek-blowing for the camera, Offeh mimics her racially stereotyped performance.I laughed out loud, in the way that you laugh at a bleak moment in a Samuel Beckett playHere he is again, wearing an “I LIKE BOYS” T-shirt and then in drag and snapping his fingers like a disco diva, flaming to Armando’s 100% of Disin’ You. Now he’s lounging in stilled, silent emulation of singerTeddy Pendergrass, posing with his hands together in a lewd gesture. This is the artist as reclining soul singer, comfortable in his studied masculinity. Offeh went on to perform drag impersonations of Black R&B and disco stars in Covers, in which he adopts their record-sleeve postures. Wearing a black leotard he performs Marlena Shaw’s stylised pose on Take a Bite, Millie Jackson’s Get Out and Get Some, Amii Stewart’s Knock on Wood. Getting into position in different parts of his house, he does Melba Moore’s Hot and Tasty in his cluttered loft, and for his rendition of Grace Jones’s Slave to the Rhythm he gets naked in the bathroom, slathering himself up in oil to attempt Jones’sanatomically impossible montaged posefrom the cover of her Island Life album, originally designed by John-Paul Goude.There’s parody, vulnerability, homage and critique and more than a hint of desire at play in Covers, which Offeh has also re-performed in a series of staged photographs.In 2020, Offeh tried to re-enact the contorted poses ofHenri Gaudier-Brzeska’s early modernist sculptures in the Kettle’s Yard collection. If he tried any harder, he’d do himself a mischief. Offeh is compelling to watch, even when he is lying in the bath or just standing on the pavement, the world swirling round him. He is happy to objectify himself, I think, even as he questions what it means to be a queer, Black body. That vulnerability and curiosity are also present in his early, 2002 Four Ways to Feel Amazing, in which we find the artist listening to self-help advice. Naked in his bath, looking like a lost little boy with a half-drowned toy as his only friend, he is advised to nurture himself. Standing on a street and looking schlumpy and alone he’s told to stop comparing himself with others (while being the solitary Black person among the milling shoppers); on the lavatory with his trousers down, he’s told that he is sitting on top of the world. In the last of these vignettes, he is alone in a bare room, staring at a digital clock as he is asked to live in the moment and to feel “the Now”. As the numbers flip on the clock, there’s a crushing sense of futility and stalled time. I laughed out loud, in the way that you laugh at a bleak moment in a Samuel Beckett play. Behind the evident joyfulness of his early work, there is an underlying pain. You feel it in Offeh’s comic timing, the eye-to-camera moments, the beat and the pause.View image in fullscreenHarold Offeh’s Covers: After Grace Jones, Island Life, 1985 (Graceful Arabesque).Photograph: Courtesy the artistOffeh performs less nowadays and his body is no longer centre stage. All the graphic razzmatazz, and an increasing installational complexity (some of which is influenced by Afrofuturism and Brazilian Tropicália, particularly the work ofHélio Oiticica) keeps the energy up even as the tempo and tenor of his art slows. On the evidence here, Offeh’s focus has shifted of late more towards community-based projects that, to my mind, are less compelling as art works themselves than as social inquiry. He has worked with young people ona project for the London Underground, and on aplaygroundwhose design was influenced by Sun Ra and George Benson. His video documentation of a workshop at Charleston in Sussex, the country retreat of the Bloomsbury Group, during an exhibition of the erotic works of Duncan Grant, and in which participants discuss queer sex, love and desire, is a dull watch. The interviews with immigrants and members of the local LGTBQ+ community in a small town in Japan, where Offeh undertook a residency in 2019, or the archival interviews about queer life in Toronto, from the 1950s to the present, might be compelling fragments of storytelling, but Offeh here is playing the role of witness and documentarian rather than artist. But he probably sees the role of artist in terms of his usefulness nowadays.In the gallery, there’s a sign hanging overhead. It says PLAY. This participatory, social turn in Offeh’s work has its own rewards, but to make art, maybe you gotta try a little less. It could be sweet.At Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, until 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtVideo artPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

For 13-year-old Dorothy (Nimi Spiff), they are the reason she wants to get out. What need for scenery and pink icing when she could be in the hubbub of London?Grieving for her mother and fantasising about her absent father, she is determined to escape to the capital for Christmas. But aLake Districtstorm is brewing and, after making a break through the upstairs window of her aunt and uncle’s house, she is propelled along a different route.In the hands of playwright Sonia Jalaly, the familiarL Frank Baumcharacters are present and correct, punky flying monkeys and all, but this is also a tale of anger management and self-realisation. Without an outlet for her grief, Dorothy is in danger of turning her rage into hatred, something the Wicked Witch of the West (Emma Jay Thomas) is all too eager to exploit. Without a sense of belonging, Dorothy is liable to forget that home is not a location but where the heart is.View image in fullscreenEmotional truth … Nimi Spiff as Dorothy.Photograph: Pamela RaithHer journey to Oz, where the Wizard (Michael Hugo) turns out to be as much of a letdown as her long-lost father, teaches her to draw on her resourcefulness and find the courage to stay.Scrooge gets a hip-hop spin and the RSC does the BFG: 20 of the best UK stage shows this ChristmasRead moreIt is a mission Spiff tackles with emotional truth as the winter trees and craggy skyline of Yoav Segal’s set make way for spangly turquoise Munchkins and lime-green residents of the Emerald City. She plots a solid path from rebellious teen to confident adult-in-waiting, taking time for some spirited singing en route, even if some of Ziad Jabero’s songs are overly wordy.Elsewhere, however, Sarah Punshon’s production is too eager to please a younger audience – younger, certainly, than the first-night guests who make little response to a cartoonish humour that would minimise the story’s urgency whatever your age. Yes, there is room for a touch of cuteness along the lines of Vinnie Monachello’s barking Toto, but it is only with the stage-engulfing flap of the Wicked Witch’s black cloak and the hi-tech bewilderment of the Wizard’s lair that the production becomes serious enough to be gripping.AtTheatre by the Lake, Keswick, until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsThe Wizard Of OzLake DistrictChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

The setting is central because the dystopia has been caused by a biomedical waste dump in the river. London is flooded and this flat on the 16th floor is the safest place to live.Or so it seems, because things are very opaque in this experimental production. Devised by director Adam Lenson, Stu Barter, Rachel Bellman, Annabelle Lee Revak, Darren Clark and Shaye Poulton Richards, it brings an electro-folk sound to bitty storylines in two timezones. There are the tower block survivors – it is unclear which century they are living in until close to the end when they mention the year 2425 – and a second storyline in the past which might be the 1990s (there is talk of DVDs) in which a couple moves into a luxury high-rise overlooking the Thames (the same 16th-floor flat?).Ash (Eric Stroud) is a scientist, Emily (Holly Freeman) a civil servant. Both are, handily, implicated in the climate disaster to come. Short scenes take us through their relationship and the storyline on toxic waste but they seem like filler between the songs.View image in fullscreenMeditative music … Precipice.Photograph: Alex BrennerThe music is meditative in pace and grounds the story rather than propelling it, especially as the relationship between the couple begins to fray. Some instrumental accompaniments are nice (with synth, guitar, cello and harmonica) but the songs are not infectious in themselves, with cumbersome lyrics that aspire for emotional interiority but sound waffly and pedestrian. There is one about a game of Monopoly, another about a mudlarker that does not seem to belong to this musical, and one about the increase of anti-microbial resistance, which is quite a mouthful.Its various strands hold promise but none engage or progress enough. There is haphazard worldbuilding within the dystopia: we meet characters as they celebrate “The Balance” (what is this?) and give thanks to its founder, Robin Blake (who is he?). There is a deadly, Hunger Games-style Tombola which ends in one resident’s eviction but we do not gather enough detail about the dangers of the world beyond this tower so the stakes remain low. A character called Biscuits (Max Alexander-Taylor) gets the short straw but we know so little of his backstory or his fears that the force of this storyline is neutered. Flashbacks lack significance and elementary facts are revealed too late (we are told that martial law was established in this society in the year 2034).The endeavour to create a new, boundary-breaking musical form is clear but the attempt at reconception drowns out the drama.AtNew Diorama, London, until 13 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them. They just seem so young. I do look at them and say, ‘Oh it’s crazy I was doing that.’ But it’s also incredibly sweet and I hope they’re having a great time.”Since falling out with Harry Potter author JK Rowlingover trans rights and gender identity issues, Radcliffe has kept his distance from the new TV series, saying that he had no plans to be involved in it.He told E! Online in 2024: “I think [the producers] very wisely want to [have] a clean break. And I don’t know if it would work to have us do anything in it.”The new series is due to premiere in 2027 and, according to HBO, will be a “faithful adaptation” of the books by Rowling, who serves as an executive producer. The eight feature films based on the books were released between 2001 and 2011, and the series has a similarly ambitious timeframe, with Casey Bloys, chairman and CEO of HBO and Max Content, sayingit would run for “10 consecutive years”.Explore more on these topicsFilmDaniel RadcliffeHarry PotterFilm adaptationsHBOTelevisionScience fiction and fantasy filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the miracle – when everything comes together and you’re there to catch it’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 19 Nov 2025 10.29 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 14.42 ESTShareIn 2013, I’d been living in New York for a long time. The social life was vibrant but I had never figured out a way to make pictures there. So when a friend sent me details of a teaching position in Eureka,California, I jumped at the chance. When I arrived, I found Northern California to be a confounding and beautiful place, one that inspired a new body of work almost immediately.Eureka was the first time I’d stayed so long in one place. During those months, I saw the same people day after day. I taught two days a week at the local community college and the rest of the time I was free to walk around – exploring, meeting people and taking photographs. I was entirely focused on my work, almost like a residency.Northern California is a rugged place that feels like the far-flung edge of the world. I lived in this old house on top of a hill where people rented furnished rooms. You could see the Pacific ocean and the redwoods from the upstairs windows and people came and went without announcement. The entire time, I had this feeling that I could disappear and no one would notice. I would get that feeling from others too. A lot of the people I met in Eureka were on the run, either from their own lives, or from a country they thought had let them down. Humboldt County has a mythic presence; it remains a mystery that I don’t think I ever solved.The camera has an amazing ability to elevate the mess of the everyday into coherence and harmonySome of the relationships I photographed in my book Lost Coast were five minutes long and others stretched out over months. There’s no shortcut when you take someone’s photograph. If I’m interested in someone, I walk right up to them with my camera and tell them what my work is about. That direct line of communication either opens the floodgates or shuts them down immediately. There has to be trust and mutual curiosity, otherwise it just doesn’t work. It’s my hope that the people I meet are getting as much from me as I am from them, and it’s that collaboration, the trust, and the shared vulnerability that make the work interesting to me.Photographing is a lot of waiting – for people or mood or the weather or the perfect backdrop. Waiting for the miracle to arrive. This picture highlights that interplay of chance, intuition and patience. I had visited this location numerous times without ever finding a picture there. I knew someone who lived nearby, and on this particular afternoon I had returned, hoping to find them. Instead, I turned the corner and saw this: a dusty alley lined with daisies, a few redheads, a handful of puppies, and a woman with a gas can, the whole scene lit up by blinding sun.That’s the miracle, when everything comes together, with me there to catch the whole thing. Those moments are so rare, and they disappear as quickly as they come. Like this picture, my favourite photographs tend to be open-ended. I want the pictures to ask more questions than they answer. I want the viewer to actively participate in the formation of narrative and meaning. In the end, the camera has an amazing ability to elevate the chaos and mess of the everyday world into coherence and harmony, to make even the mundane feel transcendent.View image in fullscreenPhotographer Curran HatlebergCurran Hatleberg’s CVBorn:Washington DC, 1982High point:“Showing at the Whitney Biennial.”Top tip:“Forget about inspiration, dedication is what sustains an artistic practice.”A new edition of Lost Coast, andCurran Hatleberg’s new book, Blood Green, are published byTBW BooksExplore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But among It Happened One Night, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, and The Silence of the Lambs, it may be Cuckoo’s Nest, released 50 years ago on Wednesday, that feels like the unlikeliest across-the-board triumph. It Happened One Night and The Silence of the Lambs both belong to rarely awarded genres (romantic comedy and horror, respectively), which makes their big wins unusual but also clearcut: here is an example of the best this type of movie has to offer. Cuckoo’s Nest, meanwhile, is potentially much thornier. It’s a comedy-drama made at least in part as allegory – an anti-conformity story of fomenting 1960s social rebellion, disguised as a movie about lovable patients at a mental health facility.Whatever happened to Billy Bibbit? The extraordinary life of actor Brad Dourif – from Cuckoo’s Nest to ChuckyRead moreThe Ken Kesey novel that the movie is based on was published in 1962, chronicling some of what Kesey saw as a hospital orderly and anticipating some of the coming pushback against postwar American conformity. The major change in Miloš Forman’s film is to shift the narrative away from Chief (Will Sampson), a towering Native American who presents himself as deaf and mute. Chief narrates the book, while the movie hews closer to the perspective of RP McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who enters the facility having faked mental illness in the hopes that he can avoid serving out a prison work-camp sentence. Though the doctors don’t seem entirely convinced by his ruse, his behavior is apparently erratic enough for him to stay at least a little while. His attempts to bring more individualism and fun to his cohabitants runs afoul of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who exercises tight control over the ward.The free-spirited rogue vexing a stern authority figure by inciting partying is a conceit that borders on zaniness; only a few years later, two of the actors who play patients at the facility, Danny DeVito andChristopher Lloyd, would be co-starring on the cast-of-eccentrics sitcom Taxi, with Lloyd even playing an amusingly burnt-out weirdo. (A great show, to be clear, but not a sobering account of mental illness.) Nicholson, however, gives such a layered performance that McMurphy transcends any easy romanticization. He’s at once as caricatured as any future “Jack” parts – look at the way McMurphy’s trademark skullcap, when removed, accentuates the arches of Nicholson’s instantly recognizable receding hairline – and subtly haunted.The moment often cited, and with good cause, comes close to the end of the picture, in the aftermath of a raucous party in-ward McMurphy has haphazardly arranged for his new friends. (It’s the kind of messy blowout that would cause many a crusty old dean to admonish a fun-loving frat for this time going too far.) McMurphy and Chief plan to escape the facility at the end of the night; they’re two of the few patients who have been committed, rather than residing there voluntarily. McMurphy sits near the window where he’ll supposedly make his escape, staring into space, and Forman holds on the closeup of Nicholson as he appears to contemplate the consequences of his actions, or maybe what he might actually do next, given his arrest record and limited resources. The stare isn’t exactly vacant – though it is echoed by his vegetative look at the end of the film, after he’s been punished for his rebellion by a lobotomy – but you can sense the lostness beneath his Nicholsonian bravado.Fletcher did not go on to a Nicholson-sized career, but her work as Nurse Ratched is nearly as indelible. In terms of screen time, she could be considered a supporting player; she’s less immediately visible for much of the movie than the ensemble of patients surrounding McMurphy. Fletcher doesn’t showboat, either. For the vast majority of her scenes, she’s quietly officious, rarely raising her voice – but never giving in, either, quelling dissent or changes in routine with a stubbornness she smoothly passes as care. Those with memories of McMurphy’s rebellious nature might be surprised to find how many scenes involve him ultimately deferring to Ratched, despite what he refers to as “that henhouse shit”. Her key moment comes when she admonishes young, timid Billy (Brad Dourif) for consorting with a prostitute. She doesn’t focus on recklessness or respect for women or even breaking the facility’s rules. Instead, she asks: “Aren’t you ashamed?”The idea of shaming people into conformity still resonates, not least because it’s issued here by an authority figure who (as is often the case) seems to refuse any herself. Though some of the treatment methods depicted in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest would fall out of favor in the decades after, the movie derives a certain sense of timelessness from its milieu, simply because the isolation and regimented nature of the hospital doesn’t feel particularly confined to the 1960s, when the story is set, or the 1970s, when it was made. (OK, maybe the notion of McMurphy’s illicit day out involving taking the boys fishing feels quaint today.)View image in fullscreenLouise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson.Photograph: Ronald Grant ArchiveFifty years later, the film’s influence may be most visible through its zanier side – which in a weird way turns out to be its more menacing side, too. It doesn’t feel entirely coincidental that the campus comedy Animal House, released a few years later, is set right around the same time as Cuckoo’s Nest, finding similarly male-centric liberation in parties and tacit self-destruction, only without the sadder dimensions of the earlier film. And despite that sadness, Cuckoo’s Nest does push a very American form of rugged-to-a-fault individualism, even conflating that rebellious nature with a Native character. In 2025, there’s almost something a little bit Maha-coded about the film’s treatment of mental health, where conditions like Billy’s stammer can be conquered with a little thematically neat (and convenient) gumption, while Chief’s muteness and deafness are just stuff he’s decided to fake, and medication is just another conformist form of control.Of course, those undertones are more to do with shifts in the nature of American rebellion over the past half-century. Still, it’s instructive to look at the unusually staggering lineup of competition Cuckoo’s Nest faced at the Oscars. Setting aside the Europe-set Barry Lyndon, the other best picture nominees for 1975 tell specific and fascinating stories about the US: the can-do spirit of the central trio in Jaws, pitted against all-American, Independence Day-themed capitalism; the hapless criminals of Dog Day Afternoon, feeling abandoned by society as they incite a media circus; and the roiling, sometimes ridiculous political climate depicted in Nashville. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, ending (as the novel did) with Chief smothering a lobotomized McMurphy and making the leap to his own majestic escape, seems at least as sad as any of those films. Yet it’s understandably received as something more triumphant, however mitigated that spirit might be. “I tried, didn’t I? Goddammit, at least I did that,” McMurphy says about his own attempt to lift a water tank and smash a window, as Chief eventually does. It’s not the most subtle or complex message among those other 1975 classics. But it might be the easiest for audiences to latch on to. Who can’t relate to losing a battle and telling ourselves that we eked out a victory?Explore more on these topicsOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's NestJack NicholsonDanny DeVitoDrama filmsMiloš FormanChristopher LloydfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a new exhibition shows, it ended up influencing pop art, graphic design and electronic musicians from Kraftwerk to OMDRobert RotiferWed 19 Nov 2025 08.31 ESTShareWhen Otto Neurath died in Oxford some 80 years ago, far away from his native Vienna, he was still finding his feet in exile. Like many a Jewish refugee, the economist, philosopher and sociologist had been interned as a suspected enemy alien on the Isle of Man, along with his third wife and close collaborator Marie Reidemeister, having chanced a last-minute life-saving escape from their interim hideout in the Netherlands across the Channel in a rickety boat in 1940.Thanks to Neurath’s pioneering use of pictorial statistics – or “Isotypes” as Reidemeister called them, an acronym for “International System of Typographic Picture Education” – he left behind an enormous legacy in the arts and social sciences: it is the language through which we decode and analyse the modern world. But his lasting relevance would have been hard to predict at the time of his death at the age of 63.Neurath demanded his images ‘show the most important thing about the object at first glance’At that point, his Vienna Method of Pictorial Statistics had had relatively little impact in the UK (beyond providing strikingly simplified imagery to the public information shorts of leftist film-maker Paul Rotha). Neurath’s “visual autobiography” had been shelved by his publishers, who probably failed to follow the ambitious arc of its title, “From Hieroglyphics to Isotype”.View image in fullscreenA graphic showing residential density in large cities, designed by Marie Reidemeister (later Neurath).Photograph: Otto and Marie Neurath Isotype Collection, University of ReadingSuggesting a civilisational peak being reached in his own creation, this tome – which remained unpublished until 2010 – outlined his democratising vision for a way to overcome educational class divides, as crystallised in the slogan: “Words divide, pictures unite”.This harked back to the socialist spirit of interwar “Red Vienna”, ill at ease with the shamelessly profit-driven orientation of capitalist postwar Anglo-American pop culture. Yet Neurath’s enthusiasm for modern methods of reproduction corresponded to the nature of pop as mass-manufactured art without a unique original. And just as advertising slogans or pop songs are angling for instant appeal, Neurath also demanded images that “show the most important thing about the object at first glance”.In retrospect, his thoughtful semiotics anticipated much of pop art. Just as pop music follows hedonistic principles, Neurath’s aims went far beyond the utilitarian. As one of the linchpins ofVienna’s social housing programme, he placed “happiness” above the practical advantages of typification and standardisation, infuriating purists with his statement that “the optimal technical solution by no means always coincides with the greatest happiness.” At the same time, Neurath was enamoured with new technology, championing fellow exile Wolja Saraga’s Saraga-Generator – an early electronic instrument akin to the theremin but controlled by light – and predicting the creation of an artificial “Isotype voice” for future documentary films.It makes a lot of sense, then, that in 2017 the UK synthpop duo Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – who utilised the unlikely charm of synthesised speech as far back as the 1983 album Dazzle Ships – would release a track called Isotype. The song was intended to celebrate Neurath’s “fucking genius”, as their singer and lyricist Andy McCluskey puts it, speaking to me from his home on the Wirral. Both he andPeter Saville, the graphic designer who notably fashioned the aesthetics of OMD’s early albums as well as the corporate identity of the Manchester label Factory Records (Joy Division, New Order, etc) came across Neurath’s method back in the early 1980s.View image in fullscreenVinyl artwork for Kraftwerk’s 1974 album Autobahn.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTo them, the de-ornamentalised style of Isotype – mostly designed by Neurath’s favoured artist Gerd Arntz – seemed to perfectly pre-empt the graphic asceticism of the post-punk era. “We liked the idea of reducing things to the minimum and still getting the point across,” says McCluskey. “We had both grown up withKraftwerk’s Autobahn album, which in its later guise was the simple Isotype of the autobahn sign with the two highways and the bridge on a blue background. So these were the frames of reference which go back decades.”However, there is some ambivalence to McCluskey’s admiration of Neurath’s proto-pop imagery. “What kind of worried me was one of Otto Neurath’s phrases: ‘To remember simple pictures is better than to forget accurate figures,’” he says. “Originally that would have been a mantra that I adored. But it’s also a scary predictor of the world we live in now, in terms of soundbites and our limited capacity to understand. Doesn’t it sound like Donald Trump’s whole political mantra?”View image in fullscreenThe Factory Records logo, designed by Peter SavilleThe video for OMD’s Neurath tribute is a moving mandala of isotypes created by German artist Henning M Lederer, and takes pride of place in Wissen für alle: Isotype (“Knowledge for all”), a newly opened exhibition on Neurath’s work and legacy in Wien Museum, the recently and beautifully expanded mid-century-style Museum of the City of Vienna on Karlsplatz, bang in the middle of the Austrian capital.Featuring lots of yellowed original posters designed for Neurath’s mass-reproducable “museums of the future”, it is a compact but effective display brimming with the socialist utopian energy that would have coursed through the streets of Vienna in those heady days before the arrival of first Austro-fascism, then the Nazi regime. But what might have seemed like mere nostalgia a few years ago now feels like a rediscovered manual for resistance; a useful reminder of how leftwing politics tackled the challenge to overcome intellectual snobbery, striving to make itself understood.Wissen für alle: Isotype, die Bildsprache aus Wienis at Wien Museum, Vienna, until 5 April 2026Explore more on these topicsDesignExhibitionsTypographyNew OrderKraftwerkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even if you’re able to ignore the culture war sailing across the Atlantic, we now have the double whammy of Thanksgiving andBlack Fridaybeing celebrated in the UK.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While the former may only have a small footprint in the UK, the latter is big business. In 2024,Britons spent £3.6bn between Black Friday and the retro-futuristically named Cyber Monday– a 5.2% increase on the previous year, despite (or perhaps because of) the ongoing cost-of-living crisis.Still, even those of us who lament the never-ending drip-feed of commercialism and resent the very presence of Black Friday in the British lexicon can benefit from this particular capitalist jamboree. It’s just a case of playing it smart and focusing on what you need, rather than being seduced by offers.Here are some tips on how to get through Black Friday feeling smug, rather than regretful.Black Friday shopping tipsPrep in advanceView image in fullscreenBlack Friday often kicks off earlier than the actual day – and finishes later.Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty ImagesDecide what you actually wantIf you’re braving the Black Friday sales, either in person or online, do so with a hitlist of what you actually need. It’s in every retailer’s interest to shove the “best” offers in your face to tempt you to spend more – and some of us just aren’t strong enough to resist the lure of the 50%-off sticker, no matter our best intentions.The thing to remember is this: if you didn’t want the product before you saw it, you haven’t made a 50% saving. You’ve just spent 100% more than you’d originally planned.Decide how much you’ll spend and stick to itWith retailers promoting offers everywhere you look, it can be easy to go overboard. A couple of bargain purchases and suddenly you’re overdrawn with a porch that resembles an Amazon warehouse.Study your income and outgoings to figure out how much you can afford to spend. You can be a little flexible here if you’re shopping for Christmas presents and thus reducing your December outgoings, but don’t be too clever with the justifications: you’ll only end up hurting yourself.Follow favourite brands on social media nowIf there are specific brands you’re hoping to see in the Black Friday sales, it pays to follow them on social media right away. Not only will you hear about any big discounts firsthand, but you might also benefit from coupons, early-bird discounts and offers exclusively for followers. Yes, you’ll have to endure a bit of hard sell and some cringey corporate meme appropriation, but you can always unfollow when the deals season is over.Prepare to go early (but not too early)Black Friday, which this year falls on 28 November, is theoretically the day after Thanksgiving. In practice, however, shoppers’ appetite for sales has led to the festivities kicking off earlier – and finishing later. In other words, you should be alert to bargains ahead of time, just in case.That said, shops will always have something up their sleeves to exclusively reveal on Black Friday itself, so it pays not to buy before the big day unless you’re absolutely certain that something better won’t come along (at the very least, make sure there’s a good returns policy, just in case). Some retailers, such asCurrysandRicher Sounds, have a Black Friday price guarantee, where they’ll refund the difference if the price drops lower, which can give you a little more confidence.Set price alertsIf you have a specific product in mind, you can track its price in real-time, helping you to strike when the time is right. ThePriceRunnerapp lets you do this, saving you from checking dozens of listings manually.On Black Friday itselfView image in fullscreenAvoid today’s Black Friday impulse buys from becoming tomorrow’s charity shop donations.Photograph: Richard Baker/In Pictures/Getty ImagesAsk why something is reducedBlack Friday sales can be disorientating. Not only is there a fixed time limit on discounts, but there’s also an implied scarcity of stock. There’s a pressure to act quickly – after all, nobody wants to be the fool who missed the great deal by being indecisive.Stores prey on this, and it’s fair to say there are some (post-Thanksgiving) turkeys in the mix alongside the bona fide bargains. Perhaps the reason for the big discount is that the warehouse is chock-full of units they couldn’t shift at full price? Less cynically, maybe it’s that there’s a newer, better version that would suit your needs. Either way, it pays to …Check the reviews – especially the one-star onesDespite being the most popular retailer in the UK,the Amazon experience has seemingly worsened in recent years. One common issue is the sudden prevalence of gibberish manufacturer names producing very similar-looking products with suspiciously good reviews.The fact that you’ve never heard of the brand may not be a red flag, though. If the product does the same thing as a well-known model and is available at a healthy discount, it may just be a savvy purchase.The trick is to dig deep into those reviews – and not just the five-star ones, which have a history of being naughtily incentivised to boost their presence in the algorithm. Check the one- and two-star reviews as well, since this is where the gold lies. If you see a consistent thread of defects or a general sense of disappointment, then don’t take the risk, no matter how deep the discount.Resist impulsebuysSometimes, an offer will seem so appealing that your resolve is tested – even if it’s a product you’ve never needed before.There’s nothing inherently wrong with that – I’ve often found myself persuaded of products’ merits by reading articles on the Filter – but today’s Black Friday impulse buy can very easily become tomorrow’s charity shop donation.Slow down and ask yourself a couple of questions. First, “Why do I need this?” If you can’t answer or your answer isn’t convincing, then at least sleep on it.Follow this up with: “Am I only interested because it’s cheap?” If so, remember you’ll save more money by closing the browser window.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The next thing to ask is: “Is it really reduced?”, and if so: “From what?”No, honestly – this isn’t a philosophical thought experiment designed to stop you from spending, it’s a literal question.Retailers have a sneaky habit of listing the percentage reduction on the RRP rather than the selling price immediately before Black Friday. Even if they’re comparing the current price against their own, some shopsinflate the list price to above its historic average shortly before the sales, so they can claim a bigger cut on the day itself.Fortunately, you can fight back against this chicanery with a couple of free internet tools. The first,CamelCamelCamel, is specifically for Amazon shoppers. Just enter the product code into the search, and you’ll get a graph of historical pricing, letting you see if this is really a once-in-a-lifetime deal or just business as usual. If that’s too much effort, you caninstall the browser pluginto instantly reveal a price history in real-time as you’re browsing by clicking the camel next to the URL.While not quite as user-friendly, bothPriceRunnerandPriceSpyhave similar price history sections for non-Amazon retailers, so you can see if you have the best price now, and whether it’s been at this level before. Remember, if it has, there’s no need to feel rushed into a purchase.Stick to reputable retailersAs well as being popular with retailers and shoppers, Black Friday is also regrettably popular with scammers. When people are racing to enter their credit card details to secure a bargain, they may be less inclined to check if the site is legitimate in the first place.The best advice here is to stick to retailers that you’ve already heard of, or at least those with an online footprint going back a few years. Even then, if you are following links from other websites and social media, make sure that the site you’re on is the real deal, not a copycat designed to harvest credit card data (this is usually as simple as checking the URL).View image in fullscreenSome Amazon deals are reserved only for Prime members.Photograph: Stephen Frost/AlamyConsider membership schemesWith subscriptions required for music, TV and even certain websites, you may resent the idea of paying retailers for a membership on top of the product itself, but it can pay to reconsider this instinct during Black Friday.That’s because some deals (or all, in the case of Costco) are reserved for site members.Amazon Prime (£95 a year)is the most obvious of these, unlocking exclusive prices for members, along with free shipping and extras such as Prime Video, but there’s alsoAO Five Star(£39.99 a year) and the aforementioned Costco (£42 a year for online-only membership.Sometimes, the price of the membership will be absorbed by the saving you’re making, so do the maths. Whichever you do take up, just remember to cancel before your first payment is due if you don’t want to keep it long term.Check the returns policyIt’s easy to get caught up in a deals frenzy and end up with something you regret buying. For that reason, check the retailer’s returns policy before buying.These may be more generous around Christmas, aware of the needs of those buying potentially unwanted gifts. But there are always caveats, such as products needing to remain unopened, so check the small print.Don’t forget discount codesRemember that you might be able to do better than the list price. Coupons can make an already discounted product even more appealing, so have a nose around and see what’s available.Some retailers will offer a percentage off your first order just by signing up for a newsletter, for example, so shop around if the product has the same discount in multiple stores.Remember refurbishedShopping refurbished isn’t only better for the planet, it can also save you a fair few quid.In recent Black Friday sales, Amazon has had a blanket code for various goods in its warehouse, so it’s worth checking to see if the same applies this year. Ebay often produces a discount code for selected products, too, so check the homepage for any refurbished goods from the big retailers.Don’t discard, donate!Finally, if you are replacing something in the sales, try to dispose of what you no longer need responsibly. You can sell it oneBay,GumtreeandVinted, or donate it to friends, family or charity.Try to avoid landfill, if possible: Black Friday sales aren’t great for sustainability, but you can at least lessen the damage by recycling and reusing where you can.

It then asked people what they thought of its findings. Louise Bastock, a money expert at the website, says respondents all said “trains should be cheaper as it is public transport and more accessible”, with some saying “it feels all wrong” when plane travel cost less.I picked a day in October and compared some costs. For lots of intercity trips the train was cheaper, but there were notable exceptions. On the day I looked, a trip from London to Edinburgh at midday on Thursday 2 October cost from £77.10 on a train and from £15 on a plane.Flightsat other times the same day were available from below £20, while train tickets started above £40. The cheapest flights were from London Stansted, which purists may not consider London at all. A flight from Heathrow at 1.30pm started from £37.It was a similar story for a trip from Newquay to Manchester the next day. Before 9pm train fares started at £113, while flights were advertised from £53. The same day, Glasgow to Bristol flights cost from £15 while train fares start at £56.50.In all cases, the prices are different throughout the day, depending on when you buy your tickets, so it is clear that the fares are not just reflecting the cost of providing the service.View image in fullscreenReserving a seat on a train is free; reserving one on the plane will cost.Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty ImagesWhen it comes to train travel, the operators’ main costs are leasing the actual trains, staffing and paying for the upkeep of the track. These total about 85% of the cost, then there’s fuel – either electricity or diesel – and business costs, such as running the HR department. The fuel is subject to VAT at 5% on diesel and 20% on electricity. I haven’t been able to find out exactly how much it costs to run a train from London to Edinburgh, but have been told that a ballpark figure would be “in the tens of thousands of pounds”. However, rail travel is subsidised, with the government supportingBritish train operating companies to the tune of £4.1bnin the year ending March 2024, according to the latest published figures.Running an airline involves many of the same costs. There are vehicles to lease, landing slots to pay for, and staff on the trip - as well as to support its sale and provision. As a consumer, you also need to pay air passenger duty – this starts at £7 on domestic flights, and is included in the ticket price. Fuel accounts for a much bigger part of airlines’ costs, but they do not have to pay VAT or duty on it. Three years ago,the Campaign for Better Transport estimatedthat taxing fuel used in domestic flights at the same rate as petrol is taxed would make the government £1.5bn a year – that’s a cost the airlines do not face.It’s important to remember that the ticket prices mentioned so far are all headline rates, and may not reflect how much you will end up paying if you require anything beyond a seat and space for a small bag. In its latest annual accounts,Ryanairsaid that while the average fare paid by passengers over the year was €46 (£41), its total revenue for each person once add-ons were included was almost €70.On the LNER train from London to Edinburgh,you’re advised to limit the luggage you lug to three bags; on the cheapest flight – provided by Ryanair – there is a very strict limit of one bag measuring 40 x 30 x 20cm. If you need to add a suitcase, you will pay a fee on top – at the time I priced up the flights I was quoted £28 on top to take a 10kg bag on board (that fee also gave priority boarding and a reserved seat). This comes to £43, so the trip is still cheaper than by train (which was £77.10). But say you want to take your bike to use at the other end: on LNER it can come with you for free (subject to a reservation), while on Ryanair you will be charged £60. Reserving a seat on a train is free; reserving one on the plane will cost – and the price will depend on the desirability of your chosen row.Even if you don’t need luggage, a plane ticket may prove a false economy if your ultimate destination is the centre of a town or city. The train from London to Edinburgh leaves King’s Cross and arrives at Waverley – a station right in the heart of the Scottish capital. Taking Trafalgar Square as the centre of London, King’s Cross is 2.1 miles away, whereas Stansted is 39.4 miles away, while Edinburgh airport is 8.9 miles from Waverley station.Looking at the whole cost of reaching your destination from home may tip the balance – particularly when arriving at an airport late at night, when public transport has finished for the day, or the choices have dwindled to one bus an hour. This will typically mean a more expensive taxi ride to a central destination than arriving at a mainline station.Ultimately, both industries are charging as much as people are willing to pay, and what they think will help them fill all of their services. Cheaper trains and flights in the middle of the day, when it’s quieter, attract travellers who don’t have a set time to arrive. According to a Ryanair spokesperson: “The £15 ticket on London-Edinburgh was a loss leader to stimulate traffic growth, as a £15 ticket is better than an empty seat.” And as the company’s figures for spending show, a full seat offers more chance of add-on purchases than an empty one.From an environmental point of view, there is no contest.According to research by Which?,a flight from London to Edinburgh emits more than double the CO2 of a train trip (although Ryanair disputes this – the spokesperson said it pays “no attention to any fake Which? surveys or ‘research’”).So while the headline cost may be lower on some flights, when the other costs are added, you may end up seeing the train ticket as a better deal.Explore more on these topicsRail faresThe price of everythingFlightsRail travelRyanairAirline industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Once a decade or so, the urban-centric fashion world discovers this delightful concept called The Countryside. With the vanishingly scant levels of self-awareness that are fashion’s default setting, it then proceeds to immediately and loudly tell the world about it. There are so many trees! Don’t you just love trees? Especially at this time of year when the leaves are lovely tasteful colours, great for selfies, very flattering to the complexion. The pubs are absolutely charming. Sometimes they even have sourdough.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Here we go again. It began with hiking boots, a couple of years ago. Last winter, the barn jacket was suddenly, inexplicably everywhere, and this season is wall-to-wall Fair Isle jumpers. Dressing like you are on a cosy mini-break is to autumn what dressing for a festival field is to summer: a version of countryside dressing conceived by someone who leaves the city for no more than 48 hours at a time. It is possibly not even a million miles from cultural appropriation. And at this point I need to hold my hands up and say: I’m as bad as any of them. I love the countryside but I, in my cold hard heart, am an urban creature, really.The gravitational pull of this look is to do with our longing for wholesomenessI think – I hope? – it’s OK to wear country-coded clothes, so long as you accept that those people with the adorable accents in that sweet pub are slightly rolling their eyes behind your back. The gravitational pull of this look is to do with our longing for wholesomeness, for slowing down in an era when life feels relentlessly digital and the future looks intimidating. Clothes that signal a connection to nature – even if you bought your rugged corduroys online and are wearing them on the tube and the connection is, therefore, entirely symbolic – feel grounding. “Touching grass” is a modish gen Z phrase for getting offline and back to nature: this goes with that. A Fair Isle jumper suggests crunchy leaves, a barn jacket has a whiff of woodsmoke, and the reassuring tread of hiking boots evokes a vigorous footpath yomp.The space the country-coded weekend wardrobe inhabits is where our tracksuits lived in the pandemic and just after. Sweatpants and a hoodie, once the badge of relaxed cool, is a look that has become trapped in its own cliches. A tracksuit looks a bit “airport fit” now. I’d rather look hedgerow-adjacent than Heathrow-adjacent.View image in fullscreen‘Dressing like you are on a cosy mini-break is to autumn what dressing for a festival field is to summer.’Photograph: Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images for Copenhagen StudiosBest of all, these clothes are just damn functional. The simple, boxy shape of a barn jacket works over everything, and they tend to have excellent pockets for your phone and your gloves, while a soft collar feels good next to your skin as well as providing a little frisson of visual interest. Cord or wool-mix trousers are substantial enough to absorb damp air so that you stay warm. Chunky jumpers are comforting, easy to layer, and a simple way to inject a little personality. There is a reassuring rigour to the whole ensemble. You look like someone with useful skills, who could build a fire or read an actual map should such a thing be necessary. It would be good to be that person, right? So dressing the part is a good place to start.Try to avoid tipping over into looking like an extra in a Guy Ritchie film, which is a pitfall for urbanites who embrace the country look. You know the vibe: tweed, flat caps, branded wellies, too-shiny waxed jackets. Don’t be too literal: you’re not on a shooting weekend, so top-to-toe brown and green is a hard no. Autumnal reds and oranges, pops of camel and cream, are a good thing. It is also good to include one item that doesn’t track, so it’s not too off-the-rack-looking. So instead of wearing a flannel check shirt with corduroys, wear the shirt with barrel-leg jeans, or the cords with a sweatshirt.Fashion is always part play-acting. It’s a good time of year to be outdoors, so why not look outdoorsy. The thing is, you don’t have to go to the actual countryside. It would be a shame to get your lovely new clothes muddy, babe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Writing a plant-based cookbook taught me new ways to save waste, and confirmed my belief that zero-waste cooking is whole food cooking. Aquafaba (the liquid from a tin of chickpeas or other beans), for example, is a powerful emulsifier that can replace eggs, especially when whisked with ground flaxseeds or chia. It’s a brilliant way of turning what we’d usually pour down the sink into cakes with remarkable lift and texture.Pear, hazelnut and chocolate torteWhen I was writing the dessert chapter of my cookbook, I wanted every recipe to offer new ways of making cakes more nourishing. Here, I use aquafaba with omega-rich flaxseed, and blitz hazelnuts into flour instead of using ground almonds (though I would encourage you to use ground almonds if they are what you have).Seasonality is core to how I cook, not least because I find it such a joyous and economical approach to home cooking that connects us to the rhythm of the seasons. With pears fresh, plentiful and easy to source locally right now, they’re perfect inspiration for this vegan chocolate torte that’s gooey, flavourful and not too sweet. Cook it a little under, so it has a brownie-like centre and, for best results, serve warm with your favourite yoghurt. You will need a 23cm stoneware flan dish or similar.ServesAbout 10250g shelled hazelnuts100g light-brown sugar, plus extra for dusting and finishing75g wholemeal flour(I used emmer wheat, but regular wholemeal or plain white will work fine, too)2 tbsp cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting2 tsp baking powder100ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for greasing100ml aquafaba50g ground flaxseeds, or chia seeds, or 2 tsp psyllium husk4 pears, cored and cut into thin slicesYoghurt(coconut, soya or dairy), to serve (optional)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and put a large baking tray inside to heat up. Tip the hazelnuts on to the hot tray, roast for eight minutes, then remove and leave to cool. Pulse-blend the cooled nuts to a powder, stopping the motor before the ground nuts turn oily, then tip into a large bowl and add the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, olive oil, aquafaba and flaxseeds, and beat to combine thoroughly.Grease a 23cm flan dish with a little olive oil, then spoon in a teaspoon each of flour and cocoa. Turn the dish a few times, so the insides are evenly coated, then knock out any excess flour and sugar. Fill the dish with the hazelnut mixture, then lay the pear slices on top. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the pudding has risen and is firm in the centre.Sprinkle the top of the finished tart with a little brown sugar, or make your own brown sugar icing sugar by blending it to a fine powder. Enjoy warm with your choice of yoghurt.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteCakeBakingFruitNuts and seedsChocolatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Don’t be daunted by social media images of perfect, artistic ones; a pie will taste just as good whether it’s rustically homespun or exactingly decorated and carved. Ultimately, what is more important is the integrity of the ingredients (both the casing and the filling). As pastry or potatoes are such a large part of the equation, invest in the best, and make sure puff pastry is all butter and filo is generously lubricated with melted butter. And, if you’re serving your pie with mash, you want it lump-free, properly seasoned and enriched with butter and cream.‘Flu-fighting’ filo chicken pie (pictured top)This is packed to the brim with ingredients to make you well: anti-inflammatory ginger, turmeric and nuts, warming spices and cranberries, which are a source of antioxidants and vitamin C.Prep15 minCook2 hr, plus coolingServes62tbsp ghee2 onions, peeled and finely sliced4 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 thumb-sized pieceginger, peeled and finely grated1 thumb-sized piecefresh turmeric, peeled and finely grated or 1 tsp ground turmeric1tsp ground coriander1tsp allspice1tsp cinnamonNutmeg8 bone-in chicken thighs, skinned400ml chicken stock, or chicken bone brothSea salt and black pepper100g walnuts or almonds, roughly chopped50g dried cranberriesZest and juice of1 lemon3 eggs, beaten1 small bunchcoriander, finely chopped1 small bunch tarragon, finely chopped75g butter½tsp ground turmeric6 filo pastry sheetsMelt the ghee in a casserole dish or large frying pan over a low heat, then fry the onions slowly for 10-15 minutes, until caramelised. Add the garlic, ginger and fresh turmeric, fry for two minutes, until fragrant, then add the ground spices and a good grating of nutmeg – if you are using ground turmeric, add it now.Add the chicken, stir to coat in the onions and spices for two minutes, then pour in the stock and season. Bring to a simmer, then cook, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Lift the chicken out of the pan and leave to cool.Bring the stock back to a boil, then reduce for eight minutes, until slightly thickened; leave to cool for 15 minutes. Stir in the nuts, cranberries, lemon juice and zest, followed by the eggs, to make a rich sauce.When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pull out and discard the bones from the thighs, shred the meat and stir it through the sauce. Stir in the coriander and tarragon and leave to cool completely (I often make the filling the day before).Once the filling is completely cool, melt the butter and turmeric in a pan and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Brush a 23cm springform cake tin with the melted butter, then brush one sheet of filo with melted butter, lay it butter side up over the tin and push it into the tin to line it, leaving an overhang. Repeat with four more filo sheets, buttering and layering them at different angles so the whole cake tin is well lined.Spoon the filling into the pastry lined tin, lay over the final sheet of buttered filo to cover the surface, then fold over the overhanging filo to enclose the filling. Brush with the remaining butter, then bake for 30 minutes, until golden and crisp. Remove and leave to stand and rest for 15 minutes, then remove the pie from its tin and serve.Coconut and curry leaf fish piesView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s coconut and curry leaf fish pie.A fish pie with a south Indian lilt that will transport you to sunnier climes even when skies are grey.Prep20 minCook1 hr 30 minServes6200g spinach2tbsp coconut oil1tsp brown mustard seeds1 star anise½tsp asafoetida(hing)15 fresh curry leaves½tsp cumin¼tsp ground cloves1 red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced into crescentsSea salt, to taste2cm pieceginger, peeled and cut into julienne strips1 fresh long red chillies, sliced seeds and all1tsp turmeric400ml coconut cream2tbsp tamarind paste1tbsp light brown sugarJuice of1 lemon1 handfulcoriander, finely chopped450g cod, haddock or other white fish fillets, skinned and pin-boned200g peeled raw prawns2 hard-boiled eggs, shelled and quarteredFor the topping40ml whole milk40ml double cream1garlic clove, peeled and bruised½tsp black peppercorns1 small onion, peeled and studded with 4 cloves1 bay leaf1tsp ground turmeric750gfloury potatoes, peeled and diced75g butter2 egg yolksFirst make the topping.

Meanwhile, steam the spinach for the filling in a colander above the pan of potatoes until wilted, leave to cool slightly, then squeeze out any excess moisture and chop roughly.Drain and mash the potatoes until smooth, then beat in the butter and egg yolks. Strain the infused milk and cream, discarding the solids, then slowly pour the milk mix into the mash and stir to combine thoroughly.For the filling, heat the coconut oil in a frying pan on a high heat. Scatter in the mustard seeds and star anise and, as soon as the mustard seeds pop, add the asafoetida and curry leaves, followed by the cumin seeds and cloves. Turn down the heat, add the onions and some sea salt, and saute until pale and translucent.Add the ginger, chillies and turmeric and fry briefly until fragrant. Add the coconut cream, tamarind and sugar, simmer for eight minutes, then take off the heat and finish with the lemon juice and coriander.Put the spinach, fish, prawns and boiled egg quarters in a pie dish and pour the coconut sauce all over them.

Lay the pastry over the top to cover, then press gently all around the edges to seal. Brush with egg wash then freeze for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180 C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Scatter the top of the pie with sesame seeds, fennel seeds and some flaky sea salt, then bake for 30 minutes, until golden and puffed. Serve with a light, leafy salad.Explore more on these topicsWinter food and drinkPieFoodAutumn food and drinkFishChickenCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

This will let you control your thermostat remotely, usually through a mobile app, meaning you can turn your heating off or down if you have had an unexpected change of plan. A smart thermostat effectively adds a timer to a boilerYou can then use the app to schedule heating and hot water.Smart thermostats vary and can offer different features, including multi-room control, hot water control, and “geofencing” to track when you leave and enter your home. They typically cost between £60 and £250, depending on the make and model.View image in fullscreenSwitching to a smart thermostatallows you to control your thermostat remotely, usually through a mobile app.Photograph: StefaNikolic/Getty ImagesSome can be fitted without help, such as the Bosch Room Thermostat II (£69,99on Amazon); others, such as the Hive Thermostat V4 (£155on B&Q) require professional fitting. This can normally be booked through the retailer, but may incur an additional cost.Some energy suppliers offer deals on smart thermostats made by companies they have partnerships with, such asOctopus Energy’s partnership with tado°, which gives customers up to 50% off tado° products. A Wireless Smart Thermostat X Starter Kit is £112, down from £159.99.Reduce temperaturesTurning down your thermostat from 22C to 21C can save a typical household £90 a year in Great Britain, according to theEnergy Saving Trust. For most people, a comfortable temperature falls somewhere between 18C and 21C.According toCitizens Advice, every degree you turn your thermostat down can save you about 10% on your energy bill, but it warns that if you are elderly or have a health condition you should not set it below 21C.View image in fullscreenFor most people, a comfortable temperature in the home is between 18C and 21C.Photograph: Ridofranz/Getty ImagesIt also advises that having the heating on all the time at a low temperature will cost more than having it on at a slightly higher temperature but for a shorter interval.Setting the heating to go off 30 minutes before you leave the house or go to sleep will also reduce your bill.Lower the flowIf you have a combi boiler, you can lower its flow temperature – that is, the temperature of the water flowing out and to the radiators.If you have a system boiler or a hot water cylinder,EDF Energy advisesyou don’t do this on your own but get advice from an engineer.On many boilers the flow temperature is set too high by default, at about 75-80C. Reducing it to about 60C can cut your gas bill without making much difference to how warm you feel.“This is especially effective in homes with well-sized radiators and good insulation … and doesn’t noticeably affect comfort,” Pennells says.The charity Nesta has an interactive onlinetoolthat gives detailed instructions on how to change the setting on your boiler. The charity recommends you take a picture of the boiler controls and settings before proceeding so that you have a record of your initial settings.Turn downradiatorsIf you have thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs), the dial that controls how much hot water enters the radiator it is attached to, you will be able to adjust the temperature separately in each room. TRVs usually have a scale from 0 to 6, where 0 is off and 6 is fully open.We’ve found that people have changed their behaviours and started to warm the person rather than the houseSophie Burr of National Energy ActionTheEnergySaving Trust recommends putting it on the lowest setting that keeps the room at a comfortable temperature, which could be 3 or 4 for rooms you use the most and 2 or 3 for others. It says adding TRVs to a system that already has a programmer and thermostat can save a household £35 a year.While it may be tempting to turn off your heating in the name of saving cash, experts say this can lead to mould and damp – and this could be more costly and dangerous to deal with in the long term.“During the energy crisis, we’ve found that people have changed their behaviours and started to warm the person rather than the house,” says Sophie Burr, the project development coordinator atNational Energy Action. “Our research has shown that it is more cost-effective to heat the whole space while turning the radiators down to number 2 in rooms you are not using, allowing some heat in those rooms and preventing the growth of mould spores, which can have serious health impacts such as worsening respiratory conditions.”GetreflectorsTheBritish Gas Energy Trustadvises that you use foil behind radiators to reflect heat back into the room. Radiator reflectors allow that heat to be dispersed into the room rather than just get absorbed by an external wall, as 35% of the heat in a room is lost through the walls. Reflectors are particularly beneficial on uninsulated external walls.Although an initial additional cost, they are fairly cheap to buy, easy to install and should last. They can be bought in rolls, and then cut to fit any radiator. They are easy to apply using a provided adhesive or double-sided tape – just make sure the radiators are off and cool first. Screwfix sells a 1.88 sq metre roll for£7.51, B&Q has a 5 sq metre roll for£14.97and Amazon sells a 15 sq metre one for£27.99.Bleed your radiators every few months so they run efficiently. To do this, make sure your radiators are off and cool. Insert a key (£3.50for a two-pack from B&Q) or a flat-head screwdriver into the bleed valve on the radiator, usually at the top corner, and turn it anti-clockwise. You should hear a hissing sound as the air escapes but wait for the hissing to stop and a steady stream of water to appear (which you can catch with a cloth) before turning the valve clockwise to close it again.View image in fullscreenA boiler service will improve its efficiency.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAAvoid covering your radiators with furniture or curtains – especially under windows. This will help the heat spread wider.Keep your boiler servicedA boiler service will improve its efficiency and extend its lifespan by catching and fixing minor problems. Octopus Energy says an unserviced boiler can use up to 10% more energy than one that is annually checked out. “If a boiler is not serviced regularly, it can have a significant impact on fuel efficiency and health,” Burr says.According to Which?, a standard boiler service costs between £70 and £110.Some energy companies offer a service as part of their annual cover plans – British Gas, for example, has one in itsHomeCarepolicy, which starts at £19 a month. However, a boiler care plan isn’t for everyone. Which? says that while a cover plan can give peace of mind, sometimes the monthly payments add up to more than paying for an annual service and repairs when needed. It recommends weighing up if you have enough savings to pay for an annual service outright every time.If you live in rented housing, it is your landlord’s responsibility to ensure that the boiler is serviced and certified yearly. “Annual boiler servicing for all homes in the rental sector is a requirement by law,” Burr says. “For properties with gas boilers, this must be carried out by a Gas Safe engineer, and for oil boilers, by an Oftec-certified engineer. Annual boiler servicing will ensure that the appliance is working efficiently and is not leaking carbon monoxide into your home.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsMoney hacksSaving moneyConsumer affairsHousehold billsEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This limestone valley on the border between Derbyshire and Staffordshire is a popular spot for day trips and hiking. Thankfully, it’s quiet on this brisk November morning, and I’m able to soak in the scene: the River Dove flowing fast, the autumn trees turning russet and gold, the green fold of hills rising around me.On days like this, it’s clear why Dovedale has inspired creatives. One of those was the 18th-century artist Joseph Wright of Derby, whose work is being celebratedin a new exhibitionat the National Gallery.Landscapes such as Dovedale were painted by Wright at a time when “people started travelling to places that in those days were hard to get to – places like the Peak District”, says Tony Butler, executive director of Derby Museums Trust. We meet atDerby Museum and Art Gallery, which houses the world’s largest collection of Wright’s paintings. Places such as Dovedale were seen as wild, Butler explains, but there was an increasing appreciation of landscapes like this, with a gradual opening up of the country, and the idea of nature evoking the sublime.View image in fullscreenWright’s Dovedale By Moonlight.Photograph: AlamyThe gallery showcases Wright’s prolific and varied work. In the place of paintings that have gone to the National Gallery exhibition are works from other artists, including paintings inspired by Wright’s use of light and dark by Nottingham-basedJoseph Norris.Much of Wright’s work reflects the industry and invention of the Enlightenment, a time of faith in reason and scientific discovery. As a hub of industrial growth, Derby was one of the Midlands towns at the centre of the movement, and Wright spent time with members of the Lunar Society, the Midlands-based group of Enlightenment thinkers. “The Enlightenment was a way of life in Derby, and he was a documenter of that,” says Butler. “He’s really reflecting the spirit of the age.”Much of Wright’s work reflects the industry and invention of the Enlightenment, a time of faith in reason and scientific discoveryOne of Wright’s most famous works, A Philosopher Giving That Lecture on the Orrery (in Which a Lamp Is Put in Place of the Sun), shows a philosopher lecturing on the solar system at a time when talks like this were held in Derby’s town hall. He painted portraits of figures reflecting the area’s role in industry, including Sir Richard Arkwright, the industrialist who built his cotton mill in nearby Cromford and was one of Wright’s patrons.I have lunch atThe Engine Room, a recently opened restaurant that draws on another element of Derby’s industrial heritage, as a centre for railway manufacturing, with railway art decorating the walls. Afterwards, I wander with Alex Rock from Derby Museums along the River Derwent as Canada geese bob by and the breeze throws leaves on the water. It’s a short walk to theMuseum of Making, which stands on the site ofDerby Silk Mill, often regarded as the world’s first modern factory, near where Wright grew up.View image in fullscreenThe Museum of Making.Photograph: Kate LoweThe museum explores 300 years of Derby’s history of making, from the Enlightenment era that inspired Wright through to the city’s contemporary creativity. A Toyota car hangs high in the atrium as a sign of Derbyshire’s modern manufacturing. “In Stoke, we lift up crockery to see where it’s made,” I say, a nod to my own home town’s industry. “I do the same,” Rock says, and we lift our coffee mugs to see them stamped as Denby, the Derbyshire-based pottery company. Afterwards, I join the crowd gathered to watch the trains running on the museum’s impressive model railway.I look around the Assemblage room, curated so items are displayed by their principal material, such as wood or metal. There are racks of everything from Derby-made train parts to ceramics showcasing the museum’s collection.

They explain the art of coaxing people out of the most pernicious groups in the worldNic M NevesWed 19 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 10.53 ESTShareWhen the phone rings at Patrick Ryan and Joseph Kelly’s home inPhiladelphia, chances are the caller is desperate. One couple rang because their son was about to abandon his medical practice to follow a new-age guru in Spain. Another call came from a husband whose wife was emptying their life savings for a self-proclaimed prophet in Australia. Yet another family phoned about their niece, who was in a relationship with a man stealing from her, maybe drugging her, probably sexually assaulting her.These families had tried everything else. When nothing worked, they heard there were two men in Philadelphia who might still be able to bring their loved one home.What Ryan and Kelly do is unusual: they help people leave cults. Over the past 40 years, they have handled hundreds of cases – some simple and local, others stretching across borders and decades. They have been hired by families of both modest and considerable means. They say they have even been hired by government agencies, and that some cults they have investigated have left them genuinely afraid for their lives.The goal is to untangle the family dynamics that might have made someone vulnerable to a cult in the first placeAlthough many people are involved in cultic studies and education, fewer than 10 people in the US do anything like what Ryan and Kelly do. And among those, only Kelly and Ryan practice their strange and unique method: embedding themselves in families’ lives, pulling on threads like marionettists, sometimes for years.Their method goes something like this. A family reaches out about their daughter, husband, nephew or grandchild. Ryan and Kelly conduct an assessment that can take anywhere from a day to a week (they would not say exactly). They charge $2,500 for the assessment, then $250 an hour after that, interviewing the family until they understand the dynamics well enough to devise a strategy. Then, over months or sometimes years, they work to create the conditions in which a person might begin to question the beliefs their life has been built on.Normally, Kelly and Ryan work by strengthening the existing relationships in a person’s life. It can be a long game. They will educate the family about the cultic group, and give advice about what to say (or not to say). They will bring in experts: psychiatrists, lawyers, priests that can provide perspective and counsel. The goal is to untangle the family dynamics that might have made someone vulnerable to a cult in the first place.Very occasionally, they meet face to face with the person involved in a cult. But these encounters look nothing like a drug intervention, with friends gathered in a circle and the reason for the meeting laid bare. Instead, Ryan and Kelly will act covertly. In one case, a son (the cult member) came home for a few days. His parents told him that Ryan and Kelly were friends of theirs, “family mediators” who happened to be “in town for a few days, to meet with some colleagues” – both technically true. The pair made sure to “forget” a book at the family home, and return the next day to collect it, as they began to build rapport.I met Kelly and Ryanat their place in south Philadelphia, a three-story house they share with a big dog named Kenny and a bright green parrot named Greta.Greta was a consolation prize Ryan bought for himself after a failed intervention, the second he ever attempted. It was the 1980s andhis client, a woman who had recently finished her master’s at a prestigious university, had been drawn into a scam job. It was essentially a pyramid scheme built around a health regimen. Before you could sell it, you had to try it, so you knew what you were selling.The regimen? Multiple enemas a day. “It escalated to 40 to 60 enemas a day,” Ryan said. “And when you do that many enemas, it upsets the electrolyte balance in your body and you begin hallucinating.”He spent three days trying to reason with her, but she would not budge. Ryan asked himself: what value do I have if I can’t even talk someone out of anenemacult? Frustrated, he went for a walk, saw a bird in a pet shop window who said: “Hello, hello.” He put her in his coat, fashioned a small cage, took her on an airplane and brought her home.View image in fullscreenJoseph Kelly with their pet parrot, Greta. She was a consolation prize Ryan bought for himself after a failed intervention.Photograph: Nic NevesTheir approach has changed a lot since those early interventions.First, they are careful with language. They don’t love the word cult. They say it’s a cudgel: too blunt an instrument to get at the heart of the problem. Also, even if a client leaves a group and returns home, Ryan and Kelly wouldn’t say they “got them out”. They describe themselves as mediators who build bridges through which families can reach their loved ones. Sometimes, the person crosses that bridge. Sometimes, the outcome is more complicated.Second, they have worked hard to distance themselves from “deprogramming” – the practice most people associate with cult interventions. In the 1970s and 80s, deprogramming could involve kidnappings, involuntary confinement and even violence. In one case Kelly mentioned, a cult member was held at gunpoint. It was controversial, and its effectiveness was questionable. “That,” Ryan said more than once, “is not what we do.”Nowadays, they focus more on helping someone reach their own informed conclusion about the group they are part of, trying to soften the obstacles that might cloud their judgment.For instance: one of the tricky parts, they explained, is communicating with a person who has been given tools to block out other people’s perspectives. This set of tools or ideas is what Ryan and Kelly call a group’s “gatekeeper”.Ryan gave me an example. One client came from an extremely rigid, orthodox Catholic family. The family had a plan for life: retire early, save well, put the kids through college. But against these goals, the wife had joined an eastern religious group and was donating thousands of dollars to it. She had quit her job, and the marriage was collapsing.The gatekeeper, Ryan and Kelly decided, was that the woman perceived her spouse “as dogmatic, fundamentalist – but not spiritual”. They needed to change her mind about her husband.So Ryan called an old friend of Kelly’s, a Jesuit priest who lived in a parish near the family’s home. Ryan asked the priest to meet the husband. The two men became friends and agreed to meet regularly – all according to Ryan and Kelly’s plan. Every so often, the husband would text his wife: “I’m coming home late tonight, meeting my priest friend.”“She’s like, ‘What priest friend?’” Ryan said.After a few months, the wife became curious enough to want to meet her husband’s new friend. The priest, who was genuinely thrilled, nearly veered off plan by offering to speak with her directly. He believed she was ready to hear his views on spirituality. But Ryan stopped him: “I told him, look, they hired us to be strategists. I have a strategy for this.”Ryan mapped out the parish and planned a tour. He made sure the route passed through the library specifically, the section with many eastern religious books. “You’re gonna go through there,” Ryan told the priest.On a Friday, the husband brought his wife along to visit. The priest greeted them warmly and showed her the grounds. They walked through the library. She saw the books.Soon, the priest was coming over for barbecues. They all became friends. And she began openly talking with her husband about the group she was involved in: the good and the bad. They had passed the group’s gatekeeper. But the work was not finished.All groups have a rhythm, like a pulse across the calendar year. We have holidays, and we have tax season. There are highs and lows. If you want to talk to someone about how dangerous their group is, you probably do not want to do it right after they have taken ayahuasca or gone on retreat. But the lows come just as reliably.When the wife finally started to complain about the group, the husband called Ryan: “She’s going to leave!” But Ryan told him firmly: “No, she’s not. Don’t push it.”By the third cycle, the third low point, when she was sleep deprived, working long hours and truly miserable, Ryan gave the husband a single line. “Just say to her this: ‘You gave it a good shot.’ And nothing more.”“She said: ‘Yeah, I have. Will you help me get my stuff?’ And he said: ‘OK.’”The whole time, the wife knew her husband had consulted Ryan and Kelly, though she did not know they had orchestrated his friendship with the priest. During the five years they worked on the case, she assumed they were anti-religious bad actors. A few months after she left the group, she met Ryan and Kelly for the first time.In Ryan’s telling, she loved chatting with Kelly and himself because they so clearly understood what she appreciated about the group. But they also saw that she was being made to sleep only a few hours a night, drink toilet water, and work hundreds of hours recruiting members for a guru accused of sexual misconduct and labor law violations.Ryan and Kelly started doing this workbecause when they were younger, they themselves had been in what would be described as cults. They wereTranscendental Meditation (TM)instructors in the 70s and 80s. After about a decade with TM, they felt disturbed by their relationship to the organization, and they sued – Kelly in 1986, and Ryan in 1989 – for negligence and fraud. Kelly joined a suit as a Doe along with six others, claiming the organization had “fraudulently promised that the practice … would confer certain personal and societal benefits”, which never materialized. Ryan says that during the course of his TM training he was constantly surveilled and led to believe that he would be able to levitate and save humanity.You can’t just interfere with someone’s life because you don’t like what they’re doingPatrick RyanThe case Kelly joined, which dragged on for several years, included expert testimony from clinical psychologistMargaret Singer, a brainwashing specialist who had previously assessed Charles Manson. Neither case won, but their lawsuits eventually settled, and through the course of the litigation, Ryan and Kelly left the organization. (TM did not respond to a request for comment; however, Bob Roth, CEO of the TM-associated David Lynch Foundation, did let me know the American Heart Association recently named Transcendental Meditation an official stress reducer for treating high blood pressure.)Kelly joined another group after leaving TM. He followed his new guru for five more years. Meanwhile, Ryan told me he gotbusy investigating and trying to expose cults, including the group Kelly had joined. In those early days, Ryan considered himself a sort of “cult fighter”, with a much more black and white view of what cults were and what it meant to be a part of one. They finally started working together when Kelly had a falling out with his second group, whose guru was eventually convicted for child sexual abuse.View image in fullscreenRyan holds William S Kroger’s 1976 book called Hypnosis and Behavior Modification: Imagery Conditioning.Photograph: Nic NevesThey have had a close relationship ever since, working and living together with their dog and bird in a big house they told me was once used as a base of operations by the Philly mafia, which seems oddly fitting. They mostly prefer to keep details about their personal lives off-record. Often, the families they work with need to hear very hard things, and being a sort of blank slate makes it easier for them to be whoever their clients need them to be.Throughout reporting this piece, privacy was an issue. Ryan and Kelly told me many more details about their cases off the record. All these cases are anonymized, with some crucial details changed, to protect the identities of their clients and their families. Furthermore, Kelly and Ryan urge their clients not to speak with the media. The firmest “no” I ever got was when I asked Ryan if I could speak to a former client. The second was when I asked if they could show me emails or letters to prove they had worked with government agencies. This made it difficult to verify all the details of their stories, though I found the situations they described were consistent with other accounts of ex-members from cults they say their clients were a part of. When cases did make it to court, the details Ryan and Kelly provided me matched the legal testimony I found.But without being able to speak to their former clients, some of the stories told here remain just that: stories in the telling of Ryan and Kelly. I was, however, able to speak with many of their collaborators, who confirmed that they had seen Ryan and Kelly’s method work close up. One of the people I spoke with, Dr Janja Lalich, is a professor emerita of sociology at California University State, Chico and author of multiple books on cults including Bounded Choice: True Believers and Charismatic Cults. Lalich lectures and consults on cultic studies, and regularly testifies as a cult expert in court cases internationally. She started studying them because she, too, joined and left a cult when she was younger. It was a radical Marxist-Leninist cult that eventually “imploded”; a process she details in her book. The members collectively overthrew the leadership and all left at the same time, she explained, “which was great”.Lalich worked on a couple of cases with Kelly and Ryan in the 90s, when they were starting out. She did not like the work. She found it stressful and difficult, and felt some reservations about the way the process interfered with people’s lives. But the three of them have remained close over the years and still collaborate in the broader cult-awareness space, attending conferences and teaching workshops. She confirmed for me a lot of the claims Kelly and Ryan made about the cults they have dealt with, including the idea that most people who join cultic groups leave on their own.You have to find 50 things [about the cult] that you could agree with the person onPatrick RyanRyan concedes that their work can look a lot like meddling in someone’s life. But he is also firm in that they are not “hired hitmen”. They work with psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers to provide oversight, several of whom I spoke with for this piece. “You can’t just interfere with someone’s life because you don’t like what they’re doing,” Ryan told me. When Kelly and Ryan take on a case, it’s because there is some dynamic in the family system that they think their expertise can help untangle. In every case, the group in question is offering something to the person involved that the family might not be able to understand or appreciate. But to Ryan and Kelly, this appreciation is exactly the point.One of their cases in the 90sinvolved a cult leader who was systematically sexually assaulting the group’s members. “I can’t get into all the details,” Ryan said. “He was horrible, a horrible man.” Ryan and Kelly had been flying regularly to Australia to work on the case. The client’s niece, a girl in the group, was beginning to fall out with the cult. The leader had been arrested and was on trial for crimes related to the cult’s activities.In their process, Ryan and Kelly require what they call 50 things: “You have to find 50 things that you could agree with the person on.” Ryan gestured to a painting on the wall in their living room. It was a strange, surrealist-looking canvas with a big Tesla coil in the center and lightning shooting out at some pigeons. Ryan said, “If you look at this piece of art and say, ‘That’s really ugly,’ then we’re going to start off … not on the right page, right?”But if I could appreciate what he found appealing, then, he said: “I think you have the right to criticize it.” The number may seem arbitrary, but their goal is to find 50 things a family can appreciate about a cult before discussing what they do not agree with.I put this number to Lalich and she said the notion of having to find 50 things seemed a bit extreme. “ I certainly could never find 50 things about my cult that I thought were good.” The spirit of it seemed right to her though, at least: that the family needs to tone down their rhetoric, or they will just push the cult-involved member away.View image in fullscreenRyan sits in front of a painting of a Tesla coil and pigeons in his living room.Photograph: Nic NevesIn Kelly and Ryan’s case, the girl’s uncle, their client, had a very difficult time finding anything positive about the group or the leader who had allegedly raped his niece. When the trial came, the uncle wanted to testify against the leader, and Ryan and Kelly told him not to. “We said, if you testify, your niece … will cut you off.”The uncle went to court anyway. Just as Ryan had predicted, the niece fell off the map entirely. She was scared they would kidnap her – try to deprogram or threaten her. Ryan and Kelly pulled some strings to find out that she had done some traveling, but otherwise, for “20 years”, Ryan said, “they didn’t know if she was alive or dead.”On Ryan and Kelly’s counsel, the family made a social media account in the 2010s to post information about the family: weddings, births, etc. After nearly 30 years, the girl, now in middle age, finally reached out. The family had posted about how the grandfather was getting old, and she called to say she wanted to see him before he died.Much has been writtenabout the psychology of cults, the archetypes of cult leaders and the way they can createtragic, abusive conditions for their members. In just the past few years there have been Christian sects convicted ofmanslaughter of children, doomsday groupskilling police officers, and starvation cults withbodies piled in mass graves. While Lalich says that to her, it is pretty clear what is or is not a cult, she also concedes that groups exist on a broad continuum ranging from extremely dangerous to “more or less” benign. She does not think that there is such a thing as a “harmless” cult – since all these groups exert some measure of coercion and manipulation. But for Ryan and Kelly, defining precisely what is or is not a cult is actually counterproductive, since so much of what they do is appeal to the person inside the cult who they are trying to reason with.There is a hole a group fills: alienation from community, family, sexualitySo, rather than labeling a group as a cult, Ryan and Kelly focus on “cultic relationships” that exist between a member and an organization. “Ten million people have learned Transcendental Meditation,” Ryan clarified. “Ten million people are not in a cult.” His voice rose and he shrugged. “I mean, they’ve been lied to. As a teacher, we lied to them. We told them things that were just absolutely not true.”“Bonkers,” Kelly added from his rocking chair.“Bonkers,” Ryan confirmed.Over the course of their careers Ryan and Kelly have found that in order to mediate people’s relationships with these groups, they have to gain a better understanding of how they are drawn in to begin with. How is it that a cult leader can make a person seriously believe that they can levitate, or that drinking toilet water is acceptable? They have to understand how exactly a group manages to shake people’s fundamental assumptions about reality.For example, Kelly described a case in which a leader would command people to have sex with one another: “‘You, woman, sleep with that woman.’ ‘You, sleep with that man.’” Even if participants were straight, the leader would ask them: “What is your limitation?” This is an archetype of cult leader that Kelly calls a “crazy adept”: “the disruptor, who comes in and destroys the norms in order to build up a better, purer reality.”One of their close collaborators, Ashlen Hilliard, told me about a harrowing case whose details she preferred to keep tightly under wraps. She said they were referred to the case by a US government agency investigating the group, and it had proved extremely dangerous. If they were publicly known to be helping members leave, the group could retaliate. “I care about this,” Ryan said of this interview, “but I care more about not dying.”View image in fullscreenRyan: ‘The only way [some questions] can be answered, in my mind, is by a feeling. And, that feeling is so easily manipulated.’Photograph: Nic NevesHilliard explained that in this group, words like “victim” were twisted out of shape. “Instead of assigning a negative meaning to a word like ‘victim’, they say: this is a word that indicates a badge of honor.” Then, when a member was subject to sexual violence or other abuse by the group, being a “victim” was reframed as something positive. Often, people in these groups have experienced past trauma, and this destabilization of the concept of victimhood can feel freeing – at least initially.What Kelly and Ryan mean when they say these groups are “offering something” to people, it is exactly that. There is a hole a group fills: alienation from community, family, sexuality; pressure to follow a certain life plan, addiction, unrealized spirituality, economic catastrophe – all reasons to join a group. We all have deep pains that make us hope that maybe, if the world were different, we wouldn’t feel the way we do.Part of why their work is so necessarily confidential is that there is always the possibility a person will go back to their group. These are people trying to make sense of a reality whose fundamental rules have been turned on its head. When is anyone ever “done” making sense of things, anyway?Kelly still thinks about a moment with the guru he followed after leaving Transcendental Meditation, back in 1985. He had been meditating at the feet of the guru, Prakashanand Saraswati (who they called Swami-ji, or “guru”), for several days. When he looked up, he saw the Swami surrounded by “a golden light.” He was not seeing an illusion. It was a real experience, built on ideas and promises laid out by the guru: a supreme, divine, transcendent love. “The wave merging into the ocean,” Kelly said.After that experience, Kelly felt Swami-ji could do no wrong. For the next three years, even when he saw the women visiting Swami-ji’s bedroom, the demands for thousands of dollars, the outbursts of rage; it all felt insignificant, or easily dismissed.For that reason, Kelly and Ryan are not looking to convince people of any particular version of reality or truth. They do not seem to be interested in truth at all, really. When you use your experience to test whether or not something is true (the holiness of a guru, the righteousness of a cause) then, Ryan told me: “The person who gives you that experience will own you.” Their work is to usher people into a state of skepticism about the conclusion they have drawn from their experiences; beginning to open them up to the idea that individual experience is not the same as truth or reality.Inside the LA ‘psychic reset’ bootcamp that promises happiness – at a priceRead moreThis lighter touch approach is controversial. While interviewing people in the broader cult-awareness network, I found that Ryan and Kelly had drawn some criticism for affiliating with a certain group of academics that some people in their sphere disparage as “cult apologists”. This group belongs to a branch of cultic study that, like Ryan and Kelly, avoid the term “cult”, preferring the term “New Religious Movement”. Kelly and Ryan have consulted these academics over the years and have kept some as trusted contacts. Lalich and others say these apologists undermine survivors’ efforts to hold cults accountable for their abuses, by brushing over the harms such as child neglect and sexual abuse committed by groups like the Children of God (The Family International) or the Unification Church, even testifying in court on a cult’s behalf. It’s a bitter, complicated split in the field of cultic study, but these academics say, among other things, that they are speaking out for freedom of religion. When Ryan and Kelly mentioned these apologists, they said they understood Lalich’s criticism, but that there was a way in which they could see things “through their lens”.Ryan and Kelly are not cult apologists, but in order to do their work they have had to keep an open mind. They neither fully endorse cults’ rights to exist, nor consider groups as bad per se. They arrive from as ideologically empty a place as they can, a skeptical place that is neither here, nor there. Doing work like this, the big question of epistemology, of what we can know and what to believe, become everyday practical quandaries.“I just know what is not real,” Ryan told me once. Take even the broadest existential question: what are we doing here?“The only way that can be answered, in my mind, is by a feeling,” he said. “And, that feeling is so easily manipulated.”You have to be a certain kind of person to do this work. Though Lalich does not do interventions any more, she is glad there are people who do it in the “legitimate way”. When I asked her who she thought did it in the “legitimate way”, she only named four people. Of them, only three, including Ryan and Kelly, were still actively taking cases.Explore more on these topicsPsychologyReligionPhiladelphiaPennsylvaniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Am I a super-recognizer?I once even thought I had seen my late grandmother. Can science explain my overfamiliarity with strange faces?Carina StorrsWed 19 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareWhen I was in my mid-20s, I spotted my grandma through the window of a coffee shop. I was dumbstruck – she had passed away the year before. I stared for a moment, then reminded myself it couldn’t be her.I’d had similar experiences all my life. Every now and then, I “recognized” someone I didn’t know. Sometimes I could quickly pinpoint who the stranger reminded me of – like my grandma. Other times, a face simply had a vague familiarity I couldn’t place.Recently, I started wondering if other people have these odd encounters. When I asked my friends, one said she frequently sees people in random places who look familiar. Others sometimes mistake a stranger or celebrity for someone they know in real life. But some reported nothing of the kind – they could easily identify people they’d met and people they hadn’t.I was intrigued by this range of experiences. Was it just yearning that made me see my grandma that day – or some kind of mental glitch? Onestudyfound we spend about 14 minutes of every hour looking at faces – do we just make mistakes sometimes? I was beginning to realize that we can all see the same face but not see the same thing.Researchers have created many tests to measure the ability to remember faces. There is a wide range: at one end are super-recognizers, who remember faces they have seen only briefly or a long time ago; at the other are people with face blindness, or prosopagnosia, who often struggle to recognize family, close friends and even themselves.Some tests also capture how good someone is at telling if they have not seen a face before. This is where I suspect I fall short. But researchers “just haven’t dug into this” as much as they’ve looked at the ability to remember a face, said Joseph DeGutis, a cognitive neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School. It does seem that the two skills use different brain processes, DeGutis noted; for instance, there is evidence that super-recognizers and prosopagnosics do about as well as each other at discerning new faces, despite their wildly different abilities to remember old faces.In a reading rut? How to get back into reading for funRead moreI was curious whether these tests would shed some light on why strangers look familiar. Was I someone who never forgets a face? I often remember people more than they remember me, and feel disappointed – a sentiment that researchers say is common for super-recognizers. But maybe I over-recognize faces – to the extent that even some new faces look familiar.DeGutis sent me several facial recognition tests. I waded through, feeling stumped at times. In one, called theCambridge Face Memory Test, I had to look at black-and-white photos of a face from three angles, then find it in lineups. During another test that instructed me to pick out celebrities from a mix of photos, many of the faces felt at least familiar, but I couldn’t quite place them – reminiscent of my real-life experience.I felt less than confident about my performance. But DeGutis analyzed my results, and I had correctly identified 96% of the celebrity faces. He concluded that I was a “borderline super-recognizer”.I also excelled in the old/new faces task, which DeGutis said was particularly good for assessing someone’s memory for faces. The test-taker looks at a series of 60 black-and-white photos, each of a different face. Then they review a string of 120 similar photos – the original series plus 60 new faces – and indicate which were in the first set. The super-recognizer cutoff is roughly 80%; I remembered 78% of the faces I’d seen. On the other end of the spectrum, people with prosopagnosia correctly guess an average of 57%.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’I was pleased with my score, but also surprised. I remembered many of the old faces, but rarely mistook a new face for one that I’d seen before. My score on this measure, called the false alarm rate, was 18%. Normal recognizers, super-recognizers and prosopagnosics all have a false alarm rate of about 30% on average. So why was I mistaking a stranger’s face for my grandmother’s?DeGutis thought it was likely that I possessed some super-recognizer capacities. Everyone has a catalogue of the faces we know in our memory, but super-recognizers – and probably borderline straddlers like me – have a relatively large and high-resolution catalogue. We’re also likely to individuate faces – that is, assign traits to each face, such as friendliness or rudeness.Studiessuggest that the latter helps people to learn and commit faces to long-term memory. While individuating may help me remember people, it may also trick me into seeing my grandmother in a woman who has a similar air.In addition, DeGutis thought I might be “an active face perceiver”, meaning I pay a lot of attention to faces. Others may have more false alarm moments, thinking they recognize someone they don’t know. But because I tend to look closely at faces, I am prone to notice the stranger who resembles my grandmother. Indeed, one friend who said she doesn’t make facial recognition mistakes admitted she doesn’t really look at the people around her.These tests helped me understand where I sat on the spectrum. But I wanted to understand more about what is happening in the brain when we “recognize” strangers. Researching further, I read about a syndrome called hyperfamiliarity for faces (HFF), in which unfamiliar faces appear familiar. On its face, this sounded like it could apply to me. But the handful of reported cases all occurred after a medical episode such as a seizure or stroke, unlike the quirk that I’ve been noticing my whole adult life.Brad Duchaine, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth College, runs a research site calledfaceblind.org, along with DeGutis and other colleagues. Through the site, he has heard from about 24,000 prosopagnosics, as well as people with all kinds of facial recognition difficulties, includingvisual distortions, like when faces appear to be melting. Duchaine and his lab study many of these people, using tools like the old/new faces task and the Cambridge Face Memory Test, which he helped develop.The magic touch: how healthy are massages actually?Read moreHe has heard from only a few people with possible HFF in the website’s 25-year history.“The prevalence is quite low,” Duchaine said of HFF. However, he theorized that there may be a spectrum, with some people who think every face is familiar, and others, like me, who only experience it a few times a month.Jenny, a 53-year-old zookeeper in northern England, developed HFF in 2018. (She withheld her last name to protect her identity.) A couple of migraines struck her as unusual – typically, she felt pain on the right side of her head, but with these it was on the left. Not long after, Jenny and her family visited a seaside town. She had only been there a handful of times before, but every single one of the people they passed on a tram ride looked familiar. Even once back home, she was convinced she knew everyone who walked by. She even followed some to try to figure out who they were.“Many times I would walk up to someone and smile, and they just walked past me,” said Jenny. “Obviously it was a massive change.”Jenny contacted faceblind.org and started talking with a researcher in Duchaine’s lab. There is no way to ease her condition, but they have helped her make sense of it. Jenny underwent a battery of face tests like I did. Not surprisingly, she had a high false alarm rate on the old/new faces test.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Subjects watched clips from Game of Thrones while undergoing FMRI scans. Some had previously seen the show, and others hadn’t. Participants who had seen it had more activity in the medial temporal lobe, a region deep in the brain that encompasses the hippocampus and is important for memory.A 2024studysuggested this region includes areas involved in recognizing familiar faces and may be where face catalogues are stored. The thinking goes that this region processes faces after the visual regions in the back of the brain study facial features such as eyes and lips and put them together into a whole-face composite.Want long, luscious hair? Experts offer their hair growth tipsRead moreJenny joined the Game of Thrones study. Although she had never seen the show, her scanslookedas if she had, lighting up in areas in the medial temporal lobe. The actors evoked similar feelings to the strangers on the street: “It was like I had memories with them, which I was looking at through a frosted window so … I couldn’t quite see what the memories were.” Similarly, when we talked over Zoom, Jenny acknowledged that we hadn’t met before but said she couldn’t shake the feeling that we had traveled together and knew each other’s families.I don’t feel overwhelmed by my false alarm encounters, but Jenny was so distraught by them that she dreaded leaving her house for a couple of years. “My brain’s firing off all these connections and memories that aren’t real, and it’s quite exhausting, actually, because there’s 100 people around you,” she said.That feeling has eased now that Jenny lives in a less populous area. She has also developed coping strategies, such as avoiding eye contact and asking friends to send her a photo of what they’re wearing so she can find them in a crowd.Our experiences have been different, but I relate to Jenny. Many times, I have been embarrassed after smiling at someone who was probably a stranger; I now act more reserved. And despite the discomfort, we both agree that it can be comforting to see a familiar face, even if it is only a mirage.Facial recognition abilities that are a little better or worse than average may result in embarrassing, funny or stressful moments. But for those with neurological conditions such as prosopagnosia and the facial distortions Duchaine described, the experiences are regular, often highly frustrating – and even scary.About 2% of the population has prosopagnosia, and there’s a clear link between the condition and social anxiety, said Anna Bobak, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Stirling in Scotland.They feel “anxiety or fear about negative evaluations from others” who may think they’re being rude or aloof for not recognizing people they know, Bobak said. In a recentsurveythat Bobak and her colleagues conducted, people with face blindness described detailed methods for recall, such as memorizing a person’s specific piece of jewellery. This survey uncovered that “one of [their] main wishes is really raising awareness … making reasonable adjustments just like for conditions such as autism and ADHD”, said Bobak.Facial recognition remains poorly understood because the roles that vision, memory and emotion play in it are still fuzzy. Super-recognizers and prosopagnosics have been studied for decades, yet researchers have only a vague idea that the former group may have more brain activity in the visual regions that process faces, whereas the latter appears to have less, Duchaine says.The Game of Thrones research, and advances in FMRI technique, are highlighting the crucial roles emotion and memory play in facial recognition processes, as well as how the brain regions related to these functions connect with visual regions. Duchaine says he’s planning new studies with super-recognizers and prosopagnosics to explore whether emotion and memory regions also contribute to their differences in facial recognition ability.It would be fascinating to learn more about how false alarm moments are related to enhanced activity in these regions. Hearing about the Game of Thrones experiment, I wondered if my brain would react like Jenny’s, misfiring even though I too hadn’t seen the show. And would this suggest that my experiences arise because of a tendency to make emotional connections with strangers?DeGutis had speculated that I might be particularly attuned to facial emotions. Reflecting on this, I can occasionally figure out that I mistook a stranger for someone I know because they had a similar “vibe”, like snark or eagerness. Once, an Amtrak agent looked so much like my favorite bartender that I expected him to hand me a cocktail. The more I thought about it, they seemed to share a cool nonchalance in addition to their physical similarities.I wouldn’t change my quirk of recognizing strangers. I enjoy looking at faces and recognizing familiar features or vibes. Sometimes it can be disorienting. But when I’m able to solve the puzzle –that’s who they remind me of!– it feels illuminating, even grounding. It’s like I understand both the stranger and the familiar person a little better. And now that I am more aware of the quirk, I sometimes step into a coffee shop or bar wondering if I’ll see a stranger I know.Carina Storrs, PhD, is an NYC-based freelance science journalist who writes about biomedical research and health policyExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyPsychologyNeuroscienceMedical researchMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old wasn’t expected to survive, let alone walk again. But she soon began her fight for other victims of crimeByClea SkopelitiWed 19 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareAmonth before she was shot, Katrina Brownlee had a premonition. It came to her in a dream: the 22-year-old saw her former fiance, a law enforcement officer who had been abusing her for years, try to kill her, but she survived. She had experienced premonitions from a young age – she later came to see them as guidance from God. On the way to the house she had shared with him, she could hear a voice in her head pleading with her: don’t go back there.It was a freezing January morning in 1993. Brownlee was five months pregnant and had taken a cab with her two-year-old daughter through the snow to the house she had shared with her ex in Long Island, New York state. Her elder daughter, then seven, was at a playdate. A few weeks earlier, Brownlee had left her fiance for good and she and her daughters had been living in a motel to hide from him. However, over the last few nights, she had spoken to him on the phone. He seemed to have accepted their relationship was over and agreed she could come and collect her belongings.“I just wanted to retrieve the little I had,” she says. “I didn’t have money. I was homeless, pregnant, with two young children. Just in a bad space.”He let her into the house. Once inside, she put her daughter down in her bedroom and went into the master bedroom to gather her clothes. The house looked just as she had left it: the same beige carpet and white walls, the bed made. But when she opened her drawers, they were empty. Her heart began to race. Had her ex lured her there under false pretences?She turned the corner to the living room. There, she found her ex, gun aimed squarely at her stomach. He fired three times. Brownlee remembers the smell of gun smoke and seeing her pregnancy bump “go flat”. Falling on to the couch, she was shocked not to see blood. Somehow, she was able to run into their bedroom to try to call 911, but there was no dial tone: the line had been cut. She tried to escape through the windows, only to find he had nailed them shut. She thought he would kill her and her daughter, before turning the gun on himself. Miraculously, her daughter remained quiet in the next room: “I think he just forgot about her,” she says. Brownlee screamed, but, “I realised nobody knows I’m here. Nobody comes to visit us. This is it. It’s over.”Over the course of an hour and a half, he shot her 10 times: three times in the stomach, once in the arm, once in the buttock, once in the hip and four times in the vagina. He beat her over the head with a wooden board. “You don’t want to be with me?” she recalls him shouting. “I gave you everything you wanted, and it still wasn’t enough!”In Brownlee’s dream, she played dead so her attacker would leave her alone. Now, she did the same thing. Eventually, she really did lose consciousness.Her ex dragged her body into the bath. She would have died there had her ex’s cousin not arrived: the men had spoken hours before, and his “manic” tone had put the cousin on alert. When he arrived and found Brownlee soaked in blood, he piled her into the car and drove her to hospital.Brownlee had met the man who tried to kill her when she was 18. He was six years older and had a nice car and a career as a prison officer. She was impressed by him. Brownlee had been raised by her grandmother. Her mother gave birth to her at 16 and abandoned her in the hospital as a newborn. Brownlee’s grandmother, who worked as a librarian, struggled with alcoholism after her own husband left her and her children. In Brownlee’s memoir, she describes her grandmother as “a good person who got a bad deal”: a stylish woman who loved Christmas, when she would bake cakes and cook soul food feasts. Brownlee still saw her mother, who went on to have another child, but says she felt rejected by her. And, despite her grandmother’s efforts, it was a chaotic home environment.View image in fullscreenKatrina Brownlee as a child.Photograph: Courtesy of Katrina Brownlee and Akashic BooksBrownlee, her grandmother and aunt all lived in a brownstone building in Brooklyn in the 1970s. They rented their apartment from a drug dealer and pimp who lived downstairs, where there would be parties almost every night – she remembers seeing piles of cocaine on the table. She was sexually abused. When Brownlee was 10, their landlord lost the building in a bet and they moved to the nearby Brevoort projects.Brownlee became pregnant for the first time at 14 by an older teenager. Terrified, she tried to ignore the pregnancy at first; then, hoping to miscarry, rolled herself down a flight of stairs in her building. By the time Brownlee’s grandmother discovered her pregnancy, and her mother stepped in to take her to a clinic, she was 27 weeks: too far along for an abortion. Brownlee left school in the ninth grade to care for her baby. She says her mother wanted to give up the child for adoption – and even took the baby away from her for months. But Brownlee kept her daughter.Her mother died of cancer when she was 17. She would meet the man who tried to kill her not long afterwards, after being introduced through her aunt’s boyfriend.Brownlee first experienced his capacity for violence when, a few months into their relationship, she discovered she was pregnant. When she told him she wanted an abortion, he beat her and stopped her from getting one by tearing up her referral letter for the procedure. Her grandmother saw the violence but encouraged her to remain with him, telling Brownlee he could give her a better life.Brownlee reported the violence three times, but says police officers left after her fiance showed his badgeHe proposed at Christmas in 1989, and she moved out of her grandmother’s and into his parents’ basement in Bedford-Stuyvesant while they waited to move into a house that he was having built. Brownlee says he treated her daughter well, but describes a stifling atmosphere with a man with a hair-trigger temper. Weeks after their engagement, in January 1990, he pushed her down the stairs during an argument. She felt sharp pains in her abdomen and called an ambulance. A police car came too but when she told the responding officer about the attack, her fiance “flashed his badge” and spoke to the police privately. The police and ambulance left and her fiance took her to hospital. There, her contractions began: a month before her due date, she gave birth to her second daughter.The couple and their new baby moved into the house in Long Island in 1991. She had hoped this would be a fresh start. But the beatings became more frequent – and more severe. She grew isolated; the new house was an hour and a half from everyone she knew.During their relationship, Brownlee called the police to report the violence three times, but says officers left after her fiance showed his badge – even when she had visible injuries. She felt abandoned by those who were meant to protect her, but felt she had nowhere safe to run to. Once, she did try to leave and went back to her grandmother’s, but he found her there and forced her to come back. When she left for good in late 1992, it was after he beat her over the head with a piece of a chair. By this time, she had begun a secret relationship with a man living nearby, which showed her what a loving relationship could be like. She had recently also discovered she was four months pregnant with her then fiance’s child. Looking back, Brownlee says that “all the signs” were there that her fiance would one day try to kill her.Brownlee woke up in hospital after the attack in a haze. She was surrounded by women who were praying for her. She would later learn that one of these women was a cousin of her ex – someone who would support her during her early recovery. Brownlee had been in a coma for nine days and over the next few days, after she was moved out of intensive care and on to a ward, she began to fill in the gaps.Her ex had been arrested – Brownlee had managed to say who had shot her, and his address, before losing consciousness – and her daughters were living with her ex’s mother, who had moved out of state. The doctors had not expected Brownlee to make it: while she was in hospital, Keri Herzog, the assistant district attorney, who would later become Brownlee’s friend, told her that she had taken a dying declaration from her before she fell into a coma. Brownlee had no memory of it.View image in fullscreen‘It’s heavy’ … Brownlee on police graduation day.Photograph: Courtesy of Katrina Brownlee and Akashic BooksIn her hospital bed, a doctor gave her several pieces of devastating news: her unborn baby had not survived; she would not be able to have any more children; and she would not walk again. She was told it was a miracle that she was alive, but she felt crushed by the weight of everything. Her daughters “were the only reason I could think of to go on living,” she wrote in her memoir.Brownlee stayed in hospital for about three weeks, starting physical therapy there before continuing it at home. At first, attempting her physiotherapist’s exercises seemed futile. But she kept going and made astonishingly rapid progress: by the end of the summer, she was walking unassisted. It was at about this time that she found her faith and was baptised.Her ex’s mother allowed her to stay in the Bedford-Stuyvesant house after she was discharged from hospital. But when Brownlee refused to write to the judge in her case saying she had shot herself, she says her mother-in-law evicted her. Brownlee and her children moved into a homeless shelter in the Bronx, waiting for assisted housing. “Homeless, hungry, two kids, lost one in the process. Just continuing pain, but you try to normalise it,” she says of this time.Her ex’s trial was set to begin in April 1994. Brownlee was reluctant to testify – she wanted to move on and was convinced he would get an easy time as he worked in law enforcement. But Herzog wouldn’t let it drop. “I will hunt you down like a dog and drag you on to the witness stand myself if I have to!” Herzog told her. Brownlee agreed to testify.Years later, whenCBS made a documentaryabout her, Brownlee learned that a letter in her name, that may have been written by her mother-in-law, had been presented to the judge by the defence. The letter – a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian – says that Brownlee would not press charges, and that, if subpoenaed to court, she would testify on the defendant’s behalf.But Brownlee’s ex entered a guilty plea. Herzog asked for 25 years to life. Six bullets remained in Brownlee’s body: her doctor had told her it would be too risky to remove them. (She still has them, though she has a tattoo over the scars.) His lawyer argued that it was a crime of passion, that his client was a prison officer with no previous record. His request for five to 15 years was granted. “I was totally gutted,” Brownlee says. Once again, she felt the justice system had failed her.The years went by. Brownlee and her daughters moved to East Flatbush, Brooklyn, and she tried to establish a routine for them. But she struggled, especially in relationships – including one with a man in prison, and a drug dealer.“At that point, I was so damaged … How could you even identify a healthy relationship if you’ve never seen it?” For years, she was existing, not living. “I normalised feeling numb. Crying at night when nobody knows you cry.”When she was 27, searching for a sense of purpose and independence, she enrolled in the New York police department (NYPD) traffic academy and took night classes to get her high school diploma, with her partner at the time helping with childcare. When she was offered the chance to take the police exam, she sat it and passed. She became a police officer in 2001.View image in fullscreenExcelling … Brownlee goes undercover as a cop.Photograph: Courtesy of Katrina Brownlee and Akashic BooksWhy did she want to become a cop after all she had been through? To be a “good cop”, she says. “If a person like me doesn’t come in to try to bridge the gap between the community and the police, who will?” Specifically, she wanted to see “more empathy” towards civilians, the end of racial profiling, and “mutual respect” between officers and civilians.Brownlee excelled in undercover roles, going on to work in narcotics and then vice. Many of the sex workers she met “came from the same story” as she did. “Most, if not all, came from some sort of abuse, some sort of neglect.”She began therapy in 2009, beginning a period of years of intensive work. “The first time I went to therapy, I totally collapsed. I just wanted to go home in this woman’s pocketbook. That was probably the very first time in my entire life that I had felt safe,” she says. Over time, she began to feel something shift in her: “I started to believe that, you know what? I think I can fully recover, if I keep going, if I keep my eyes on the light, and follow the light.”She was far from the only victim of domestic violence at the hands of a police officer: research from the 1990sfound US police officers weretwo to four times more likely to abuse their familiesthan was the case in the general population. Still, she never told any of her colleagues that she was nearly killed by a law enforcement officer. She was worried they would think she was “mentally or emotionally” unfit for the job. She also stayed away from specialising in policing domestic violence, because she felt support for victims was lacking and the sentences for perpetrators were too weak.View image in fullscreenWith mayor Bill de Blasio and Reverend Jesse Jackson.Photograph: Courtesy of Katrina Brownlee and Akashic BooksHer memoir, which she began writing in about 2017 and published this year, is sharply critical of the NYPD at points, in particular a culture where officers don’t report each other in cases of misconduct. “I saw the dynamics of how the police really are a family – theyreallybelieve in this ‘blue wall of silence’.” She believes officers need mandatory therapy. “Police officers are exposed to a lot when they go out in the field, and it’s heavy. Then they have to come home, be husbands, wives, parents or caregivers … They need an outlet.”After working in vice, Brownlee transferred to community affairs – what she saw as the ultimate “good cop” role. She founded a mentoring scheme called Young Ladies of Our Future for at-risk teenage girls, supporting them to build confidence and offering guidance on relationships, including the warning signs of abuse. She says it would have helped her as a teenager. “Because even though you have to go back to that situation [at home], you still walk away with some tools.” She later served on mayor Bill de Blasio’s security detail, becoming one of the first Black women to do so.Brownlee ended her police career as a first-grade detective after 20 years’ service, retiring in 2021. Soon after, she was interviewed by theNew York Times. After publication, she received an anonymous call from someone who identified himself as a former police officer. He wondered if he had been one of those officers who had left when her ex flashed his badge, despite seeing her injuries. “He said: ‘I worked at that precinct at the time, and I’ve had incidents where I’ve done that. If that was me, I’m sorry.’” Then he hung up.View image in fullscreen‘I really believe in the power of forgiveness, because it’s not for them – it’s for you.’Photograph: Maria Spann/The GuardianWhat would she have said to him, if he had stayed on the line? “Why didn’t you help me if you saw me with a black eye? How would you feel had that been your daughter, or anybody you loved?” He could, she says, have been the “key” to the attempted murder not happening.Brownlee’s ex was released after 10 years. She has worked hard to forgive him. “I was so angry and bitter. I didn’t want to be a product of that. I really believe in the power of forgiveness, because it’s not for them: it’s for you, it’s for the people around you.” They have been in the same room together once since his release – after his mother died, she was present to support her daughters. They did not speak.Now, at 55, her career is focused on advocacy, coaching and mentoring. After decades of silence about her attack, she now talks regularly about domestic violence, including to law enforcement. She wants to see legislation that would, among other measures, ban those convicted of domestic violence in New York from accessing firearms. “If we can keep guns out of abusers’ hands, that couldcut half of domestic homicides,” she says. “I’m also trying to create a registry for domestic violence,” she says. This would allow people to check if someone – their new partner, for instance, or the partner of a relative or friend – had a related conviction. She also wants mandatory rehabilitation and training for domestic abusers because abusers too often leave prison unreformed. “If you just treat the symptoms, the symptoms come back,” she says.Starting at the end of the year, she’ll also be heading into federal prisons – speaking to men who have committed, among other offences, domestic abuse and other violent crimes and offering mentoring and coaching.View image in fullscreenBrownlee on The Kelly Clarkson Show with Chelsea and Hillary Clinton.Photograph: NBC/Weiss Eubanks/NBCUniversal/Getty Images“Domestic violence doesn’t just start from a place of ‘I’m this abuser,’” she says. “It comes from different things they have experienced, the way they’ve been raised at home … So if I’m speaking to an audience of people who have been abused or been neglected, I can relate to them.” It’s a place to start while legislation catches up, she says. “If I can’t get Congress and the government to do it, then I have to take the initial step … then maybe they’ll come behind me.”These days, when Brownlee isn’t on the road for work, she splits her time between her homes in New York City and the south. She exercises, walking 3.5 miles a day, and still returns to therapy when needed. Her religious faith is a guiding force: “This is a life that I will never get over – I’ve learned to live with it.”Publishing her memoir this year brought her closer to some family members, who she says had not fully understood the extent of what she had been through until they read it. Some people in her life have apologised for “not even seeing the signs that something was wrong”. She doesn’t hold anything against them, though. She says her daughters, who are now 35 and 40, haven’t read her book. “Whenever they’re ready, they’ll read it … I don’t want to bring triggers to my children,” she says.Brownlee also remains close with her ex’s cousin who saved her life.Her gaze is set firmly on the future, but that morning of January 1993 will never leave her: “There’s not a day I don’t think about it. But I’ve learned to accept this is my life, and how I respond is what matters. I was dealt a losing hand. But then, I was able to win.”Katrina Brownlee’s memoir And Then Came the Blues: My Story of Survival and My Rise in the NYPD is out now (Akashic Books, £26.99).In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

Then I borrowed an oversized road bike. At first, I couldn’t wait to ditch it, but something kept me going ...Emma PooleyWed 19 Nov 2025 01.55 ESTShareIcouldn’t pinpoint the exact moment that I broke my foot. The injury didn’t seem like a big deal at first, because stress fractures sneak up on you. It just hurt, and wouldn’t stop hurting, except while running. Maybe because running was the only time I felt good about myself. But in the end the pain intruded there, too. I ran on stubbornly, with a limp.Eventually I had to go to the doctor, and that’s when it hit me. She said it would take eight weeks to heal – no running. I couldn’t imagine even one week without running. I had run every single day for nearly 10 years and I loved it. I tried to find the words to explain, to say that this “rest” was just not possible, but I was too embarrassed. It was a minor injury by clinical standards – and self-inflicted, too. But afterwards, in the corridor, I cried.I couldn’t have known then, in 2002, that those eight weeks would take me from cross-country runner mediocrity (because, despite my obsessive training, I wasn’t fast) to an Olympic podium. All I knew was that I couldn’t cope without running.It was like a state of grief. After the denial came depression and bargaining with myself. OK, running was banned, but what about cross-training? Swimming helped with my frustration at the inactivity but I was soon fed up with the stuffy air, the chlorine, with slogging back and forth without ever getting anywhere or seeing anything or a sniff of nature. I decided cycling would be better: fresh air, low impact. I borrowed an oversized road bike and began to ride it every day with the same dedication I’d put into running. Except I was even worse at cycling. Also, I hated it.Any new sport has its challenges, but road cycling is especially tough. It links together all the discomforts of weather, traffic, mechanical problems and a bewildering variety of tech, plus everything is eye-wateringly expensive. On top of that, you have the very personal discomfort of a saddle. I was counting the days until I could run again.View image in fullscreen‘Group rides were always planned around where to get tea and cake.’Photograph: Thomas LecomteI was also missing the sociability of club training, and wondered if cycling with a group might help. On a grey Saturday morning I showed up for my first club ride, cold and nervous. The other cyclists were sleekly wrapped in Lycra, their bikes gleamed, and no one else had a rucksack. I looked down, past ski gloves and a flappy jacket, to my trusty trainers. My jogging tights had sagged, bunching up above my bare ankles. That was the day I found out that there are right socks and wrong socks in cycling. I also found out what a cross wind is, and that fixing a puncture in the rain with frozen hands (and ankles) is harder than at home in the warm.Cyclingwas still miserable. I couldn’t wait to ditch the bike and never see that saddle again.And yet somehow, almost unnoticed, a little bit of fun crept in. First it came via cafe stops. The club regulars knew every garden centre and village cafe within a 100km radius of Cambridge, and group rides were always planned around where to get tea and cake. Over pint mugs of tea clutched in bluish hands, I began to enjoy the social side of cycling. Words were used sparingly out on the road – especially on windy days – but at the cafe stop it was different. Kind people and interesting conversation can improve even the most tedious hobby.If it had been a choice, I still would have ditched cycling straight away. But the stress fracture meant I stuck at it and, after nearly two months, when running was allowed again, I didn’t abandon the bike. It helped that I found a better saddle.Living near mountains allowed me to find my strength as a climber – a cyclist who specialises in uphillsA month later, I did my first time trial, in which I got beaten by a guy wearing a gorilla suit. After a year, I bought a bike that fitted me. A friend dragged me along with her to a road race. Soon after, I entered the national championships and finished fourth.Two years later, a research job and a PhD took me to Zurich. I left behind the friends who had helped me become a cyclist, as well as those scones from my favourite cafe, but living near mountains allowed me to find my strength as a “climber” – a cyclist who specialises in uphills.In 2008, five-and-a-half years after my unwilling detour into cycling, I waited to start the Olympic time trial. Below the ramp, the road shimmered with heat, red flags hanging in the heavy air. Only Kristin Armstrong, winning the first of her three Olympic gold medals, would ride faster that day.It wasn’t a straightforward route to Olympic success. There’s so much to learn to get anywhere close to elite level, and bike racing is not gentle on late starters. I lost a lot of races, slogged through many thousands of kilometres of training, and crashed countless times along the way. Sometimes I wondered why I carried on; a career as a professional cyclist hadn’t been my plan. But I’d found a lot to enjoy in cycling, and that was more motivating than brute ambition.I thought there was something wrong with my body – until I shared a shower with 50 strangersRead moreAfter the Beijing Olympics, I signed for a pro team and assisted teammates in winning the Giro and the Tour de l’Aude. With their help, I went on to win some stage races myself. In 2010, I won the British championships in both time trial and road racing, and then the rainbow jersey as time trial world champion. I was part of two more Olympic teams in London and Rio. When I switched to triathlon, cycling came in useful at Alpe d’Huez in 2015 and for four duathlon world champion titles (2014-2017). And when I went back to competitive running, I found the cycling had made me stronger – I became Swiss trail-running champion in 2021 and finished 11th at the uphill world championships in 2023.I still love running; it’s the time when I feel best about myself. But now I love cycling, too. My bike has taken me to quieter places with more awesome views than a start ramp, and while winning races has been fun, long rides in the mountains with friends still feel even better.Oat to Joy: Recipes and Somewhat of an Oatobiographyby Emma Pooley is available now (YouCaxton Publications, £29).

How wrong he was ...John CraceWed 19 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 05.43 ESTShareIfeel I should probably start with an apology. A few days after the 2024 general election, I wrote that it felt as ifthe grownups were back in charge. It wasn’t as if I was carried away by the vision of Keir Starmer or the charisma of Rachel Reeves. More that I felt we had regained a basic level of competence. That politics would become business as usual rather than the breathless psychodrama of the past 10 years. You could go to bed at night relatively confident that the country would be more or less recognisable when you woke up. There would be no more mad people doing mad things as we raced through five or six news cycles in the course of a couple of hours.And part of me was a little concerned. Because what is good for economic stability and social justice isn’t necessarily good for a sketch writer. Dull, well-intentioned politicians putting in place dull, well-intentioned policies, and a government that is ticking over more or less OK, do not necessarily make for great entertainment. So what would I write about?It turns out that I needn’t have worried.View image in fullscreenWet, wet, wet … Rishi Sunak calls for a general election in May 2024.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAFor the last year of the Conservative government, it felt as if Westminster was demob happy. There was no real jeopardy. Everyone knew what was coming next. There would be a general election at some point in 2024 and the Tories would lose. Not because there was a great outpouring of love for Starmer’s Labour but because after 14 years of austerity, Brexit, Partygate and Liz Truss, everyone was sick to death of theConservatives. People wanted change. So nothing the Tories did in that final year was of any real consequence. We could all sit back and enjoy the ride while having a laugh.It was Rishi Sunak’s bad luck to be prime minister in the dog days of a Tory government that had long since run out of ideas. Most politicians, Sunak included, are control freaks. They like to think they can make a difference, can bend reality to their will. But the one thing they can’t control is their own space-time continuum.If a politician is very lucky, he or she might get one shot at Downing Street in their lifetime. But it won’t necessarily be at a time of their choosing. Sunak’s time came when even someone as naturally entitled as he is could see he was bound to fail. And yet he couldn’t turn down the job. Better to have been a rubbish prime minister for two years than not to have been prime minister at all. At least some people might recognise him in 10 years’ time when he joins the ranks of ex-prime ministers at the Cenotaph for the Remembrance Day service. Which is more than anyone could say for Truss.Credit to Sunak: he did at least try. Inside a prime minister desperately trying to manage a Tory party lurching ever further to the right, there were the occasional glimpses of a decent person trying to get out. He was, though, the embodiment of Samuel Beckett. Fail. Fail again. Fail better.Almost everything he tried fell apart in his hands. There were hisfive pledges. “Judge me on them,” he said. And we did. Only one of them – to halve inflation – was delivered. And that one had very little to do with him. The fall in inflation was more a global trend from which he benefited.View image in fullscreenThe new wave … Keir and Victoria Starmer.Photograph: James Manning/PANothing defined Sunak more than his exit. Walking out of Downing Street in a torrential downpour tocall the election. Having forgotten to bring an umbrella. Anyone sensible – me included – had remained indoors and watched the announcement on TV. No point in all of us getting drenched. Most people even missed the speech as an anti-Brexit campaigner was playing Things Can Only Get Better through a loudspeaker just outside the Downing Street gates.Things Can Only Get Wettermore like.Then there were the D-day commemorations in which Sunakleft the veteranson the beaches. And the No 10betting scandalover the date of the election, in which one of his closest aides was implicated. It was as if the Tories had a death wish and were actively trying to lose the election. Someone should have told them they didn’t need any extra help. Come polling day, Sunak looked dazed and confused, as if he couldn’t wait for it all to be over. The results came as a relief. Gone and almost certainly soon to be forgotten.The first inkling that the new Labour government might also be accident-prone came early on with thefreebies row. Starmer had campaigned on the slogan that Labour would be squeaky clean. No more Tory sleaze. Starmer helping himself to a few suits and extra pairs of glasses and Reeves enjoying corporate hospitality at aSabrina Carpenter concertmight not be up there with Partygate or dodgy PPE contracts, but it was not a good look.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Billy B/The GuardianAs head of the firstLabourgovernment for 14 years, Starmer knew he would be under scrutiny from the media. This was Politics 101. And yet he and the chancellor couldn’t resist. When most of the country was still struggling with low growth and a cost of living crisis, they were getting the perks. One rule for them, another for us.Ministers who Starmer had thought had been doing a rubbish job were promptly given another one. Failing upwardsIt was a similar story a year or so later when Angela Rayner was found not to have paid the correct stamp duty on a flat in Hove. Now I’m sure the trust arrangements were complicated, but you would expect a deputy prime minister and housing secretary to go the extra mile to make sure everything was correct. That errorcost Rayner her jobsand took one of the few Labour politicians who can connect with Labour voters out of the frontline. Just when she was needed most.Then there were the policy announcements and the budget. A Labour government that didn’t look much like the Labour government that voters had given a landslide majority. There was a lack of confidence in the administration. As if all its energy had been spent on winning an election it was always going to win, and no one had thought of what they would do when they were in office.The removal of the winter fuel allowance. The pointless fight with the farmers over inheritance tax. The welfare bill designed to remove payments to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people. A bill that was then hollowed out because of backbench rebellions while the government tried to pretend that nothing had really changed. The increasingly rightwing rhetoric on immigration. The“island of strangers” speech. The fanfare surrounding the return of one asylum seeker to France only for him to find his way back to the UK within a month. All this rather drowned out what good news – hospital waiting lists coming down – there was. It seemed as if Labour was lurching from one crisis to the next. The cabinet reshuffle in which ministers who Starmer had thought had been doing a rubbish job were promptly given another one. Failing upwards.View image in fullscreenThe Rachel papers … the chancellor of the exchequer presents the spring budget in March 2025.Photograph: House of Commons/AFP/Getty ImagesMostly, though, you couldn’t escape the feeling that Starmer just wasn’t very good at politics. That No 10 had no control of the news grid and were waking up each morning just as surprised as we were that the country was falling apart.Take next week’s budget. Little more than two weeks ago, Reeves was giving asurprise press conferenceinside Downing Street at 8.10am – something almost unheard of. “I want to be clear with the country,” she said. Only she was anything but, as she couldn’t bring herself to say the one thing she had come to say. We were supposed to deduce via interpretive dance that she was planning to break a manifesto promise and increase income tax by 2p.Only it turns out that was a false start. Scrub the previous 10 days of briefings. Because now Reeves has changed her mind. Right hand, meet left hand. Having said she was going to do what was right for the country and not the party, she has now realised she would rather do things the other way round. Then we had the absurd spectacle of No 10 briefing journalists that everything was going so well that Starmer was going to fight off any leadership challenge from Wes Streeting.View image in fullscreen‘Never less than entertaining’ … Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.Photograph: House of Commons/AFP/Getty ImagesFor reasons best known to themselves, Downing Street thought this made them look hard. It was only the following day they realised they had created a totally unnecessary shitshow and tried to deny they had anything to do with it. Starmer promised to come down hard on whoever had done the briefings. In time he will have to sack himself. But for now he is happy to believe it was divine intervention. The worst game ofWestminster No-Cluedo: Keir Starmer in the Cabinet Office with the career suicidal tendencies. It increasingly feels as if the government is doing all this solely for my benefit. To give me something to write about. I’m not complaining. Though you may well be.I’m happy with Badenoch. She’s never less than entertaining. Some of her performances at PMQs have been thrillingly uselessBut never let it be said that the Tories aren’t doing their bit to liven up British politics. Since the election they seem to have positively embraced their own descent into irrelevance. However unpopular Labour are with the public – current opinion polls have them on less than 20% – the Conservatives can still go lower. For now, at least, Kemi Badenoch is still their leader – she has been in post for just over a year – and looks relatively secure. Not even Robert “Honest Bob” Jenrick is mad enough to want to become leader given the current state of the party. At least, I don’t think he’s quite that mad. Watch this space.I’m quite happy with Badenoch. She’s never less than entertaining. Like many politicians, she seems to have no idea that she’s nowhere near as competent as she thinks she is. That reality gap is always fertile territory. Some of her performances at prime minister’s questions have been thrillingly useless. But more than this, she is always in a permanent state of fury and exasperation. It’s almost as though she wakes up in the morning, sees her reflection in the mirror and picks a fight with herself. Just recently she demanded that Reeves resign over her failure to get a licence for her rental property, and then unresign so that she could resign again in a few weeks’ time when she broke a manifesto promise. You can’t make this nonsense up.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner arrives in Downing Street a few days before resigning.Photograph: Aaron Chown/PAThe Tory supporting cast are also good material. Not least Chris Philp. One of the features of the new government is that it is no longer the Labour shadow cabinet you bump into in the corridor. They now go everywhere by ministerial car. Instead it is the Tory shadow ministers. Which can be awkward. I passed the Philpster on the stairs a few months back. He looked me in the eye and said, “Hello, John.” Awkward. At that moment I knew that he knew that I had once described him as “a nose in search of a bum”. He also told a press gallery lunch he was upset I had called him a “quarter-wit”. He aspires to be a half-wit. Patience, Philp.This new parliament has seen the rise and rise of Reform. Nigel Farage is adamant his party adopts a “one in, one out” policy. Which is why he has lost two of his MPs and gained the driven-mad-by-the-sight-of-black-peopleSarah Pochinand the gullible Danny Kruger. Reform are now more than 10 points ahead and, if the polls remain the same, look set to win the next election.View image in fullscreenPromises, promises … Nigel Farage.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockJust who would make up Farage’s cabinet is anyone’s guess. Presumably either a bunch of MPs who had only just won their seats and had no experience of anything, or he would appoint outsiders to the Lords who would be prevented from being able to appear in the Commons. It seems that Richard Tice is being groomed to be chancellor. Principally because he is in possession of a small fortune. Mainly because he started with a large one. As for Farage, he is currently trying to reposition himself from insurgent to mainstream politician. By ditching all the promises he made in his manifesto at the last election. I am watching him like a hawk.Then there is Donald Trump. Currently in the process of suing the BBC. The Beeb is planning to pay any damages from the proceeds of a new channel – BBC5 – which will be dedicated to programmes examining programmes about the BBC. Its favourite pastime.Meanwhile, Starmer is on a mission not to do anything that might upset Agent Orange. The recent press conference at Chequers during the president’s state visit was a case in point. I sat there gobsmacked as Trump claimed to have ended eight global conflicts, including one betweenAlbania and Azerbaijan– which will have come as news to both countries, as they didn’t even know they were at war with one another – and then said hehad never heard of or met Peter Mandelson. Starmer just stood there and nodded. Either I’m going mad or he is.Lucky us to have such politicians in such an uncertain world.

I don’t need to wait to get information back and classify you as drug sensitive, this or that regimen. There is no need to go through all of that.”Access to swift diagnostic tests for TB is patchy and it can take days or weeks in some places for doctors to get laboratories to identify the TB type a patient has before they can be helped.Dr William Brumskine, clinical research site leader at the Aurum Institute in Rustenburg, SouthAfrica, said he hoped overall care would be improved. “The hope of having a universal regimen that is shorter, that has less side-effects, is you will have less individuals coming in for clinic visits [and so] the health care providers will have more time to give individual care to patients,” he said.View image in fullscreenPhase-2 trials of a sorfequiline-based regimen at the University of Cape Town Lung Institute. TB Alliance hopes to launch phase 3 in 2026.Photograph: Jonathan Torgovnik/TB AllianceA decade ago, patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis faced a gruelling treatment regimen of 18 months or more, involving multiple injections and hospital stays, that only cured about 50% of people. The current gold-standard treatment, introduced in 2019, successfully treats 90% of people within six months. Researchers hope using sorfequiline could improve things further.Beaumont said excitement had built before the full trial results arrived. “It’s incredible when you start getting these little anecdotes from the sites [such as]: ‘This patient got cured so fast. I don’t know what arm [of the trial] he was on, but wow, I’ve never seen this before.’”US to demand countries share data on ‘pathogens with epidemic potential’ in return for health aidRead moreTB Alliance said it hoped to launch a phase-3 clinical trial in 2026.Dr Kavindhran Velen, chief scientific officer at the International Union againstTuberculosisand Lung Disease, which organised the conference, said a swifter, more effective TB treatment could have clear benefits, increasing the proportion of patients completing treatment and reducing the time they are contagious.However, he said he worried that applying it universally to TB patients could have downsides, including disincentivising health systems’ investment in wider innovations such as laboratories and testing.He said doctors would need to be sure any universal TB treatment was not akin to “taking a hammer to an ant [for patients who could be treated with gentler drugs]. We don’t want to overexpose an individual to treatment that is not necessarily needed.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthTuberculosisHealthWorld Health OrganizationSouth AfricaAfricaInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this content"

This must happen in order to have a chance to avoid unmanageable and extremely costly climate impacts affecting all people in the world.”The signatories include several of the world’s leading authorities on planetary science, forests and oceans: Carlos Nobre from Science Panel of the Amazon; Fatima Denton of United Nations University; Johan Rockström of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research; Marina Hirota; Instituto Serrapilheira; Paulo Artaxo - Universidade de São Paulo; Piers Forster of the University of Leeds; and Thelma Krug, who is Chair of the COP30 Science Council.They saythis is the first time that a COP presidency has involved scientistsin the preparation of a climate conference and then provided a pavilion for them to share their findings and opportunities to provide updates to the negotiators.Bearing in mind the gravity of the threat, their latest report says action needs to be accelerated: “We need to be as close as possible to absolute zero fossil fuel emissions by 2040, the latest by 2045. This means globally no new fossil fuel investments, removing all subsidies from fossil fuels and a global plan on how to phase in renewable and low-carbon energy sources in a just way, and phase out fossil fuels quickly.”They say finance - from developed to developing countries - is essential for the credibility of the Paris Agreement. “It must be predictable, grant-based and consistent with a just transition and equity,” they say. “Without scaling and reforming climate finance, developing countries cannot plan, cannot invest and cannot deliver the transitions needed for a shared survival.”This is the first climate conference in the Amazon rainforest, which used to be one of the planet’s great climate stabilisers. The scientists warn this can no longer be taken for granted: “The only reason we can have an orderly phase out of fossil fuels is because we assume forests will continue to be a major carbon sink. Unfortunately we have increasing evidence that forests are turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources. This happens because forests are vulnerable to climate change causing more frequent and intense droughts, fires, heatwaves and land use conversion.”To address this, they stress that Cop30 also needs to produce a roadmap that concurrently ends deforestation and phases out fossil fuels.“The Roadmap on ending deforestation must include financial support, capacity building and robust monitoring. Forest protection cannot be used as offsets. Standing forests cannot be an excuse to keep burning fossil fuels.“Share"

But a larger panel of appellate judges on Friday said Boasberg “remains free to require the government to identify the decision makers who directed the potentially contemptuous actions and to carefully consider next steps”.Boasberg’s remarks on Wednesday breathed new life intohis standoffwith the Trump administration over the limits of US presidential power. By conducting the criminal contempt proceedings, which can result in fines or other forms of censure, Boasberg has drawn the ire of Trump allies, who say the judge has overstepped.Venezuelans sent by Trump to El Salvador endured systematic torture, report findsRead moreBoasberg asked the justice department to submit a proposal on 24 November outlining their proposed next steps. Boasberg also requested a similar proposal from lawyers who brought the litigation before him on behalf ofthe deported men.The justice department has disagreed with Boasberg’s interpretation of the appeals court order issued last week, asserting he lacks jurisdiction to conduct contempt proceedings. The justice department has also argued that theTrump administrationdid not willfully defy any court orders.Boasberg has been hearing a lawsuit brought on behalf of alleged Venezuelan gang members removed from the US under the rarely invokedAlien Enemies Act.Boasberg in April concluded the Trump administration appeared to have acted “in bad faith” when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights on 15 March at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess the legality of the effort.The Venezuelan men at the center of the litigation were released from a notorious Salvadorianprisonthis summer aftera traumatic time, and returned to Venezuela as part of a US-brokered prisoner swap.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsEl SalvadorLaw (US)AmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We will find you. And you will be accountable and held to justice for your crimes,” she said.Authorities also announced the arrest of the Ontario lawyer Deepak Paradkar, who allegedly advised Wedding to murder the FBI witness, Jonathan Acebedo-Garcia, a Canadian citizen who was shot dead in a restaurant in Medellín in January.FBI offers $10m reward for ex-Olympic snowboarder turned drug kingpinRead moreBill Essayli, first assistant US attorney at the central district of California, told reporters that Paradkar was one of a dozen individuals who were recently arrested in an “international takedown”. He said the well-known Brampton lawyer told Wedding: “If you kill this witness, the case will be dismissed.”Police inCanadaalso arrested Atna Onha, a Montreal man, and charged him with murder conspiracy in the killing of Acebedo-Garcia, a former member of Wedding’s organization.“Make no mistake about it: Ryan Wedding is a modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said. “He’s a modern-day iteration of El Chapo Guzmán.”The state department also increased its reward for Wedding’s capture and conviction from US$10m to $15m.Wedding, 43, grew up in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and competed for TeamCanadain the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic games, where he placed 24th in the parallel giant slalom event.Four years after the Games, Ryan Wedding was named in a search warrant investigating a marijuana-growing operation in British Columbia, but was never charged.In 2010, Wedding was convicted of drug trafficking after attempting to buy cocaine from a US government agent and was sentenced to four years in prison.Described by mediaat the time as a 2010 “Olympic hopeful”, Wedding sought to dismiss the charges, alleging “outrageous conduct” by US authorities, suggesting they used a “violent former KGB agent” as an undercover operative.But in the years since, he has emerged as a powerful and ruthless transnational narcotics trafficker.The RCMP commissioner, Mike Duhame, was also present at the press conference and told reporters that seven Canadians have been arrested. Duheme said Wedding’s organization probably makes more than $1bn a year.On Wednesday, the US treasury department also announced sanctions on Ryan Wedding and nine other people linked to his criminal organization.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMexicoDrugsDrugs tradeSnowboardingOlympic GamesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They could offer more finance, and technology.”Amid squabbles, bombast and competing interests, what can Cop30 achieve?Read moreThis does not necessarily involve an increase in the headline amount of money to be provided directly from rich world coffers,set last year at $300bn (£230bn) a year by 2035. It could also come from better use of existing finance, Corrêa do Lago added.“You don’t need more money. You don’t need public money from developed countries. You need to leverage more dollars from each dollar that you have,” he said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian as the talks entered their crucial stage.“They can offer not only more resources in banks, in multinational development banks; put more public money in funds like the green climate fund or the global environment facility, but there are an increasing number of alternatives like debt-for-nature swaps and other [instruments].”The divide over the “transition away from fossil fuels” has emerged as the biggest faultline at the Cop30 talks, now entering their final days in Brazil. On Tuesday,more than 80 countries demanded a roadmap to the transitionas a key outcome of the summit, in what some campaigners described as a “turning point”.But they are likely to face stiff opposition from petrostates such as Saudi Arabia and others who are dependent on fossil fuels. Decisions at “conference of the party” meetings require consensus, so even a handful of states could scupper the roadmap proposal.“Not only is [the divide] binary, but it is two extremes: one very favourable [to a phaseout] the other very unfavourable. There aren’t many countries that are indifferent,” said Corrêa do Lago.View image in fullscreenA demonstration at Cop30 in Belém calling for an end to the use of fossil fuels.Photograph: Fraga Alves/EPABut countries could still come together, he added. “Like most of these negotiations, it is less binary than it looks,” he said, if countries could recognise their own internal contradictions, and face up to the global need for climate action.Some oil-producing countries oppose the fossil fuel phaseout, but so do some consumer countries. “Some countries, because oil is a very important source of revenue, and other countries because they evaluate that they still need to use coal for more years, have shown very clearly that this proposal is not acceptable to them,” Corrêa do Lago said.Oil-producing countries also had hard truths to face up to. “They have to decide by themselves how they interpret the transition [away from fossil fuels],” he said. “They are already doing it. There is one statistic that shows that the use of oil will be reduced inevitably in the years ahead. [Electric vehicles are] reducing significantly the demand for oil, for gasoline and diesel.”He urged all countries toexamine their future in the context of the climate crisis. “All countries could engage in this exercise, which is to find its own path to transition towards net zero, which is what we have committed to,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Brazil embodies this: the country has recently become amajor producer of oil and gas, but its president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has repeatedly insisted, at Cop30 and the summit of world leaders in Belém that preceded it, on the need to “move away from dependency on fossil fuels”.Countries should face up to these opposing internal forces rather than try to hide them, Corrêa do Lago urged. “This Cop is happening in a country that is at the same time a nouveau oil producer and exporter, and the champion of renewables.“The country where you have the largest tropical forests in the world and the country that has the largest meat producer in the world. Brazil is a microcosm of the world: we have many successes, and we still have great challenges [with poverty] and many things to do to improve the life of our population. We understand the challenges of wealth and the challenges of poverty. [Brazil] reminds us that every country in the world has contradictory circumstances.”Lula is expected to return to Belém on Wednesday in an attempt to draw conflicted countries together. Corrêa do Lago said this would be done by listening to all countries’ concerns. “Brazil doesn’t want to do a top-down negotiation – Brazil wants to hear from countries which solutions they propose,” he said.Corrêa do Lago is a pragmatist, a climate diplomat since 2002 who believes the annual talks must evolve fast to keep up with the speed at which global heating is altering the planet. Arguments over the precise wording of promises and resolutions that have been rehearsed many times before can distract countries from the need to pursue action in the real world, he says.“The sense of urgency is what drove us to insist on implementation, because I think at this stage it’s irrelevant to be right. What is relevant is really to advance and make progress in implementation,” he said.That could mean countries pushing ahead with “coalitions of the willing” to take immediate action, rather than waiting to gain consensus at a Cop.Brazil has drawn up an “action agenda”of issues that do not need formal Cop approval to go ahead.Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisFossil fuelsBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaGreenham CommonGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

All vaccine rates analysed were below the 95% level needed to reach herd immunity.The data marks a dramatic reversal for a country long regarded as having one of Latin America’smost robust immunisation systems. While coverage has been slipping since 2015, public health specialists say the speed and scale of the drop in 2024 is without precedent – a collapse deepened by Javier Milei’s sweeping austerity programme, which has slashed thenational health budgetand strained the outreach networks that once underpinned Argentina’s vaccination successes.“The decline is serious. Coverage continues to fall. It has never been this low,” said Dr Alejandra Gaiano, a paediatric infectious disease specialist at the SAP. “The re-emergence of diseases that have been eliminated or controlled is the most serious issue and the greatest concern.”‘You’re either poor or rich’: the Argentinians struggling under Milei’s chainsaw austerityRead moreOnly 46% of five-year-olds received theMMR(measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine in 2024, compared with about 90% in the 2015-2019 period, the SAP’s analysis found. The percentage of five-year-olds receiving the polio vaccine booster also fell from 88% to 47% in the same period, while the vaccine against whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus dropped from 88% to just 46%.“We are facing a scenario of collective immunological fragility. The current figures not only compromise individual immunity, but also put public health as a whole at risk,” Gaiano said.The SAP cautioned that changes in how some municipalities recorded immunisations in 2023 would have contributed in part to the decrease, but said this would not have had a “substantial impact” and that coverage levels remained “critically low”.While reduced coverage was seen across all ages, experts warned that the situation was particularly alarming in children younger than 18 months old. The SAP estimated that coverage of the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine and the inactivated polio vaccine, administered at six months old, fell by an average of 10 points from pre-pandemic levels. This would mean more than 115,000 infants did not complete the schedules needed to protect them from diphtheria, hepatitis B, polio and whooping cough.According to Elizabeth Bogdanowicz, an SAP infectious disease specialist, it is now common forless than 70%of children to have received their mandatory vaccines.Access barriers were the primary driver of the decline, worsened by Argentina’s deepening economic crisis and sharp cuts in public spending under libertarian Milei. Since taking office in December 2023, the president has slashed Argentina’s healthcare budget by48% in real terms.Gaiano said difficulties ranged from reduced clinic hours and fewer media campaigns to the cutting back of outreach work that once underpinned Argentina’s historically strong immunisation system.“At one time, outreach activities were carried out. Vaccinators would go door to door to vaccinate people, but these activities are decreasing. Activities used to be carried out in schools, but with the cutbacks this has become difficult,” Gaiano said. Parents struggling to pay for travel or to get time off work have also played a role, she added.This strain on services also coincides with a post-pandemic rise in vaccine mistrust. Gaiano said Argentina previously had “almost no anti-vaccine groups” but that the pandemic “generated some mistrust of the Covid vaccine”, which had “spread to other vaccines”.Experts warned that the low coverage could lead to the re-emergence of eliminated diseases such as hepatitis A, whooping cough, measles and polio.Argentina has already reporteda large number of hepatitis A casesthis year and has seen an uptick in measles. It is currently battling a whooping cough outbreak – the number of cases is three times higher in 2025 than the year previous, and five children have died so far, the SAP said.The Argentina ministry of health was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaVaccines and immunisationMMRInfectious diseasesHealthAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

No casualties have been reported.More than 300 residents in the three villages most at risk in the district of Lumajang were evacuated to government shelters, said Abdul Muhari, a spokesperson for the national disaster mitigation agency.He said increased activity of the volcano on Wednesday afternoon prompted authorities to widen the danger zone to 8km (5 miles) from the crater. People were advised to keep away from an area along the Besuk Kobokan River, which is the path of the lava flow, as searing gas flowed down Semeru’s slopes.Videos on social media showed a dense cloud of ash sweeping through a forested valley to a river beneath a bridge. Residents, some with faces smeared with volcanic dust and rain, fled to temporary shelters or left for other safe areas.Local media reported that authorities were struggling to rescue about 178 people stranded on the 3,676-metre mountain at the Ranu Kumbolo monitoring post. The group included 137 climbers, 15 porters, seven guides and six tourism officials, according to an official with the Bromo-Tengger-Semeru national park (TNBTS).“They are currently safe at Ranu Kumbolo monitoring post,” Endrip Wahyutama, a TNBTS spokesperson, said in video statement. He said the post was located 4.5km from the crater on the northern slope of the mountain, which is not in the path of the hot cloud flow that was observed moving to the south-southeast. Bad weather and rain forced the group to spend the night there, he said.Semeru, also known as Mahameru, has erupted numerous times in the past 200 years. Still, as is the case with many of the 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, tens of thousands of people continue to live on its fertile slopes.Semeru’slast major eruptionwas in December 2021, when 51 people were killed and several hundred others burned and villages were buried in layers of mud. The eruption forced the evacuation of more than 10,000 people from their homes.Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 280 million people, sits along the Pacific “ring of fire”, a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines, and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaVolcanoesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But if you were more junior, you don’t know what you’re looking for. You might think it’s a genuine offer that’s made to you on LinkedIn, they might accept.”He said he believed this kind of contact was becoming more common. “They have realised the way to get to parliamentarians is through their staff … it’s deeply worrying,” he said.It comes not long after the collapse of a trial into alleged spying by two British people for China.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a complex picture with China, as I’m sure you’ve heard from government ministers over many weeks on this.”Appearing on the LBC radio breakfast show with Nick Ferrari, Pollard was challenged on the government’s purchase of Chinese technology, including vehicles used by the military that could contain listening devices.Pollard told Ferrari the government was “looking carefully at what the options are with Chinese technology”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Chinese officials reportedly said Wednesday’s decision was related to a need to further monitor the water source, but it has been widely received as part of China’s retaliatory measures amid adeepening diplomatic row with Japan.At a regular press briefing on Wednesday afternoon, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Japan had “failed to provide the technical documentation it committed to”.“I would also like to emphasise that due to [Japanese] prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s recent actions that go against the tide and her erroneous remarks on major issues such as Taiwan, which have triggered strong public outrage inChina, there would be no market for Japanese seafood in the current climate even if Japan were able to export it to China.”Before the 2023 ban, the Chinese market – including Hong Kong – accounted for more than one-fifth of Japan’s exports.The spat started after Takaichi told her country’s parliament earlier this month that Japan could become militarily involved if China attacked Taiwan, because it would be a threat to Japan’s existence.Beijing claims Taiwan is a Chinese province and has vowed to annex it, with military force if it cannot coerce or convince Taiwan to accept what it calls “reunification”.Takaichi had been asked what would trigger Japan’s 2015 “collective self-defence” laws, which give exceptions for Japan’s postwar ban on using force to settle international disputes.The remarks infuriated Beijing, which has repeatedly demanded Takaichi retract her comments, accusing her of issuing a “military threat” against China, and of pursuing a “revival” of Japan’s prewar militarism.Takaichi has not withdrawn her comments, although her government has said Japan’s self-defence policy has not changed. Earlier this week, she sent a high-ranking foreign ministry official to Beijing for talks, but they did not appear to lower tensions.China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Takaichi’s remarks “caused fundamental damage to the political foundation of China-Japan relations”.The reported seafood ban comes amid a swathe ofrhetorical, symbolic, and economic retaliations.Over the weekend, China sent a coastguard fleet through the disputed waters around the Senkaku Islands and military drones past Japan’s most westerly territory, Yonaguni Island, close to Taiwan’s east coast.After China issued a travel warning to tourists and students planning to visit Japan, almost a dozen airlines offered refunds to passengers and about 500,000 people were estimated to have cancelled flights. Shares in Japanese retail and tourism companiesfell sharply on Monday. State-owned enterprises, including Chinese banks, have also reportedly told staff not to travel to Japan.Japanese film releases have also been suspended and numerous cross-cultural events have been cancelled. On Tuesday, China’s permanent representative to the UN, Fu Cong, told a forum that Japan was “totally unqualified” for a permanent seat on the UN security council, citing Takaichi’s remarks.Additional reporting by Lillian YangQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We’re expecting them to intensify more rapidly.

Not according to new analysis, which suggests that the way Australia calculates forest cover obfuscates the impacts of ongoing deforestation.Australia calculates forest cover as a net figure, in which forest losses are “netted off” against forest gains. That is problematic, according to a report led by Griffith University’s Climate Action Beacon, because new forests do not store as much carbon or have the same wildlife benefits as established forests that are being destroyed.Prof Brendan Mackey of Griffith University, one of the study’s co-authors, described measuring forest losses and gains in net terms as “an accounting sleight of hand”.Biodiversity is in catastrophic decline. Here are three ways to ensure Australia’s conservation law actually works | Atticus Fleming and Andrew MacintoshRead more“We need to measure gross losses and gains, and collect much better information about what’s been lost and the regeneration that’s happened, to assess whether we are meeting our global obligations to climate and ecosystems,” he said.Australia is a signatory to the Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land use, made in 2021, which pledges to reverse forest loss and land degradation.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAccording to the federal government’s latestState of the Forestsreport, published in 2023, “Australia’s total forest area increased by 0.75 million ha … from 2016 to 2021, maintaining the increase in total forest area that has been observed since 2008”.But the new analysis suggests “there is considerable uncertainty about whether the reported net increase in forest area in Australia is real”.It suggests that the official dataset used to estimate increases in forest area tends to “overreact”, misclassifying areas as experiencing change when none has occurred.The research, commissioned and funded by the AustralianConservationFoundation (ACF), found that most forest destruction has occurred in species-rich forests while regrowth was mostly in drier regions with sparse vegetation, which are not comparable carbon sinks.It estimates that clearing in intensive regions releases up to 120 times more greenhouse gas emissions per hectare than could be removed from the atmosphere via the thickening of existing vegetation where most forest gains have occurred.“If mapped gains in forest area are not really new forests, just greening or thickening of existing wooded lands … then Australia’s seemingly positive net increase in forest cover statistic may be hiding even more substantial losses to biodiversity and much higher greenhouse gas emissions than claimed,” the report found.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The purpose of the forest area change indicator is to report how forest area has changed over time, and that forest area has increased. This is the most robust estimate of forest change available.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDeforestationLogging and land-clearingConservationTrees and forestsAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Comfortable? No. But is it the right thing to do for the country? Yes.”In an interview with LBC, he saidShabana Mahmoodwas “making sure that we, where people have got no right to be here, that we are deporting them, but also supporting them to be relocated as well … so actually the number of forced removals should be low”.Streeting’s comments appeared to signal that he has sympathy with some of the worries of Labour MPs, two dozen of whom have raised concerns about families being forcibly removed if they refuse cash incentives to return to their own country.Keir Starmer and Mahmood are facing the threat of a revolt over the policy at a time when the soft left of the party is expressing growing discontent with Labour’s leadership.The policy also came in for criticism internationally on Wednesday when Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, accused Mahmood of “ethnic stereotyping” and “indecent demagoguery”.Rama, who leads the country’s Socialist party, questioned how a Labour politician could “so poorly echo the rhetoric of the populist far-right” after Mahmood’s officialssingled out 700 Albanian families for deportation.He wrote on X: “How can a Labour home secretary so poorly echo the rhetoric of the populist far-right – and single out 700 Albanian families, a statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain’s challenges – precisely at a moment when the UK and Albania have built one of Europe’s most successful partnerships on illegal migration?“Albanians are net contributors to the British economy, and the number of Albanians receiving UK benefits is very low relative to other communities. To single them out again and again is not policy – it is a troubling and indecent exercise in demagoguery.“The UK should be seeking ways to deepen cooperation with Albania on all security issues – from defence to border protection – rather than repeatedly scapegoating Albanians and thereby exposing citizens of an allied nation to increased risks, including from extremist groups that thrive on such narratives. Official policy should never be driven by ethnic stereotyping.”Is this Labour’s hostile environment? – podcastRead moreAn Albanian government source said there were growing tensions between the Albanian and UK governments despite successful collaboration over immigration policies.Rama’s attack has also caused discomfort in Whitehall, because the western Balkans are seen as a major transit route for asylum seekers attempting to reach the UK.UK border security officers were sent to Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina over the summer to build links and gain intelligence on smuggling gangs, it has been confirmed.Announcing the asylum policy on Monday, Mahmood said: “We must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are.“Today, we are not removing family groups, even when we know that their home country is perfectly safe. There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims – despite an existing returns agreement, and Albania being a signatory to the European convention on human rights.“So we will now begin the removal of families.

The plan is likely to be viewed as surrender in Kyiv.0:47Moment Russian missile strikes apartment block in Ukraine – videoThe two men have formed an important but unofficial backchannel between Moscow and Washington, and it was unclear whether the Trump administration had formally backed the plan.The Financial Times and Reuters reported that the proposal would require Ukraine to cede territory it controls in the east of the country and halve the size of its military, conditions that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has in the past called non-starters. Other conditions include limiting US military assistance and categories of armaments used by the Ukrainian military.The existence of the 28-point plan, which appears to be inspired by a similar proposal the Trump administration developed to end the war in Gaza, was first reported by Axios. The White House did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for more detail on the proposal.Washington has repeatedly suggested that it is close to a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but the proposals have failed because they would have granted Russia most of its demands while requiring Kyiv to make painful concessions.On Wednesday night, US secretary of state Marco Rubio appeared to respond to reports of the plan by saying that a durable peace would require “both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions.”“That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict,” Rubio wrote on X.The leaked reports came as Russia launched a massive attack in western Ukraine targeting several multi-storey buildings in the city of Ternopil, as well as energy facilities in Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv. Russia is engaged in a systematic campaign to destroy Ukraine’s civilian power infrastructure ahead of winter.View image in fullscreenFirefighters tackle a blaze caused by a Russian strike on Lviv.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOleg Hrytsyshyn, who lives on the sixth floor of one of the damaged apartment blocks in Ternopil,said that the smoke instantly cut off evacuation routes, leaving him trapped in his home.“There were several loud explosions. When I tried to get dressed, there was thick black smoke in the entrance. It was burning,” he said. “It was impossible to get out, although I tried twice. The windows in the apartment were not broken. I knocked on the neighbors’ doors but no one answered.”The man was rescued and doctors treated him for high blood pressure.Avideo clip on social mediaappeared to show the moment a missile hit the building.Ukraine’s interior ministry said 25 people, including three children, had been killed in the strike, with another 73 injured, among them 15 children.A witness, Yaroslav Teslyuk,said the strike happened at about 5.30am, when most people were asleep.“I heard a loud rumble. It was followed by the noise of ‘shaheeds’ and several more rockets, and then explosions,” he said. “A fire started. I was told some people burned alive in their apartments because the strike happened when everyone was still asleep. The bodies were covered up. Some have already been taken away.”Zelenskyy, who met the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Wednesday in what he described as an effort to “reinvigorate negotiations” and secure a “just peace” for Ukraine, urged Kyiv’s allies to intensify pressure on Russia to end its nearly four-year invasion, including by providing more air-defence missiles.View image in fullscreenRecep Tayyip Erdoğan greets Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ankara.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“Every brazen attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “Effective sanctions and assistance to Ukraine can change this.”Potential peace talks have largely stalled in recent months as a result of Russia’s maximalist demands. Zelenskyy is expected to meet a senior delegation of US military officials on Thursday.The US army secretary, Daniel Driscoll, arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday to hold talks with Ukrainian officials and “discuss efforts to end the war,” the US Embassy said in a statement.Kyiv and Moscow have not held direct negotiations since the summer, and efforts to revive a diplomatic track have largely frozen since the last meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.Despite Kremlin claims that it is open to talks on ending the war, Moscow has shown no willingness to scale back its far-reaching demands.Zelenskyy finds himself in an increasingly difficult position at home and on the battlefield. Russian forces have recently advanced into the strategically important city of Pokrovsk and are pressing forward elsewhere along the front, while a widening corruption scandal in the energy sector has erupted into Ukraine’s most serious political crisis since the start of the war.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied on Wednesday that any significant progress had been made. “So far there are no innovations on this that can be reported to you,” he said.Russia’s foreign ministry also said it was unaware of any new US peace proposal. Its spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said Moscow had not received any draft agreement on Ukraine “of such a level” from Washington.“If the American side had come up with proposals, they would have been communicated through the established diplomatic channels between our two countries,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I have asked for an immediate investigation.”Italy has long tried to fight against the huge global market in “Italian-sounding” products – that is, food items that give the impression they are made in Italy when they are not.The own-label sauces Lollobrigida referred to are sold by the Belgian supermarket chain Delhaize and have an Italian flag on their packaging.Under EU regulations, a food product could be deemed to be misleading consumers if its labelling distorts its actual country of origin.Reports in Brusselssaid the sauces were not claimed to be made in Italy and did include Italian ingredients. The Guardian has asked Delhaize to comment.The episode comes as Italy eagerly awaits the outcome of its application for Italian cuisine to be included in Unesco’s intangible cultural heritage list. A decision is expected in early December.Italy’s biggest agribusiness association, Coldiretti, said the “scandal of fake Italian products” cost the country €120bn (£106bn) a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Christie’s described the machines as “nothing less than the first attempt in history to substitute the work of a machine for that of the human mind”.Pascal developed the instruments, the first attempt to “mechanise mental calculation”, to simplify the work of his father, who was in charge of a court tasked with restoring order to tax revenue collections in northern France, Christie’s said.View image in fullscreenLa Pascaline was invented by Blaise Pascal, the French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer and Catholic philosopher, when he was 19.Photograph: Geille c.1845/AlamyThe philosopher devised several models, each using different units for a specific purpose, such as calculating decimals, commercial transactions or taxes. This one, for surveyors, calculates in units of measurement including feet, inches and fathoms.The group of eminent scientists and researchers, including the 2021 Nobel physics laureate Giorgio Parisi, asked the administrative court last week to block La Pascaline’s potential export, arguing it should be classified a “national treasure” and remain in France.La Pascaline was “the origin of modern computing” and had made France “the cradle of the computing adventure: a revolution that transformed our understanding of the world”, they said inan impassioned op-ed published by Le Monde.It was “one of the key jewels in France’s intellectual and technological heritage”, they said, accusing the state of committing an “astounding blunder” in granting Christie’s export authorisation rather than giving French institutions time to mount a bid.“What a sad admission of disinterest in our scientific heritage,” the scientists wrote. “What a misunderstanding of Pascal, engineer, mathematician, philosopher, writer, a personality like no other, whose 400th birth anniversary we celebrated in 2023.”The fact that five Pascalines were already in French public collections – the other two are in Germany – did not diminish this one, they said, because all have their own characteristics and this one was little known to the scientific community.“It is vital that it enter a public collection so that it can be studied,” they added, describing La Pascaline as “a shining symbol of a unique alliance of history, science and technology” that reflected “a philosophy of learning that honours France”.The culture ministry said an export certificate had been issued last May following standard procedures, with two experts – one from the National Centre of Arts and Crafts and the other from the Louvre museum – approving the decision.Explore more on these topicsFranceMathematicsEuropeParisHistory of sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

Two years later, the charges were reduced to so-called “cyber crimes” and he was sentenced to a 30-year ban on leavingSaudi Arabia.The announcement that Almadi, a dual citizen and retired engineer who had lived in the US since the 1970s, would be free to leave the country came after the US president delivered a speech touting US-Saudi ties, including arms sales and investment deals, during a second day of public events in Washington.“Our family is overjoyed that, after four long years, our father, Saad Almadi, is finally on his way home to the United States!” the Almadi family said in a statement.“This day would not have been possible without PresidentDonald Trumpand the tireless efforts of his administration. We are deeply grateful to Dr Sebastian Gorka and the team at the national security council, as well as everyone at the state department,” it added.The statement by Almadi’s son, Ibrahim Almadi, also thanked various non-profit organizations, including the James Foley Fund and Hostages America, and House speaker Mike Johnson for supporting the elder Almadi’s cause.He later posted on Xthat his father was on his way to the US.Almadi is one of a handful of American dual citizens facing exit bans from Saudi Arabia following a crackdown on online dissent. His son has previously claimed that Almadi was pressured to sign papers renouncing his US citizenship.The case against Almadi centered on social media posts in which he was alleged to have urged Saudi citizens to seek Lebanese citizenship and faulted the kingdom’s defenses against Houthi rocket strikes.More controversially he expressed approval for the renaming of a street in the US capital afterJamal Khashoggi, the journalist and Washington Post columnist killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.US intelligence reports released by the Biden administration later assessed that the crown princehad approvedof a plan to “capture or kill” Khashoggi.Asked about the killing on Tuesday, Trump said the crown prince “knew nothing” of Khashoggi’s kiling. The Saudi crown prince has denied any wrongdoing. He said at the White House that Saudi Arabia “did all the right things” to investigate Khashoggi’s death, which he called “painful” and a “huge mistake”.US pressure to release Almadi and allow him to return to the US has been building since Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia in May. Many appealed to Trump claim that he is uniquely successful in repatriating US citizens detained overseas.When asked by a reporter in May about the case, Trump said he didn’t know about it but promised to take a look. A few weeks later, one of his national security aides, Gorka, met the younger Almadi at the White House.Johnson also met Almadi’s son. Johnson said: “President Trump is the president of deals and he loves to do business with the Saudis and we will win your father back.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policySaudi ArabiaUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaMohammed bin SalmanJamal KhashoggiDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The use of cluster munitions is widely banned as up to 40% of submunitions do not explode upon impact, posing a danger to civilians who might later stumble upon them and be killed when they explode.To date, 124 states have joinedthe convention on cluster munitions, which forbids their use, production and transfer. Israel is not a party to the convention and is not bound by it.“We believe the use of cluster munitions is always in conflict with a military’s duty to respect international humanitarian law because of their indiscriminate nature at time of use and afterwards,” said Tamar Gabelnick, the director of theCluster Munition Coalition. “Their wide area impact means they cannot distinguish between military and civilian targets and the cluster munition remnants kill and maim civilians for decades after use.”The Israeli military neither confirmed nor denied its use of cluster munitions but said it “uses only lawful weapons, in accordance with international law and while mitigating harm to civilians”.Israel’s war with Hezbollah which started in October 2023 and killed almost 4,000 people in Lebanon and about 120 people in Israel, left the Lebanese militant group devastated. Much of Lebanon’s south remains in ruins and Israelstill carries outnear-dailyairstrikes in the country, despite a ceasefiresigned last year.Lebanon in particular has a painful history with cluster munitions. Israel blanketed Lebanon with 4m cluster bombs in the final days of the 2006 war, with an estimated 1m failing to explode. The presence of unexploded cluster bombs continues to make life in south Lebanon dangerous, with more than 400 people killed by unexploded bomblets since 2006.The huge number of unexploded cluster bombs in Lebanon was a main driving factor for the drafting of the cluster convention in 2008.Despite not being a party to the convention, Israeli officials condemned Iran’s use of cluster munitions in Israel during this summer’s12-day war. “The terror regime seeks to harm civilians and even used weapons with wide dispersal in order to maximise the scope of damage,” said the Israeli military spokesperson, Brig Gen Effie Defrin, after an Iranian strike used cluster munitions in populated areas in southern Israel.Images of the remnants of the first cluster munition, a 155mm M999 Barak Eitan advanced anti-personnel munition produced by the defence contractor Elbit Systems in 2019, were verified by six different arms experts, including Brian Castner, the head of crisis research at Amnesty International, and NR Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, a technical intelligence consultancy specialising in arms and munitions analysis.Elbit Systems did not respond to a request for a comment.Each M999 artillery shell releases nine submunitions which explode into 1,200 tungsten shards, according to aUS army primeron the weapon.View image in fullscreenThe second munition’s remnants were said by two analysts to be from a Ra’am Eitan guided missile. The yellow diamond markers indicate that the shell contains high-explosive submunitions.Photos of the second munition’s remnants were identified as a cluster bomb by five different arms experts, though most were unable to identify the exact model owing to a lack of open-source materials on this specific rocket.Jenzen-Jones and a separate weapons analyst said the weapon was a 227mm Ra’am Eitan guided missile, a new type of cluster munition developed by Elbit Systems. This specific shell was produced in 2017, evidenced by its lot code.Israeli mediadescribedthe Ra’am Eitan as guided missiles that hold 64 bomblets each, which “scatter in a large radius and kill everyone present”. According to apress releaseby the IDF in February 2024, Israeli troops operating on the country’s northern border were equipped with the Ra’am Eitan in preparation for a fight with Hezbollah.The legality of cluster munition usage for non-signatory countries is dependent on the circumstances of the strikes they were used in, as well as the intentions of the military personnel involved in their use. The Guardian does not have information about the strikes the shells were used in, as the remnants were found after the fact.The remnants were found in heavily forested valleys in south Lebanon, which Israel accusedHezbollahof exploiting during the war to provide cover from aerial bombing and surveillance.Cluster munitions, due to their wide spread, could be useful against soldiers spread out across large, wooded areas. US forces used cluster munitions in a similar way in Vietnam, carpeting dense jungles where Vietcong soldiers were located.According to Israeli media reports, both of the cluster munitions found had been developed in recent years to leave fewer unexploded munitions behind, with claims that the Ra’am Eitan had a“dud rate” of 0.01%. Israel developed the munitions after its use of cluster bombs in the 2006 Lebanon war triggered outrage abroad and at home – seeking a way to continue using cluster bombs while minimising civilian harm.Gabelnick and other arms experts warned that dud rates advertised by arms companies were often many times higher in the field. Israel Military Industriesclaimeda 0.06% dud rate for the M85 cluster munition used in the 2006 war; lateranalysissuggested the rate was about 10%.Human rights groups have said that it is impossible for cluster munitions to be used in a way that minimises harms to civilians.“Cluster munitions are banned internationally for a reason. They are inherently indiscriminate and there is no way to employ them lawfully or responsibly, and civilians bear the brunt of the risk as these weapons stay deadly for decades to come,” said Castner.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

One teenager, Devonte Cantrill, 19, committed the fatal stabbing, butseven defendants were convicted of murder, and four of manslaughter, under the“joint enterprise” law.Lawyers for the men argued in their 2023 application to the CCRC that the “gang narrative” advanced at the trial was based on racist stereotypes of black boys and young men, and that the convictionsresulted from “institutional racism”by the police, prosecution and judge.The GreaterManchesterpolice (GMP) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) presented a rap music video and selected images from the defendants’ mobile phones as evidence that they were members of a the gang called Active Only, or AO. The judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, directed the jury that they could infer gang “membership or allegiance” if a defendant had the rap video on their mobile phone.Joint enterprise holds all participants in a violent incident, however minor their individual actions, equally guilty if they are found to have intentionally “encouraged and assisted” a person to commit the most serious violence. Accusing people involved in an incident of disorder of being gang members can be crucial to establishing a joint enterprise charge, as it alleges that all had a common motive.A series ofreviews and academic researchhas found that black boys and young men are disproportionately portrayed as being in gangs and subjected to joint enterprise prosecutions.The Moss Side defendants were accused of being members of AO and to have collectively killed Hafidah because he was a member of a rival gang who strayed into their area. The rap video, in which some of the defendants participated, was portrayed in the trial and referred to by Openshaw as a “gang video”.In 2021, the Guardian reported that the video wasrecorded at a local youth centre, which was publicly funded, and that GMP supported initiatives there. Young people, including some of the defendants, took part in activities that included being encouraged to make rap music as a constructive activity.No criminal activity such as drug dealing was alleged to have been carried out by the AO gang, five of the 11 convicted had no criminal records and Openshaw said three other teenagers’ minor convictions were not relevant. Most were studying at college and had good character references. The men and their families have always argued they were not in a gang and did not intend that Hafidah be killed.The application to the CCRC, submitted in 2023 by Keir Monteith KC and Darrell Ennis-Gayle of solicitors Hodge Jones and Allen, argued “there was no violent criminal gang by the name of AO”, and that the convictions are a “gross miscarriage of justice” influenced by institutional racism.Lucy Powell, deputy leader of the Labour party, MP for the constituency in which Hafidah was killed, supported the application to the CCRC. She has repeatedlycriticised the joint enterprise prosecution, saying that gang narratives “seem to be more effectively deployed against young black men from places like Moss Side where underlying preconceptions and prejudices come into play”.The CCRC said the new evidence and arguments presented on behalf of Goodall, Walters and Wilson “undermine the ‘gang narrative’ relied on by the prosecution at trial”. “There is a real possibility the court of appeal will find the fresh evidence materially undermines the prosecution case,” it said.The CCRC chair, Dame Vera Baird KC, said: “This referral highlights the need for safeguards to protect defendants against the risk of unfairness from a too readily adopted gang narrative, based on inappropriate labelling.“It is possible that there are other cases which would benefit from guidance on this issue, where the fear may be that stereotypes can be wrongly introduced as evidence.”Monteith said he hoped the court of appeal would reach a decision by the end of next year at the latest.“The use of joint enterprise laws and gang narratives by the CPS has resulted in too many racist miscarriages of justice,” he said, arguing the system needs urgent reform. “These prosecution tactics are overwhelmingly targeted at young black men and reinforce harmful racial stereotypes that undermine trust in our justice system for racialised and marginalised communities.”Ennis-Gayle said: “The CCRC decision reflects what we have been arguing for five years: that our clients were convicted because of the colour of their skin.”A CPS spokesperson said: “We note today’s CCRC referral and will carefully consider our next steps.”Mary Goodall, Durrell’s mother, said of the CCRC referral: “This is amazing news we have been waiting a long time for. There is still a long way to go for our boys to get justice and for us to get them home, but this is a step in the right direction: they are innocent.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterCourt of appealCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Some people wavering over whether to back Reform candidates at the ballot box next year in Wales may be put off by Jones’s exclusion.It comes four weeks after Reform’s hopes of winning theCaerphilly byelectionwere dashed by Plaid Cymru. The loss there was seen as a rejection by many voters of Reform’santi-immigration stancein a country that has long prided itself on being welcoming to newcomers.Jones’s suspension follows an investigation by theSenedd’s standards commissioner, Douglas Bain.Areportby the Senedd’s standards of conduct committee said Bain found that, in August 2023, Jones posted a racist slur about Chinese spies in a WhatsApp group.The report said: “At that time there was public concern about the use of TikTok by the Chinese government to gather information.”According to the report, in another WhatsApp exchange involving Jones in November 2023, a member of her staff posted the message: “Suella [Braverman, the former UK home secretary] was correct. We have two-tier policing. It was clear over the weekend if your [sic] white working class, you get hammered, if you’re an Islamist it’s all fine, spew all the hate you want.”Around that time, Braverman wascriticising a banon a marchby the UK Independence party in Whitechapel, east London.The report said Jones had accepted this post was unacceptable but at the time did not reprimand the staff member.The standards of conduct committee concluded: “The conduct found in this report fell far below the standards expected. It points to an office culture where there was little respect towards others or any consideration of what may be found offensive.”Jones was cleared of complaints relating to making false expenses claims.Addressing the Senedd before her suspension, Jones apologised for the language she used. “I never meant to cause any offence,” she said.Jones added that the process – and leaks about it to the press – have had a negative impact on her family and her own health. She said she had nearly taken her own life.After the report was released last week, a Reform UKWalesspokesperson said: “Laura has rightly apologised for her comments, made in a private WhatsApp.”A Plaid Cymru spokesperson called Jones’s “vile and completely unacceptable”. They said: “The fact that Reform accepted the member’s defection tells us everything you need to know about the party, whose divided rhetoric only serves to pit our communities against each other.”A Welsh Labour spokesperson said: “She made these comments when she was a Conservative, but we’ve seen in Caerphilly that the same sort of language is part of the Reform UK playbook.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKWelsh politicsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Anxiety over billions in investment in artificial intelligence pervaded, in part because the US has been starved of reliable economic data by the recent government shutdown.Investors hoped that both questions would be in part answered by Nvidia’s earnings and by a jobs report due on Thursday morning.“This is a ‘So goes Nvidia, so goes the market’ kind of report,” Scott Martin, chief investment officer at Kingsview Wealth Management,told Bloombergin a concise summary of market sentiment.The prospect of a market mood swing had built in advance of the earnings call, with options markets anticipating Nvidia’s shares could move 6%, or $280bn in value, up or down. Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI’s chief equities strategist,told the Financial Timesthat “angst around ‘peak AI’ has been palpable”.The anxiety has only been heightened by signs that some AI players, including Palantir’s Peter Thiel, Japanese investor Masayoshi of SoftBank have recently sold off multi-billion positions in Nvidia if only (in the case of Softbank) to place those funds in OpenAI. Michael Burry, who became a legend on Wall Street for taking a short position ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, announced that he was shorting Nvidia and Palantir stock – and warned of an AI bubble – before abruptly winding down his investment company, Scion Asset Management.Analysts had expected the chip behemoth to show more than 50% growth in both net income and revenue in its fiscal third quarter as the tech giants – Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta – that represent more than 40% of Nvidia’s sales continue to pour billions into the chipmaker.The company reported growth beyond even those lofty expectations. Nvidia reported $57.01bn in total revenues, beating investor expectations of $54.9bn in revenue. Sales increased 62% year-over-year, and profit rose 65% year-on-year to $31.9bn. On the key metric of data-center sales,the company reported $51.2bn in revenue, beating expectations of $49bn.Nvidia’s future looks bright, too. The company is projecting fourth-quarter revenue of around $65bn; analysts had predicted the company would issue a guidance of $61bn.CEO Jensen Huang addressed the elephant in the room on Wednesday’s earnings call after Nvidia’s stellar numbers were released.“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” he said. “From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI from pre-training to post-training to inference.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Investors have grown wary of the AI boom, with shares in Nvidia and Palantir, a major AI player, falling more than 10% since peaking last month.The Nasdaq stock exchange has seen a broad, panicked selloff over the past few days in response to these fears. Still, Nvidia shares are up about 37% for the year to date, and they rose in after-hours trading on Wednesday.The Nvidia earnings report, and investor reaction over the coming hours or days, will be read into for broader economic signals because AI is now intimately tied, correctly or falsely, to broader economic confidence, with Nvidia as the foundation for the entire artificial intelligence buildout.“Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout was a bubble and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management after the earnings report was released.For bullish analysts, fears that the AI revolution would soon follow the path of internet stocks in 1999 have been entirely overblown, and the AI party is only just getting started.“The largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real,” Zaccarelli added.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)NvidiaUS economyEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The experiment was conducted three separate times: once with 7.2% THC cannabis, once with 3.1% THC cannabis and once with 0.03% THC cannabis, which was considered a placebo.A major component of the study was the replication of a real-life bar, complete with dark lighting and drinks on tap.Jane Metrik, a professor of behavioral and social science at Brown University who led the study, stressed the importance of authenticity for participants,telling NPRthat “we wanted to make sure that when given the opportunity, you would be really driven to drink”.The results revealed that participants’ alcohol consumption fell by 19% after smoking cannabis with 3.1% THC. The drop was even more significant after smoking the higher-potency 7.2% THC cannabis – participants ended up drinking 27% less alcohol than the placebo.Expanded legalization efforts have led to a major surge in marijuana usage – its consumption has doubled over the past 10 years, according to a2024 Gallup survey. Alcohol consumption is ata record low, with many turning to alternatives such as weed. Of the participants in the Brown trial, however, 40% met the criteria for alcohol use disorder.While cannabis could serve as a potential solution to heavy drinking, Metrik acknowledged that there is still more research to be done.“We’re not ready to tell people seeking treatment for alcohol, ‘Go ahead and substitute cannabis, and it will work out for you,’” she said.Explore more on these topicsCannabisAlcoholAlcoholismMedical researchCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

And it’s hard for any storyline to break through the administration’s “flood the zone” strategy, much less one like this. Nothing seems to stick. But the “quiet, piggy” clip has taken off, several days after the admonishment occurred on Air Force One last Friday, and without much help from the media itself.“I don’t know why the ‘Piggy’ thing is bothering me so much,” wrote Hank Green, a YouTuber and author. “It’s one more unforgivable thing in a list of 20,000 unforgivable things, but I’ve been mad about it for like 12 straight hours.”Trump is going through a string of losses: Democrats dominating in off-year elections, having to reverse course on the Epstein files, Republicans refusing to get rid of the filibuster to end the shutdown, a faltering economy. There’s a possibility that he’s losing his air of impenetrability, and his grip on the right could maybe, just maybe, be loosening.The anger he displayed in the clip could be a sign of someone on the back foot, overreacting to a question Bloomberg correspondent Catherine Lucey was asking about why Trump was fighting against releasing the Epstein files “if there’s nothing incriminating in the files”. The files related to the child sexual abuser released so far by Congress show that Epstein communicated regularly, and derogatorily, about women with a host of prominent friends.0:19Trump tells reporter 'quiet piggy' after Epstein question – videoLashing out at a female reporter with a derogatory insult amid a news cycle dominated by politicians splitting hairs over a man who ran a sex-trafficking outfit – it was pretty on the nose.But the clip also pinged around the internet in the same news cycle as Trump telling another female reporter it was rude to ask Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist whom the CIA determined was killed at the direction of the crown prince.“You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,” Trump said of Khashoggi, responding to a question from ABC News’s Mary Bruce. “A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him, or didn’t like him, things happen. But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that. You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.”The combined force of two outbursts at female journalists in a single news cycle – for asking about a child sexual abuser and a murdered colleague – went beyond the standard-fare Trumpian attacks on the media.Part of the collective ire could be that no one in the press gaggle jumped to Lucey’s defense in the video, underlining that those attacked by Trump often stand alone while others fear becoming next on his list; the media backbone that stiffened in his first term has wilted, under exhaustion and at the hands of Trump-friendly owners, in his second. The condemnations of Trump and accolades for both journalists came after the fact.“These incidents are not isolated; they are part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility – often directed at women – that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press,” the Society of Professional Journalists said in astatementWednesday.The White House, meanwhile, has doubled down on the comment, saying Lucey had “behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way towards her colleagues on the plane”, providing no details on what that meant. “If you’re going to give it, you have to be able to take,” they said.Beyond the clip’s power to outrage, though, is a sign that the leftwing media ecosystem and its creators are starting to command attention and elevate stories that media outlets aren’t jumping on.BBC should not pay Trump any money, says former director general Tony HallRead moreAs Democratic digital strategist Parker Butler pointed out on X, the “quiet, piggy” clip grabbed millions of views on online accounts four days after it happened, saying: “It got almost NO coverage when he said it … A viral post can shape an entire news cycle.”And some Democrats who’ve taken the strategy of being Trump back to Trump, including California governorGavin Newsom’s press office, are using the clip to bully the president back, Photoshopping Trump’s face onto pigs and repeatedly tweeting “quiet, piggy”.In Trump 2.0, you never know which affronts to decency will stick in people’s minds. This one, though, has a symbolism that seems to be resonating.“Portland has reclaimed the frog as a symbol of its resistance to Trump’s efforts to militarize the city,” former US attorney and commentator Joyce Alene wrote on X. “Perhaps women should claim the glamorous, sassy Muppet Miss Piggy, a known diva with a fierce karate chop, as their own symbol.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGenderWomenUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

In sum, Huang said, there’s a major transformation happening in AI andNvidiais foundational to that transformation.“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” said Huang. “From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI from pre-training to post-training to inference.”Huang said that there are currently three huge platform shifts: a transition from general purpose computing to accelerated computing; a transition to generative AI and a transition to agentic and physical AI, eg robots or autonomous vehicles.“As you consider infrastructure investments, consider these three fundamental dynamics,” Huang said. “Each will contribute to infrastructural wealth. Nvidia … enables all three transitions and does so for any form or modality of AI.”Demand for the company’s chips continues to grow, Huang said.“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” said Huang in a press release. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference – each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast – with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”The company surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in nearly every regard, as it has for multiple quarters in a row, a sign that the financially enormous AI boom is not slowing down. Nvidia reported $1.30 in diluted earnings per share on $57.01bn in total revenues beating investor expectations of $1.26 in earnings per share on $54.9bn in revenue. Sales are up 62% year-over-year.The company reported $51.2bn in revenue from data-center sales, beating expectations of $49bn.The company is also projecting fourth- quarter revenue of around $65bn; analysts had predicted the company would issue a guidance of $61bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As investors worry that mounting CapEx will force companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is not optional, but rather the central need for every tech business in the world.”Analysts and experts said that although they were largely confident Nvidia would beat Wall Street expectations, they were anxiously awaiting the earnings call for morenews on the status of industry demand for the firm’s AI chips.“There is still no doubt that Nvidia is far and away the leader for AI-focused chips,” David Meier, senior analyst at investment websitethe Motley Fool, wrote. “So, I expect revenue, margins, and cash flows to be pretty close to analysts’ estimates. But the valuable information is more likely to come from the commentary about where management sees its markets headed, whether it’s in the AI market or [a] new market the company is currently pursuing.”Shares in Nvidia have been down 7.9% in November after major investors dumped their stocks in the firm. Peter Thiel’s hedge fund,Thiel Macro, sold off its entire stake in the chipmaker in the last quarter. His holdings would have been valued at about $100m, according to a Reuters report. Softbank has also sold off its $5.8bn holdings in the company, further boosting fears of an AI bubble.“I do not believe that Nvidia’s growth is sustainable long-term,” said Forrester’s senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. “AI demand is unprecedented, but if there is a market correction due to supply meeting demand or a slowdown in the pace of innovation/businesses getting used to the pace, I expect that the continued growth in Nvidia share value will slow down.”Explore more on these topicsNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)Quarterly resultsStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both sides have blamed the other.‘Red cup rebellion’: striking Starbucks baristas urge customers to stay awayRead moreProminent politicians includingZohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, have backed the striking workers.Why are Starbucks workers striking?Since 13 November, more than 1,000 Starbucks workers have been on strike in more than 40 cities across the US.The open-ended unfair labor practice strike was launched on Starbucks’ “red cup day”, which typically hails the start of the lucrative holiday trading season at the coffee chain.Starbucks and Starbucks Workers United, the union, have been bargaining over the chain’s first union contract. But these talks stalled over economic elements of the contract. Each side has blamed the other.Starbucks Workers United has also filed dozens of unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board throughout its organizing campaign, including one in December, alleging that the chain had failed to bargain in good faith, and undermined the representative status of the union.“I want Starbucks to succeed. My livelihood depends on it,” said Dachi Spoltore, a striking barista from Pittsburgh. “I know that Starbucks’ success has to include and prioritize people like me who make the coffee, open the stores and keep the customers coming back. We’re proud of our work, but we’re tired of being treated like we’re disposable.“That’s why we’re taking this major step. We’re confident and clear-eyed in what we need to win a contract and resolve the legal issues. We’re risking a lot: our jobs, our livelihoods, our economic security. This might be a game to Starbucks, but it isn’t a game for us.”How many Starbucks workers are in the union?Starbucks Workers United represents 11,000 baristas at more than 550 Starbucks stores. Its organizing drive has become of the highest-profile unionization efforts in a generation in the US.The first Starbucks storevotedto unionize, by 19 to 8, in Buffalo, New York, in December 2021, setting the stage for a wave of mobilization that swept hundreds more stores across the nation.Starbucks had actively fought unionization for decades, insisting its stores would operate best when executives at the company were able to work directly with its employees.During a US Senate committee hearing in March 2023, its longtime CEO Howard Schultz defended Starbucks’ response to the union organizing campaign andrespondedto allegations of union busting by saying: “These are allegations, and Starbucks has not broken the law.”What has Starbucks said about the strike?Starbucks has blamed the union for the lack of progress in negotiations and claimed the strike hasn’t affected operations.A spokesperson for Starbucks, Jaci Anderson, said: “Despite Workers United’s efforts to cause disruption, more than 99% of our coffeehouses remained open and our partners [employees] delivered the strongest Reusable Red Cup Day in company history building on the previous Thursday’s holiday launch which was the biggest sales day ever for the company.“We anticipate a bright holiday season and are eager to welcome customers to enjoy their favorite holiday beverage and sit and stay in one of our 17,000 locations across the US.”Anderson expressed disappointment “that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table”, adding: “When they’re ready to come back, we’re ready to talk.”Any contract “needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners”, she said.What’s going on at Starbucks?Starbucks is under pressure to turn its business around.In October, the coffee chain issued a press release declaring that it had delivered sales growth for the first time in seven quarters. That growth was just 1%.A sharp rise in coffee prices and softening demand have hit the firm. Its shares have fallen 10% so far this year.It has also reshuffled its top ranks several times in recent years. Schultz, who built Starbucks over several decades as CEO, abruptly returned to the role in 2022 after initially stepping down years earlier. He was succeeded by Laxman Narasimhan the following year, who was ousted after 16 months and replaced by Brian Niccol, former CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill.Niccol has pledged to revive the chain’s fortunes,unveilingjobcutsand store closures as part of an internal plan dubbed “Back to Starbucks”.What’s the latest on the strike?Starbucks Workers United claims most of the 65 stores hit by the action have been forced to close due to insufficient staffing. The action is taking place across more than 40 cities.The union is threatening to escalate the campaign, dubbed “no contract, no coffee”, by adding more stores if they don’t receive new proposals and make progress with Starbucks in contract negotiations.About 92% of Starbucks Workers United members voted to authorize an open-ended unfair labor practices strike, according to the union. “Union baristas are prepared to make this the largest, and longest strike in company history during the critical holiday season,” it said in a November memo.Why are politicians getting involved?Ahead of the strike, a wave of lawmakers –26 US senatorsand82 congressional representatives– signed letters to Niccol, the current Starbucks CEO, demanding that the company reach a contract with the union. No Republicans signed either letter.New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani also weighed in. “Starbucks workers across the country are on an Unfair Labor Practices strike, fighting for a fair contract,” hewroteon social media. “While workers are on strike, I won’t be buying any Starbucks, and I’m asking you to join us.”Katie Wilson, mayor-elect of Seattle, where Starbucks is based, also made a similar call. “I am not buying Starbucks and you should not either,” she said at a Starbucks Workers Unitedrally, shortly after winning the close mayoral race. “Baristas are the heart and soul of this company, and they deserve better than empty promises and corporate union busting.“This is your home town, and mine. Seattle is making some changes right now. And I urge you to do the right thing.”Explore more on these topicsStarbucksUS unionsFood & drink industryCoffeeZohran MamdaniexplainersShareReuse this content"

A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provokingChina. The discussions have not been previously reported.Trump aides are taking their time on chip tariffs as they work to avoid a rupture with Beijing over trade issues, which would risk a return to a tit-for-tat trade war and disruption of the flow of critical rare earth minerals, according to two of the people.Trump’s focus on race backfires as voters punish economic failingsRead moreThose people cautioned that no decision is final until the administration signs off on it, and also said that triple-digit tariffs could be imposed at any time. The sources spoke anonymously in order to recount private conversations about policy deliberations. Trump said in August that the United States would impose a tariff of about 100% on imports of semiconductors but exempted companies that are manufacturing in the US or have committed to do so. Privately, over the last several months, Washington officials had told people that the administration would roll out the tariffs soon. That guidance has now changed as the administration has continued to debate the timing and other details.A White House official and a commerce department official, asked about the discussions, disputed that the administration had adjusted its posture.“That is not true,” the White House official said, without specifying what was incorrect. “The administration remains committed to reshoring manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security.” The commerce official said: “There is no change in department policy regarding semiconductor 232 tariffs.” Neither one specified how soon tariffs that have been threatened since the early days of the Trump administration would be finalized, nor did they offer any other details.Any decision by the administration to slow down or narrow the scope of chip tariffs would come at a sensitive time for Trump. The Republican president is facing growing consumer angst over prices heading into the holiday shopping season.Hiking taxes on imported semiconductors could raise consumer costs on the gadgets they power, from refrigerators to smartphones. Reuters reported in September that the Trump administration was looking at a plan that would also tax foreign electronic devices based on the number of chips in each one. Trump rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products last week, but he has also said that his import taxes have made no significant contribution to inflation.The US government shutdown has delayed recent data on consumer prices, but inflation has been running above the Federal Reserve’s target since former president Joe Biden held office. Trump is also trying to maintain a delicate trade truce with China, a top manufacturer of both semiconductors and devices powered by them. Last month, Trump met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Busan, South Korea, and reached an agreement to set aside their trade issues, for now.During those conversations in Korea, US officials nonetheless warned their Chinese counterparts that they could take national security steps in the coming months that Beijing might find objectionable, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Trump has bet that tariffs can revive domestic factory jobs lost over decades to countries including China.In April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of an effort to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsInflationDonald TrumpEconomicsChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Chinese officials reportedly said Wednesday’s decision was related to a need to further monitor the water source, but it has been widely received as part of China’s retaliatory measures amid adeepening diplomatic row with Japan.At a regular press briefing on Wednesday afternoon, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Japan had “failed to provide the technical documentation it committed to”.“I would also like to emphasise that due to [Japanese] prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s recent actions that go against the tide and her erroneous remarks on major issues such as Taiwan, which have triggered strong public outrage inChina, there would be no market for Japanese seafood in the current climate even if Japan were able to export it to China.”Before the 2023 ban, the Chinese market – including Hong Kong – accounted for more than one-fifth of Japan’s exports.The spat started after Takaichi told her country’s parliament earlier this month that Japan could become militarily involved if China attacked Taiwan, because it would be a threat to Japan’s existence.Beijing claims Taiwan is a Chinese province and has vowed to annex it, with military force if it cannot coerce or convince Taiwan to accept what it calls “reunification”.Takaichi had been asked what would trigger Japan’s 2015 “collective self-defence” laws, which give exceptions for Japan’s postwar ban on using force to settle international disputes.The remarks infuriated Beijing, which has repeatedly demanded Takaichi retract her comments, accusing her of issuing a “military threat” against China, and of pursuing a “revival” of Japan’s prewar militarism.Takaichi has not withdrawn her comments, although her government has said Japan’s self-defence policy has not changed. Earlier this week, she sent a high-ranking foreign ministry official to Beijing for talks, but they did not appear to lower tensions.China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Takaichi’s remarks “caused fundamental damage to the political foundation of China-Japan relations”.The reported seafood ban comes amid a swathe ofrhetorical, symbolic, and economic retaliations.Over the weekend, China sent a coastguard fleet through the disputed waters around the Senkaku Islands and military drones past Japan’s most westerly territory, Yonaguni Island, close to Taiwan’s east coast.After China issued a travel warning to tourists and students planning to visit Japan, almost a dozen airlines offered refunds to passengers and about 500,000 people were estimated to have cancelled flights. Shares in Japanese retail and tourism companiesfell sharply on Monday. State-owned enterprises, including Chinese banks, have also reportedly told staff not to travel to Japan.Japanese film releases have also been suspended and numerous cross-cultural events have been cancelled. On Tuesday, China’s permanent representative to the UN, Fu Cong, told a forum that Japan was “totally unqualified” for a permanent seat on the UN security council, citing Takaichi’s remarks.Additional reporting by Lillian YangQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The Union said in a statement to the Guardian that they have placed Tanner on administrative leave. The move comes a day after the Guardian publishedan investigation into Tanner’s conduct.Tanner had previously been under investigation byMLSafter the league received a complaint from the MLS Players Association in late January. In it, the MLSPA outlined a wide range of alleged issues surrounding Tanner, which included the use of racist, sexist and homophobic language and instances of inappropriate physical contact with a staff member.Tanner denied the allegations in the Guardian’s original report, and reiterated his denial in a new statement issued by his legal representatives after this story was published on Wednesday.“I continue to firmly deny these accusations,” Tanner wrote. “My priority is the team, the employees, and thePhiladelphia Unioncommunity, particularly at this important time when the team has the opportunity to continue to excel in the playoffs. I will cooperate fully with the League’s investigation as I work to clear my good name and reputation.”The Guardian’s investigation outlined six of the MLSPA’s eight allegations against Tanner for which supporting evidence could be found, plus other claims. The investigation involved interviews with 17 subjects as well as the review of materials that supported several of the claims against Tanner.Together, the allegations span the bulk of Tanner’s seven-year tenure in Philadelphia. Tanner told the Guardian through his legal representation that he “firmly denies these accusations, some of which are six or seven years old.”MLS had concluded its investigation in September after being unable to corroborate the allegations against Tanner, but told the Guardian it reserved the right to reopen it should new evidence be presented.“MLS recently concluded an investigation into allegations raised by the MLS Players Association, which the MLSPA noted had not been independently verified,” MLS said in a statement to the Guardian. “Following publication of a Guardian article that included new allegations and potentially new information, MLS will reopen the investigation. MLS maintains an anonymous reporting hotline and encourages anyone with relevant information to come forward.”“While a recent MLS investigation was unable to corroborate allegations involving Sporting Director Ernst Tanner,” the Union said in their own statement, “MLS has advised the Union that it will be reopening the investigation and the Union continues to cooperate fully. The Union has placed Mr Tanner on administrative leave during the investigation. Throughout this process, our top priority remains the well-being of our players, fans, staff, and community.”In summary, the claims reported by the Guardian allege that Tanner:Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”Directed a homophobic slur at an MLS referee in 2023Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.In its initial investigation into the allegations against Tanner, MLS reached out to 13 potential interview subjects, promising them anonymity if needed. Eight of those 13 subjects, who the Guardian understands to be current and former players and employees of the Philadelphia Union, chose to speak with the league. The Union “fully cooperated” with the investigation, according to a club statement released earlier this week.Despite not being able to corroborate the allegations against Tanner, the league said in a statement that they required him to participate in a “structured remedial program focused on professional workplace conduct.”Tanner also underwent training on appropriate workplace conduct early on in his tenure with the club, the Union said in their statement, after he was found to have made “potentially insensitive gender-based comments,” though the club did not specify what those comments were.Tanner is amongst the most widely-respected executives in MLS history. During his seven-year tenure, the club won its first two trophies (the 2022 and 2025 Supporters’ Shield, awarded to the team with the highest point total in the league), and they’ve regularly produced players that feature on the US national team. The Union’s academy, which Tanner helps oversee, has produced multiple players that have generated seven-figure transfer fees for the club. In 2022, Tanner was the league’s executive of the year.The Union are presently in the midst of the MLS playoffs and will face NYC FC in the Eastern Conference semifinals on Sunday evening.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsPhiladelphia UnionShareReuse this content"

The NHL moved its package to ESPN in 2021.NBC, which celebrates its 100th anniversary next year, has a long history with baseball, albeit not much recently. The network carried games from 1939 through 1989. It was part of the short-lived Baseball Network with ABC in 1994 and ’95 and then aired playoff games from 1996 through 2000.Its first game will be on 26 March when the defending two-time champion Los Angeles Dodgers host the Arizona Diamondbacks.The 25 Sunday night games will air mostly on NBC with the rest on the new NBC Sports Network. All will stream on Peacock.The first Sunday Night Baseball game on NBC will be 12 April with the next one in May after the NBA playoffs.The addition of baseball games gives NBC a year-around night of sports on Sunday nights. It has had NFL games on Sunday night since 2006 and will debut an NBA Sunday night slate in February.NBC will also have a prime-time game on Labor Day night.The Sunday early-afternoon games also return to Peacock, which had them in 2022 and ’23. The early-afternoon games will lead into a studio Whip-Around Show before the Sunday night game.NBC/Peacock will also do the Major League Futures game during All-Star week and coverage of the first round of the MLB amateur draft.Netflix’s baseball deals are in alignment with its strategy of going for big events in a major sport. The streamer will have an NFL Christmas doubleheader this season for the second straight year.Besides the Home Run Derby, Netflix will have the first game of the season on 25 March when three-time AL MVP Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees visit the San Francisco Giants. It also has the Home Run Derby and MLB at Field of Dreams in Dyersville, Iowa, on 13 August when Minnesota face Philadelphia. Netflix will stream an MLB special event game each year.The negotiations around the other deals were complicated due to the fact that MLB was also trying not to slight two of its other rights holders. MLB receives an average of $729m from Fox and $470m from Turner Sports per year under deals which expire after the 2028 season.Fox’s Saturday nights have been mainly sports the past couple years with a mix of baseball, college football, college basketball and motorsports.Apple TV has had Friday Night Baseball since 2022.The deals also set up Manfred for future negotiations. He would like to see MLB take a more national approach to its rights instead of a large percentage of its games being on regional sports networks.Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballESPNNetflixTelevision industryUS sportsUS television industryShareReuse this content"

And again, that’s what gives me comfort, that he feels like that and he’s talking that way.”New York police released surveillance images Monday of a man sought in the shooting of Boyd. A motive for the shooting remains under investigation and authorities said it’s not clear if Boyd was targeted by the shooter. No other injuries were reported.The shooting happened just after 2am on Sunday about halfway between Madison Square Garden and Times Square. Boyd, 29, was taken to Bellevue Hospital after being shot in the abdomen, police said. The shooter fled the scene.Glenn said Boyd has been on his mind “a ton” since he heard about the shooting. The coach said Boyd and his wife recently welcomed a baby.“The first thing I thought about, he just had a kid,” Glenn said. “And I’m thinking about his wife, I’m thinking about his kid and I want to make sure that he’s OK. And that’s the only thing that really went through my mind.“There’s a process to this, which I won’t get into, but I’m happy at the fact that he’s going to come out of this thing really, really well.”Boyd hasn’t played this season, his first with the Jets, after going on the season-ending injured reserve list on 18 August with a shoulder injury that required surgery to repair.He signed with New York as a free agent in March and was expected to be a key part of a revamped special teams unit under Glenn and special teams coordinator Chris Banjo. But Boyd was injured during a training camp practice on 2 August and carted from the field.Boyd has remained around the team throughout the season while recovering from the shoulder injury.“He’s been a part of what we’re doing,” Glenn said. “I mean, he comes to the games all the time. He’s fully engaged. To be one of the top special teams players in this league, he’s done a really good job of helping the other guys we have.”Boyd, a Texas native, played his first four seasons with Minnesota after being a seventh-round pick by the Vikings out of the University of Texas in 2019. He signed with the Arizona Cardinals in 2023 and then joined Houston’s practice squad later that season. Boyd signed a one-year contract worth $1.6m with the Jets in March.Explore more on these topicsNew York JetsGun crimeNFLNYPDShareReuse this content"

The NFL is very wrongMelissa JacobsThe New York Giants quarterback has become everyone’s favorite goofball. But it’s a jarring status given his historyWed 19 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 14.33 ESTShareHear the term “national treasure” and odds are you think of someone like Dolly Parton, Betty White, Simone Biles or Tom Hanks. They are comforting, widely admired and have uncontroversial histories.And then there’s Jameis Winston.To celebrate Winston getting the call as the New York Giants starting quarterback last weekend, the NFL created a hype video, splicing a bunch of his goofiest quotes during his meandering journey through various NFL teams. It also, somewhat dubiously, accompanied the video with a commentcalling him “a national treasure”.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThere was nothing in the video showcasing Winston’s insane arm talent or his fondness for throwing interceptions. It didn’t remind us of Winston’s historic 2019 season, in which he became the firstNFLplayer to throw 30 touchdowns and 30 picks in a season. And there was definitely no mention about the myriad issues in Winston’s past that automatically disqualify him from national treasure status.This is the same Winston who was accused of sexual assault while at Florida State (he was never charged over the allegations but didreach an out of court settlementin 2015). The same Winston who received a citationfor shoplifting crab legsat a Publix grocery store in 2014. The same Winston who allegedly groped an Uber driver (he wasn’t charged over those claims either butreached a settlement with the woman in 2018– None of Winston’s settlements contained an admission of liability). The same Winston who told a group of elementary students that boys should “stand up” and “be strong” and girls ought to be “silent, polite, and gentle” (he later apologized). And the same Winston who last year came to the fierce defense of Deshaun Watson. Yes,that Deshaun Watson, when he was his backup at the Cleveland Browns. “I’m grateful I had a chance to serve Deshaun, but I’m very upset with the reaction to a man that has the world against him for the past four years when he put his body and life on the line for this city every day,” Winston said.In case you need reminding, the world was “against” Watson because he was accused of sexual assaultby dozens of women(Watson never faced criminal charges over the allegations but the NFL suspended him for 11 games of the 2022 season after its own investigation. He alsoreached out of court settlementswith nearly two dozen of his accusers, without an admission of liability). The world was so against Watson, in fact, that the Browns gave him a fully guaranteed $230m contract.What makes the league’s praise of Winston so jarring is that the NFL itself has punished him in the past.It suspended himfor three games over the Uber allegations after its investigation “concluded that Winston violated the personal conduct policy by touching the driver in an inappropriate and sexual manner without her consent and that disciplinary action was necessary and appropriate.”I am not arguing that Winston shouldn’t have an NFL career. But you would think any player suspended by the NFL for anything in the sphere of sexual misconduct would automatically be disqualified from off-the-field adulation by the league. It should be noted that the NFL isn’t the only entity presenting Winston as a lovable goofball. This week, the Athletic praised his “carefree personality”.Sure, Winston is a personable, sometimes electric personality capable of compelling play. But a national treasure? C’mon NFL, unless the people running your social media are 12 and haven’t researched his history, they should know better.The NFL has history with this. Players like Tyreek Hill and Ben Roethlisberger have had fascinating careers, and been the subject of serious off-the-field accusations, and yet we have seen the NFL hype them up.There’s no denying Winston is a fan favorite. Scrolling through the comments on the national treasure post, one stuck out as representing the majority opinion.Jameis single-handedly could get me to go to church again. I don’t believe in god, but I do believe in Jameis.Do we really need a church of Jameis? Before we build one, how about examining Winston’s personal growth? During this past Sunday’s Falcons-Dolphins game, the broadcasters focused on Mike McDaniel’sjourney towards sobriety, and the support of his fellow head coach, Dan Quinn. It was a beautiful, teachable few minutes.Where is the evidence that Winston has grown? A year ago he was still keen to depict Watson as some kind of victim. Sometimes it seems we’re too enamored with a player’s ability or his charisma rather than the quality of his character.Most fans don’t want to think about whether their quarterback sexually assaulted a woman. They want to know if he’s going to help their fantasy team win. And most youngsters have no idea what some of their heroes are accused of. How would they?Of course, the NFL’s first order of business is to hype its product. That means sharing a boatload of enthralling clips of plays and players. Want to throw together some Jameis Winston hype videos? Fine. But please, please be more thoughtful before making him out to be a national treasure.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York GiantsUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

It ends with real World Cup hopeThe US coach took charge of a team in flux and initially looked like he would feed that uncertainty. But his foundations are starting to look solidTell us: have you bought tickets for the 2026 World Cup yet?Leander SchaerlaeckensWed 19 Nov 2025 12.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 12.27 ESTShareThe symbolism felt a tad heavy-handed, as if a scriptwriter had slightly overcooked the plot.That the United States men’s national team shouldutterly humiliate Uruguay 5-1,the very opponent who dumped the Americans out of the 2024 Copa América in the group stage on their home soil, precipitating an all-out crisis. That the first of the USMNT’s goals on Tuesday, and the assist for the second, should come from Sebastian Berhalter, whose father, Gregg, was fired as US head coach after said Copa. That Berhalter’s successor, Mauricio Pochettino, should reclaim the program’s honor against his mentor,his “second father”, his “football father”, his “inspiration”, Marcelo Bielsa.This story of retribution and rehabilitation would have been sent back for a rewrite. Too obvious. Too hackneyed. Too tidy.All the same, the USMNT finished out 2025 by matching their biggest win ever over a South American team – and that one came back in 2016 against Bolivia, an inferior team to two-time world champions Uruguay.“That victory doesn’t mean nothing for me, personally, because we need to build our journey until the World Cup,” Pochettino said inan oddly testy postgame press conferenceon Tuesday, where he got annoyed at being asked about missing regulars because he feels like there is no such thing. “But what I really, really appreciate from the team, the roster, and all the staff is the way we start to connect together. That is the most important thing. If we want to arrive to the World Cup and have the chance to challenge the big teams, that is the way we need to play.”‘An impossibility made possible’: how tiny Curaçao made World Cup historyRead moreMore pleasing to Pochettino than the score was that he had rotated most all of his team – who were already missing a handful of … stars, let’s call them, rather than regulars – afterSaturday’s 2-1 victory over Paraguay, and that the collective had looked largely unaltered. “Nine changes, but [we kept] the ideas, the philosophy, the faith, the fight, the togetherness,” he said. “All the bench players were supporting the starting 11. That connection is amazing, it’s what we wanted.”The Argentinian’s fixation on this continuity vindicated the focus of his work over the calendar year, when he refreshed the player pool with 71 callups and rejuvenated the team’s culture.By posting a series of confidence and momentum-building results, punctuated by a head-turning one, the co-hosts will enter aWorld Cupyear in a much better place than they might have imagined at the close of 2024.Ever since a strong second-half in what was neverthelessa 2-0 lossto South Korea in September, the Americans have posted wins over three World Cup-bound teams – Japan, Australia and Paraguay – and played to a gamely tie with Ecuador, the second-best side in South American qualifiers. And now, as if to formally announce their intentions, they have recorded a beatdown of one of the international game’s most stories teams.After Pochettino’s appointment in September 2024, an entire four-year cycle had to be crammed into just over a year. In this supercharged timespan, Pochettino made an encouraging start with an avenging 2-0 win over Panama in October 2024, afterLos Canaleros–along with Uruguay–doomed the USA’s Copa América campaign; quickly crashed back to earth in a loss to Mexico; regained momentum in a pair of Nations League quarter-final wins over Jamaica last November; and then utterly disintegrated in losses to Panama and Canada in the Nations League Finals in March. This prompted yet another reset.Pochettino saw it as a turning point. “All that negativity was a positive thing,” he said on Monday. “All this negativity we used to build this journey. That was, I think, when the reality touched.”Yet dispiriting friendly losses to Turkey and Switzerland in early June made things look desperately bleak for the World Cup. But in response, a roster shorn of most anyone the casual fan might have heard of – again, not “regulars” – made a gutsy run to the Gold Cup final, where the US were finally overmatched by Mexico.“I felt like we had a group of guys [at the Gold Cup] that really connected on a deeper level,” Berhalter told TNT on Tuesday. “That’s something that we really needed to build that camaraderie, that chemistry, and kind of building that into the next couple of camps. Guys have each other’s backs.”Around this time, the USMNTfinally and fully became Pochettino’s team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once you match that intensity and have that DNA, things like this [5-1 win] can happen.”“Mauricio has expressed a lot of confidence for us to go out there and solve problems as we see fit,” echoed defender Mark McKenzie on Monday. “It’s not about Xs and Os; it’s not about the stuff we always see in videos. […] It’s just the aggressiveness, the mentality to win the ball back as soon as possible and just to be strong in both phases.”This, in the end, has been Pochettino’s broader project for 2025: to build a foundation that will survive the tremors of a World Cup. The results have merely been the residue of that work, even as the numbers on the scoreboard ascended steadily from concerning to spectacular.“After [more than] one year, we start to see the identity that we want to translate to our players, I think that is an important improvement,” Pochettino told TNT before Tuesday’s game. “[2025] was really difficult. All projects, when they start, it’s about analyzing and seeing what’s going on. But I’m happy. I’ve seen motivation, focus.”After the final whistle rang through Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium, Pochettino did his best to wrap a reluctant Bielsa in a hug. The elder coach, who had oncediscovered a teenaged defenderin rural Argentina in the dead of night some 40 years ago, was in no mood.Something about apprentices and masters might have followed in this space, were it not so trite.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

The new league minimum would be more than $220,000 with an average of more than $460,000.Those numbers would start in the first year of the deal for more than 180 players and increase over the length of the CBA.People familiar with the WNBA’s latest proposal described the plan to the AP as a highly lucrative package providing substantial increases over prior years and designed to bring negotiations to a quick conclusion.The current CBA was set to expire 31 October when the WNBA and the players’ union agreed to continue negotiations to 30 November, allowing more time to negotiate a deal that would be revolutionary for the players in terms of salary.The players exercised their right to opt out of the current CBA last year with hopes of getting, among other things, increased revenue sharing, higher salaries, improved benefits and a softer salary cap. When the last CBA expired in 2019, both sides agreed to a 60-day extension with a CBA eventually ratified in January 2020.WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert was hopeful before the 2025 All-Star Game that everyone would be talking about how great the next CBA would be at the 2026 All-Star Game.“I’m still really optimistic that we’ll get something done that would be transformational,” Engelbert said in July.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

She has not played for the US since a 3-0 victory over Canada on 2 July.“I’m just so happy she’s back,” USWNT head coach Emma Hayes said in a conference call with reporters. “I realize more and more the importance, not just of her qualities on the field, but her quiet leadership – not just in terms of leading the line, but off the field as well.‘There’s this buzz of excitement’: Emily Fox on USWNT and Arsenal ambitionsRead more“Before we had to put forward the provisional roster, she made sure she called and texted me several times to say, ‘I’m fit. I’m coming.’ Like, I don’t know why she’d think we wouldn’t bring her anyway if she’s fit and healthy. But let me tell you, Naomi will be the first person in camp.”The US will play Italy for their final two matches of the year on 28 November at Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando and on 1 December at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale.Hayes named 26 players to the camp roster and 23 players will be available for each match.Trinity Rodman was left off the roster as she continues to recover from a knee injury. The forward appeared as a late substitute in the Washington Spirit’s 2-0 semi-final victory over the Portland Thorns last weekend and nearly scored in the sixth minute of stoppage time but her shot went just wide.The Spirit play Gotham FC on Saturday in the NWSL championship game in San Jose, California.“She was fortunate to get a few minutes the other day, but she’s still working her way back,” Hayes said. “And the reality is, we felt together with an important camp and big-game minutes required, she’s not in a position to do that. And I think you know Trin, more than anyone, wants to be playing with the national team, so we hope that can happen in the new year. But it has just come too soon to be honest, and her wellbeing and welfare is of importance to me.”Goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce was also left off the US roster while she recovers from a fractured eye socket suffered during a game for Manchester United last week.Midfielder Croix Bethune, who has not played for the United States since July, was included on the roster. Like Rodman, Bethune plays for the Spirit.Two players have been called up to the national team for the first time: Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz and Chicago Stars forward Jameese Joseph.

It could be his last day on Earth,” David Haye tells Sky News, with the sort of apocalyptic glare I try to give my children when they want to jump in a muddy puddle.Yes, this week everyone appears to be deeply concerned for the wellbeing of 28-year-old YouTube celebrity Jake Paul. The announcement of his fight againstAnthony Joshuanext month has generated a flood of foreboding prognoses, and fair enough. Stepping into the ring with a two-time world heavyweight champion when a) you’re not even a heavyweight, b) your record consists almost entirely of novices and geriatrics and c) you still fight like a marmoset trapped in an empty crisp packet: on some level, we all know how this might go.Here’s how it’s actually going to go, if it even happens. Jake Paul is going to be fine. Jake Paul: structurally unharmed. Jake Paul will gurn for the celebrities at ringside – maybe Lionel Messi, maybe Snoop Dogg – and at one point he will almost certainly drop his arms to his sides and dare Joshua to hit him. Jake Paul will hang in there.Obviously Jake Paul will eventually lose, and there may even be some cartoon blood spat in the process. But at the end they’re going to hug and Joshua is going to call Paul a warrior, a true fighter, and the pair will hoist their arms skywards, and most importantly Jake Paul’s name will be everywhere, and Jake Paul will live to grift another day. Not to spoil anybody’s fun, of course. But while I do not profess to be any great analyst of boxing, I do happen to know a thing or two about the internet. And what we essentially have here is the ultimate collision of these two worlds, these two kinds of fame and power, the pure athlete and the performance artist, the puncher and the prankster, meeting on weird middle ground. Is this sport or stunt? And is it still even meaningful to distinguish the two?View image in fullscreenAnthony Joshua celebrates victory over Andy Ruiz Jr.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesThe first thing to note is that the danger is the point. Or rather, theperceptionof danger. The idea that Paul may get seriously hurt as a result of this fight, or even die, scandalises many lovers of the sport. Which is exactly why it must be invoked as often and as gruesomely and as gratuitously as possible. This is the stuff that turns the wheels, sells the tickets, outrages the traditionalists. A dead Jake Paul: even to read these words will feel to some of you like a thrilling incantation, awful and alluring in equal measure, one that may just persuade you to watch on Netflix.And, of course, Paul has always known this. Part of his macabre genius is his ability to intuit – on some deep and shameful level – what you really, truly want, and then to pump it into your bloodstream and keep pumping. This is a guy who, along with his older brother Logan, has been chasing YouTube fame since he was a child. This is an algorithm native: a man steeped in hard numbers, dark desires, white lies and the unfailingly lucrative relationships between them.To revisit Paul’s YouTube feed, which goes back to 2014, is basically to witness a kind of real-time machine learning. At the start a lot of his videos have titles like “I Graduated High School” and “Fireworks In The Park!” This does OK, but soon enough he works out what does even better. And so over time the wholesome teenage stuff gives way to the confrontations, the clickbait, the madcap stunts. “Hanging From 300ft Cliff”. “Here’s How I Lost $300,000 dollars [sic] in 10 seconds”. “I Spent 24hrs BURIED IN SOLID CONCRETE”. And if big-time boxing is all about creating suitable matches, internet culture thrives on the outlandish mismatch. A man tries to put an iPad in a blender. One Jew debates 500 Nazis. Ordinary bloke tries to last eight rounds with Anthony Joshua wearing regulation 10oz gloves. This is basically sport as elaborate viral hoax, and to harrumph about things like veracity or integrity is about as fatuous as wondering whetherDerren Brown really had bulletsin his Russian roulette pistol.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of his pranks are so blatantly staged that it’s hard not to imagine that the joke is tacitly on the audience. Even his marriage to fellow content creator Tana Mongeau in 2019 was later revealed to be a sham for content. I watched the concrete video all the way through. He doesn’t spend 24 hours buried in it. He bails after about six. Personally, I’m sceptical it was more than about 15 minutes. “This is America,” Paul brags on his reality TV show. “The currency isn’t being liked. It’s attention. What can you do with attention? The answer is anything.” Well, almost. Attention might earn you the Joshua fight in the first place, but it’s not going to stop a crushing straight right from rearranging your dentistry. Or can it? Does the fight even happen in the first place? “I don’t believe a single thing until I see them in the ring,” said Tony Bellew. “Even if they come together for a presser. It won’t happen. It can’t happen.” And even if it does, will Joshua even bother training properly? Does he decide to carry Paul for a few rounds, as Floyd Mayweather essentially did with Conor McGregor in 2017? If the killer angle opens up does he take it, or switch down to the body? Why go to the trouble of maiming the biggest payday in the sport?One of the reasons I find celebrity boxing so interesting and alarming is that it is one of the few prototypes of modern sport articulating exactly what it wants. This is sport stripped of the niceties, the trappings and inhibitions. The only true worth here is fame and bluster, money and eyeballs. It’s a grift and you will happily watch us grifting, because you want this. And even if you don’t want this, we will force-feed it into all the places you get your sport, your favourite websites and your social feeds and your betting apps, until you do want it. It has often been said that the death of a sport comes when the viewer can no longer believe what they are seeing.Boxinghas always required its audience to accept a little incredulity as part of the bargain, and yet the runaway success of its algorithmic late-capitalist form hints at a stage beyond. Where you don’t believe what you’re seeing, and you no longer care, and you watch it anyway.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuacommentShareReuse this content"

Caught my second wind, caught my third wind. Rhythm is still coming back, obviously. First game in almost seven months, so everything that happened tonight was to be expected.”That’s because not much can surprise James at this point in his basketball odyssey – not even the work necessary to overcome injuries.The 40-year-old had been sidelined since the start of training camp by sciatica, keeping him out of the preseason and the Lakers’ first 14 games of the regular season. James, who had never missed a season opener since he started playing organized basketball three decades ago, took part in his first Lakers practice of the new season on Monday.James realized that some wondered whether his return would disrupt the Lakers, who got off to a 10-4 start without him. The four-timeNBAchampion could only laugh.The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron LakersRead more“I can fit in with anybody,” James said. “I don’t even understand why that was even a question. What’s wrong with these people out here? I can fit in right away with anybody. Just watching the guys the first 14 games, I was putting myself [mentally] in position while I was watching the games of how I could help the team and how I could be successful to help those guys. I’m still able to gain a lot of eyes when I’m driving the ball or have the ball.”About 30 minutes before tipoff, the team confirmed James would start for the 1,561st time in his 1,563rd regular-season games. He got a loud ovation when he was announced first in the Lakers’ starting lineup.James didn’t score in his first 11 minutes on court, but soon found his rhythm. After hitting a pair of three-pointers in the second quarter, he recorded eight assists in the second half – including six in just over three minutes early in the fourth quarter.“He played with the right spirit,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said of James. “Very unselfish all night. Was a willing passer. Didn’t force it. Took his drives and his shots when they were there. The defense is going to pay attention to him, and I just thought he made a lot of great decisions tonight. Really great to have him back.”James said on Monday that his body isn’t in ideal game shape, but he was eager to get started on his latest milestone achievement. Redick was also impressed by James’ fitness, saying he could have played more minutes if the Lakers hadn’t already run away from Utah.“LeBron is, for a lot of us that played with him, or some of these guys that grew up watching him, he’s a superhero,” said Redick, who played 15 NBA seasons. “What he’s been able to do in this game, there’s a handful of guys that have been able to do it.”James is the first player ever to participate in 23 NBA seasons. Vince Carter played in 22 seasons in a career that concluded in 2020, while five players have made it through 21 seasons: Robert Parish, Kevin Willis, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki and 40-year-old Chris Paul, who currently plays for the Los Angeles Clippers. Philadelphia guard Kyle Lowry is in his 20th season.View image in fullscreenLeBron James embraces teammate Austin Reaves during Tuesday’s game.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APWith this debut, James is now just 48 games behind Parish’s NBA record for regular-season games played (1,611). James already holds another NBA record with 1,855 regular-season and playoff games combined – 58 more than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar – along with the record for most total minutes played.James has repeatedly said he isn’t assuming this season will be his last, but he also hasn’t decided whether he’ll play another year. His most recent offseason was injury-plagued, with two months of recovery after spraining his knee ligament during the Lakers’ first-round playoff loss to Minnesota followed by that painful bout of sciatica – pain in the nerves running from the buttocks and down the back of the legs.James is a four-time NBA Finals MVP who also has four league MVP awards and 21 All-Star selections. His career began with the Cleveland Cavaliers in October 2003, a year before the birth of his oldest son and current Lakers teammate, Bronny.Los Angeles’ next game isn’t until Sunday – also against the Jazz in Salt Lake City. The Lakers will have at least two practices before then, allowing James to continue to establish his chemistry and his role.“I don’t have to worry about chemistry,” James said. “This is a great group. Everyone enjoys being around each another, sacrificing for one another, playing for one another. [I have to] get my wind, get my rhythm back. Missed a couple of chippies tonight that I’m used to making. But that will come around.”Explore more on these topicsLeBron JamesNBABasketballUS sportsWest CoastLos Angeles LakersShareReuse this content"

Frustrated by the national federation’s financial problems, he deferred starting until January 2024, when the problems were resolved and players paid, paving the way for a historicWorld Cupqualifying campaign.Curaçao will be the smallest nation – by land area and population – to play at the World Cup after their0-0 draw in Jamaicaon Wednesday. The Caribbean island has a population of 156,000, sinking the previous record holders, Iceland, which has about 400,000 inhabitants. Last month Cape Verde were confirmed as surprise tournament debutants but the African nation is almost 10 times bigger by area than the former Dutch colony, indicating the level of achievement by Advocaat and his squad.World Cup 2026: which countries have qualified and how did they do it?Read more“It’s an impossibility that is made possible,” the winger Kenji Gorré says from the team hotel in Jamaica after two hours’ sleep. “It’s literally impossible for such a small island, such a small 150,000 population, and now to go to the biggest pinnacle of football is unbelievable.”Advocaat initiated contact with Curaçao about the job, knowing that by the time the tournament came around he would be 78. That could be another bit of history because Advocaat may become the oldest coach in the tournament’s history, surpassing Otto Rehhagel, who was 71 years and 317 days old when he oversaw Greece’s third and final group game in 2010. Although Romania’s coach Mircea Lucescu is hoping to make it through the playoffs and take charge in North America at the age of 80.“He’s been fantastic,” Gorré says of Advocaat. “As soon as he came in he brought a lot of experience with him. For him to believe in us and believe in our dream as well just shows also the potential that he saw, and I’m just really grateful that he said yes to the job and trusted his feeling on it. Now we’re walking in the destiny of what we’ve called.”Advocaat was joined by his long‑time assistant Cor Pot but there was also a desire to maintain some local knowledge.

These are things that were dreamt of when I was young.“With God all things are possible and you can see that even with a faith of a size as a mustard seed, you know, God can do a miracle. And even just for my family, like my mum, who is from Curaçao, and her mum, my grandma, and they’ve got so much family in Curaçao as well that I’m just proud. And that just does something to my soul.”Advocaat was unfortunately absent from Kingston, having returned to the Netherlands to deal with a personal matter. When he arrived last year he set about making the national setup more professional and instilling a desire to avoid defeat at all costs. Few know better how to run camps and qualifiers.This is Advocaat’s 10th spell in charge of a men’s national side, his previous appointments being the Netherlands (three times), the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Belgium, Russia, Serbia and Iraq.His compatriots Patrick Kluivert and Guus Hiddink previously held the Curaçao role but neither had the impact of Advocaat. A key part of Advocaat’s plan to take Curaçao to the next level was to integrate members of the diaspora. In years gone by the Netherlands internationals Patrick van Aanholt, Gregory van der Wiel and Jetro Willems were eligible to play for Curaçao, and the current Netherlands players Jurriën Timber and Justin Kluivert have Curaçaoan heritage.Most of the squad were born in the Netherlands, including the starting XI from the decisive draw on Tuesday night. Many of Advocaat’s charges featured for Netherlands age-group teams.There is plenty of experience. The defender Armando Obispo has played in the Champions League for PSV, as has the striker Jürgen Locadia, who cost Brighton £15m in 2018 but is unemployed after leaving the Spanish fourth-tier side Intercity in the summer. Three of the squad play in the English Football League, including the former Manchester United midfielder Tahith Chong, the only squad member born on the island, who moved to Sheffield United from Luton in August. The former Ajax youngsters Ar’jany Martha and Sontje Hansen play for Rotherham and Middlesbrough respectively, the former PSV full-back Joshua Brenet moved to Livingston in September, and Shurandy Sambo of Burnley is on loan at Sparta Rotterdam.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The younger Gorré came through the ranks at Manchester United before embarking on a nomadic career taking in Portugal, Qatar and now Israel.“It’s not really sunk in yet,” says Kenji Gorré with his Mancunian twang. “What if we do get England?

Their first international was in 2011, having previously played as the Territory of Curaçao until the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved. In three previous World Cup qualifying campaigns Curaçao won six of 18 matches.In the opening group phase this time they had a 100% record, defeating St Lucia, Aruba, Barbados and most notably Haiti, who will also be in North America next summer. In the third round the more established nations of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago stood in their path in a group that also included Bermuda. Kenji Gorré scored in the crucial 2-0 home victory against Jamaica last month and Bermuda were thrashed 7-0 last week to boost confidence going into the decider.Fortitude got them through, even though there were nerves when Jamaica were awarded an injury-time penalty that was overturned after a video assistant referee consultation. Curaçao finished top of group B and delirium greeted the final whistle.“All the emotions were flying up in the air. He goes to the VAR and he says ‘no penalty’,” says Kenji Gorré. “My heart just dropped again and we were like, wow, we are actually going to the World Cup. This is destiny.

Five first-half goals raised the dial as momentum swung before the hosts opened up a gap after the break.Arsenal v Real Madrid: Women’s Champions League – liveRead moreMarc Skinner was left to rue his side’s defensive lapses in concentration. The timing of the goals and the errors in the buildup seemed to frustrate him the most, particularly after a strong start.“I think the stats sum it up,” the United manager said. “Six shots on target, five goals. They’ve been clinical but, really, we’ve given them the game… there’s not much more I can say. It’s gut-wrenching to concede five, especially in the way that we have.”Despite taking a sucker punch from Manchester City last Saturday, United’s Champions League endeavours have been impressive. There are not, however, many sides with as much European pedigree as Wolfsburg and United soon learned how clinical the two-time champions can be.Much has been made of the lack of depth in this United squad. Accumulating fatigue has become more apparent after a challenging fortnight and there is no doubt the squad is threadbare.Quick GuideWCL roundup: Lyon rescue dramatic draw at JuventusShowLyoncame from 3-0 down at half-time to snatch a 3-3 draw atJuventusin the Women's Champions League.Goals from Chiara Beccari, Michela Cambiaghi and Tatiana Pinto put Juve in control at the break.

I think that’s clear.”Skinner did freshen things up with Melvine Malard, Fridolina Rolfö and Simi Awujo all returning. It was a slight surprise that Jess Park was on the bench but the 24-year-old has accumulated a lot of minutes recently. In goal Safia Middleton‑Patel remained in place of Phallon Tullis‑Joyce, who has a fractured eye socket.View image in fullscreenWolfsburg’s Ella Peddemors (centre) celebrates after scoring her side’s second goal.Photograph: Swen Pförtner/APUnited started the brightest and, in the 14th minute, Malard broke down the left and lifted her head before producing a sublime cross that fell perfectly for Rolfö.

This was only Middleton-Patel’s fourth senior appearance for United but it will be one she will want to forget. She attempted to clear her lines but passed it straight to Ella Peddemors to fire home.The game sparked into life as the first half drew to a close. There were three goals in the space of 10 minutes. Peddemors got her second, driving in a low shot from distance, before Lineth Beerensteyn rifled a sublime effort into the top corner.Just as United looked done and dusted, they pulled a goal back. Malard read the Wolfsburg defensive line perfectly to hook in a finish with the last kick of the half.After the break Wolfsburg put their foot on the gas as United struggled to make an impact. They found the cushion they sought as the electric Beerensteyn scored her second before Endemann added a fifth in stoppage time. The result epitomised just how tight this stage is. It was undoubtedly a disappointing night for Skinner’s team, but they will know they still have so much to play for when the competition resumes next month.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueWolfsburg WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Their manager was delighted to end that long wait, especially as he believes it has harmed the nation’s football development. “This should stimulate or motivate young players to go out and become Scotland internationals in the future,” said Clarke. “Hopefully there is a legacy from this group of players to the younger generations and we don’t wait so long to go to the next tournament and the next tournament.Scotland’s wild World Cup moment was built by collective will and individual brilliance | Ewan MurrayRead more“By the way, it is more difficult to qualify for the World Cup than it used to be. If you look at the stats, it is really difficult to qualify. It is incredible, even [versus] when the boys went to France ’98. There were 15 European teams in a 32-team tournament. That is almost 50%. But this one is 16 out of 48, almost a third. You see the World Cup getting bigger and you think: ‘It must be easier to get there.’ But it is not, it is more difficult to get there.”Despite a lengthy career at Chelsea, Clarke was overlooked for the World Cups of 1990 and 1998. He used that lingering disappointment not only as personal motivation but also to inspire his players in the team hotel before the game against ­Denmark. “The manager’s speech was ­unbelievable,” said Andy ­Robertson, the captain. “He went into a little bit about his life and the lads were quite emotional. To do it for him, all the staff, all our families, it will go down as one of the greatest nights of our lives.”View image in fullscreenAndy Robertson celebrates after the final whistle.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Uefa/Getty Images“It was always in my mind that I would love to go to a World Cup,” Clarke said. “I got close in 1990; I was in the squad that went to Italy for a pre-camp in February and I didn’t make the final selection. From there, there was a motivation to get there.“When we messed up against Ukraine [in the playoff for the last World Cup] I was disappointed. I thought: ‘That was my chance, that was my chance.’ But I believe in this group of players so I hung around. Eventually I got there. It is a lifelong ambition to go to a World Cup with my country and because of this group of players and me coaching staff I have managed to do it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We shrugged our shoulders, just as clueless as they were. A few of the girls laughed about it and then one of the other players came over and handed my friend and me some bananas, saying, ‘Here, have these.’ That was the cherry on top,” she said.“Since leaving Montpellier, my friend and I have spoken about that moment a few times. Not receiving flowers was one thing, but as two of only six black girls in the squad, receiving bananas wasn’t something I could laugh off and forget about. Was it an accident? Was it the only thing in the dressing room she could give us? Did she mean well by it?“I’ve tried to justify it in many different ways, trying to find any indication that it was an honest mistake. But when I add in the many other times at the club when we were left feeling a similar way, it was hard to see it as merely a simple error. No matter what the intentions were, it left us feeling taken aback and upset.”The incident marked the end of a largely unhappy time for Fowler in France. She also alleges club staff accused her of feigning chest pains, even though they had been notified of a possible health issue by Matildas staff.A Montpellier physio who spoke English passed on to the teenager that other members of the staff believed Fowler was feigning injury to avoid playing.“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Frustrated, I told him I wasn’t making it up, that I’d never make up something that could be related to my heart. He informed me that it wasn’t his opinion – he believed me – but all the coaching staff thought I was making it up so that I could get out of playing in our match the next day.”She says she subsequently raised the issue with a coach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then he started throwing minutes at me. Could I play for 60 minutes? Thirty? Ten? ‘The team needs you,’ he said. I shook my head.“It wasn’t a situation I’d expected to be in. He wasn’t showing any empathy at all. I ended the conversation by saying: ‘If you’re not going to look after me then I’m going to look after myself. I’ll be at the game, but I won’t be putting my boots on.’”Montpellier was contacted by the Guardian for comment.Fowler was ultimately allowed to miss the game, and the club did provide her with checks afterwards that cleared her of a heart condition.“I’ve still experienced it in recent years, but after even more extensive heart checks, we’ve come to the conclusion that it’s most likely a muscular or skeletal issue,” she said.“I’m very grateful that it’s not something that ended my career.”Explore more on these topicsMatildasWomen's footballAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

In February, Arsenal were accused of delivering an“outrageous” snubto the ­Congolese ­government by not meeting the ­foreign minister, ­Thérèse ­Kayikwamba Wagner, to ­discuss the deal.VisitRwandais an arm of the Rwanda Development Board, a ­government department, and it is widely believed Arsenal signed and stuck by the partnership in order to grow their fanbase in Africa. The arrangement has now, however, come to an end after both parties “mutually agreed” to go their separate ways.“Together, Arsenal and the Rwanda Development Board have exceeded the original goals of the partnership – promoting conservation and sustainable tourism, inspiring millions of supporters to discover the country, and creating a lasting foundation for tourism growth,” read an Arsenal statement. “The ­partnership has also supported Rwanda’s ambition to become an international sporting hub in Africa and host more global sporting events whilst delivering grassroots football initiatives that have helped hundreds of young players and coaches develop their skills and inspire greater participation in sport across the country.”Richard Garlick, Arsenal’s chief executive officer, described the ­partnership as a “significant ­journey” and claimed it had been “driving ­forward” the club’s ambitions. But that is not how a section of Arsenal’s fanbase viewed the arrangement, with the campaign group Gunners for Peace protesting outside the Emirates Stadium during thefirst leg of the Champions League semi-final encounterwith Paris Saint-Germain in late April with a banner that read “Drop Visit Rwanda”. They also ­distributed armbands to cover up the Visit Rwanda logo on kits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ministers had originally proposed capping secondary ticket sales for sport, music and arts events at 30% above the face-value price of a ticket, but have now settled on limiting any resales to the original cost price in an attempt to combat touts.While football was not included in the details of the draft legislation released yesterday on the grounds that secondary ticket sales are already outlawed under the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, government sources have indicated they would oppose any moves by United to introduce a secondary market for seat licences.United began consulting fans over introducing seat licences this year in a survey conducted by the commercial research company CSL International, the largest piece of market research ever undertaken by the club. The survey is understood to have been sent to hundreds of thousands of season-ticket holders and United members, with different questions asked of different groups of fans.Buying a PSL would give fans the right to buy a specific seat at the new ground for a set period, although they would have to pay separately for their season ticket. Such licences have become commonplace in American sport, often as a means of part-funding new stadium builds. In the NFL, in particular, there is a strong secondary market for the licences themselves, with the resale of PSLs generating significant profits.United sources have disclosed that the PSL model being explored by CSL included the possibility of reselling the licence, although they added that the consultation process was still at an early stage. While a prohibition on resale at a profit is not necessarily a dealbreaker for PSLs, it may make them less attractive investments and lead to United lowering prices.It is envisaged that PSLs would only be sold for the most exclusive, premium seats at the new stadium, with other areas being reserved for ordinary fans. Licence holders would also have a guarantee of remaining in the same seats every season, as many long-term season-ticket holders have been angered by being relocated by the club in recent years. But should they fail to buy a season ticket, they would automatically lose the licence.A PSL differs from the debentures available at Wimbledon and Twickenham as they are interest-free loans made to the All England Club and Rugby Football Union in return for the right to buy tickets. The nominal value of Wimbledon debentures is repaid after a five-year period, while Twickenham debentures are repaid to the holder or their family estate after 75 years, with the latter considerably cheaper as a result. Some Twickenham debenture holders have been asked to forgo future repayments in a “Debenture Donation Campaign” to help raise funds for the RFU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No discussions have taken place with United as seat licences are not yet in operation.It has been reported that United were planning to charge £4,000 for a 30-year seat licence, although if there is no resale value the club may have to alter their pricing strategy.United declined to comment, but sources at the club made it clear they will comply with all legislative requirements.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

They did the same ahead of Italia 90 – but three of their six group games were 0-0 draws andthey might not have qualifiedhad Poland’s Rysard Tarasiewicz scored in the last minute of their final game in Chorzow. Insteadhis heatseeker hit the crossbarand England were through.There are dozens of examples of perfect campaigns across the men’s and women’s games, especially in the early days when qualification groups were smaller. In 1934, for example, Italy qualified after beating Greece 4-0 in their only game. Greece chose not to play the return match and Italy went on to win the whole tournament. With that – and research time – in mind, we’ve restricted the answer to a) European qualification only and b) teams who played at least five games.Golden Goal: Jude Bellingham for England v Slovakia (2024)Read moreWethinkEngland are the first men’s team from Europe to achieve this particular definition of World Cup perfection. Four women’s teams have done it, including the Lionesses during qualification for the 2023 tournament. In 10 games they scored 80 (e-i-g-h-t-y) goals and conceded none.Plenty of other sides have won all their games while conceding the odd goal, including Erling Haaland’s Norway en route to the men’s finals tournament next year.Possibly the most spectacular performance came from Germany Women before the 1995 World Cup, a campaign that doubled up as qualification for Euro 95. These were their results:Switzerland (A) 5-0Wales (H) 12-0Wales (A) 12-0Croatia (A) 7-0Croatia (H) 8-0Switzerland (H) 11-0Germany eventually lost the 1995 World Cup final against Norway, but they went all the way in 2003 and 2007 after qualification with a 100% record and the cleanest of sheets. The other teams to achieve that feat are Spain’s men (2010) and Spain’s women (2023).Here’s a (hopefully) comprehensive list of European teams who qualified with a 100% record (minimum five games). Oddly, three of the four men’s teams went on to lose their first game at the World Cup proper. Then again, West Germany (1982), the Netherlands and Spain (both 2010) all went on to reach the final.Men’s World Cup1982West GermanyPlayed 8, Goals For 33, Goals Against 32010NetherlandsP8 F17 A2and SpainP10 F28 A52018GermanyP10 F43 A42026EnglandP8 F22 A0and NorwayP8 F37 A5View image in fullscreenSpain beat Turkey 1-0 en route to a victorious World Cup in 2010 but drew against the same opposition on Tuesday to spoil an otherwise perfect qualifying campaign.Photograph: Jasper Juinen/Getty ImagesWomen’s World Cup1995GermanyP6 F55 A01999DenmarkP6 F22 A3and SwedenP6 F18 A52003GermanyP6 F30 A12007GermanyP8 F31 A32011FranceP10 F50 A02015EnglandP10 F52 A1, FranceP10 F54 A3, GermanyP10 F62 A4and SwedenP10 F32 A12019SpainP8 F25 A22023EnglandP10 F80 A0, DenmarkP8 F40 A2, FranceP10 F54 A4and SpainP8 F53 A0View image in fullscreenEngland prepare to face Belarus in 2015 World Cup qualifying. The Lionesses won 6-0 in Bournemouth.Photograph: Chris Ison/PASing song“Commentating on Manchester City v Liverpool (in the US), Jon Champion observed that the City fans were chanting about Steven Gerrard’s slip of 10 years earlier and commented: ‘Long memories.’ As a football fan, 10 years (actually 11) doesn’t seem like a particularly long time to me. So which football chants display the longest memories?”asks Chris Taylor.Football fans have longer memories than most, for richer and poorer, so there are plenty of answers from the 20th century. We’ve excluded general chants about individual players (“Ooh, Aah, Cantona”) and focused on those that reference specific incidents or seasons. Here they are in reverse chronological order.Sheffield Wednesday v Sheffield United, Division Three, 1979-80“On Boxing Day 1979 there was a Sheffield derby at Hillsborough,” writes Darren White. It was the first league meeting between the clubs in eight years and attracted a still record third-tier crowd of over 49,000 people. Wednesday won 4-0 and it became known as the Boxing Day Massacre. To this day, both sets of fans sing the same song to the tune of Boney M’s Mary’s Boy Child:Hark now hear United (or Wednesday) singThe Wednesday (or United) ran awayAnd we will fight for evermoreBecause of Boxing Day“One might think it curious that United fans sing about an embarrassing defeat, but in the true style of the era, it’s a celebration of the abilities of the club’s hooligan element rather than their players.”On a similar note, this from Ed Parkinson: “In the run-up to Christmas, some Hartlepool fans like to commemorate early 1970s festive fisticuffs with old rivals Darlington by promising to ‘fight for forevermore because of Boxing Day’.”Bayern Munich v Leeds United, European Cup final, 1974-75“Leeds fans cause some confusion with the ‘We are the champions, champions of Europe’ chant, given we’ve never actually won the European Cup/Champions League,” writes Adam Brewer. “The chant originates from the 1975 final where we were[redacted – Legal Ed]out of it against Bayern Munich. Fifty years later it’s still being sung – and passed down the generations. You should ask my 10-year-old aboutthe foul on Allan Clarke that wasn’t given as a penalty.”View image in fullscreenBayern Munich goalkeeper Sepp Maier (centre) looks hopefully at the ball after colliding with Leeds United’s Allan Clarke (left) in 1975.Photograph: APSheffield United, 1970-71It seems Yorkshire football supporters have longer memories than most. Our own John Ashdown writes in with a chant that pays tribute to the 1970-71 promotion squad and specifically three players: Eddie Colquhoun, Tony Currie and Alan Woodward.We ain’t got a barrel of money,But we’ve got Woodward and Currie,And with Eddie Colquhoun,Promotion is soon,U-ni-ted,All together now …Rangers v Motherwell, Scottish Cup third-round replay, 1960-61“Motherwell fans sing a song which begins As I was walking down the Copeland Road, I heard a might roar’,” writes Gary Tait. “This references The Well beating Rangers 5-2 in a Scottish Cup replay in March 1961, one of Ian St John’s last games before moving to Liverpool. The family-friendly version continues:For the boys in blue got beat 5-2 by the boys in claret and amber“‘Beat’ is usually substituted for something far more industrial.”He’s a keeperIn last week’s Knowledgewe looked at players born in the crown dependencies (Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey) who have played for the Home Nations. There’s another name to add to the list. “Walsall goalkeeperTrevor Woodwas from Jersey and, despite no obvious connection, played one game for Northern Ireland,” writes Robert Davies. “He was recommended by his club manager Chris Nicholl, who had played for Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s.”San Marino: an apologyIn last week’s Knowledge we referred to San Marino as a “principality” when in fact is a republic. We apologise for the mistake.Knowledge archive“Has a footballer ever had a haircut at half-time?”pondered Darren McVeighin 2013.Although we’ve not been able to turn up any tales of half-time barnet-trimming, there have been a couple of reports of a half-time face-fuzz buzz, although as yet the reasons remain a mystery. “Although it technically isn’t a haircut, Sweden and former Celtic defender Daniel Majstorovic had his beard shaved at half-time, while playing for AEK Athens,” writes Yiannis Tsaousis. “The match was Levadiakos v AEK on 30 November 2008. The fun fact is that he didn’t shave it clean, but he came out on the pitch for the second half with a Genghis Khan-like thick moustache.”And there’s a similarly hairy tale concerning one of the all-time greats. “In all his bearded glory, George Best starred in an indie film festival here in Wellington about six or eight years ago which devoted 90 minutes and a single camera fixed on him throughout a match, on and off the ball,” writes Ian Rogers. “It was for Manchester United, against the powerhouse of Coventry City, and the vice-like boredom of the entire cinematic experience was broken only by George scoring early in the second half. There may have been a second goal, who knows or cares really. However, at half-time, clearly they had to do an off-scene retake and fill in shot, and so a non-sweating, fully kitted out, and clean shaven George gazed dolefully at the camera. Cue start of the second half, and he’s back on, beard and all.”The film in question is the East German director Hellmuth Costard’s Fußball wie noch nie, or “Football as never before”, and the game in question was United’s home fixture against the Sky Blues on 12 September 1970. Ian’s memory is slightly off as the beard in question actually appears only at half-time, and to be fair to the filmmaker it’s not entirely clear that the half-time segment is supposed to be in real time – as well as gaining a beard, Best has lost the No 11 from his back. But,thanks to the wonder of YouTube, readers can make up their own minds:Knowledge archiveCan you help?“How does Troy Parrott’s amazing performance for Ireland – five goals in two games against Portugal and Hungary – compare to the great individual performances in a single international window? I’m sure other players have scored more goals but who else has had such a dramatic impact?” asks Richie Tuohy[Let’s limit any answers to players whose goals were decisive in every game of a single window – Knowledge Ed]“In the current under-17 World Cup, Morocco beat New Caledonia 16-0 with no player scoring two goals. Is this the highest score without a hat-trick?” asks Paul Gage.“Ross Sykes (Union Saint-Gilloise) and Conor Gallagher (Atlético Madrid) both scored when their teams faced each other in the Champions League. Have two English players scored in the same match for opposing foreign teams before?” asks Liam Corbett.“My beloved team/lifelong affliction York City just scored four goals in a fourth consecutive league game.

The air felt heavy – not with pressure or expectation, but with heat. It was more than 30C (86f) that day. It makes your lungs sting, makes you feel like you’re running through water.In the England camp, we had done everything to prepare. Ice vests before training, hydration breaks, modified warm-ups – things that just weren’t part of football life a few years ago. At our base in Zurich we even had cryotherapy and Slush Puppies to cool our core temperatures. During training, there were ice-cold towels, extra rest moments and constant reminders to hydrate. You could feel how carefully the staff planned every detail. But when the whistle blew, no protocol could change the fact that the climate itself has changed.View image in fullscreenBeth Mead (left) and Lucy Bronze take part in cryotherapy treatment at England’s Geneva Euro 2025 training camp in July.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesThe tempo of the game slowed. Recovery took longer. Every sprint, every tackle, costs a little bit more. This summer’s Euros felt different for me in other ways too. My role as a forward with England had changed – I wasn’t always starting, but I was part of what we call the finishers. You’ve got to be ready to go into any moment, any position, even one you don’t normally play. In Switzerland I dropped into midfield, switched roles mid-game, That willingness to adapt is what makes a team succeed.We went on to win the tournament – back-to-back European champions. But I walked off the pitch with more than just a medal. I walked away with the realisation that the game I love, the game that’s given me everything, is already being shaped by the changing climate. This isn’t something that’s happening in the future. It’s happening now – on training grounds, in stadiums, and in communities all over the world. Matches are being cancelled because of heatwaves. Training sessions are being moved to dawn or dusk.Air-quality alerts are becoming part of match prep. Athletes are used to adapting – it’s what we do. But adaptation is critical for us all in the face of climate change. That’s why I’ve joinedAdapt2Win, a new global campaign backed by more than 40 athletes from around the world – from footballers to surfers, basketball players to runners, skiers to rugby players – calling on world leaders to invest in climate adaptation now. Because what’s happening on the pitch is only a glimpse of what’s happening off it.When droughts, floods or extreme heat hit, we are all impacted, but it’s the most vulnerable communities that pay the price. Farmers lose crops. Kids miss school. Families lose homes. Yet less than 10% of global climate finance goes toward helping people prepare for these impacts – which means billions of people are being left unprotected.Adaptation isn’t about giving up; it’s about finding a way to keep going. It’s about better water systems, smarter cities, stronger health care and fairer access to finance for those who need it most. It’s about resilience – the same quality every athlete trains to build.Football has always been an equaliser. Anyone can pick up a ball and play – on a beach, a street, a patch of grass. It’s why the game can belong to anyone. But climate change is changing that. Extreme heat is making it dangerous to play outside. Floods wash away pitches. Drought turns fields to dust. The very conditions that make football inclusive – open spaces, shared environments – are disappearing.If we don’t adapt, the world’s most accessible sport becomes a privilege, not a right. And that’s why this fight matters- not just for athletes at elite tournaments, but for every person who loves to kick a ball around with their friends. I want future generations to grow up in a world where sport still brings people together, where kids can still play outdoors safely, where talent and teamwork decide the game – not the climate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The Cop30 president has described this as the moment to turn the game around and this is what I am hopeful for today. This means investing in solutions that will help people everywhere to adapt to the changing climate now.Some people argue that focusing on adaptation means taking attention or funding away from cutting emissions. But that’s a false choice. We have to do both. Investing in adaptation isn’t a distraction from tackling the causes of climate change – it’s how we protect people while we do it.The truth is, adaptation saves lives and drives progress. It’s not charity or compromise – it’s strategy. It’s how we keep sport alive as a force for unity and hope.As athletes, we push our limits every day. But when the climate is pushing back, it’s time for the world to step up. Because if we can learn anything from sport, it’s that when the odds are stacked against you, there’s only one way to win: you adapt. Now it’s time for the world to do the same.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The case law on scheme benefits, deliverability, relevance, material considerations and irrationality merits review.”SWP maintains that the expansion plans will create a “tennis industrial complex”, which will damage the environment and has failed to properly listen to the community. It is also fighting its legal battle with the All England Club on two other fronts, including a separate court case in January, where a judge will consider the possibility that the golf course could be subject to a “statutory trust” and thus be reserved for public recreation.It is also considering whether to go to court to challenge a “restrictive covenant” given by the AELTC committee in 1993 in which it promised never to develop the land.“This is a David and Goliath struggle,” Save Wimbledon Park said in a statement. “The AELTC is a rich and well-connected corporate developer which has worked for decades to take over a substantial part of this highly protected public Park for its own purposes.”Christopher Coombe, a local lawyer who opposes the plans, said: “SWP has never been anti-tennis. We believe that it is high time for the AELTC to recognise the raft of legal and principled problems with its proposals and sit down and talk constructively with SWP and the local community.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The jury is outRead moreDaly has not played any competitive rugby since breaking his armagainst the Queensland Redson the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia, but Borthwick has wasted no time reinstating him on the left wing and believes the versatile Saracens three-quarter still has plenty of international rugby in him.“I think he is in as good a shape as I have ever seen him,” Borthwick said, having announced a reshuffled selection with Henry Slade, Ben Spencer, Asher Opoku-Fordjour, Ellis Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie restored to the starting XV. “I think he hit very close to his fastest speed ever the other day in training … he can’t wait to go. So I’ve no doubt [about] the next couple of years until the World Cup. Somebody who reads the game as well as him can go even beyond that.“I always think those smart players can keep playing even later in their careers, because they have such intelligence about the game. I think Elliot’s in that category.”Add Daly’s Lions Test experience and 73 England caps, his ability to play multiple positions, his high‑ball aptitude plus a raking left boot and the basis for Borthwick’s faith is understandable. It is less uplifting news, however, for the clutch of younger players who might conceivably have hoped to benefit from the injuries to Tom Roebuck and Tommy Freeman. For now Henry Arundell, Cadan Murley, Noah Caluori and Adam Radwan will have to remain patient.If they are looking for a positive role model in that regard they need only turn to Slade, who has not had a sniff this autumn despite his outstanding club form for Exeter. Now, following aninjury to Ollie Lawrence, he is finally back in England’s midfield alongside Fraser Dingwall with the head coach singling out both his attitude and enduring ability for praise. “When he played the first Test in Argentina in the summer, I thought it was one of the best games he has played for England,” Borthwick said. “I thought he was absolutely fantastic.”Elsewhere the team to face the Pumas reflects the management’s desire to continue developing depth in certain positions. Joe Heyes has been excellent for England over the past six months while Will Stuart has been good off the bench but, for this game, Borthwick has handed the tighthead jersey to Sale’s Opoku‑Fordjour, who is still just 21.Quick GuideEngland team to play ArgentinaShowEngland v Argentina, Allianz Stadium, 4.10pm GMT, Sunday 23 NovemberSteward (Leicester); Feyi-Waboso (Exeter), Slade (Exeter), Dingwall (Northampton), Daly (Saracens); Ford (Sale), Spencer (Bath); Genge (Bristol), Cowan-Dickie (Sale), Opoku-Fordjour (Sale), Itoje (Saracens, capt), Coles (Northampton), Pepper (Bath), Underhill (Bath), Earl (Saracens).ReplacementsDan (Saracens), Baxter (Harlequins), Stuart (Bath), Ewels (Bath), Curry (Sale), Pollock (Northampton), Mitchell (Northampton), M Smith (Harlequins).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At scrum-half, Spencer has been invited to show he can be as influential from the start as he is for Bath, with Alex Mitchell shifting to the bench. It may not be entirely coincidental that the weekend weather forecast is not brilliant, making Spencer’s outstanding box-kicking even more of a potential weapon. His clubmate Charlie Ewels is also back on the bench, as is the Saracens hooker Theo Dan in the absence of the hamstrung Jamie George.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All are hopeful of witnessing an all-time classic and a change to the story after three winless Ashes tours.The Spin | Stokes’ England have reminded us all that cricket is meant to be funRead moreStokes, ready to unleash Mark Wood and Jofra Archer when the series begins in Perth Stadium on Friday, is fully aware of the challenge: succeed and he will become just the sixth postwar England captain to do so after Andrew Strauss (2010-11), Mike Gatting (1986-87), Mike Brearley (1978-79), Ray Illingworth (1970-71) and Len Hutton (1954-55).“I have come here absolutely desperate to get home on that plane in January as one of the lucky few captains from England to have come here and been successful,” Stokes said, having named a 12‑member match‑daysquad that includes Shoaib Bashiras the spin‑bowling option.“A lot has been spoken about the history and how it has gone for England [in recent years]. This is our chance to create our own history and it is up to us how that looks.“Everyone in the world, everyone in Australia, everyone in England, knows how big this series is and I think if we were to come out and not accept that – treat it as just another series – we’d only be lying to ourselves.”While Stokes recently signed a new two-year contract with England that takes him through to the 2027 Ashes at home, this impending series marks the defining moment in a four‑year project led by his aggressive captaincy and an ultra‑positive head coach in Brendon McCullum.Stokes said: “[It is a case of] looking it in the eyes, taking it on, not being afraid of the challenge that we have ahead of us. We know it’s a huge task coming to Australia and everything that comes with that away from the field, on the field.”Archer and Wood have not featured in the same England Test attack since a one-off outing against West Indies in 2020. Both have been through injury ordeals and after meticulous rehabilitation programmes designed with this series in mind they are primed to hit Australia with pace.“Two years ago we would have bitten your hand off to be able to take this group of bowlers with us,” said Stokes, who along with his own brand of muscular fast-medium has Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse in the squad for the series opener and Josh Tongue waiting in the wings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They don’t listen to the players, we would have liked to start in Brisbane, too.”England’s Gus Atkinson said that though “there are no scars for me” from his country’s previous failures in Brisbane given he is a first-time Ashes tourist, “history would say it’s probably a good thing we’re not starting at the Gabba”.Shoaib Bashir a surprise inclusion in England squad for first Ashes TestRead moreBut Isaac McDonald, the chief curator at Perth Stadium, defended the decision, saying that the city’s relative proximity to England makes it a sensible first stop, and adding that he is enjoying the extra attention that comes with hosting the first game of a marquee series.“We’ve actually opened the last four summers here,” McDonald said. “So we’ve been the first Test of the summer for the last four years. You get all the first-game hype regardless who it is – I thought last year with the Indian touring team that it was crazy but this is a whole new level, being in the Ashes.“In some ways it’s pretty cool that we are the first because it does have that extra little hype, but being a direct flight from the UK to Perth it kind of makes sense that it is the first one. Just being around town you can tell there’s a lot of travellers here that have come from the UK to watch this game, so it’s going to be really cool to kick it off.”One complication for McDonald is that the first Test starts less than three weeks after Perth Stadium hosted a concert by the rock band Metallica, held just days after the drop-in wicket had been installed.“The wicket came out of the concerts unscathed, with no scarring, and having the run-in after the ­concert leading into this game was perfect timing – it gave us enough time to get moisture back through the profile and get us into a really confident spot leading into the first day of preparation.”View image in fullscreenCameron Green bowls during an Australia cricket team training session at Perth Stadium.Photograph: Dave Hunt/EPAAustralia have won four of their five games at Perth Stadium, which replaced the nearby Waca as host of Western Australia’s Test matches after the 2017 Ashes, with their only defeat coming against India last year, when 17 wickets fell on a chaotic first day before the wicket flattened.“I miss the Waca,” Starc said. “The ­Fremantle Doctor [the cooling afternoon breeze] comes in.

Last year we saw lots of wickets on the first day. There’s been a fair bit made about the colour of it, that it’s going to be a green mamba – it’s all good and well to look at the wicket, but until both teams have played on it we’re not really sure what it’s going to do.”McDonald has moved all his preparations this year forward 24 hours in an attempt to avoid the scenes witnessed on the first day last year. “The curator, no matter what the outcome of the game, always reflects and on reflection maybe I was a day late on the prep,” he said of that India game. “So we’ve knuckled down and we started a day early to ensure that the firmness is there and the characteristics of our Waca pitch, the pace and bounce, are going to be there on day one.”The first Ashes Test will be contested on the same drop-in pitch that was used in the India match and all five previous Tests here, which has spent the winter recuperating just outside the ground. “It just seems to have the best characteristics, so why change something that’s working really well?” McDonald said.Despite the wildness of the first day, last year’s pitch was rated as “very good” by the InternationalCricketCouncil, the highest possible ranking. At the time Cricket Australia’s head of cricket operations said: “We don’t look to prepare wickets that favour the home side or suit our situation in a series. What we seek is a good contest between bat and ball and pitches that are likely to produce a result.”View image in fullscreenPerth Stadium’s curator, Isaac McDonald, said he would not know how the pitch would play till the match started.Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAPMcDonald insisted he had received “absolutely no directives from anyone ever – that just doesn’t happen” and is fully focused on delivering the seam-friendly conditions that Tests at the Waca and at Perth Stadium are known for. “Low and slow is just not possible – West Test is pace and bounce and that’s what we’re gonna stick to,” he said. “I’ve really knuckled down with ensuring that’s spot on from day one to ensure that even battle.”But the 28-year-old admitted that, as Starc suggested, he would not be sure how the pitch would play until it had been played on, forcing him to endure a tortuous wait for validation – or ignominy. “Friday morning is the slowest,” he said.“I get here normally around 5.30am on matchdays, so that’s a slow, slow five-hour sit-around for me. Once the toss is done and I can’t roll any longer or take any more grass out I park myself up, and the national anthems seem like they go on for minutes and minutes. It’s probably more excitement than dreading what’s coming, but you can be as confident as you like, until you’re an hour into actual play you just don’t know.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Memphis Depay, who plays for Corinthians in Brazil, led the way with eight goals in the campaign, during which he became hiscountry’s record goalscorer. The Dutch lost to Argentina in an enthralling andill-tempered quarter-finalin the last World Cup in Qatar.BelgiumRudi Garcia’s side hammered Liechtenstein 7-0 in their final qualification match to confirm their berth, finishing their campaign unbeaten. A fifth victory in eight games saw Belgium top Group J in front of Wales. After being powered to the semi-finals at the 2018 competition in Russia by their golden generation, the Belgians flopped last time out in Qatar,exiting at the group stage.SpainThe European champions and Fifa’s No 1-ranked side sealed their spot courtesy of a 2-2 draw with Turkey in their final group game. Real Sociedad’s Mikel Oyarzabal, who scored the winner in theEuro 2024 final against England, and Arsenal’s Mikel Merino were joint top scorers for Spain in qualifying, with six goals each. But all eyes will be on Barcelona’s teenage sensation Lamine Yamal in the summer to see if he can inspire his nation to a second World Cup triumph.ScotlandTwenty-eight years later, Scotland will be back in a World Cup finals. They earned their spot in dramatic fashion, with Kenny McLean’s strike from the halfway line securing a4-2 victory over Denmarkthat saw them top Group C. After the historic achievement, captain Andy Robertson said: “That just sums up this squad. Never say die, we just keep going right to the end. One of the craziest games of football. We’ve certainly put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it – we’re going to the World Cup and I can’t believe it.”AustriaLike Scotland, Ralf Rangnick’s side will be making their first appearance at a World Cup since France 98. A 1-1 draw with Bosnia-Herzegovina secured top spot in Group H in the final game. Marko Arnautovic, now 36 andplaying his club football at Red Star Belgrade, led the way with eight goals in the qualifying campaign.SwitzerlandSwitzerland have reached every World Cup finals since 2006 and continued that record by topping qualifying Group B with four wins from six matches. Having exited at the last-16 stage for the past three World Cup finals, however, Murat Yakin’s side – who are captained by Granit Xhaka - will be hoping to finally go further this time around in North America.See the full Uefa standingshere.North America, Central America and the CaribbeanThe three automatic qualification spots have been taken byCuraçao,HaitiandPanama. JamaicaandSurinamego tothe intercontinental playoffs as the two best runners-up.CuraçaoTheDutch Caribbean island nation are going to their first World Cup and are the smallest nation by population (156,000) to have qualified for a finals. They sealed their place with a goalless draw in Jamaica in the absence of their coach, Dick Advocaat, the 78-year-old former Rangers and Netherlands manager missing the game for personal reasons. Curaçao went through qualifying unbeaten.HaitiHaiti, wholast appeared in the World Cup in 1974, secured their spot with a 2-0 win over Nicaragua. The decisive victory was achieved in Curaçao, where the team have played home qualifiers owing to unrest in their homeland. They are coached by the Frenchman Sébastien Migné, whose previous posts include Congo-Brazzaville, Kenya, Equatorial Guinea. Two squad members, Hannes Delcroix and Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, are in English football.PanamaA 3-0 win over El Salvador took Panama back to the World Cup, their only previous appearance having come in 2018. They qualified unbeaten under the former Leeds and Union Saint-Gilloise coach Thomas Christiansen. Several of the squad play in Venezuela or Mexico. The right-back Michael Amir Murillo is with Marseille.See the full Concacaf standingshere.TheUS,CanadaandMexicoare all taking part as tournament hosts.OceaniaOne automatic place has been secured, by New Zealand.New Caledonia, a French overseas territory not recognised by Fifa until 2004, will play in March’s intercontinental playoffs after losing the Oceania qualifying final.New ZealandIn a land where rugby union is a sporting religion, any success by the All Whites is to be savoured. New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36. Kosta Barbarouses doubled New Zealand’s lead shortly after, before Eli Just wrapped up the result in the 80th minute.See the full OFC standingshere.South AmericaThe six direct spots have all been all filled.Boliviasecured the confederation’s playoff place with a surprise 1-0 win over Brazil in El Alto.ArgentinaThe holders claimed their spot on 25 March when Bolivia drew 0-0 with Uruguay. The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras.UruguayMarcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guidedLa Celesteto their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

In adisastrous Nations League finalsin March: Where was the fight? Where was thelikability? In a shorthanded summer slate: Where wasthe commitmentfrom the team’s best players?How deep is this team, really? And for head coach Mauricio Pochettino, the entire time: Where is the signature win?After Tuesday’s 5-1 smashing of a mostly first-choice Uruguay side in Tampa, Florida, there will be a new question added: Please can theWorld Cupstart tomorrow?The United States, having made nine changes from Saturday’ssolid 2-1 winover Paraguay, were nonetheless rampant through the first 45 minutes on Tuesday evening. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter struck first with a curling beauty off a set piece, before setting up right-back Alex Freeman off a corner kick to double the lead. Freeman then finished off a great team goal, dribbling through two Uruguay defenders before scoring the United States’ third. Diego Luna capped the flurry with a smart finish off a cutback.Gio Reyna and Sergiño Dest: X-factors that could fuel the USMNT World CupRead morePochettino, for his part, wasn’t getting carried away. When this team was floundering at rock bottom, the Argentinian insisted that positive results were good to have, but not strictly necessary, in friendlies at least. And after half-time, with his team – lacking many of Pochettino’s first-choice players – holding a 4-1 lead over one of the world’s best sides, he again told the TNT broadcast that the result was not important. He seemed mostly perturbed by the US allowingUruguaya route back into the game – in the 44th minute, Uruguay’s Giorgian de Arrascaeta rattled the woodwork with a powerful effort, before taking advantage of a US scramble in their own penalty area to score off an impressive, acrobatic bicycle kick.It was an exclamation point to a mostly dreadful first-half for Marcelo Bielsa’s side, who hardly ever got out of second gear. Though in fairness, they were dealt an early shock with Berhalter’s opener.After Haji Wright won a free-kick just off the left edge of the penalty area, Berhalter put the expertise on set pieces he has displayed consistently in MLS to good use on the international stage. The Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder tapped the ball to Sergiño Dest, who returned the service to Berhalter’s right foot, and he curled in an exquisite effort past goalkeeper Cristopher Fiermarin for the opener 15 minutes in. It was Berhalter’s first goal for the national team – something his father, former USMNT head coach Gregg – never did in his 44-cap playing career as a center-back.From there, it was the Freeman show for a time. Berhalter put the ball on the promising Orlando City youngster’s head at the far post to double the Americans’ lead in the 20th minute, but it was the US’s third that was really special. After a strong, smart tackle in midfield by late call-in Timmy Tillman and a quick-thinking ball forward from Auston Trusty, Freeman gathered the ball and ran directly at the Uruguay defense, turning two defenders inside-out before notching a delicate finish in the 31st.Tillman’s great work continued. As the first-half drew to a close, the LAFC midfielder found acres of space in the center of the Uruguay defense, allowing him time to look up as defenders converged. He cut the ball back to an onrushing Luna, who made no mistake with his finish to make it 4-0.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A team mostly made up of players on the World Cup squad bubble had dominated a first-choice Uruguay, who rarely looked close to matching the US – even less so after Rodrigo Betancur’s 64th-minute red card for a high tackle on Berhalter.Two substitutes capped the win four minutes later, as Gio Reyna followed his fine performance on Saturday with a nice ball in the box for Tanner Tessmann, who headed home past a stranded goalkeeper and a flat-footed defense.It’s the kind of win Pochettino has long craved – one where the result and the performance match to devastating effect.

But look at the picture!I am. Where are all those lights hanging from?They’re just floating. It’s part of the magic.And there’s snow on the ground.

Lots of visitors have reported turning up to find nothing but locked gates, security fencing and puddles.So there’s no truth to it?There is a festive pop-up in the Royal Mews gift shop round the corner from the palace gates, with royal-themed Christmas gifts and a single hut selling hot drinks out back.That’s not the same thing.So the Royal Collection Trust has been obliged to clarify. “There will not be a Christmas market at Buckingham Palace,” it says.Is this kind of AI hoaxing common these days?I’m afraid it is.

It’s also very durable, so it’s great for coffee table reading. While a Fire tablet isn’t as useful as a full Android tablet, at this price it’s still a great deal, even if it only ends up as your Netflix screen to go.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJBL Live Pro 2$89.95, originally $169.95 at Amazon (47% off)JBL is an iconic name in sound, and the JBL Live Pro 2 are some of my favorite earbuds. They have excellent Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which makes it easier to listen to your music at a lower volume to avoid hearing damage. You also get excellent battery life, at up to 10 hours on a single charge, so these can be a great musical companion for the vibe-coders in your life to blot out the world for hours while they crack on the next big thing. I’d heartily recommend them at full price, so at half-off they’re a no brainer.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBlink Outdoor 4 Wireless smart security camera$51.99, originally $129.99 at Amazon (60%)Smart cameras typically come with a big trade-off: you need to either run an ugly wire to them or change the battery every couple months. But the Blink Outdoor 4 Wireless camera sidesteps both with a battery that can last up to two years. I’ve had one for about a year so far, and the battery shows no signs of stopping. You can put this camera anywhere it has access to wifi and basically forget it exists, except when you want to see what’s going on in your yard.

This particular bundle also includes a case with an origami-style leg to prop up the tablet up for watching shows on the go. Like the larger model, it’s mainly a media machine, so imagine it more like a portable TV than a full-fledged tablet. At this price, it’s still well worth it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra$1,057.91, originally $1,499.99 at Amazon (25%)I review phones year-round, and this is the one I go back to when I’m not reviewing anything else.

It has an amazing camera setup great for ultrawide snaps and zooming in to a crazy degree, onboard AI including Gemini Live, epic battery life (easily a day and a half), and a built-in stylus for those times you want precision in your tapping and swiping. This price tag may not seem like much of a discount since the S25 Ultra usually starts at about $1,200, but this is the upgraded model with 512GB storage, which you’re going to want.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy S25 FE$534.99, originally $709.99 at Amazon (25%)Samsung’s “fan edition” (FE) devices are designed for buyers who want a flagship phone experience at a lower price point. That means the S25 FE phone has most of the same chops as its larger siblings, including all the same AI tricks, and an impressive triple-camera setup that’s no joke. It’s a great value even at full price, and at 27% off one of the best phone deals out there for Black Friday.Personal audioView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphonesskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 19 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 10.01 ESTShareArc Raiders is, by all accounts, a late game-of-the-year contender. Dropped into a multiplayer world overrun with hostile drones and military robots, every human player is at the mercy of the machines – and each other. Can you trust the other raider you’ve spotted on your way back to humanity’s safe haven underground, or will they shoot you and take everything you’ve just scavenged? Perhaps surprisingly, humanity is (mostly) choosing to band together, according to most people I’ve talked to about this game.In areview for Gamespot, Mark Delaney paints a beguiling picture of Arc Raiders’s potential for generating war stories, and highlights its surprisingly hopeful tone as the thing that elevates it above similar multiplayer extraction shooters: “We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I’ve ever played.”But, but, but, but … There is a small irony to Arc’s depiction of humanity united against the machines. The game uses AI-generated text-to-speech voices, trained on real actors. (The game also uses machine learning to improve the behaviour and animation of its robot enemies, a different type of “AI”, which video games have been using for ever.) Games writer Rick Lane found this to be so ethically compromising that he couldn’t look past it. “For Arc Raiders to ride the wave of human sociability all the way to the bank, while also being so contemptuous of the thing that makes us social animals – carving up human voices and reassembling them like a digital Victor Frankenstein – demonstrates a lack of artistic integrity that I find impossible to ignore,”he wrote for Eurogamer.Generative AI in video game development is becoming a red-line issue for many players (although it’s impossible to tellhowmany – neither social media outrage nor Steam forum sentiment are reliable predictors of how most people actually feel). It gives a lot of people, myself included, the ick. Last week, the new Call of Duty alsocame under fire(sorry) for using supposedly AI-generated art; people absolutely hate it. Proponents of the use of generative AI in games often say that it empowers smaller developers to do more with less, but Call of Duty is a multibillion-dollar franchise. Activision can more than afford to pay artists to draw something. Given Arc Raiders’s success, you could say the same about its AI voice lines.It is an existential issue for video game workers – artists, writers and voice actors particularly, but also coders – who may be at risk of losing out to this technology. Many believe that gaming’s corporate overlords would be thrilled to replace expensive, inconvenient humans with machines that generate inadequate but functional work. Take EA, which is mandating that its employees use the company’s internal suite of AI tools, even thoughthey are apparently widely hated. And then there’s Krafton, which proudly declared itself an AI-first game developer before offering its Korean employeesvoluntary redundancy.View image in fullscreenUnder fire … Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been called out for using AI-generated art.Photograph: ActivisionIndeed, most of the people rushing to defend the use of generative AI in games are not everyday players or on-the-ground developers, but the corporate class. Epic’s Tim Sweeney – net worth $5bn, give or take – posted on X a series of replies to Eurogamer’s Arc Raiders review, beginning with the familiar, facepalm-inducing entreaty to keep “politics” out of video game reviews (“Political opinions should go into op-eds folks.). Sweeney argued that generative AI could “transform gaming”, evoking a dystopian vision of the future: “Instead of games having a few dozen or hundred lines of prerecorded dialogue, how about infinite, context-sensitive, personality-reflecting dialogue based on and tuned by human voice actors?”Personally, I do not want a machine constantly generating things it thinks I want to hear. I would rather have characters speak lines written by humans with something to say, performed by other humans who understand that meaning. As the award-winning video game actor Jane Perry put it in an interview withGamesIndustry.biz: “Will a bot scuttle up to the stage at the Games awards or the Baftas to accept an award for best performance? I think most audiences prefer a real human performance; however, the creative drive of the tech elite is incredibly strong, especially when the name of the game is to replace humans with machines.”In my many years covering this beat, I have noticed that what happens in the video game world often happens in the wider world. A few years ago, there was a rush of investment in Web3/blockchain-driven games that bought into the idea of NFTs – digital “artworks” that people could own and trade, all of which were just unbelievably ugly, all rad skulls and gurning computer-generated apes smoking cigars; thankfully,that bubble burstspectacularly. When the big tech world suddenly latched on to theidea of the “metaverse”a few years ago, gaming companies had already been building much better versions of that idea for decades. And Gamergate provided a blueprint for the weaponisation of disaffected young men that directly influenced the Trump campaign playbook and set the template for the now omnipresent culture wars. This is why anyone interested in the impact of AI on work and culture should be looking at the ripples that that technology is making among developers and players. It can be an interesting predictor.What we’re seeing play out looks like a familiar struggle between the people who actually make things, and those who profit off that labour. We’re also seeing players question whether they should pay the same money for games that include lower-quality, machine-generated art and voices. And we are seeing new lines being drawn around which uses of AI are culturally and ethically acceptable, and which are not.What to playView image in fullscreenA plot less travelled … Goodnight Universe.Photograph: Nice Dream/Skybound GamesFrom the people behind the devastating Before Your Eyes comesGoodnight Universe, a game in which you playa super-intelligent six-month-old baby with psychic powers. It’s narrated by the baby’s inner monologue: wee Isaac suspects that he’s a lot smarter than a baby should be, and finds it exceptionally frustrating that he seems unable to communicate his thoughts and feelings to his family. But soon he develops telekinetic abilities and the power to read minds, attracting unwanted attention. If you have a webcam, you can play it with your eyes, by looking around and blinking. This game packs an emotional punch and the plot also goes places I wasn’texpecting.

This will let you control your thermostat remotely, usually through a mobile app, meaning you can turn your heating off or down if you have had an unexpected change of plan. A smart thermostat effectively adds a timer to a boilerYou can then use the app to schedule heating and hot water.Smart thermostats vary and can offer different features, including multi-room control, hot water control, and “geofencing” to track when you leave and enter your home. They typically cost between £60 and £250, depending on the make and model.View image in fullscreenSwitching to a smart thermostatallows you to control your thermostat remotely, usually through a mobile app.Photograph: StefaNikolic/Getty ImagesSome can be fitted without help, such as the Bosch Room Thermostat II (£69,99on Amazon); others, such as the Hive Thermostat V4 (£155on B&Q) require professional fitting. This can normally be booked through the retailer, but may incur an additional cost.Some energy suppliers offer deals on smart thermostats made by companies they have partnerships with, such asOctopus Energy’s partnership with tado°, which gives customers up to 50% off tado° products. A Wireless Smart Thermostat X Starter Kit is £112, down from £159.99.Reduce temperaturesTurning down your thermostat from 22C to 21C can save a typical household £90 a year in Great Britain, according to theEnergy Saving Trust. For most people, a comfortable temperature falls somewhere between 18C and 21C.According toCitizens Advice, every degree you turn your thermostat down can save you about 10% on your energy bill, but it warns that if you are elderly or have a health condition you should not set it below 21C.View image in fullscreenFor most people, a comfortable temperature in the home is between 18C and 21C.Photograph: Ridofranz/Getty ImagesIt also advises that having the heating on all the time at a low temperature will cost more than having it on at a slightly higher temperature but for a shorter interval.Setting the heating to go off 30 minutes before you leave the house or go to sleep will also reduce your bill.Lower the flowIf you have a combi boiler, you can lower its flow temperature – that is, the temperature of the water flowing out and to the radiators.If you have a system boiler or a hot water cylinder,EDF Energy advisesyou don’t do this on your own but get advice from an engineer.On many boilers the flow temperature is set too high by default, at about 75-80C. Reducing it to about 60C can cut your gas bill without making much difference to how warm you feel.“This is especially effective in homes with well-sized radiators and good insulation … and doesn’t noticeably affect comfort,” Pennells says.The charity Nesta has an interactive onlinetoolthat gives detailed instructions on how to change the setting on your boiler. The charity recommends you take a picture of the boiler controls and settings before proceeding so that you have a record of your initial settings.Turn downradiatorsIf you have thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs), the dial that controls how much hot water enters the radiator it is attached to, you will be able to adjust the temperature separately in each room. TRVs usually have a scale from 0 to 6, where 0 is off and 6 is fully open.We’ve found that people have changed their behaviours and started to warm the person rather than the houseSophie Burr of National Energy ActionTheEnergySaving Trust recommends putting it on the lowest setting that keeps the room at a comfortable temperature, which could be 3 or 4 for rooms you use the most and 2 or 3 for others. It says adding TRVs to a system that already has a programmer and thermostat can save a household £35 a year.While it may be tempting to turn off your heating in the name of saving cash, experts say this can lead to mould and damp – and this could be more costly and dangerous to deal with in the long term.“During the energy crisis, we’ve found that people have changed their behaviours and started to warm the person rather than the house,” says Sophie Burr, the project development coordinator atNational Energy Action. “Our research has shown that it is more cost-effective to heat the whole space while turning the radiators down to number 2 in rooms you are not using, allowing some heat in those rooms and preventing the growth of mould spores, which can have serious health impacts such as worsening respiratory conditions.”GetreflectorsTheBritish Gas Energy Trustadvises that you use foil behind radiators to reflect heat back into the room. Radiator reflectors allow that heat to be dispersed into the room rather than just get absorbed by an external wall, as 35% of the heat in a room is lost through the walls. Reflectors are particularly beneficial on uninsulated external walls.Although an initial additional cost, they are fairly cheap to buy, easy to install and should last. They can be bought in rolls, and then cut to fit any radiator. They are easy to apply using a provided adhesive or double-sided tape – just make sure the radiators are off and cool first. Screwfix sells a 1.88 sq metre roll for£7.51, B&Q has a 5 sq metre roll for£14.97and Amazon sells a 15 sq metre one for£27.99.Bleed your radiators every few months so they run efficiently. To do this, make sure your radiators are off and cool. Insert a key (£3.50for a two-pack from B&Q) or a flat-head screwdriver into the bleed valve on the radiator, usually at the top corner, and turn it anti-clockwise. You should hear a hissing sound as the air escapes but wait for the hissing to stop and a steady stream of water to appear (which you can catch with a cloth) before turning the valve clockwise to close it again.View image in fullscreenA boiler service will improve its efficiency.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAAvoid covering your radiators with furniture or curtains – especially under windows. This will help the heat spread wider.Keep your boiler servicedA boiler service will improve its efficiency and extend its lifespan by catching and fixing minor problems. Octopus Energy says an unserviced boiler can use up to 10% more energy than one that is annually checked out. “If a boiler is not serviced regularly, it can have a significant impact on fuel efficiency and health,” Burr says.According to Which?, a standard boiler service costs between £70 and £110.Some energy companies offer a service as part of their annual cover plans – British Gas, for example, has one in itsHomeCarepolicy, which starts at £19 a month. However, a boiler care plan isn’t for everyone. Which? says that while a cover plan can give peace of mind, sometimes the monthly payments add up to more than paying for an annual service and repairs when needed. It recommends weighing up if you have enough savings to pay for an annual service outright every time.If you live in rented housing, it is your landlord’s responsibility to ensure that the boiler is serviced and certified yearly. “Annual boiler servicing for all homes in the rental sector is a requirement by law,” Burr says. “For properties with gas boilers, this must be carried out by a Gas Safe engineer, and for oil boilers, by an Oftec-certified engineer. Annual boiler servicing will ensure that the appliance is working efficiently and is not leaking carbon monoxide into your home.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsMoney hacksSaving moneyConsumer affairsHousehold billsEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anxiety over billions in investment in artificial intelligence pervaded, in part because the US has been starved of reliable economic data by the recent government shutdown.Investors hoped that both questions would be in part answered by Nvidia’s earnings and by a jobs report due on Thursday morning.“This is a ‘So goes Nvidia, so goes the market’ kind of report,” Scott Martin, chief investment officer at Kingsview Wealth Management,told Bloombergin a concise summary of market sentiment.The prospect of a market mood swing had built in advance of the earnings call, with options markets anticipating Nvidia’s shares could move 6%, or $280bn in value, up or down. Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI’s chief equities strategist,told the Financial Timesthat “angst around ‘peak AI’ has been palpable”.The anxiety has only been heightened by signs that some AI players, including Palantir’s Peter Thiel, Japanese investor Masayoshi of SoftBank have recently sold off multi-billion positions in Nvidia if only (in the case of Softbank) to place those funds in OpenAI. Michael Burry, who became a legend on Wall Street for taking a short position ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, announced that he was shorting Nvidia and Palantir stock – and warned of an AI bubble – before abruptly winding down his investment company, Scion Asset Management.Analysts had expected the chip behemoth to show more than 50% growth in both net income and revenue in its fiscal third quarter as the tech giants – Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta – that represent more than 40% of Nvidia’s sales continue to pour billions into the chipmaker.The company reported growth beyond even those lofty expectations. Nvidia reported $57.01bn in total revenues, beating investor expectations of $54.9bn in revenue. Sales increased 62% year-over-year, and profit rose 65% year-on-year to $31.9bn. On the key metric of data-center sales,the company reported $51.2bn in revenue, beating expectations of $49bn.Nvidia’s future looks bright, too. The company is projecting fourth-quarter revenue of around $65bn; analysts had predicted the company would issue a guidance of $61bn.CEO Jensen Huang addressed the elephant in the room on Wednesday’s earnings call after Nvidia’s stellar numbers were released.“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” he said. “From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI from pre-training to post-training to inference.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Investors have grown wary of the AI boom, with shares in Nvidia and Palantir, a major AI player, falling more than 10% since peaking last month.The Nasdaq stock exchange has seen a broad, panicked selloff over the past few days in response to these fears. Still, Nvidia shares are up about 37% for the year to date, and they rose in after-hours trading on Wednesday.The Nvidia earnings report, and investor reaction over the coming hours or days, will be read into for broader economic signals because AI is now intimately tied, correctly or falsely, to broader economic confidence, with Nvidia as the foundation for the entire artificial intelligence buildout.“Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout was a bubble and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management after the earnings report was released.For bullish analysts, fears that the AI revolution would soon follow the path of internet stocks in 1999 have been entirely overblown, and the AI party is only just getting started.“The largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real,” Zaccarelli added.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)NvidiaUS economyEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, Trump hosted the prince for lunch and talks at the White House, followed by a black-tie dinner that included members of Congress, business leaders and top administration officials. The next day, Trump and the prince appeared together at a US-Saudi investment summit at the Kennedy Center.It’s all part of a rehabilitation tour for Prince Mohammed, years after US intelligence agencies concluded thathe had orderedthe assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and Saudi dissident. In October 2018, Khashoggi was ambushed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member hit team, who dismembered his body with a bone saw. For a time, the killing turned Prince Mohammed into an international pariah. But Trump never wavered in his support of the Saudi leader, and during his first termprotected the princefrom US sanctions and pressure from Congress.Prince Mohammed later repaid the favor to Trump: after a mob of the president’s supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, several US banks and other businessescut ties withthe Trump Organization, which was already reeling from financial losses that hammered the tourism industry at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. But Saudi Arabia stood by Trump and his family business, expanding variousreal estate dealsand golf partnerships that helped Trump at one of his lowest points. During his years out of power, the kingdom and its crown prince became one of the most importantsources of new dealsfor the Trump brand, which had become toxic for many US businesses and consumers after the Capitol riot.Trump has now rewarded Prince Mohammed with a victory tour of the US, along with new American security guarantees for the kingdom anda planned saleof billions of dollars in advanced US fighter jets. But Trump was also eager to repay the prince’s loyalty with an extravagant welcome that is usually reserved for the closest US allies. “I just want to thank you,”Trump toldthe prince at the White House on Tuesday in front of reporters and cabinet members. “We’ve been really good friends for a long period of time. We’ve always been on the same side of every issue.”Aside from heaping praise on his friend, Trump also fiercely defended the prince when a reporter asked about Khashoggi’s murder. “Things happen,”Trump saidof the assassination and then insisted that Prince Mohammed “knew nothing about it” – despite US intelligence agencies concluding otherwise during Trump’s first term.The president’s treatment of Prince Mohammed underscores his corrupt and transactional approach to governing, and the ways that wealthy autocrats have learned to exploit Trump by supporting his extensive business interests. The prince and his advisers know that Trump views the world in terms of deals won or lost – and they’re eager to cultivate a closer relationship with the president by boosting his family business, along with deals to buy US weapons and make investments. Days after Trump began his second term in January, the prince pledged he wouldinvest $600bnin the US economy over the next four years. On Tuesday, he promised to increase that pledge to $1tn, although the details of exactly how Saudi investments would reach that levelremain hazy.For Prince Mohammed, the primary goal of his visit, aside from being lavished with Trump’s praise, was to secure a defense cooperation agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia. That deal falls short of theformal defense treatythat the kingdom has sought for years, but such a treaty would require approval from Congress. For now, Trump offered an agreement to extend US defense guarantees, boost weapons sales and increase intelligence sharing. (In September, Trump signed a similarexecutive orderfocused on Qatar, which promised the US would come to the emirate’s defense if it is attacked.)The prince also signed a deal for Saudi Arabia to buy dozens of F-35 stealth fighter jets, America’s most advanced warplane.Pentagon officials are worriedthat, if the sale goes through in the coming years, China might be able to acquire the plane’s technology through espionage or its security partnership with the kingdom. For his part, Trump tried to persuade the Saudi leader to establish diplomatic relations with Israel now that the US administration has brokered a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza. Trump dreams of securing a Nobel peace prize by negotiating an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but the prince has vowed not to sign a deal with Israel until it commits to the establishment of a Palestinian state.Even if Prince Mohammed did not relent on a normalization deal with Israel, he has amassed more goodwill with Trump than most other world leaders. And much of that benevolence is rooted in Saudi Arabia’s support for Trump’s golf resorts and other businesses when he was out of office. After the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the PGA of America cancelled its 2022 major championship at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “It’s become clear that conducting the PGA championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand,”the group’s presidentsaid at the time.But Trump soon convinced a rival group, the LIV Golf league, which is financed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund that is controlled by the crown prince, tohost its tournamentsat his golf courses. The tournaments brought Trump’s properties back into the professional golfing circuit after the Trump Organization had lost the PGA championship, one of golf’s four major competitions. The LIV Golf tournaments, which have been held at Trump courses in Bedminster, Miami and Washington, providedmillions of dollarsin revenue for the Trump family business.And the Saudi-backed league is still paying to use Trump’s properties for its tournaments, even after his reelection. In April, Trump’s golf club outside Miami hosted athree-day tournamentfor the LIV Golf circuit, an event that was almost entirely funded by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. LIV Golf paid the Trump Organizationa site rental feeof around seven figures, which doesn’t include revenue generated by hotel room rentals, restaurants and other services. In 2023, Trump calledthe incomehis businesses receive from deals like those with LIV Golf “peanuts”. Butgovernance watchdog groupssay the Saudi-backed league’s payments to Trump’s golf courses violate the constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which prohibits the president from receiving gifts from foreign powers.In Trump’s first term, his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, cultivated a close relationship between the president and Prince Mohammed, who at the time was consolidating power as the kingdom’s de-facto ruler under his ailing father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. After Khashoggi’s assassination in 2018, the prince became more dependent on Trump and Kushner, who worked to protect him from fallout over the journalist’s murder.As members of Congress demanded sanctions against the crown prince, Trump maintained his support for the Saudi leader and pressed forcontinued weapons salesand business deals with the kingdom. Prince Mohammed eventually blamed rogue Saudi operatives for the gruesome killing. But aUS intelligence report, which Trump refused to make public, concluded that the crown prince had ordered the assassination.The report, which was released by Joe Biden’s administration a month after it took office, noted that since 2017, Prince Mohammed “has had absolute control of the kingdom’s security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the crown prince’s authorization”.Days after Khashoggi’s killing, Trump was asked by reporters in the Oval Office whether he would cancel billions of dollars in US weapons sales to Saudi Arabia if its leaders were implicated. “We don’t like it even a little bit,”Trump responded. “But whether or not we should stop $110bn from being spent in this country… That would not be acceptable to me.”At the time, Trump’s comments about the loss of arms sales struck many as a crass attempt to justify Khashoggi’s assassination. But Trump had dropped any pretense of concern for human rights and political freedoms, which past US presidents used to obscure decades of American military support for repressive regimes likeSaudi Arabia. Trump stripped the US-Saudi alliance down to its transactional core: Washington protects the House of Saud in exchange for the Saudi regime keeping global oil prices stable and buying a steady supply of US weapons.With little restraint on his powers, Trump has expanded that corrupt and transactional method of governing in his second term. And autocrats like Prince Mohammed are eager to benefit from Trump’s brazen effort to use the presidency to enrich himself and his family.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpMohammed bin SalmanSaudi ArabiacommentShareReuse this content"

This is a new lowJodie GinsbergJamal Khashoggi was dismembered in a Saudi consulate. The president says ‘things happen’Wed 19 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 12.12 ESTShare“Things happen.” Just two words. That’s all it took forDonald Trumpto effectively dismiss what is probably the most infamous journalist killing of the last decade – and in so doing plumbed a new low in his contempt for journalists, for journalism – and for the truth.The US president’s dismissal of the murder of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi came in a press conference with the Saudi crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman– a man whom the CIA found in a 2021 report had orchestrated the kidnap and killing of the Washington Post columnist in 2018. (Prince Mohammed has denied involvement.)The US intelligence services were not the only ones to conclude the murder – which took place in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and in which the 59-year-old Khashoggi was drugged and dismembered – was signed off at the highest levels. An investigation led by then UN special rapporteur, Agnès Callamard, reached similar conclusions.For a brief period, governments were unified in their condemnation of Saudi Arabia’s actions. The US imposed sanctions and visa bans in 2021 over the killing, although it stopped short of sanctioning Prince Mohammed himself. Since then, the kingdom has been slowly rehabilitating itself – and the crown prince’s visit to Washington seemed to be the final confirmation of that redemption.Critics of the regime had roundly condemned the visit. But what was on display at the White House was worse than could have been imagined. Not only did Trump fete Prince Mohammed but he effectively rewrote history – and then blamed the victim. Prince Mohammed, Trump asserted when asked, knew nothing about the killing – in direct contradiction to what his country’s own intelligence services concluded four years ago. Moreover, Trump said: “A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about, whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen.”This marks a new and abject low for a president who has made little secret of his contempt for the truth – or for the press. Trump has smeared journalists (he called ABC news, whose reporter asked the question about Khashoggi at the Saudi press conference “fake news”), berated them in public (he called one a “piggy” this week for asking about his relationship with the convicted sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein), sued news outlets for eye-watering sums of money in vexatious law suits, and called for news outlets he doesn’t like to lose their licenses.He has forced veteran news services out of the White House press pool for refusing to use language of his choosing, and he has gutted funding for essential public media at home and vital independent media abroad.All of that has created an environment in which journalists are manifestly less safe in the US, but one in which their targeting – and indeed killing – becomes not just unimportant (“things happen”) but acceptable (“a lot of people didn’t like that gentleman”).It is no surprise that 2024 was the deadliest year on record for journalists in the more than 30 years the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has been documenting this data: a persistent failure to hold those responsible for journalist killings has created a culture of impunity in which journalists’ killers are literally able to get away with murder and so continue to do so.Nowhere is this more evident than in Israel, which is responsible for the killing of more than 200 journalists in the past two years.The impact on society is profound. Attacks on journalists are attacks on the truth. They are attacks on facts. They are attacks on our rights to know and on our freedom to live freely and safely.On Thursday, CPJ gathers for its annual International Press Freedom awards. My message there is the same as my one for Trump: these things may happen. But it is our responsibility to make sure they do not.Jodie Ginsberg is CEO of the Committee to Protect JournalistsExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionMohammed bin SalmanJamal KhashoggicommentShareReuse this content"

I bring you tidings from theNazi-filledwilderness that is now X, whereMaga-adjacentbillionaire Bill Ackman has generously decided todispense romantic adviceto the masses. Online culture, Ackman notes, has “destroyed the ability to spontaneously meet strangers”. The antidote to this, he suggests, are four simple words.“May I meet you?”That’s it. That’s the strategy. Ackman used this pickup line throughout his youth and, he says, it served him well. He didn’t even have to put “I’m a billionaire,” in front of the sentence – it was the syntax that women found sexy.“I think the combination of proper grammar and politeness was the key to its effectiveness,” Ackman mused. “You might give it a try.” And by “you”, he explains, he means everyone, not just young heterosexual men. “I think it should also work for women seeking men as well as same sex interactions,” Ackman proclaimed.View image in fullscreenBill Ackman speaks at the Wall Street Journal digital conference in Laguna Beach, California, on 17 October 2017.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersA real man of the people, Ackman took time out of his busy billionaire schedule to add a little more context to his advice, which he explains is motivated by concern about the “next generation’s happiness and population replacement rates”. Per Ackman, you should try to be in motion while chatting someone up. This strategy “works much more effectively when you are moving”,he noted. “So on subways, elevators, escalators, airplanes, buses, and even walking down the street, it is most effective.”I have debased myself for numerous columns (just Google “Arwa Mahdawi accidental laxatives” or “Arwa banana”) but I do have my limits. Walking around the streets of Philadelphia asking women who set off my gaydar “may I meet you?” being one of them.But while I haven’t tried the Ackman approach myself, the advice has gone viral and various other people aregiving it a whirl. It’s too early to do a quantitative assessment of its effectiveness but I hope that some enterprising social scientists are applying for funding for a future study. It’s perfect material for a futureIg Nobel prize.Young people might go out on the town more if the cost of living hadn’t become so expensive, and they had more disposable incomeWhile we wait for a peer-reviewed analysis to come out, I must confess that I have my doubts that imposing yourself on strangers in the subway is going to do much to help “population replacement rates”. This may be a wild take but it’s possible that not supporting genocidal wars (Ackman has been abig cheerleaderof Israel’s actions in Gaza) that have made prenatal carevirtually nonexistentand killed an average ofa child an hour, might be more effective when it comes to population replacement. That’s assuming we think all populations are equal, of course.Doing something about the exorbitant price of childcare, and the dire state of public schools in affordable areas of the US might also encourage more people to have kids. Since I’m churning out the hot takes over here, it’s also possible that young people might go out on the town more if the cost of living hadn’t become so expensive, and they hadmore disposable income. In short: solving underlying social issues that wealth-hoarding billionaires have exacerbated might prove more effective than a grammatically interesting pickup line.But what do I know, eh? I’m not a billionaire. Far better if plebs like me keep quiet and listen to our social and economic betters. So, in that spirit, and in the hopes of solving the population crisis, I have put together a few bits of relationship advice from the rich and infamous:1Putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing: avoid at all costsOnce you have found your future spouse through the May-I-Meet™ method, you should try to hold on to them. According to our great leader Donald Trump that means avoiding a working relationship. “If you’re in business for yourself, I really think it’s a bad idea to put your wife working for you. I think it’s a really bad idea. I think that was the single greatest cause of what happened to my marriage with [first wife] Ivana,” Trump toldABC newsin 1994. RIP Ivana, who is now dead andburied under the first holeof Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.2 Sabotage your co-worker’s carFox News host Jesse Watters is not a billionaire like Ackman or Trump, but he lives in amansionso is still worth listening to. During a 2022 episode of the panel series The Five, Watters boasted that he “let the air out of“ now wife Emma DiGiovine’s tires when he “was trying to get [her] to date” him. “She couldn’t go anywhere. She needed a lift, I said, ‘Hey, you need a lift?’ She hopped right in the car,” Watters recalled. The Fox news host was 43 at the time, by the way, and DiGiovine, who is his second wife, was 29 and anassociate producer on his showat Fox News. After some backlash about “Deflategate” he claimed this tactic, which he said “works like a charm”,was a joke.Jeffrey Epstein’s emails reveal a disdain for morality among the elite | Moira DoneganRead more3Cozy up to a sex offender (DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT)The latest batch of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents to be released reveal that Harvard professor and economist Larry Summersspent years discussingrelationship advice with the convicted pedophile. In one 2018 email, Summers forwarded Epstein an email from a woman and asked for advice on when to write back. “Think no response for a while probably appropriate,” Summers said. Epstein agreed: “she’s already beginning to sound needy :) nice.” In another email Summers complained that attitudes to dating had become too woke. The “American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard,” he wrote to Epstein. “But hit on a few women 10 years ago and can’t work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”4Offer your sperm to strangers over supperIf one is simply concerned with increasing the population rather than meeting a life partner you can always go the Elon Musk route and donate your sperm willy-nilly. According to a2024 New York Times report, Musk has “offered his own sperm to friends and acquaintances”. The same piece notes: “At a dinner party held at the home of a well-known Silicon Valley executive [in 2023] Mr. Musk offered to provide his sperm to a married couple he had met socially only a handful of times.” (Musk has denied this.) Or, if that sounds too exhausting, you can be like Russian-born billionaire Pavel Durov andfund free IVF treatmentsfor women who use your sperm. Durov now hasmore than 100 biological childrenin 12 countries via sperm donation. Perhaps, in the future, one of Durov’s children will bump into one of Musk’s many children and ask: “May I meet you?”Explore more on these topicsThe super-richOpinionDatingDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinElon MuskUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Eighty years on, it is increasingly being said that we are living through a moment of great change, towards a world that is without such law.In September, the Financial Times published an editorial headlined “A world without rules”. That view was premised on two incidents: Israel’s launch of a missile strike on a building that hosted Hamas officials in Qatar; and the flight of 19 Russian drones into Polish airspace. This flouting of the previous “rules-based order”, the FT said, was now producing “a kind of anarchy and a proliferation of violence”.Others have adopted what appears to be a more sanguine – or accepting – view. Last year in the New Statesman, John Bew, history professor at King’s College London and former foreign policy adviser at 10 Downing Street under Boris Johnson,addressed the“rules-based system” and challenged the attitude of those advocating for its continuing role, including me, as having a “sentimental” view. “Much as we may wish it to be the case, we are not in a rule-of-law era today,” he wrote. In his view, “raw power is being asserted everywhere we look”, and those who operate on the global stage are wilfully breaking the rules of the post-1945 legal international order. He references Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.That is certainly one view. But is it the case that “raw power is being asserted everywhere we look”? I wonder. First, there is nothing new about “raw power”. The assault on international rules has been more or less continual since 1945. Long before Ukraine or Qatar or drones over Poland there was Hungary, Czechoslovakia; Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia; Afghanistan; the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and Iraq. We have known a multitude of acts of manifest lawlessness, and moments of acute lawlessness.Are we witnessing the death of international law?Read moreIt is undoubtedly the case that there is rampant lawlessness today, at least in respect of certain rules of international law. Given what is happening in Ukraine, and in Israel/Palestine, and in Sudan, among other places, it is hard to disagree with Yale professor Oona Hathaway whosaid this monththat the protection of civilians under international humanitarian law is being “eroded to the point of threatening to lose all meaning”. But the fact that certain laws are being violated does not mean that they cease to exist. The rules set forth in the1949 Geneva conventionsand their1977 protocolson the protection of civilians in times of armed conflict, did not cease to have their writ in the face of attacks on civilians in Ukraine, in Israel on 7 October, or in Gaza subsequently, or in parts of Sudan.And while some rules are undoubtedly being flouted, and gravely so, the vast majority of the rules of international law continue to be respected and to operate and apply in a manner that is fully effective. My train journey recently, from London to Paris and back, was made possible by the operation of a host of international treaties. So are the phone calls I make on my mobile phone, and the foods I eat, and the medications I take. Every aspect of our daily lives is informed by the writ of international law. It operates behind the scenes – unseen, silently, seamlessly, effectively.In a post-rules world, you would expect international lawmaking to have ground to a halt. That has not happened. In recent months,states have agreedto negotiate a new UN convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity, and they adopted a new treaty to create thefirst international tribunalon the crime of aggression since Nuremberg, in relation to Russia’s illegal occupation of Ukraine.In a post-rules world, you might also expect international courts and tribunals to be in a state of collapse or disappearance. It is the case that a few courts have finished their work or disintegrated, and that some countries are leaving some courts, but the numbers are few and far between.Many of the other courts and tribunals are busier than ever. The international court of justice currently has23 contentious cases on its docket, which is more than at any time I can remember. The court’s advisory opinion function has attracted unprecedented engagement in recent years – 37 states participated in the advisory opinion proceedings on the Chagos Islands, whichled to the February 2019 decisionthat the separation of the Chagos archipelago from Mauritius was unlawful. And, this year,98 states participatedin the advisory opinion on climate change. That is the highest level of participation in any case in the history of the court, or its predecessor.I do not ignore the assault on parts of international law that is under way from some quarters. As Giuliano da Empoli articulates it in his bookThe Hour of the Predator, the new populist class of political predators and digital conquistadors has made an enemy not just of lawyers, but of their rules and institutions, their courts and their judges, the post-1945 commitment to rules on free trade, on the rights of individuals and groups, and on the use of force. If their attacks succeed, he writes, “it will not only be the parties of lawyers and technocrats that will be swept away, but also liberal democracy as we have known it until today”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As US president Donald Trump has shown, a bit of swagger can allow you to boycott Cop30 on climate change, or to embark on a policy of killing alleged narco-traffickers in the Caribbean Sea. But these are not policies that will be sustainable over the longer term. They produce reactions from others. The UK was reported to have ceased certain intelligence support to the US in the Caribbean, for fear of beingcomplicit in criminality, although foreign secretary Yvette Cooper has downplayed that report. And the French foreign minister,Jean-Noël Barrot, declared that“we have observed with concern the military operations in the ‍Caribbean region, because they violate international law”.So, we are not in a world without law. We are, however, in a world in which some would like to strip back or do away with certain international rules, and that is the struggle which is under way. No doubt it may yet get worse before it gets better. But history shows a pattern over the centuries – the elaboration of international rules and institutions is followed by their partial destruction, and that is then followed by a reconstruction, and the reconstruction generally builds on what came before. And so it will be once more.There is nothing new in Trump’s swagger.Hans Frankswaggered once, so did General AugustoPinochet. That approachgave us Iraq and the palaver over the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, and so many other disasters. And then, over time, such people encounter other realities – political, diplomatic, economic, military, ecological, human, legal – and they learn that accommodations have to be made, which will lead to agreements, and those agreements will be governed by international rules, in one form or another.Philippe Sands is professor of law at University College LondonThis is adapted from A World Without Law?, the46th FA Mann Lecture, delivered by Philippe Sands on 18 November 2025Explore more on these topicsInternational lawOpinionUnited NationsWar crimesDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

They are comforting, widely admired and have uncontroversial histories.And then there’s Jameis Winston.To celebrate Winston getting the call as the New York Giants starting quarterback last weekend, the NFL created a hype video, splicing a bunch of his goofiest quotes during his meandering journey through various NFL teams. It also, somewhat dubiously, accompanied the video with a commentcalling him “a national treasure”.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThere was nothing in the video showcasing Winston’s insane arm talent or his fondness for throwing interceptions. It didn’t remind us of Winston’s historic 2019 season, in which he became the firstNFLplayer to throw 30 touchdowns and 30 picks in a season. And there was definitely no mention about the myriad issues in Winston’s past that automatically disqualify him from national treasure status.This is the same Winston who was accused of sexual assault while at Florida State (he was never charged over the allegations but didreach an out of court settlementin 2015). The same Winston who received a citationfor shoplifting crab legsat a Publix grocery store in 2014. The same Winston who allegedly groped an Uber driver (he wasn’t charged over those claims either butreached a settlement with the woman in 2018– None of Winston’s settlements contained an admission of liability). The same Winston who told a group of elementary students that boys should “stand up” and “be strong” and girls ought to be “silent, polite, and gentle” (he later apologized). And the same Winston who last year came to the fierce defense of Deshaun Watson. Yes,that Deshaun Watson, when he was his backup at the Cleveland Browns. “I’m grateful I had a chance to serve Deshaun, but I’m very upset with the reaction to a man that has the world against him for the past four years when he put his body and life on the line for this city every day,” Winston said.In case you need reminding, the world was “against” Watson because he was accused of sexual assaultby dozens of women(Watson never faced criminal charges over the allegations but the NFL suspended him for 11 games of the 2022 season after its own investigation. He alsoreached out of court settlementswith nearly two dozen of his accusers, without an admission of liability). The world was so against Watson, in fact, that the Browns gave him a fully guaranteed $230m contract.What makes the league’s praise of Winston so jarring is that the NFL itself has punished him in the past.It suspended himfor three games over the Uber allegations after its investigation “concluded that Winston violated the personal conduct policy by touching the driver in an inappropriate and sexual manner without her consent and that disciplinary action was necessary and appropriate.”I am not arguing that Winston shouldn’t have an NFL career. But you would think any player suspended by the NFL for anything in the sphere of sexual misconduct would automatically be disqualified from off-the-field adulation by the league. It should be noted that the NFL isn’t the only entity presenting Winston as a lovable goofball. This week, the Athletic praised his “carefree personality”.Sure, Winston is a personable, sometimes electric personality capable of compelling play. But a national treasure? C’mon NFL, unless the people running your social media are 12 and haven’t researched his history, they should know better.The NFL has history with this. Players like Tyreek Hill and Ben Roethlisberger have had fascinating careers, and been the subject of serious off-the-field accusations, and yet we have seen the NFL hype them up.There’s no denying Winston is a fan favorite. Scrolling through the comments on the national treasure post, one stuck out as representing the majority opinion.Jameis single-handedly could get me to go to church again. I don’t believe in god, but I do believe in Jameis.Do we really need a church of Jameis? Before we build one, how about examining Winston’s personal growth? During this past Sunday’s Falcons-Dolphins game, the broadcasters focused on Mike McDaniel’sjourney towards sobriety, and the support of his fellow head coach, Dan Quinn. It was a beautiful, teachable few minutes.Where is the evidence that Winston has grown? A year ago he was still keen to depict Watson as some kind of victim. Sometimes it seems we’re too enamored with a player’s ability or his charisma rather than the quality of his character.Most fans don’t want to think about whether their quarterback sexually assaulted a woman. They want to know if he’s going to help their fantasy team win. And most youngsters have no idea what some of their heroes are accused of. How would they?Of course, the NFL’s first order of business is to hype its product. That means sharing a boatload of enthralling clips of plays and players. Want to throw together some Jameis Winston hype videos? Fine. But please, please be more thoughtful before making him out to be a national treasure.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York GiantsUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

My mother answered the phone which sat on a bench in a book-lined downstairs room we reverentially called “the den” which included a special shelf for the White and Yellow Pages (remember them?). Mum gave this caller the third degree – who was she and what did she want? – before eventually summonsing me to the phone to name the “very forward” girl asking to speak to me.Kill me now. Just the memory …That was the thing about the landline. It pretty much ensured that parents and siblings could glean way too much about any fledgling romantic and social interactions just as we learned a lot about our parents because of a) the people who called them, and b) what we deliberately or otherwise overheard them talking about over the landline.I know – smartphones have done all sorts of evil to our own and our kids’ brains. They have also totally changed the way phone calls are made and received.Back home in the late 1970s when the phone rang in the den it was a family moment. You’d answer formally –Hello, 8361 …(this was part of our actual number and its entirety is burnt into my memory along with the home numbers of some of my closer cousins and friends),Paul speaking.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsIf it was someone I knew (an aunt or uncle who seemed to call Mum every day, one of Dad’s business associates or a friend of my sister) some polite conversation would ensue before the intended recipient was notified.Similarly, when I’d ring a mate I might first have to speak to one of his siblings or his parents about the weather, the Collingwood football club’s malaise, my beach holiday, schoolwork, or what I was reading or listening to lately.Thebrnng-brnngof the phone was always a household moment. Was it ringing for me or was it a portent of bad news about an elderly relative … or maybe just something prosaic from the dry cleaner, the vet or the mechanic? Regardless, the landline was uniquely integral to the (semi-)open book of family life.It would ring totally without warning. Now, when our smartphones ring unexpectedly with an actual unheralded phone call, we are startled. Many people text to presage voice calling someone else and they get anxious before ringing strangers about administrative matters.Anyway, nobody actuallyringsordialsany more (I remember decades ago when our son was startled by the dusty old rotary dial phone in my parents’ garage as if it were some instrument of torture or intergalactic messaging device).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

My adult kids’ romantic lives, for instance, have pretty much always been completely opaque to me until they’ve wanted them otherwise.I’m not saying this is good or bad. It just is.To illustrate how things have changed I could tell them, perhaps, about the girlfriend I had at 17 whose tyrannical father, if he answered, would convey to me no matter when I’d rung that that my call was “intrusive and inconvenient” before hanging up on me.But I’m not sure they’d quite believe it. It would be as alien to them as that rotary dial landline in their grandparents’ garage.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsTelecomsOpinionFamilyAustralian lifestyleSmartphonescommentShareReuse this content"

Police found her body in the boot of a carRead more fromGuardian Australia’s two-year investigation hereWed 19 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 14.06 ESTShareThree months before Kardell Lomas and her unborn baby were killed in a horrific act of feminicide in Ipswich, she stood in the office of a support service trying to get away from the perpetrator, who was with her in the building.Over the previous year Lomas hadtried many times to get help. She had disclosed to another support service that she was suffering from brutal violence – including strangulation and threats to kill – and her partner was stalking her to the bathroom and other places, including to those same support service appointments. After her disclosures the violence escalated – the danger was growing.Lomas had shown up at appointments with injuries and was trying to leave her abuser, for the safety of herself and her unborn child. She was clearly high risk and her attacker had a violent history.Pregnant and frightened, Kardell Lomas begged for help. Police found her body in the boot of a carRead moreDespite police being called to their home several times by neighbours who heard him yelling at her, the two – victim and perpetrator – were seen by police as “just as bad as each other”.But that day, in the support service office, Lomas passed a note to staff, asking them to call the police on her behalf. This was an enormous act of resistance and courage. She wanted to escape her perpetrator and go to her aunty’s house.When police arrived, they took her killer aside and laughed and joked with him. They clearly knew him, and that he had a history of violence, but they were jovial and friendly. In comparison, Lomas was treated as though she was wasting their time. One officer told her abuser: “To be honest, mate, I’m not even sure why we got called either.”47:41Broken trust: how police failed Hannah Clarke and other women they were supposed to protect – videoIn the bodycam footage of the callout, released to Guardian Australia by police, Kardell is withdrawn, fearful and cowering. The perpetrator yells abuse at her. Before she is led out of the agency and into the back of a police wagon, in which police place her to drive her to her aunty’s place, she appears to have heard this message loud and clear.It is the most heartbreaking moment of the footage. She turns and says: “I’m sorry for the fuck around.”This is a message that is sent to every single black woman: be thankful, be gracious, cower into yourself, apologise for fucking them around.This is a message given to black women even when we know the deaths of black women rarely make the front pages of newspapers, lead national debates or change laws; whose deaths are normalised and seen as routine, so of course are not newsworthy; whose deaths are not mournable, whose deaths are not worthy of inquiry, whose experiences of violence are secondary to the experiences of white women and even black men; whose disappearances are seen as “going walkabout” or “drug addiction” or their own responsibility, even when there are potential perpetrators involved.These words should shame not just those there that day who failed Lomas but every person who watches this footage. Every Australian should be made to hear her words: “I’m sorry for the fuck around.” She speaks as if she is the problem, when it is those around her who have made her more vulnerable to death.I’m not shocked because it’s what I’ve come to expect from the Queensland coroner’s courtPolice took no protective action for Lomas – such as taking out a domestic violence order – and there is no evidence they ever followed up with her.Three months later her body was found in the back of a car at the house she shared with her abuser.He was jailed for manslaughter and given a sentence of 14 years for the horrific feminicide of Lomas and her unborn child. Some people may think this is “justice” but it is far from it.Lomas’s killing was not just a “DV death”. Its perpetrator was not only the man but the state that failed to protect her and even made her more vulnerable to violence.I use the word “feminicide” because it widens the definition of “femicide” from a woman killed for being a woman to include state violence, which targets black women, particularly inQueensland, and which is routinely ignored by white feminists who refuse to centre black women.In feminicide, a definition drawn from the work of activists and academics in Latin America, it is not just interpersonal violence but also the mechanisms of the state – the police, the media, the bureaucracy and the judicial system – which enact horrific violence upon black women.Lomas was not only a victim of interpersonal violence, she was a victim of state violence. She had been routinely criminalised throughout her life and was regularly surveilled by police, which again increased her vulnerability and made her a target for violence.Feminicide also incorporates impunity, and a part of this impunity involves the refusal by the state to further interrogate the deaths and what led to them. Impunity involves the refusal, for example, of a coroner to investigate the role of the state in the deaths of black women.The refusal of the Queensland coroner to conduct a coronial inquest into Lomas’s death reveals again what many black women know: it is not a place for truth-telling but rather a mechanism to alibi the state and its failures.Gail Karran recorded the savage beating that killed her. Shocking new evidence reveals how police failed herRead moreI’m not shocked because it’s what I’ve come to expect from the Queensland coroner’s court; a place which has largely refused to accept the role of systemic racist violence in the deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women.Over the past five years I’ve sat in on many inquests alongside black families and have seen the effect of this clearly. Black families don’t leave with justice but further heartache.I’ve also witnessed the absence of gender and race and how it works against Aboriginal women and their families, because to make racism and race absent is to deny and deliberately conceal the truth of Aboriginal women’s experiences of violence. And if race is made absent, then the responsibility is placed back upon the black woman. When race is absent, the police are seen as justified in their responses, or their failures to respond. When race is absent, police are automatically believed over Aboriginal women and their families.In her non-inquest findings, the coroner in Lomas’s case suggests it was her “mistrust” in services and police due to her Aboriginality that laid part of the foundation for her killing. That’s even though Lomas could not go to services or police, because every time she did, the violence exacerbated – and this is clearly shown in every interaction she had leading up to her death.Instead of interrogating the role of the state in the death, the coroner claims these are just “missed opportunities” between government departments, language she uses several times. But these “missed opportunities” are as callous as the message the coroner is really sending: that there are no further lessons to be learned from Lomas’s death. This is foundational to feminicide: the idea that these deaths are inevitable.I reject that wholeheartedly. Kardell Lomas and her baby should still be here. And her family have every right to fight for justice, both in the coroner’s court and beyond.Dr Amy McQuire is a Darumbal and South Sea Islander academic whose work looks at media representations of violence against Aboriginal women.

These give us a sense of whether there is so much competition for jobs that employers are offering higher wages and workers can demand higher wages without fear of their hours being cut.The RBA likes to think that the current level of unemployment means the job market is still “tight” (a polite way of saying they would like to see more unemployment). They believe there is too much competition for workers, and so wage growth will be strong and drive up prices.And yet in the September quarter private-sector wages grew just 0.7%, down from 0.8% in the June quarter and 0.9% in the first three months of this year:If the graph does not display click hereThe annual figures also show that wage growth is slowing and the days of wages rising above 4% are behind us.If the graph does not display click hereThe slowing figures across the board did, however, bring one moment of unintentional hilarity, when the shadow minister for industrial relations, employment and small business, Tim Wilson, decided this was his chance to show off his economic acumen.The RBA predicts inflation will rise faster than wages. Let’s hope it’s wrong | Greg JerichoRead moreHe quickly put out a media release noting that while private-sector wage growth was slower than this time last year “wages in the public sector rose to 3.8%, up from 3.7% a year earlier”.That is true but then, displaying a level of comic ignorance that was missing from parliament during his time out of office, he suggested the Albanese government was to blame. He argued that “Australia’s economy is slowly sinking as the private sector is being outpaced by public spending”.Alas for Wilson, had he read theAustralian Bureau of Statistics webpagehe would have seen the ABS explain that “state government pay rises contributed 82% of public sector wage growth” and that commonwealth public service pay contributed just 0.04 of a percentage point to quarterly public-sector wage growth – or 3.9% of the increase in public-sector wages.That is the lowest contribution since 2017:If the graph does not display click hereAlso, while public-sector wages outgrew those in the private sector over the past year, that has been very much the exception. Since March 2021, public-sector wages have grown 14.2% compared with 15.2% wage growth in the private sector. The importance of that, however, is that in that same period prices have gone up 21.8% and the cost of living for employee households (which takes into account mortgage repayments) has risen 26.6%:skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the September quarter overall wages fell 0.6% in real terms, which wiped away a lot of the gains since March 2023. Since that time the value of real wages has increased 0.95%, but that still leaves real wages 4.6% lower than they were in March 2021.What does that mean?

Now those $90,000 have the purchasing power of $85,862 – a loss of $4,138 worth of spending.Even worse, because the recovery of real wages is expected to be so slow, if the estimates of the RBA in its mostrecent Statement on Monetary Policycome to fruition, it will take us until the middle of 2044 to get back to having a wage that has as much purchasing power as in March 2021:If the graph does not display click hereSuch a situation is what comes when the policy levers are all geared to treating wage growth as something to prevent – and worries about a “tight labour market” continue to remain even as wage growth slows below that of inflation.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsReserve Bank of AustraliaWages growthCost-of-living crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

To defeat Faragism, Labour must revive a vision of social cohesion and collective responsibilityWed 19 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 06.20 ESTShareLast month, as the Nobel peace prizeeluded Donald Trump’scovetous grasp, the Harvard professor Michael Sandel received an accolade sometimes described as a Nobel equivalent for philosophers. The $1mBerggruen prizeis awarded annually to a thinker deemed to have helped humanity find “wisdom, direction, and improved self-understanding”. Somewhat wistfully, given the state of the polls, I found my mind wandering back to the early 2010s, when Sandel wasrecruited by the Labour partyto deliver just these benefits to the British centre left.At the time, under the leadership of Ed Miliband, Labour wastrying to developa One Nation politics to address deepening social fissures which – we now know – were soon to turn our politics upside down.Having addressedthe Labour party conference of 2012 on responsible capitalism and the “moral limits of markets”, Sandel was interviewed at a fringe event, where he elaborated on the challenges he believed modern progressives faced.In that interview,Sandel was askedby the veteran centre-left thinktanker Nick Pearce: “What would you say to people in the Labour party in the UK, and people interested in progressive politics more generally? What should we be aiming at, if not an abstract notion of equality or justice?” He replies: “I think that it would be important to anchor the concern for social justice and equality in the longer tradition of the Labour party, which draws on resources of solidarity, civic virtue and community.”This synthesis never came to pass. As post-Brexit Britain has polarised, it is Faragian “national conservatism” that has come to monopolise the politics of community, and lay claim to other forms of unity rooted in place, culture and identity. Think flags of St George, Christian symbols and Robert Jenrick lamenting the absence of a friendly white facein Handsworth. Progressives have responded by rallying to the defence of universal rights and a vision of global justice and equality founded on the celebration of diversity. See Green party leaderZack Polanski’s viral videofrom Birmingham, in which he recites Benjamin Zephaniah’s poem British – a lyrical celebration of a melting-pot country.For many on the left, this showdown between two ideological blocs, on everything from immigration to net zero, is likely to be lived as a moral crusade. Liberal tolerance v reactionary authoritarianism. Diversity v racism. Hope v hate. Universalism v a narrow and defensive Little Englandism. Such binaries will be accompanied by warnings that it is both futile and immoral to try to “out-Reform” Reform in the public square.The attraction of a strategy ofNo pasaránis understandable, given that a virulent and repellent strain of ethno-nationalism has entered the national bloodstream. But resistance politics is not enough, and it oversimplifies the complexities of the moment. To truly see off Faragism, progressives will ultimately need to understand and outthink Reform’s broad appeal, as well as denounce its malign consequences. That will involve dialling down the moral self-certainty, analysing rather than anathematising, and confronting some inconvenient truths.In the second half of the 20th century, liberal ideas about justice and equality – embodied in the radical new social movements which emerged towards the end of the 1960s – transformed for the better the lives of women, ethnic minority communities and LGBTQ+ people. Crucially, in the ecology of the left, these new sources of inspirational energy developed alongside the collectivist politics of more culturally conservative blue-collar communities. But a creative tension – in evidence each year on theLabourparty conference floor – was lost as deindustrialisation stripped working-class Britain of the power, influence and prestige it once enjoyed.The consequences have been philosophical as well as political. From the 1980s onwards, the cutting edge of progressive thought became overwhelmingly preoccupied with the rights and freedoms of the individual. This shift in tone was, in part, pragmatic. Tony Blair’s defining repudiation of commitments to public ownership, for example, was deemed essential if the party hoped to be elected again after the defeats of the Thatcher era. But it was also seen as ethically desirable. The cumulative impact of the social revolutions of the 60s, and the epochal collapse of communism a generation later, led to a suspicion of communitarian-type thinking, and an emphasis on deepening minority rights and promoting individual aspiration.The ongoing migration of less well-off voters to the nationalist, authoritarian right tells us that not everyone felt “seen” or represented by this politics. In 2019, the historian Timothy Garton Ashacknowledged this downside, invoking the thought of the Romanian-French philosopher Pierre Hassner to observe that “humankind does not live by liberty and universality alone”.Sandel would agree. In an interview this autumn,he suggeststhat the centre left urgently needs to develop an “alternative idea of national community” to the ominous, racialised versions on the far right. For progressives, this phrasing may generate considerable queasiness. But it is becoming a political truth that the modern left’s guiding assumptions are, in fact, no longer modern; they belong to the socioeconomic settlement which dominated the decades after the end of the cold war, and is coming to an end. Is it a coincidence that nationalist partieslead the polls in England, Scotland and Wales?Something new is required; a collectivist politics that preserves the ethical insights of universalism, but that also foregrounds the values of social cohesion, collective obligation and communal wellbeing – and is willing to negotiate tensions that might result. Within Labour, there are signs that, in different ways, both the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, have begun to move in this direction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is right, but the Labour left will take some convincing that her reconstruction of Britain’s asylum policy is not an ethical capitulation.Similarly, Burnham’smuch-derided observationthat it was “time for the UK to stop being in hock to the bond markets” identified the need to develop a politics that gives people a sense of sovereign control over the country’s economic choices. Overcoming the subjection of democracies to the arrogance of rootless international capital is arguably the greatest progressive challenge of the age. Yet 40 years on, the left has still to find an answer to the big bang in the 1980s.In new times, a journey without familiar maps is required. To redeploy Blair’s famous 2001formulation, “the kaleidoscope has been shaken. The pieces are in flux”. The British left needs to quickly adapt to that fact, or risk handing over the next chapter of the nation’s political history to the forces of deep reaction.Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editorExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionReform UKThe far rightcommentShareReuse this content"

This states that the scale of any misfortune can only be measured against unknown future disasters. As Shakespeare has the banished son of the blinded Earl of Gloucester say in King Lear: “The worst is not, so long as we can say ‘this is the worst’.”According to Edgar’s law, there is no opinion pollso gloomyfor Labour that it can’t be followed by one even bleaker; no fiscal forecast so bad that the Treasury can’t aggravate it with contradictory signals on tax; no misgivings about Keir Starmer that can’t be amplified bymalevolent briefingabout a leadership challenge; no social policy so nauseating to the party faithful that it can’t be made grosser still with a relish of cruelty.In that context, this week’sannouncement of plansthat aim to limit the number of refugees admitted to the UK, modelled on anotoriously mean Danish system, went down less badly with Labour MPs than might have been expected. There were sparks of backbench anger but no conflagration of dissent. No 10 was relieved. It helped that the home secretary had taken steps to explain the political imperative of the measures to colleagues in advance and in private. The plan landed on a rolled pitch.Tightening asylum rules is not Labour’s comfort zone, but the current system is clearly failing and voters are angry. Most MPs understand Shabana Mahmood’s argument that tolerance and intercommunal harmony are easier to cultivate when there is confidence that the nation’s borders are secure. But many also struggle to see the pathway to greater compassion through a barricade of deterrent measures – threats to confiscate property anddeport children– that advertise Britain as a country hostile to foreigners. The proposals may not have ignited instant rebellion. That doesn’t mean they were welcome.Quiet backbenches can also be ominous.MPs have learned that everything is negotiable with a directionless leader of malleable conviction. What is announced today may be unannounced tomorrow. There is no need to rush over the top when victories can be won by attrition. Some of what looks like parliamentary discipline is really disdain – an acceptance among MPs and even ministers, after months of trying to decrypt the purpose of Starmer’s leadership, that there is none. Energy spent trying to influence him or participate in his project is wasted; nothing will come of nothing.A common complaint is that Starmer is barely running the government at all, having delegated political judgment to Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff. That isn’t to say the prime minister lacks executive dynamism, he just prefers not to mediate in departmental disputes or engage in long debates.Starmer came to party politics late in his career, first entering parliament at the age of 52. He has no feel for Labour lore – the canon of historical arguments, campaigns, characters and cultural references that connect a leader to the wider movement and its sense of collective mission. He is said by people who have tried to engage him in discussion of ideas to be allergic to abstraction, seeing it as impediment to action. His innermost beliefs are a mystery even to the cabinet. As one senior Labour figure puts it: “Keir is highly unusual as a prime minister in giving the impression that whatever he personally thinks is none of your business.”Wilful detachment from so much of what defines politics explains the reliance on McSweeney, whose strength in opposition was controlling party machinery and deploying it with ruthless efficiency. But the methods that worked in the run-up to July 2024 are not relevant to the challenge of running a country. The government isn’t a giant constituency party to be captured by a well-organised clique, then purged of irksome, wrong-thinking members.The product packaged as Starmer in last year’s election campaign has also not delivered its purported benefits: managerial competence leading to national renewal. If Britain still had a two-party system, the memory of how bad things were under the Tories might prolong patience with Labour. But voters now channel their disappointment with a failing governmentto Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and, in Scotland and Wales, nationalist parties.That presages a massacre of Labour candidates in council and devolvedelections next May.It will be a moment of extreme peril for Starmer, assuming he survives that long. There are MPs who query whether it is worth waiting for defeat to prove that the leader is a dud when you could avert damage by ditching him now. Others argue that any opinion-poll bounce generated by fresh leadership is a precious, one-off resource, best held in reserve until much closer to a general election.Missing from these calculations is agreement on the identity of a successor and how their programme may differ from the current government’s agenda. This flaw in the transition plan is cited by the prime minister’s defenders as one of many reasons to stick with the incumbent. Aleadership contestwould, they say, only accelerate voter flight from Labour. It would look weird and self-indulgent. It would prioritise party members’ grievances over wider public concerns. It would alarm markets as a symptom of instability. It would certainly not grow the economy or generate revenues to fund public services. The new prime minister would have no personal mandate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the sound of failure to define Starmerism as anything more than a sequence of tactics for clinging on, warning that this is as good as it gets, betting that enough people will dread the thought of Nigel Farage in Downing Street to give Labour a second term. It is the defence of painful policy compromise as the means to an end, where the destination is just a labyrinth of endless means.It is hard to summon loyalty to such a cause. And most Labour MPs have tried. They have stuck with the party line, defended it on the doorstep, obeyed the whips, believed assurances that their concerns were heard, feasted on crumbs of improvement in the prime minister’s performances, and been made to feel like mugs for extending so much benefit of the doubt. Not mutinous by disposition, they see mutiny as the only option left.Regicide is fraught with risk, but is it riskier than pretending that the current ruler has answers to big questions that he never even names? Edgar’s law invites caution in ousting a sitting prime minister. The replacement could always be worse. But in the closing lines of King Lear, Edgar also articulates the quality so craved by Labour MPs in a future leader because it is painfully absent in the present one. “The weight of this sad time we must obey; Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.”Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

It is time we faced up to our dark pastMaría RamírezThis week marks 50 years of Spanish democracy, but the failure to talk more about the crimes of the dictatorship leaves us vulnerableWed 19 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 08.23 ESTShareLike most Spaniards alive today, I was born after the death of Franco 50 years ago. Even for my parents’ generation, the dictatorship that lasted from 1939 until 20 November 1975 is today a distant bad dream. Growing up, the stories I heard were mostly about the post-Franco democratic transition, a time full of promise and energy as younger people set about rebuilding everything from scratch.My mother, who was pregnant with me when she voted in thefirst free elections in 1977, talks about that time as the happiest of her life. International media reporting from that yeardescribed “a broad optimism”in a soon-to-be “healthy, modern, lively nation”.Writing in October 1977, the philosopher and former political prisonerJulián Marías commented: “The Franco years seem incredibly distant; almost everything that seemed impossible has already taken place.” It had been less than two years since Franco’s death, and there was not yet a full democratic system or a constitution in place.As in many European countries, those years were also marked by political violence andeconomic crises. One of my earliest memories is of fear, confusion and radio bulletins during theattempted coup d’etat in February 1981.Still, looking back, it was extraordinary how Spain went from a poor, isolated, rural country to a dynamic democracy that, within a few years, outpaced most of Europe in terms of openness and social rights. In 50 years, GDP has multiplied by a factor ofmore than 15in today’s money, the value of exports has increased almost eightfold, and the number of employed people has almost doubled in a country that has gone from 35m toalmost 50minhabitants. Same-sex marriage waslegalised in 2005, around a decade before it was recognised in the US, UK or Germany.The transition to democracy was remarkably smooth given its pace; some of that was thanks to European funds and support. But in seeking to balance justice and reconciliation, Spain leaned heavily towards the latter. Few of the dictatorship’s crimes were prosecuted, and as the years passed, amnesty turned into amnesia.View image in fullscreenRelatives of victims of Franco's dictatorship attend a tribute in Madrid, October 31, 2025.Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersFormer officials of the Franco regime were absorbed into political parties – mostly the forerunner of today’sPeople’s party (Partido Popular). There was no public reckoning for millionaires or big companies that sustained the regime and, by extension, decades of repression and human rights abuses. Spain even kept as head of state King Juan Carlos, who had been chosen by Franco as his successor in an almost “filial relationship”, as the disgraced former kingwrites in a new memoir. Juan Carlos’s own role in the democratic transition and the attempted coup is still contested.Today, the Franco era is taught in schools, but at the end of a packed history syllabus that many teachers have to rush through in the final high school year. It was largely absent from public debate until the centre-left government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapateropassed the first historical memory lawin 2007, and began removing Franco statues and other symbols, investing in national archives and supporting the search for the remains of those killed during the civil war of the 1930s.Pedro Sánchez has gone even further,introducing new legislationand implementing the existing law. The most symbolic gesture was theremoval, in 2019, of Franco’s remains and tombfrom Valle de los Caídos (the Valley of the Fallen), now renamed Valle de Cuelgamuros, a mausoleum built by political prisoners on the outskirts of Madrid, where he had been laid to rest and honoured for decades – among his victims. A new project will transform the site, which for the first time will featuredisplay panels, documentary artefacts and recordingsexplaining its dark history.This is significant, because openly and publicly telling the history of Francoism has been missing inSpainfor far too long. More important than removing symbols is explaining them. Spain does not even have a museum of national history, and it lags behind Germany, Italy, Portugal and even younger democracies such as Slovenia, in confronting its past and putting it on display.Politicians on the rightare now resisting many of these efforts, with historical memory becoming yet another partisan issue. Even Spain’s transition to democracy, once idealised and long a source of pride, has come under question as political consensus has fractured.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But when you don’t fully reckon with the past, it can return to haunt you.My mother is often surprised and distressed in equal measure to seevery youngpeople – even if it’s a tiny minority – makingfascist salutes or singing Franco’s anthem, or to hear leaders of Vox, the far-right party,making lightof the dictatorship’s crimes. In the past few months, my mother speaks much more often about her own memories: running in front of the mounted police –losgrises,so called for their grey uniforms – during protests at her university against the final executions ordered by Franco; whispering about her cousin crossing into France to meet political activists; and wondering about her long-lost uncle who may have been a victim of repression.“Life was grey,” she would say now. She is shocked, as are many who lived through the dictatorship, that anyone in today’s Spain could embrace that troubled past. Those people should know better. But they should have been taught better as well.There is no danger in Spain of Francoism coming back, but forgetting history can make you take for granted the democratic freedoms that need constant vigilance and protection.María Ramírez is a journalist and deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in SpainExplore more on these topicsSpainOpinionThe far rightEuropeFrancisco FrancoPedro SánchezcommentShareReuse this content"

Ahead of a tour as himself, the actor and Instagram cookery guru looks backWed 19 Nov 2025 11.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 14.42 ESTShareFew actors are more indelibly associated with one role than Gregor Fisher – and few comic characters (although Alan Partridge leaps to mind) grow with their audiences over decades rather than years. “Somebody pointed out to me the other day,” says Fisher of his most famous alter ego, the unemployed Glaswegian alcoholicRab C Nesbitt, “that it’s 40 years since he first appeared on the telly”. Fisher wore the string vest on and off for 30 of those years, weaving himself into Glasgow folklore – but backing himself into a casting cul-de-sac too. Now 71, he’d love you to bear in mind the other roles he can play – not least that of Gregor Fisher, in which out-from-behind-the-mask persona he is soon to set off, for the first time, on a UK tour.You might imagine that an actor stepping out as himself after years in character(s) could be scary, or exciting, or a chance to set the story straight. But Fisher is not, as I discover when meeting him in Glasgow on the eve of his tour, a man apt to self-dramatise. Ask him about his career and he’ll toss the word back at you in scare quotes. Ask him about Nesbitt and he’ll tell you: “It’s just a part. It’s gossamer wings. It’s nothing.”‘I was due to turn on the Glasgow Christmas lights – but the council leader said no’Ask him about An Evening With Gregor Fisher – cooked up with his friend, the theatre director Nigel West (a neighbour in France, where Fisher lived for 10 years until his recent homecoming) – and he’ll give you this: “There’s no lines to learn. We can maybe have a laugh. We might make a couple of quid, and we might not. But it’ll be a painless exercise. There’s no crucifixion involved.” Who said that romance was dead!?View image in fullscreen‘Why are we portraying this nutcase?’ … with the cast of Rab C Nesbitt in 1990.Photograph: Bbc/AllstarAh, but this is the face Fisher presents to the world – and not the whole story. For a start, he delivers all this stuff with the twinkle of a man who, asthe Guardian once said of him, “could make reciting the alphabet uproarious”. And then there’s the palpable affection with which he recalls the passerby who, way back when, apprehended him mid-filming in public to offer his curt appreciation of Fisher’s life and work. “I saw this wee guy coming up the street. The light was fading, he’d obviously just finished work. And he clocked me, and I thought, ‘He’s going to say something.’ And he went …” – and here Fisher grabs my arm, with arresting intensity – “‘Thank you very much, son.’” It’s not much, but between two Scottish males, it’s plenty. “It meant a lot,” says Fisher. “It’s nicer to be liked than not.”Nesbitt, along with Fisher’s other identifiable alter ego, the combover king and Hamlet cigar salesman known only as the Baldy Man, started life on the 80s sketch showNaked Video. Fisher, who was separated from his birth siblings and given up for adoption aged three, had grown up on Glasgow’s outskirts, and cut his acting teeth at the Dundee Rep theatre in the late 70s. As Nesbitt, a street philosopher with a skanky headband, he touched a nerve in his native land – and far beyond: Fisher points out that the vast majority of the viewers of the eponymously named comedy, which ran on and off on the BBC between 1988 and 2014, lived south of the border.View image in fullscreenAs Baldy Man in an advert for Hamlet cigars in 1986.Photograph: cdpIndeed, he was somewhat resistant at first to playing a character who he worried perpetuated stereotypes of boozy and aggressive Scots. “I thought, ‘Why does it have to be this? Why are we portraying this nutcase brandishing a rolled-up newspaper?” But the character caught on – probably because Fisher’s performance (andIan Pattison’s scripts) fleshed out the cartoon of sozzled Scottish masculinity into something smarter, more lovable and more complex.Watching back episodes of Rab C Nesbitt now – including one that teases at his home town’s 1990 glow-up into a Europeancity of culture– you can interpret Nesbitt as a spirit of Glasgow incarnate, reassuring us that, at a time of tumultuous change, there remained some constants we could hang on to. But, for all that the series was more innovative than it’s given credit for (with direct address to camera decades before Fleabag – not to mention a very early TV appearance for the young David Tennant), Nesbitt remained, in Fisher’s phrase, “a Marmite character”.He tells me about the time he was invited to turn on Glasgow’s Christmas lights – only for the invitation to be rescinded when the leader of the council “got wind of the fact, and didn’t think [I was] a suitable person to represent the city”. Mind you, Nesbitt was always loved, says Fisher, where it mattered most: “Nancy Banks-Smith[in the Guardian] was always a great fan. I always used to think if Nancy likes it, it must be not too bad.”It did, however, typecast for a while an actor who would later star alongsideAl Pacino in The Merchant of Venice, not to mention his role as Bill Nighy’s manager inLove Actually. “People would say to me, after I’d done an audition, ‘Well that’s absolutely marvellous, I didn’t realise you could speak properly.’ These people don’t know what acting is.”View image in fullscreenAcclaimed …  Fisher in Yer Granny, for the National Theatre of Scotland.Does Fisher regret that Nesbitt pigeonholed him as a comic turn? “Well, I was never going to play Romeo,” he says. “Maybe on the wireless.” As for fretting about his career path, well, “Your career is your career is your career. We’ve all got bills to pay.” It all comes down, he says, to “casting directors who say, ‘We’d like him to do this, and we’re no’ interested in him doing that’” – and to your financial circumstances at any given time. “I’ve had some scripts sitting on my shelf for months,” he says, “until the tax bill comes in. I’ll be thinking, ‘This is crap’, but then suddenly it’s, ‘Oh thanks, I’d love to do it. Yes, I’ve got a window for that.’ That’s how a career works.”If he’s never exerted much control over it, Fisher is chuffed with how the most recent chapters of his working life have panned out. The last decade has seen an acclaimed stint with the National Theatre of Scotland in thestage comedy Yer Granny; an unlikely new direction, orchestrated by his grownup daughter Cissie, as an Instagram cookery guru (“I get people stopping me in the street saying, ‘I made yer potato scones.’ It’s just nuts!”); and acclaim for his role alongside Greg McHugh inthe BBC sitcom Only Child, about a son looking after his ageing dad. Of the last one, Fisher says, “One of the things that makes comedy sing is if there are people you can connect with, and where that connection really lifts it to unexpected places. The young McHugh boy does that for me. Which, when you’re 71, you think, ‘Christ, how lucky am I?’View image in fullscreenWith Bill Nighy in Love Actually.Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy“So yes, I now specialise in dotty old people losing the plot.” Is he surprised to find himself at such a career stage? He replies with a memory of the great Scottish vaudevillianStanley Baxter, who guested on a Rab C Nesbitt episode. “Stanley was already at a very advanced age.” (He is still with us, now aged 99.) “But he insisted on wearing a grey wig, despite already having grey hair. I thought, ‘You’re fine, Stanley, I think the wig’s overkill!’”Fisher himself is now in his no-need-for-a-grey-wig era, and relaxed about it. “There’ll come a time, and I hope I know when it is, that I think, ‘Maybe I’ll just give it a miss now.’ You hear stories of people, who shall remain nameless, who now have earpieces [to be fed their lines] in films and on stage. For me, I think, ‘If you can’t do it any more, you should just do something else.’”View image in fullscreen‘Christ, how lucky am I?’ … Fisher with Greg McHugh in BBC sitcom Only Child.Photograph: Graeme Hunter/BBC/BBC Scotland/Happy Tramp NorthUntil such time arrives, Fisher has his An Evening With … to look forward to, although “I’ve no idea what we’re going to talk about, because Nigel and I have yet to discuss that.” But a Q&A with his fans, in character only as himself, “doesn’t alarm me in any way”, says Fisher. “OK, there may be certain things I don’t want to talk about, personal things. But I can’t imagine somebody coming along to the Beacon Arts Centre in Greenock and asking, ‘How many times a week do you shag your wife?’” Assuming no such inquiries, “I think you just answer the questions as truthfully as you can. And you know, everybody likes a good story, don’t they?”“I’m doing it,” he concludes, unsentimental to the last, “because I love a laugh, it’s not too much pressure, and I might make a couple of quid.

That’s the miracle – when everything comes together and you’re there to catch it’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 19 Nov 2025 10.29 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 14.42 ESTShareIn 2013, I’d been living in New York for a long time. The social life was vibrant but I had never figured out a way to make pictures there. So when a friend sent me details of a teaching position in Eureka,California, I jumped at the chance. When I arrived, I found Northern California to be a confounding and beautiful place, one that inspired a new body of work almost immediately.Eureka was the first time I’d stayed so long in one place. During those months, I saw the same people day after day. I taught two days a week at the local community college and the rest of the time I was free to walk around – exploring, meeting people and taking photographs. I was entirely focused on my work, almost like a residency.Northern California is a rugged place that feels like the far-flung edge of the world. I lived in this old house on top of a hill where people rented furnished rooms. You could see the Pacific ocean and the redwoods from the upstairs windows and people came and went without announcement. The entire time, I had this feeling that I could disappear and no one would notice. I would get that feeling from others too. A lot of the people I met in Eureka were on the run, either from their own lives, or from a country they thought had let them down. Humboldt County has a mythic presence; it remains a mystery that I don’t think I ever solved.The camera has an amazing ability to elevate the mess of the everyday into coherence and harmonySome of the relationships I photographed in my book Lost Coast were five minutes long and others stretched out over months. There’s no shortcut when you take someone’s photograph. If I’m interested in someone, I walk right up to them with my camera and tell them what my work is about. That direct line of communication either opens the floodgates or shuts them down immediately. There has to be trust and mutual curiosity, otherwise it just doesn’t work. It’s my hope that the people I meet are getting as much from me as I am from them, and it’s that collaboration, the trust, and the shared vulnerability that make the work interesting to me.Photographing is a lot of waiting – for people or mood or the weather or the perfect backdrop. Waiting for the miracle to arrive. This picture highlights that interplay of chance, intuition and patience. I had visited this location numerous times without ever finding a picture there. I knew someone who lived nearby, and on this particular afternoon I had returned, hoping to find them. Instead, I turned the corner and saw this: a dusty alley lined with daisies, a few redheads, a handful of puppies, and a woman with a gas can, the whole scene lit up by blinding sun.That’s the miracle, when everything comes together, with me there to catch the whole thing. Those moments are so rare, and they disappear as quickly as they come. Like this picture, my favourite photographs tend to be open-ended. I want the pictures to ask more questions than they answer. I want the viewer to actively participate in the formation of narrative and meaning. In the end, the camera has an amazing ability to elevate the chaos and mess of the everyday world into coherence and harmony, to make even the mundane feel transcendent.View image in fullscreenPhotographer Curran HatlebergCurran Hatleberg’s CVBorn:Washington DC, 1982High point:“Showing at the Whitney Biennial.”Top tip:“Forget about inspiration, dedication is what sustains an artistic practice.”A new edition of Lost Coast, andCurran Hatleberg’s new book, Blood Green, are published byTBW BooksExplore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a new exhibition shows, it ended up influencing pop art, graphic design and electronic musicians from Kraftwerk to OMDRobert RotiferWed 19 Nov 2025 08.31 ESTShareWhen Otto Neurath died in Oxford some 80 years ago, far away from his native Vienna, he was still finding his feet in exile. Like many a Jewish refugee, the economist, philosopher and sociologist had been interned as a suspected enemy alien on the Isle of Man, along with his third wife and close collaborator Marie Reidemeister, having chanced a last-minute life-saving escape from their interim hideout in the Netherlands across the Channel in a rickety boat in 1940.Thanks to Neurath’s pioneering use of pictorial statistics – or “Isotypes” as Reidemeister called them, an acronym for “International System of Typographic Picture Education” – he left behind an enormous legacy in the arts and social sciences: it is the language through which we decode and analyse the modern world. But his lasting relevance would have been hard to predict at the time of his death at the age of 63.Neurath demanded his images ‘show the most important thing about the object at first glance’At that point, his Vienna Method of Pictorial Statistics had had relatively little impact in the UK (beyond providing strikingly simplified imagery to the public information shorts of leftist film-maker Paul Rotha). Neurath’s “visual autobiography” had been shelved by his publishers, who probably failed to follow the ambitious arc of its title, “From Hieroglyphics to Isotype”.View image in fullscreenA graphic showing residential density in large cities, designed by Marie Reidemeister (later Neurath).Photograph: Otto and Marie Neurath Isotype Collection, University of ReadingSuggesting a civilisational peak being reached in his own creation, this tome – which remained unpublished until 2010 – outlined his democratising vision for a way to overcome educational class divides, as crystallised in the slogan: “Words divide, pictures unite”.This harked back to the socialist spirit of interwar “Red Vienna”, ill at ease with the shamelessly profit-driven orientation of capitalist postwar Anglo-American pop culture. Yet Neurath’s enthusiasm for modern methods of reproduction corresponded to the nature of pop as mass-manufactured art without a unique original. And just as advertising slogans or pop songs are angling for instant appeal, Neurath also demanded images that “show the most important thing about the object at first glance”.In retrospect, his thoughtful semiotics anticipated much of pop art. Just as pop music follows hedonistic principles, Neurath’s aims went far beyond the utilitarian. As one of the linchpins ofVienna’s social housing programme, he placed “happiness” above the practical advantages of typification and standardisation, infuriating purists with his statement that “the optimal technical solution by no means always coincides with the greatest happiness.” At the same time, Neurath was enamoured with new technology, championing fellow exile Wolja Saraga’s Saraga-Generator – an early electronic instrument akin to the theremin but controlled by light – and predicting the creation of an artificial “Isotype voice” for future documentary films.It makes a lot of sense, then, that in 2017 the UK synthpop duo Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – who utilised the unlikely charm of synthesised speech as far back as the 1983 album Dazzle Ships – would release a track called Isotype. The song was intended to celebrate Neurath’s “fucking genius”, as their singer and lyricist Andy McCluskey puts it, speaking to me from his home on the Wirral. Both he andPeter Saville, the graphic designer who notably fashioned the aesthetics of OMD’s early albums as well as the corporate identity of the Manchester label Factory Records (Joy Division, New Order, etc) came across Neurath’s method back in the early 1980s.View image in fullscreenVinyl artwork for Kraftwerk’s 1974 album Autobahn.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTo them, the de-ornamentalised style of Isotype – mostly designed by Neurath’s favoured artist Gerd Arntz – seemed to perfectly pre-empt the graphic asceticism of the post-punk era. “We liked the idea of reducing things to the minimum and still getting the point across,” says McCluskey. “We had both grown up withKraftwerk’s Autobahn album, which in its later guise was the simple Isotype of the autobahn sign with the two highways and the bridge on a blue background. So these were the frames of reference which go back decades.”However, there is some ambivalence to McCluskey’s admiration of Neurath’s proto-pop imagery. “What kind of worried me was one of Otto Neurath’s phrases: ‘To remember simple pictures is better than to forget accurate figures,’” he says. “Originally that would have been a mantra that I adored. But it’s also a scary predictor of the world we live in now, in terms of soundbites and our limited capacity to understand. Doesn’t it sound like Donald Trump’s whole political mantra?”View image in fullscreenThe Factory Records logo, designed by Peter SavilleThe video for OMD’s Neurath tribute is a moving mandala of isotypes created by German artist Henning M Lederer, and takes pride of place in Wissen für alle: Isotype (“Knowledge for all”), a newly opened exhibition on Neurath’s work and legacy in Wien Museum, the recently and beautifully expanded mid-century-style Museum of the City of Vienna on Karlsplatz, bang in the middle of the Austrian capital.Featuring lots of yellowed original posters designed for Neurath’s mass-reproducable “museums of the future”, it is a compact but effective display brimming with the socialist utopian energy that would have coursed through the streets of Vienna in those heady days before the arrival of first Austro-fascism, then the Nazi regime. But what might have seemed like mere nostalgia a few years ago now feels like a rediscovered manual for resistance; a useful reminder of how leftwing politics tackled the challenge to overcome intellectual snobbery, striving to make itself understood.Wissen für alle: Isotype, die Bildsprache aus Wienis at Wien Museum, Vienna, until 5 April 2026Explore more on these topicsDesignExhibitionsTypographyNew OrderKraftwerkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In his latest,The Phoenician Scheme, a man is casually split in half in an aircraft crash. InThe Royal Tenenbaums, the patriarchal protagonist feigns a terminal illness in order to weasel his way back into his estranged and dysfunctional family. InThe Grand Budapest Hotelthe “heroic” concierge Monsieur Gustave is essentially a killer and the fictional Republic of Zubrowka is in the tightening grip of a fascist regime.All this is played for knowing comedic effect (the splatted bisection resembles a Tom and Jerry cartoon; Zubrowka is a brand of Polish bison grass vodka), while lavishly sugarcoated in a set dressing of eccentric curios, outlandish costumes and saturated colour. Anderson aficionados will be familiar with the drill, a bit like finding a gnat in a cupcake, delivered in a series of perfectly composed vignettes.AfterStanley KubrickandTim Burton, the Design Museum’s fascination with film directors has now alighted on Anderson, with an expanded version of a show devised in association with the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, where it was first shown. The format is by now familiar, featuring a curated trove of archive material arranged film by film. Among the 700 objects exhumed from a warehouse in Kent are costumes, wigs, sketches, models, fictional books, fictional art, a tent, a typewriter and dozens of stop-motion puppets.View image in fullscreenUpper-class elites … costumes from The Royal Tenenbaums on display.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty ImagesThe 30-year cinematic arc begins withBottle Rocket, an unlikely mid-90s homage to Scorsese’s Mean Streets, and ends with The Phoenician Scheme, released earlier this year to mixed reviews. Ab Rogers created the exhibition design, with rooms decorated in various shades of red, starting with post-box and terminating in maroon. The Anderson quirkfest fairly zings out from this incarnadine backdrop.Wesophiles will doubtless relish poring over the spoils, such as the implausibly intricate scale model of the Darjeeling Express, or the luxurious red velvet and mink number worn by Tilda Swinton as the desiccated dowager, Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis, in The Grand Budapest Hotel. There is also the actual Grand Budapest Hotel, a towering pink confection resembling a monstrous marzipan wedding cake, along with maquettes of the mutant sea creatures that populateThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, and an array of furry, diddy, stop-motion puppets fromFantastic Mr Fox, lined up like a vulpine identity parade.Known for his snappy dressing, Wes had a suit made from the same corduroy as Mr Fox, who was voiced by George Clooney, exemplifying Anderson’s A-list pulling power. Stellar ensemble casts are another recurring feature; blink and you may miss Swinton or Tom Hanks. Wider creative collaborators include graphic designerErica Dornand Italian costume designerMilena Canonero, whose first major screen credit was on A Clockwork Orange.View image in fullscreenFantastic … Mr Fox models his corduroy suit.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPALess committed cineastes might find the insistent “Wesness” of it all somewhat overwhelming, like being trapped in a branch of Oliver Bonas crammed with hyper-twee gewgaws. The tone of object fetishisation is set from the get-go as the show opens with a vitrine full of identical, spiral bound notebooks, filled with preternaturally neat and precise handwriting outlining ideas for each film. Wes is, and has always been, a details man.The pervading impression is of a creative finickiness verging on the obsessive. Supreme pains are taken, whether it’s auditioning left-handed children to achieve the right kind of 1960s handwriting for a five-word note on screen for seconds inMoonrise Kingdom, or employing the exact type of ink favoured by the Japanese yakuza for a tattoo on the back of Mayor Kobayashi, a puppet character fromIsle of Dogs.The laborious technique of stop-motion animation, which requires models to be manipulated between 12 and 24 times for each second of film, must take the biscuit. Fantastic Mr Fox took two years to make and the animators, who are more like performers, are required to make the puppet model act and feel like a real person.Less cosy and less discussed is what American criticJonah Weiner has describedas “the clumsy, discomfiting way Anderson stages interactions between white protagonists – typically upper-class elites – and non-white foils, typically working-class and poor”. This was especially apparent inThe Darjeeling Limited, featuring three white men blundering haplessly around “exotic” India, a reminder of the absence of real-world politics in Anderson’s films. Concentrating on the minutiae of their art and craft conveniently swerves any knotty issues.Yet for all the tantalising stuff on show, there’s something fundamentally disconcerting about deconstructing the kinetic medium of film in order to reframe it as a collection of static objects. It’s like pulling back the curtain to find the scenery creaking and the mystique, if not exactly dissolved, then certainly altered. Invariably, there’s a certain reductive lifelessness about it all.Nonetheless, Anderson’s idiosyncratic, deadpan hipster view of the world continues to attract an appreciable following. It has even spawned an extensive fan website,Accidentally Wes Anderson, to which devotees can submit Andersonesque tableaux of kooky buildings and landscapes. Scrolling through colour-coded Alpine chalets, darling launderettes and the odd Crochet Museum, it would would appear that there really is no escaping Wes World.Wes Anderson: The Archivesis at the Design Museum, London, 21 November to 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsDesignWes AndersonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mm-mm. Mmmmmwwwwwmmm. MMM. Sometimes sexy and sometimes sleepy, sometimes like a kid making airplane noises or doing an impression of a creaking door or maybe a whale, the sound of Harold Offeh humming and ummming fills the lobby of Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge. Mmm, he goes, mmm-mm-mm. He up-speaks and mumbles and wrings a whole world of feeling out of this disembodied overture. The title of Offeh’s show, including that Mmm, is a quote,from a song on Portishead’s 1994 album Dummy. “Gotta try a little harder / It could be sweet,” runs the lyric, which is also printed in big gloopy lettering on the gallery walls, behind Offeh’s video screens, his photographs and other graphic interventions. The show blares and jostles with life, with song and dance, with skits and routines, with public moments and private performances on the loo and in the bathroom.For more than two decades Offeh has been a moving target. Here’s the Ghanaian-born Offeh as Haroldinho, in Rio de Janeiro in 2003, shuffling samba steps and wearing typical, Brazilian blue worker’s overalls, his adopted name appliqued on the back. Dancing in the streets and on the beach, he sways and smiles, an object of mild curiosity to passersby. In Rio, people often assumed he was Brazilian. Here he is again, now on the streets and shopping centres of Walsall, Oxford, Liverpool and Chester, in Stockholm and Banff, in the shadow of the Canadian Rockies, wearing a Victorian-era magnifying lens in front of his face, which distorts and exaggerates his features. Given the suspicious looks he gets on the British streets, you worry for his safety.View image in fullscreen‘The artist as reclining soul singer’ … Harold Offeh’s Lounging.Photograph: © Harold OffehSometimes a smile will see you through. A closeup of Offeh’s face, maintaining a sardonic rictus-like grin fills the screen. He’s listening, over and over again, to Nat King Cole and the Nelson Riddle Orchestra’s 1954 version of the Charlie Chaplin-composed Smile. Made in 2001, when Offeh was still a student, Smile is the earliest work here. He went on to mimic the exaggerated facial expressions and closeup reaction-shots of black actor Hattie McDaniel in her role as Mammy, the enslaved house servant in the 1939 movie Gone With the Wind. Subjected to racism and discrimination throughout her life as a blues singer and the first Black recipient of an Oscar in 1939 (as best supporting actor in the same movie), McDaniel becomes Offeh’s model as he runs the gamut of her on-screen performance. Hair done-up in a white scarf, eye-rolling, eyebrow-raising, lip-curling and cheek-blowing for the camera, Offeh mimics her racially stereotyped performance.I laughed out loud, in the way that you laugh at a bleak moment in a Samuel Beckett playHere he is again, wearing an “I LIKE BOYS” T-shirt and then in drag and snapping his fingers like a disco diva, flaming to Armando’s 100% of Disin’ You. Now he’s lounging in stilled, silent emulation of singerTeddy Pendergrass, posing with his hands together in a lewd gesture. This is the artist as reclining soul singer, comfortable in his studied masculinity. Offeh went on to perform drag impersonations of Black R&B and disco stars in Covers, in which he adopts their record-sleeve postures. Wearing a black leotard he performs Marlena Shaw’s stylised pose on Take a Bite, Millie Jackson’s Get Out and Get Some, Amii Stewart’s Knock on Wood. Getting into position in different parts of his house, he does Melba Moore’s Hot and Tasty in his cluttered loft, and for his rendition of Grace Jones’s Slave to the Rhythm he gets naked in the bathroom, slathering himself up in oil to attempt Jones’sanatomically impossible montaged posefrom the cover of her Island Life album, originally designed by John-Paul Goude.There’s parody, vulnerability, homage and critique and more than a hint of desire at play in Covers, which Offeh has also re-performed in a series of staged photographs.In 2020, Offeh tried to re-enact the contorted poses ofHenri Gaudier-Brzeska’s early modernist sculptures in the Kettle’s Yard collection. If he tried any harder, he’d do himself a mischief. Offeh is compelling to watch, even when he is lying in the bath or just standing on the pavement, the world swirling round him. He is happy to objectify himself, I think, even as he questions what it means to be a queer, Black body. That vulnerability and curiosity are also present in his early, 2002 Four Ways to Feel Amazing, in which we find the artist listening to self-help advice. Naked in his bath, looking like a lost little boy with a half-drowned toy as his only friend, he is advised to nurture himself. Standing on a street and looking schlumpy and alone he’s told to stop comparing himself with others (while being the solitary Black person among the milling shoppers); on the lavatory with his trousers down, he’s told that he is sitting on top of the world. In the last of these vignettes, he is alone in a bare room, staring at a digital clock as he is asked to live in the moment and to feel “the Now”. As the numbers flip on the clock, there’s a crushing sense of futility and stalled time. I laughed out loud, in the way that you laugh at a bleak moment in a Samuel Beckett play. Behind the evident joyfulness of his early work, there is an underlying pain. You feel it in Offeh’s comic timing, the eye-to-camera moments, the beat and the pause.View image in fullscreenHarold Offeh’s Covers: After Grace Jones, Island Life, 1985 (Graceful Arabesque).Photograph: Courtesy the artistOffeh performs less nowadays and his body is no longer centre stage. All the graphic razzmatazz, and an increasing installational complexity (some of which is influenced by Afrofuturism and Brazilian Tropicália, particularly the work ofHélio Oiticica) keeps the energy up even as the tempo and tenor of his art slows. On the evidence here, Offeh’s focus has shifted of late more towards community-based projects that, to my mind, are less compelling as art works themselves than as social inquiry. He has worked with young people ona project for the London Underground, and on aplaygroundwhose design was influenced by Sun Ra and George Benson. His video documentation of a workshop at Charleston in Sussex, the country retreat of the Bloomsbury Group, during an exhibition of the erotic works of Duncan Grant, and in which participants discuss queer sex, love and desire, is a dull watch. The interviews with immigrants and members of the local LGTBQ+ community in a small town in Japan, where Offeh undertook a residency in 2019, or the archival interviews about queer life in Toronto, from the 1950s to the present, might be compelling fragments of storytelling, but Offeh here is playing the role of witness and documentarian rather than artist. But he probably sees the role of artist in terms of his usefulness nowadays.In the gallery, there’s a sign hanging overhead. It says PLAY. This participatory, social turn in Offeh’s work has its own rewards, but to make art, maybe you gotta try a little less. It could be sweet.At Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, until 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtVideo artPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Producers HBO had previously said that John Lithgow would play Albus Dumbledore, Paapa Essiedu would be Severus Snape, Janet McTeer would be Minerva McGonagall, and Nick Frost would appear as Rubeus Hagrid.View image in fullscreenDominic McLaughlin, who is set to become Harry Potter for a decade.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/HBORadcliffe said: “I do not want to be a spectre in the lives of these children. I just wanted to write to [McLaughlin] to say, ‘I hope you have the best time, and an even better time than I did – I had a great time, but I hope you have an even better time. And I do. I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them. They just seem so young. I do look at them and say, ‘Oh it’s crazy I was doing that.’ But it’s also incredibly sweet and I hope they’re having a great time.”Since falling out with Harry Potter author JK Rowlingover trans rights and gender identity issues, Radcliffe has kept his distance from the new TV series, saying that he had no plans to be involved in it.He told E! Online in 2024: “I think [the producers] very wisely want to [have] a clean break. And I don’t know if it would work to have us do anything in it.”The new series is due to premiere in 2027 and, according to HBO, will be a “faithful adaptation” of the books by Rowling, who serves as an executive producer. The eight feature films based on the books were released between 2001 and 2011, and the series has a similarly ambitious timeframe, with Casey Bloys, chairman and CEO of HBO and Max Content, sayingit would run for “10 consecutive years”.Explore more on these topicsFilmDaniel RadcliffeHarry PotterFilm adaptationsHBOTelevisionScience fiction and fantasy filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

JTI still sponsors the Royal Academy of Arts and theLondon Philharmonic Orchestra.The move was welcomed by critics, who had been calling for an end to the deal since 2016, when 1,000 experts signed an open letter to the British Museum and the Royal Academy over what they called themorally unacceptablesponsorship by JTI.Dr Allen Gallagher, the co-director of theTobacco Control Research Groupat the University of Bath, said such agreements “enable a deadly industry to use UK cultural institutions as a way to try and improve its public image”.The Labour MP Dr Simon Opher, who is a GP, said: “I find it deeply troubling that a national cultural institution has been sponsored by a tobacco company for 15 years in clear breach of WHO guidelines.”He said there were no circumstances in which public bodies should be “legitimising an industry that profits from harm”.A British Museum spokesperson said the institution was grateful for JTI’s support and that sponsorship was a crucial way for it to secure its financial future.“The museum operates on public and private funding, which ensures the magnificent collection remains free and accessible to the public for centuries to come,” they said.“As a public body we have an obligation to ensure the long-term financial stability of the museum by securing funding from a number of sources. Their support enabled the museum to significantly increase accessibility and engagement with the collection for under-represented adults.”The decision again highlights the controversies surrounding sponsorship of cultural institutions in the UK, which have often centred on the British Museum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Climate activists have previouslyheld several other protests in the museum.The museum’s leadership has continued to defend the deal. Its director, Nicholas Cullinan, has said he uses two criteria to weigh up donations and sponsorship.“One is: was the money legally acquired? The other is: will accepting it cause us reputational damage?” he said shortly after starting at the museum. “I think you have to have very good, clear reasons for turning down money that would help to keep the British Museum free to the public.”Members of the Museums Association, an industry body, voted last month to adopta code of ethicsthat expects museums to transition away from sponsorship by “organisations involved with environmental harm – including fossil fuels – human rights abuses, and other sponsorship that does not align with the values of the museum”.Explore more on these topicsBritish MuseumCorporate sponsorshipTobacco industryMuseumsJapannewsShareReuse this content"

Sotheby’s declined to identify the successful buyer of the painting.Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer was looted by the Nazis and nearly destroyed in a fire during the second world war, but in 1948 it was returned to Lederer’s brother Erich, who was a frequent subject of drawings and paintings by Klimt’s friend and fellow artist Egon Schiele. It remained in Erich’s possession for most of his life, until he sold it in 1983, two years before his death.In 1985 the painting became part of the private art collection of Estée Lauder heir Leonard A Lauder, who displayed it in his Fifth Avenue home in New York but for brief periods when it was lent to galleries. Lauder died in June, aged 92.Art historian Emily Braun, who worked as Lauder’s art adviser for nearly four decades,told CNNthat the painting was the jewel of his collection.“He ate lunch whenever he was at home, and lunch would be at a little round table right by the painting,” Braun said.The painting was one of just two full-length Klimt portraits that remain in private hands.It was predicted before Tuesday that the Klimt painting would sell for more than $150m (£114m, A$230m). But it smashed expectations to represent more than 40% of the total value of Lauder’s collection, which fetched $575.5m (£437.5m, A$885.7m) with fees.The sale of Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sets a new record for a Klimt painting at auction,surpassing the $108m record set by the sale of Lady with a Fan in 2023.In 2006, Lauder’s brother Ronald paid $135m in a private sale, rather than at auction, for Klimt’s famous Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer 1, widely known as Woman in Gold.The most expensive artwork ever sold at auction was Salvator Mundi by Leonardo da Vinci,which sold in 2017 for US$450.3m in 2017.After the auction of Lauder’s collection on Tuesday night, Sotheby’s proceeded with a wider auction of modern art that included a solid gold, fully functional toilet satirising the ultrarich.‘Gunshots were my obsession’: the nicked golden toilet’s creator on his new pump-action artRead moreThe 101kg, 18-karat-gold toilet, titled America, was made by Maurizio Cattelan, the provocative Italian artistknown for taping a banana to a wall and selling it for $5.2m. But on Tuesday, his gold toilet received only a single bid that met the asking price of $10m, or $12.1m with fees.Cattelan created two solid gold toilets in 2016. The other was displayed in 2016 at New York’s Guggenheim Museum, which pointedly offered to lend it to US president Donald Trump when he asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.It was later stolen while on display in England at Blenheim Palace.Two men were convicted in the toilet heist, but the loo was never found. Investigators believe it probably was broken up and melted down.Cattelan has said that his gold toilets satirise superwealth, once saying: “Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise.”Explore more on these topicsArtGustav KlimtNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

His masterwork isPalestine, a collected volume of single-issue comic books he created in the 1990s, documenting the violence in Gaza. His technique is to embed as a journalist in a war zone and interview people on the street, telling their stories with pictures. Lessons on global politics emerge from ultra-local conflict and depictions of day-to-day life.Palestine propelledSaccoto fame, drawing comparisons with Maus,Art Spiegelman’stwo-volume saga about Polish Jews during the Holocaust with Nazis portrayed as cats, and Jews as mice. These works are sold prominently in bookshops, not in musty basements packed with racks of polyethylene-sheathed superhero comics. Alongside a couple of others, Maus and Palestine signalled that graphic novels, as they became known, could be serious works of fiction, nonfiction and journalism. Palestine itself is as depressingly relevant today as it was in the 1990s. In December 2023, it was reprinted for the first time in a decade, after selling out following the 7 October attacks.The historical backdrop to Sacco’s work is colonialism. Just as Palestine charts the long-term ramifications of the Balfour declaration, this new book explores the legacy of the disastrous and inherently violent act of Indian partition in 1947. It’s a history told through the lens of a seemingly small-scale, parochial conflict in a very rural part of Uttar Pradesh, northernIndia, more than six decades after the British imposed a chaotic division of the country along very poorly devised religious lines. Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy of British India, lacking any humility or foresight, declared: “I shall give you complete assurance. I shall see to it that there is no bloodshed and riot.”Sacco’s focus isthe Muzaffarnagar riotsof 2013, but he spends time documenting the history of the region and the tensions that foreshadowed them. Their exact cause is disputed: a Jat Hindu woman was “eve-teased” – a grim euphemism for public sexual harassment – by a Muslim man, who was then killed by her brothers, who were subsequently killed themselves. Or was it a traffic incident that spiralled into sectarian scrapping, escalating into murder by rampaging gangs?If the trigger remains a mystery, the outcome is well documented: clashes between two communities, dozens killed, hundreds injured and tens of thousands displaced. At every juncture, politicians and religious leaders fail to maintain peace and control.View image in fullscreenA page from The Once and Future Riot.Photograph: The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Jonathan Cape, £20).And so this becomes a story of the uneasy relationship between democracy and sectarian politics, and the brutality that constantly lurks in the shadows. It charts how rumour and misinformation fuel chaos – a video on Facebook purporting to show a local Jat boy being lynched was pivotal in igniting feverish violence, though it turned out to be years old and from Afghanistan.The riots lasted a few days, with the army eventually brought in to quell the violence. Sacco chronicles its aftermath in camps the dispossessed – both Jat and Muslim, but mostly Muslim – were forced into, and the attempts at reparations, which were inept and possibly corrupt.The “future riot” of the title invokes the idea that violence is a perennial feature of democratic processes in India. Prime minister Modi’s rise was at least partly fuelled by riots in Gujarat in 2002, after a train containing Hindu pilgrims was set on fire and Muslims were blamed. Anti-Muslim prejudice following the Muzaffarnagar riots themselves benefited Modi’s Hindu nationalist BJP. A decade later, the atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh, and the wider country, remains volatile. In the concluding pages, Sacco turns to a question of global significance: does a democracy that foments violence risk being overwhelmed by it?There’s wit and realism in the panels and art. It’s dynamic and clear, and the people seem less like caricatures than in Palestine. Vox pops punctuate the narrative, a reminder of the subjective experience of people on the street, in the midst of the action. There is, however, a strange phenomenon I’ve not seen before in 40 years of reading comics. The skin tone of all of the protagonists is dark, and the shading is done not by cross-hatching, but by parallel horizontal lines. Once I noticed it, it became distracting, like TV interference on every character’s face, and I couldn’t unsee it. This may seem like a pathetically trivial point, but comics are a visual medium, and you have to get on with the art. Get over it, I told myself, because the story is important and compelling, but it niggles.Above all,Joe Saccois a journalist, and this is journalism. The format, of which he is almost the only exponent, has a subjectivity absent from traditional approaches. The memories of the protagonists are sometimes contradictory, but Sacco includes them nonetheless. The graphic novel – a wholly unsatisfactory descriptor – can contain all the complexity of a tumultuous politics. In an era when long-form journalism is under pressure, and political analysis filleted to morsels, Sacco’s work is a lifeline.The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).

From Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway to more recent offerings such as Sarah Gilmartin’sThe Dinner Partyand Teresa Präauer’sCooking in the Wrong Century, an intimate soiree provides the perfect recipe of claustrophobia and choreography into which a novelist can sink their teeth. The preparations are usually unduly stressful, the guest list dynamic unpredictable, the quantity of alcohol borderline obscene – in short, as a device it has all the ingredients for total, delicious carnage.The latest entrant to this literary Come Dine With Me is Viola van de Sandt, whose debut The Dinner Party centres on Franca, a shy young woman from the Netherlands tasked with hosting a meal for her English fiance Andrew and his two male colleagues. To make matters more challenging, it is the hottest day of the year, the menu is rabbit (despite Franca’s vegetarianism) and her sous chef is their often violent pet cat.Before we get to all this, though, the novel begins with the words “Stella says I should write a letter”, adding two further literary devices into the mix. For Stella is Franca’s therapist, with whom she now meets regularly to unpack the repercussions of that disastrous evening a year ago, while the entire novel is framed as a correspondence addressed to the enigmatic “Harry”.Through this letter, and these therapy sessions, Franca’s backstory is revealed, from her grief-stricken childhood to her lonely student days in Utrecht, where she meets first Harry and later the handsome Andrew. Very soon she persuades herself that none of her problems “would matter if I became part of this beautiful, privileged man’s life”, so she drops out of university and follows Andrew back to the UK. There she half-heartedly applies for some internships, then spends her days lounging around his Kensington flat drinking and watching episodes of The Crown.The queasy smells, unctuous textures and ‘nameless dread’ are like something from a horror storyThere are echoes here of Natasha Brown’s astonishing debutAssembly, a searing examination of race and class, as well as Olivia Sudjic’sAsylum Road, in which a young Bosnian woman tries to outrun her traumatic past by immersing herself in the wealthy world of her British boyfriend. That said, the class politics are never really interrogated, while Franca’s “otherness” is barely remarked upon. Andrew, at least before the dinner party, seems a bit arrogant but broadly fine, while Franca gives little sense of what she would like to be doing instead – there are vague references to becoming a writer, though as Harry says: “I can’t work out if it’s something youreallywant, or if it’s what youwantto want.”If the themes and characterisations are slightly muted (at one point Franca refers to herself as “bland, beige béarnaise”), the novel is much bolder in its repeated references to the dinner party’s climax, or as Franca puts it to Stella: “the culmination, the denouement […] That business with the knife.” Meanwhile, the party itself is described in intensely visceral prose, from the cannellini beans that resemble “fat maggots” to the rabbits whose “flesh glistens, seems to crawl”, everything pungent and putrid and rotting in the heat: “The fridge is dead: the butter is swimming in its dish, and the milk has curdled. The knife lies on the counter.”It is here that Van de Sandt is at her strongest, the queasy smells, unctuous textures and “nameless dread” like something from a horror story. The description of Franca stuffing a cavity is positively grotesque, while, over the course of the evening, Franca’s own body is slowly torn apart – first shredded by the cat’s vicious scratches, then blistered by a dropped cigarette, then violated by a terrible act.The tension builds and builds to its bloody climax; by contrast, the present-day sections see Franca – thanks to her sessions with Stella – slowly building towards a new sense of calm, finding solace in the mundane pleasure of refurbishing her one-bedroom Berlin flat. The combination is sometimes jarring, like two different recipes spliced together, but this formidable debut offers plenty to savour.The Dinner Party by Viola van de Sandt is published by Headline (£20).

It wittily fuses the real and the fictional into a trance-state – and that’s the state that I’ve sometimes found a little static in previous films by Lucile Hadžihalilović, but not here. Dreamily strange it might be (and in fact, on the face of it, entirely preposterous) this movie had me gripped with its two outstanding lead performances – fromMarion Cotillardand newcomer Clara Pacini – and a clamorous musical score.Cotillard plays a diva-ish movie actor called Cristina, who is the lead in a new adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen being filmed on a soundstage which is in a remote and snowy spot in late 60s France; she is gorgeously costumed in a sparkling white form-fitting gown and crown, a look she carries off with great unsmiling hauteur. Pacini plays Jeanne, a teenage girl in a foster home nearby, stricken with memories of the death of her mother, whose bead necklace she keeps. In her loneliness and grief, Jeanne has projected her feelings into an obsession with the story of the Snow Queen, an obsession further displaced at another remove into idolising the teen girls who ice-skate at the local rink. One day she runs away, stealing the ID of an older girl called Bianca and breaks into the film studio to sleep overnight; she somehow gets a job as an extra, astonished to realise what story is being filmed, and it is here that her gamine prettiness and air of demurely sensitive adoration for the queen catches Cristina’s eye.Cristina’s somewhat louche director Dino, played by cameo by Hadžihalilović’s partner Gaspar Noé, is in the habit of telling likely young actresses that he might cast them in his next project, a Hitchcockian thriller. In fact, there is something Hitchcockian in this shoot, with an attack carried out by a bird, and in Cristina’s own cold, cruel detachment from the victim’s suffering. Hadžihalilović might intend us to notice in one shot a movie poster for The Red Shoes, but the Powell/Pressburger film that this more resembles is surely Black Narcissus with its female desire and delirium in the bitter mountain cold.Cristina and Jeanne become very close in a dangerous way, although the younger woman is always subject to Cristina’s whim and caprices, the starry mannerisms which Cristina has learned to enforce her own status and mask her vulnerability. There is a great shot of Jeanne’s awestruck gaze as she turns the pages of a glossy-magazine profile of Cristina. She learns, along with the audience, that they have much in common: Cristina herself was once in a foster home, and appears to have been guided and protected in her early years by a male confidant, Max (August Diehl), who calls himself her friend and doctor. Has Max been prescribing certain medications for Cristina?Sequences in the film let us drift on to the set of The Snow Queen, as if in a dream; it is a production design which fabricates the ice-realm in all its seductive artificiality, with the ice tower in one shot juxtaposed with Cristina’s own statuesque poise. We can feel what Jeanne woozily feels: that she has miraculously found herself in the ice realm with the ice queen herself. But what does Cristina want of Jeanne – and what can she want of Cristina? It is a mesmeric melodrama, mixing sensuality with a teetering anxiety, balancing on a cliff-edge of disaster.The Ice Tower screened at theBerlin film festivaland is in UK cinemas from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekDrama filmsMarion CotillardFestivalsBerlin film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nevertheless, their content conveyor belt rolls on, offering treats about as substantial and enduring as cotton candy beginning in mid-November.A Merry Little Ex-Mas review – Netflix’s season of cheapo festive fare begins with a shrugRead moreLike American chocolates that no longer, in fact,contain real chocolatebut sell like gangbusters on Halloween anyway, the Netflix Christmas movie, like rival holiday movie master Hallmark, is relied upon, even beloved, for its brand of badness, for its rote familiarity (nostalgic casting, basement-bargain budgets, Styrofoam snow, knowingly absurd premise) and uncanny artificial filler, for its ability to deliver hits of sugary pleasure while still somehow under-delivering on expectations. At worst, these films are forgettable train wrecks (last week’sA Merry Little Ex-Mas); at best, they are forgettable fun, such as the Lindsay Lohan comeback vehicleFalling For Christmas, of which I remember nothing other than cackling with my friend on her couch. (Actually, at best they are memorably ludicrous, such as last year’s impressively unseriousHot Frosty.)Champagne Problems, Netflix’s latest Christmas concoction, disappears into the vast middle of the forgettable spectrum. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, a former studio writer whose last Netflix-core romcom,Love in the Villa, was so disposable I forgot I had even reviewed it, it goes down like cheap bubbly, appropriately flat and situational.It begins, naturally, with what one imagines an AI-generated ad for drugstore brand champagne would look like, should US drugstores be legally allowed to market their own champagne. The commercial, it turns out, is actually the pitch of one Sydney Price (Minka Kelly) to her colleagues at the Roth Group, a private equity fund (without, of course, saying the words private equity) looking to take over a legacy champagne brand. With perpetual TV curls and an endless supply of luxe coats, Sydney is the construction paper cut-out of a career woman – underestimated, obsessed with her phone, ambitious to the detriment of her personal life and, in fact, any personality at all. So much so that when her ogreish boss (Mitchell Mullen) selects her to fly to France and close the deal over Christmas, her sister Skyler (Maeve Courtier-Lilley) makes her pinky promise: she must take a single night in Paris to actually live for herself.Of course, there’s no place like Paris to wrest one away from Google Maps, even when the city is laden with below-grade CGI snow. And at an absurdly cutesy bookstore, Sydney meet-cutes with Henri Cassell (Tom Wozniczka), who does the wresting of her beloved Google Maps. As demanded by the genre, Sydney at first resists this absurdly perfect man for silly reasons (work, a briefly mentioned divorce, just because).Equally as expected are movie mechanics proceeding at abrupt quarter turns, just as one rotates the ageing champagne bottles in the cellars of Chateau Cassel, the champagne vineyard Sydney hopes to acquire. The catch? Henri is the heir to Chateau Cassel, as reluctant to run it as he is resentful of his father Hugo (Thibault de Montalembert) for selling it – and, in perhaps the film’s most salient contribution to the genre, extremely judgmental of private equity. The conflict? Sydney sincerely believes she’s not stripping this family-owned company for parts, and is competing for the acquisition with three caricatures: a severe French grand dame (Astrid Whettnall), a severe blond German man (Flula Borg), and severely delusional gay billionaire (Sean Amsing, admirably if annoyingly unhinged). The twist? Sydney’s skeevy co-worker Ryan (Xavier Samuel, who has more chemistry with Kelly in a single scene than Wozniczka does in the whole movie), shows up unannounced. The grist? Henri and Sydney look yearningly at each other in holiday pyjamas, across a vast chasm in economic worldview.The gift and the curse, of course, is that none of this sticks for longer than a bubbly buzz on an empty stomach. And there is no real absorbent filler here – Kelly, still best known for playing a deceptively sharp cheerleader in Friday Night Lights, goes for strictly serviceable, all sweet surfaces and gestures of care, more a maternal presence than a romantic lead. Wozniczka, too, provides exactly the dollop of French charm with mild self-torture and nothing more. The gimmicks are unfunny, the romance inoffensive, the happy-ever-after straightforward. For all its waxing poetic on the specific luxury of champagne, no one is pretending this is anything other than a mass market item; the things to hate are also the things to like. One might call a critic’s feelings about it a champagne problem.Champagne Problems is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsNetflixComedy filmsChristmasComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Pitting a grizzled prospector against an entire platoon of Nazis, writer-director Jalmari Helander heeded the lessons of George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road, principally that there is serious cinematic value in going pedal-to-the-metal along a single, straight narrative line. That profitable sleeper hit now yields this choice follow-up, which somehow feels more expansive while still clocking in under 90 minutes.Having seen off the SS, indomitable hero Aatami (Jorma Tommila) gains a tragic backstory and a new, vicious postwar foe in the tremendously named Red Army butcher Igor Draganov, played by wily James Cameron favourite Stephen Lang. Again, the economy of Helander’s approach proves striking and thrilling. No unnecessary obstacles have been placed between the audience and a good time at the movies: we get one scene of Aatami dismantling his family home beam by beam and one scene of Draganov being sprung from jail before the pair intersect in the back roads of Soviet-occupiedFinland. Cutting to the chase grants Helander time to craft set pieces in which Aatami outthinks and outflanks the Red Army’s might; in this respect, Sisu 2 is a more-of-the-same sequel. The good news is that it remains terrific: punchy, old-school stunt work, crisply uncluttered cutting, and varied, inventive baddie-splattering from the moment Aatami deploys one of those beams to take down a jet fighter.Revelling in his homeland’s gorgeous, sun-dappled scenery, Helander has the boyish enthusiasm of a kid playing war games in the woods; you half-expect someone’s mum to call everybody in for tea. It may be cartoonish – look sharp for a regrettably misplaced mousetrap – but the comic-strip simplicity serves as a rebuke to knottier blockbusters. You don’t need excessive CGI with practical special effects as potently compelling as Tommila’s bloodied, defiant face. The script meanwhile offers one grace note after another; those beams become a memento, then a life raft, then a new beginning.Like his protagonist, Helander holds on to the essential, torches the rest, and goes harder and faster for it. His film should raise huge cheers in Kyiv – and, indeed, everywhere else.Sisu: Road to Revenge is out on 20 November in Australia, and 21 November in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsFinlandEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a surrealist film whose surrealism resides not merely in the bizarre parched landscape of the Sierra Morena mountain range with its bleached skulls, hanged bandits, crows and mysterious inns in which seductive encounters are to be had, but also simply in the bewildering juxtaposition of individual tales and anecdotes, stories which grow out of each other. The surrealist effect (and the comedy) is in the jolt from one micro-narrative to the other, and the realisation that the overall story is thwarted and undermined.The premise is that in the Spanish town of Saragossa during the Napoleonic wars, one officer tries to arrest another, who is apparently reading an old book – but is then distracted by the fact that this book is about his own grandfather, the nobleman Alfonse Van Worden. (Later we discover that the passages about this grandfather have been added by hand, in pen-and-ink, hence Saragossa Manuscript.) Then we flash back to the this preening aristocrat-soldier himself, played by prominent Polish actor Zbigniew Cybulski.While travelling on horseback through the wilderness in the blazing heat, Alfonse encounters a grim gallows with two dead men, and has an erotic interlude with two Muslim princesses who require him to convert. Is it a dream? We get another flashback showing the life of Alfonse’s father, a proud blueblood and insatiable duellist, Alfonse is later arrested by the Spanish Inquisition – which he didn’t expect – and encounters a hermit, a scholar of the occult and a mathematician, tale-tellers and raconteurs all, and a stylish Gypsy in whose own reams of garrulous stories Alfonse’s father is to reappear.It is pure narrative chaos, a kaleidoscope in which meaning and resolution always appear to be just around the corner or just over the horizon. The Saragossa Manuscript is like Cervantes or Borges, but also very much like Alejandro Jodorowsky (those hanged men and princess are like the tarot cards beloved by Jodorowsky) andTerry Gilliam. The farcical encounters could be sketches by Monty Python or even plays by Mr Ernie Wise. And it is all shot on crisp, clean monochrome which makes watching it feel like binging on dozens of episodes of some cult countercultural TV comedy from 1960s Poland.“I no longer know where reality ends and fantasy begins,” whimpers Alfonse at one point. The thing to be savoured about The Saragossa Manuscript is its lack of irony and self-awareness; there is a kind of innocence and even refinement in the drama, even as it outrageously swerves off the beaten track of conventional storytelling.The Saragossa Manuscript is on Klassiki from 20 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsPolandComedyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

This documentary narrated by Imelda Staunton tells the story of the campaign to hold the Irish government to account for its role in the laundries, mother and baby homes and industrial schools for children. A key figure in that campaign is Maeve O’Rourke, an impressive young Irish human rights lawyer whose master’s thesis at Harvard Law School served as a key legal submission in the legal fight for justice.O’Rourke had plans for a career in international human rights law until she watched a survivor speaking in a debate on Irish television. We see that footage here, of Michael O’Brien, a former mayor and survivor of rape and torture by priests at a residential school, as he blasts a government minister, white-hot with fury, his trauma raw. It takes your breath away. This thorough documentary hears from campaigners, historians and survivors – including Philomena Lee, forced to give up her son, who was trafficked and sold to rich Americans. Lee was later portrayed on screen by Judi Dench.The scale of scandal is at times overwhelming. There was the mass grave found at the St Mary’s mother and baby home near Tuam in Galway – the bodies of 796 babies and children dumped in a septic tank. The spitefulness of the abusers is a recurrent theme, such as a nun throwing baby clothes at a young mum, who had knitted them for her baby – removed from her for adoption just minutes earlier. The expressions of remorse from the religious organisations are best described as carefully drafted. Legally, they are untouchable. But the film ends on a triumphant high, a lunch in Dublin for survivors, honoured like celebrities by crowds outside cheering, waving banners, celebrating their courage; it left me in floods of tears.● Testimony is in UK cinemas from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIrelandCatholicismChristianityEuropeReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yes, there is room for a touch of cuteness along the lines of Vinnie Monachello’s barking Toto, but it is only with the stage-engulfing flap of the Wicked Witch’s black cloak and the hi-tech bewilderment of the Wizard’s lair that the production becomes serious enough to be gripping.AtTheatre by the Lake, Keswick, until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsThe Wizard Of OzLake DistrictChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

The setting is central because the dystopia has been caused by a biomedical waste dump in the river. London is flooded and this flat on the 16th floor is the safest place to live.Or so it seems, because things are very opaque in this experimental production. Devised by director Adam Lenson, Stu Barter, Rachel Bellman, Annabelle Lee Revak, Darren Clark and Shaye Poulton Richards, it brings an electro-folk sound to bitty storylines in two timezones. There are the tower block survivors – it is unclear which century they are living in until close to the end when they mention the year 2425 – and a second storyline in the past which might be the 1990s (there is talk of DVDs) in which a couple moves into a luxury high-rise overlooking the Thames (the same 16th-floor flat?).Ash (Eric Stroud) is a scientist, Emily (Holly Freeman) a civil servant. Both are, handily, implicated in the climate disaster to come. Short scenes take us through their relationship and the storyline on toxic waste but they seem like filler between the songs.View image in fullscreenMeditative music … Precipice.Photograph: Alex BrennerThe music is meditative in pace and grounds the story rather than propelling it, especially as the relationship between the couple begins to fray. Some instrumental accompaniments are nice (with synth, guitar, cello and harmonica) but the songs are not infectious in themselves, with cumbersome lyrics that aspire for emotional interiority but sound waffly and pedestrian. There is one about a game of Monopoly, another about a mudlarker that does not seem to belong to this musical, and one about the increase of anti-microbial resistance, which is quite a mouthful.Its various strands hold promise but none engage or progress enough. There is haphazard worldbuilding within the dystopia: we meet characters as they celebrate “The Balance” (what is this?) and give thanks to its founder, Robin Blake (who is he?). There is a deadly, Hunger Games-style Tombola which ends in one resident’s eviction but we do not gather enough detail about the dangers of the world beyond this tower so the stakes remain low. A character called Biscuits (Max Alexander-Taylor) gets the short straw but we know so little of his backstory or his fears that the force of this storyline is neutered. Flashbacks lack significance and elementary facts are revealed too late (we are told that martial law was established in this society in the year 2034).The endeavour to create a new, boundary-breaking musical form is clear but the attempt at reconception drowns out the drama.AtNew Diorama, London, until 13 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 19 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Nov 2025 10.01 ESTShareArc Raiders is, by all accounts, a late game-of-the-year contender. Dropped into a multiplayer world overrun with hostile drones and military robots, every human player is at the mercy of the machines – and each other. Can you trust the other raider you’ve spotted on your way back to humanity’s safe haven underground, or will they shoot you and take everything you’ve just scavenged? Perhaps surprisingly, humanity is (mostly) choosing to band together, according to most people I’ve talked to about this game.In areview for Gamespot, Mark Delaney paints a beguiling picture of Arc Raiders’s potential for generating war stories, and highlights its surprisingly hopeful tone as the thing that elevates it above similar multiplayer extraction shooters: “We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I’ve ever played.”But, but, but, but … There is a small irony to Arc’s depiction of humanity united against the machines. The game uses AI-generated text-to-speech voices, trained on real actors. (The game also uses machine learning to improve the behaviour and animation of its robot enemies, a different type of “AI”, which video games have been using for ever.) Games writer Rick Lane found this to be so ethically compromising that he couldn’t look past it. “For Arc Raiders to ride the wave of human sociability all the way to the bank, while also being so contemptuous of the thing that makes us social animals – carving up human voices and reassembling them like a digital Victor Frankenstein – demonstrates a lack of artistic integrity that I find impossible to ignore,”he wrote for Eurogamer.Generative AI in video game development is becoming a red-line issue for many players (although it’s impossible to tellhowmany – neither social media outrage nor Steam forum sentiment are reliable predictors of how most people actually feel). It gives a lot of people, myself included, the ick. Last week, the new Call of Duty alsocame under fire(sorry) for using supposedly AI-generated art; people absolutely hate it. Proponents of the use of generative AI in games often say that it empowers smaller developers to do more with less, but Call of Duty is a multibillion-dollar franchise. Activision can more than afford to pay artists to draw something. Given Arc Raiders’s success, you could say the same about its AI voice lines.It is an existential issue for video game workers – artists, writers and voice actors particularly, but also coders – who may be at risk of losing out to this technology. Many believe that gaming’s corporate overlords would be thrilled to replace expensive, inconvenient humans with machines that generate inadequate but functional work. Take EA, which is mandating that its employees use the company’s internal suite of AI tools, even thoughthey are apparently widely hated. And then there’s Krafton, which proudly declared itself an AI-first game developer before offering its Korean employeesvoluntary redundancy.View image in fullscreenUnder fire … Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been called out for using AI-generated art.Photograph: ActivisionIndeed, most of the people rushing to defend the use of generative AI in games are not everyday players or on-the-ground developers, but the corporate class. Epic’s Tim Sweeney – net worth $5bn, give or take – posted on X a series of replies to Eurogamer’s Arc Raiders review, beginning with the familiar, facepalm-inducing entreaty to keep “politics” out of video game reviews (“Political opinions should go into op-eds folks.). Sweeney argued that generative AI could “transform gaming”, evoking a dystopian vision of the future: “Instead of games having a few dozen or hundred lines of prerecorded dialogue, how about infinite, context-sensitive, personality-reflecting dialogue based on and tuned by human voice actors?”Personally, I do not want a machine constantly generating things it thinks I want to hear. I would rather have characters speak lines written by humans with something to say, performed by other humans who understand that meaning. As the award-winning video game actor Jane Perry put it in an interview withGamesIndustry.biz: “Will a bot scuttle up to the stage at the Games awards or the Baftas to accept an award for best performance? I think most audiences prefer a real human performance; however, the creative drive of the tech elite is incredibly strong, especially when the name of the game is to replace humans with machines.”In my many years covering this beat, I have noticed that what happens in the video game world often happens in the wider world. A few years ago, there was a rush of investment in Web3/blockchain-driven games that bought into the idea of NFTs – digital “artworks” that people could own and trade, all of which were just unbelievably ugly, all rad skulls and gurning computer-generated apes smoking cigars; thankfully,that bubble burstspectacularly. When the big tech world suddenly latched on to theidea of the “metaverse”a few years ago, gaming companies had already been building much better versions of that idea for decades. And Gamergate provided a blueprint for the weaponisation of disaffected young men that directly influenced the Trump campaign playbook and set the template for the now omnipresent culture wars. This is why anyone interested in the impact of AI on work and culture should be looking at the ripples that that technology is making among developers and players. It can be an interesting predictor.What we’re seeing play out looks like a familiar struggle between the people who actually make things, and those who profit off that labour. We’re also seeing players question whether they should pay the same money for games that include lower-quality, machine-generated art and voices. And we are seeing new lines being drawn around which uses of AI are culturally and ethically acceptable, and which are not.What to playView image in fullscreenA plot less travelled … Goodnight Universe.Photograph: Nice Dream/Skybound GamesFrom the people behind the devastating Before Your Eyes comesGoodnight Universe, a game in which you playa super-intelligent six-month-old baby with psychic powers. It’s narrated by the baby’s inner monologue: wee Isaac suspects that he’s a lot smarter than a baby should be, and finds it exceptionally frustrating that he seems unable to communicate his thoughts and feelings to his family. But soon he develops telekinetic abilities and the power to read minds, attracting unwanted attention. If you have a webcam, you can play it with your eyes, by looking around and blinking. This game packs an emotional punch and the plot also goes places I wasn’texpecting. It also made me nostalgic for the relative past, when my children were still babies.Available on:PC,NintendoSwitch 2, PS5, XboxEstimated playtime:three to four hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenFirst look … Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link and Bo Bragason as Zelda in The Legend of Zelda film, coming in 2027.Photograph: Nintendo/SonyNintendo has released the first image from the forthcomingLegend of Zelda movie, starring Bo Bragason and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, pictured here lounging in a meadow.

This limestone valley on the border between Derbyshire and Staffordshire is a popular spot for day trips and hiking. Thankfully, it’s quiet on this brisk November morning, and I’m able to soak in the scene: the River Dove flowing fast, the autumn trees turning russet and gold, the green fold of hills rising around me.On days like this, it’s clear why Dovedale has inspired creatives. One of those was the 18th-century artist Joseph Wright of Derby, whose work is being celebratedin a new exhibitionat the National Gallery.Landscapes such as Dovedale were painted by Wright at a time when “people started travelling to places that in those days were hard to get to – places like the Peak District”, says Tony Butler, executive director of Derby Museums Trust. We meet atDerby Museum and Art Gallery, which houses the world’s largest collection of Wright’s paintings. Places such as Dovedale were seen as wild, Butler explains, but there was an increasing appreciation of landscapes like this, with a gradual opening up of the country, and the idea of nature evoking the sublime.View image in fullscreenWright’s Dovedale By Moonlight.Photograph: AlamyThe gallery showcases Wright’s prolific and varied work. In the place of paintings that have gone to the National Gallery exhibition are works from other artists, including paintings inspired by Wright’s use of light and dark by Nottingham-basedJoseph Norris.Much of Wright’s work reflects the industry and invention of the Enlightenment, a time of faith in reason and scientific discovery. As a hub of industrial growth, Derby was one of the Midlands towns at the centre of the movement, and Wright spent time with members of the Lunar Society, the Midlands-based group of Enlightenment thinkers. “The Enlightenment was a way of life in Derby, and he was a documenter of that,” says Butler. “He’s really reflecting the spirit of the age.”Much of Wright’s work reflects the industry and invention of the Enlightenment, a time of faith in reason and scientific discoveryOne of Wright’s most famous works, A Philosopher Giving That Lecture on the Orrery (in Which a Lamp Is Put in Place of the Sun), shows a philosopher lecturing on the solar system at a time when talks like this were held in Derby’s town hall. He painted portraits of figures reflecting the area’s role in industry, including Sir Richard Arkwright, the industrialist who built his cotton mill in nearby Cromford and was one of Wright’s patrons.I have lunch atThe Engine Room, a recently opened restaurant that draws on another element of Derby’s industrial heritage, as a centre for railway manufacturing, with railway art decorating the walls. Afterwards, I wander with Alex Rock from Derby Museums along the River Derwent as Canada geese bob by and the breeze throws leaves on the water. It’s a short walk to theMuseum of Making, which stands on the site ofDerby Silk Mill, often regarded as the world’s first modern factory, near where Wright grew up.View image in fullscreenThe Museum of Making.Photograph: Kate LoweThe museum explores 300 years of Derby’s history of making, from the Enlightenment era that inspired Wright through to the city’s contemporary creativity. A Toyota car hangs high in the atrium as a sign of Derbyshire’s modern manufacturing. “In Stoke, we lift up crockery to see where it’s made,” I say, a nod to my own home town’s industry. “I do the same,” Rock says, and we lift our coffee mugs to see them stamped as Denby, the Derbyshire-based pottery company. Afterwards, I join the crowd gathered to watch the trains running on the museum’s impressive model railway.I look around the Assemblage room, curated so items are displayed by their principal material, such as wood or metal. There are racks of everything from Derby-made train parts to ceramics showcasing the museum’s collection. The museum is also home to a workshop where visitors can book sessions to learn skills such as pot-throwing and woodwork.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I amble down Sadler Gate, a pedestrianised street lined with independent shops, where I settle for a while with a pint of cider atthe Old Bell Hotel, a 17th-century former coaching inn that’s been sensitively restored.Following the Derwent and the A6 north leads to the village of Cromford, home toCromford Mills, the world’s first successful water-powered cotton spinning mill. I join an hour-long guided tour and learn how it was built in 1771 by Arkwright, and is seen as another important site of the Industrial Revolution. The tour takes us into vast old factory buildings, and we see examples of the machinery that would have been used.

Ravinder Bhogal’s recipes for warming winter piesFish pie gets a tropical reboot, or try a cold-busting filo chicken pie or a wholesome supergreens and cheese pieRavinder BhogalWed 19 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareWhen the temperature takes a nosedive, few things compete with a just-baked pie. Don’t be daunted by social media images of perfect, artistic ones; a pie will taste just as good whether it’s rustically homespun or exactingly decorated and carved. Ultimately, what is more important is the integrity of the ingredients (both the casing and the filling). As pastry or potatoes are such a large part of the equation, invest in the best, and make sure puff pastry is all butter and filo is generously lubricated with melted butter. And, if you’re serving your pie with mash, you want it lump-free, properly seasoned and enriched with butter and cream.‘Flu-fighting’ filo chicken pie (pictured top)This is packed to the brim with ingredients to make you well: anti-inflammatory ginger, turmeric and nuts, warming spices and cranberries, which are a source of antioxidants and vitamin C.Prep15 minCook2 hr, plus coolingServes62tbsp ghee2 onions, peeled and finely sliced4 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 thumb-sized pieceginger, peeled and finely grated1 thumb-sized piecefresh turmeric, peeled and finely grated or 1 tsp ground turmeric1tsp ground coriander1tsp allspice1tsp cinnamonNutmeg8 bone-in chicken thighs, skinned400ml chicken stock, or chicken bone brothSea salt and black pepper100g walnuts or almonds, roughly chopped50g dried cranberriesZest and juice of1 lemon3 eggs, beaten1 small bunchcoriander, finely chopped1 small bunch tarragon, finely chopped75g butter½tsp ground turmeric6 filo pastry sheetsMelt the ghee in a casserole dish or large frying pan over a low heat, then fry the onions slowly for 10-15 minutes, until caramelised. Add the garlic, ginger and fresh turmeric, fry for two minutes, until fragrant, then add the ground spices and a good grating of nutmeg – if you are using ground turmeric, add it now.Add the chicken, stir to coat in the onions and spices for two minutes, then pour in the stock and season. Bring to a simmer, then cook, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Lift the chicken out of the pan and leave to cool.Bring the stock back to a boil, then reduce for eight minutes, until slightly thickened; leave to cool for 15 minutes. Stir in the nuts, cranberries, lemon juice and zest, followed by the eggs, to make a rich sauce.When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pull out and discard the bones from the thighs, shred the meat and stir it through the sauce. Stir in the coriander and tarragon and leave to cool completely (I often make the filling the day before).Once the filling is completely cool, melt the butter and turmeric in a pan and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Brush a 23cm springform cake tin with the melted butter, then brush one sheet of filo with melted butter, lay it butter side up over the tin and push it into the tin to line it, leaving an overhang. Repeat with four more filo sheets, buttering and layering them at different angles so the whole cake tin is well lined.Spoon the filling into the pastry lined tin, lay over the final sheet of buttered filo to cover the surface, then fold over the overhanging filo to enclose the filling. Brush with the remaining butter, then bake for 30 minutes, until golden and crisp. Remove and leave to stand and rest for 15 minutes, then remove the pie from its tin and serve.Coconut and curry leaf fish piesView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s coconut and curry leaf fish pie.A fish pie with a south Indian lilt that will transport you to sunnier climes even when skies are grey.Prep20 minCook1 hr 30 minServes6200g spinach2tbsp coconut oil1tsp brown mustard seeds1 star anise½tsp asafoetida(hing)15 fresh curry leaves½tsp cumin¼tsp ground cloves1 red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced into crescentsSea salt, to taste2cm pieceginger, peeled and cut into julienne strips1 fresh long red chillies, sliced seeds and all1tsp turmeric400ml coconut cream2tbsp tamarind paste1tbsp light brown sugarJuice of1 lemon1 handfulcoriander, finely chopped450g cod, haddock or other white fish fillets, skinned and pin-boned200g peeled raw prawns2 hard-boiled eggs, shelled and quarteredFor the topping40ml whole milk40ml double cream1garlic clove, peeled and bruised½tsp black peppercorns1 small onion, peeled and studded with 4 cloves1 bay leaf1tsp ground turmeric750gfloury potatoes, peeled and diced75g butter2 egg yolksFirst make the topping.

Meanwhile, steam the spinach for the filling in a colander above the pan of potatoes until wilted, leave to cool slightly, then squeeze out any excess moisture and chop roughly.Drain and mash the potatoes until smooth, then beat in the butter and egg yolks. Strain the infused milk and cream, discarding the solids, then slowly pour the milk mix into the mash and stir to combine thoroughly.For the filling, heat the coconut oil in a frying pan on a high heat. Scatter in the mustard seeds and star anise and, as soon as the mustard seeds pop, add the asafoetida and curry leaves, followed by the cumin seeds and cloves. Turn down the heat, add the onions and some sea salt, and saute until pale and translucent.Add the ginger, chillies and turmeric and fry briefly until fragrant. Add the coconut cream, tamarind and sugar, simmer for eight minutes, then take off the heat and finish with the lemon juice and coriander.Put the spinach, fish, prawns and boiled egg quarters in a pie dish and pour the coconut sauce all over them.

Writing a plant-based cookbook taught me new ways to save waste, and confirmed my belief that zero-waste cooking is whole food cooking. Aquafaba (the liquid from a tin of chickpeas or other beans), for example, is a powerful emulsifier that can replace eggs, especially when whisked with ground flaxseeds or chia. It’s a brilliant way of turning what we’d usually pour down the sink into cakes with remarkable lift and texture.Pear, hazelnut and chocolate torteWhen I was writing the dessert chapter of my cookbook, I wanted every recipe to offer new ways of making cakes more nourishing. Here, I use aquafaba with omega-rich flaxseed, and blitz hazelnuts into flour instead of using ground almonds (though I would encourage you to use ground almonds if they are what you have).Seasonality is core to how I cook, not least because I find it such a joyous and economical approach to home cooking that connects us to the rhythm of the seasons. With pears fresh, plentiful and easy to source locally right now, they’re perfect inspiration for this vegan chocolate torte that’s gooey, flavourful and not too sweet. Cook it a little under, so it has a brownie-like centre and, for best results, serve warm with your favourite yoghurt. You will need a 23cm stoneware flan dish or similar.ServesAbout 10250g shelled hazelnuts100g light-brown sugar, plus extra for dusting and finishing75g wholemeal flour(I used emmer wheat, but regular wholemeal or plain white will work fine, too)2 tbsp cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting2 tsp baking powder100ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for greasing100ml aquafaba50g ground flaxseeds, or chia seeds, or 2 tsp psyllium husk4 pears, cored and cut into thin slicesYoghurt(coconut, soya or dairy), to serve (optional)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and put a large baking tray inside to heat up. Tip the hazelnuts on to the hot tray, roast for eight minutes, then remove and leave to cool. Pulse-blend the cooled nuts to a powder, stopping the motor before the ground nuts turn oily, then tip into a large bowl and add the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, olive oil, aquafaba and flaxseeds, and beat to combine thoroughly.Grease a 23cm flan dish with a little olive oil, then spoon in a teaspoon each of flour and cocoa. Turn the dish a few times, so the insides are evenly coated, then knock out any excess flour and sugar. Fill the dish with the hazelnut mixture, then lay the pear slices on top. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the pudding has risen and is firm in the centre.Sprinkle the top of the finished tart with a little brown sugar, or make your own brown sugar icing sugar by blending it to a fine powder. Enjoy warm with your choice of yoghurt.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteCakeBakingFruitNuts and seedsChocolatefeaturesShareReuse this content"
