This rampant early exposure should have turned me into a hay fever immunity machine, but here I am, all itchy eyes and streaming nose as summer hoves into view. Not that I can see it very well.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“You cannot cure hay fever,” is the rather dispiriting verdict of theNHS website, which recommends staying inside with your doors and windows shut. I sought a second opinion from Dr Unnati Desai, national lead for GP Services atNuffield Health. “Trying to avoid any type of pollen from about February to September in the UK is near impossible,” she says. “Instead, find the right way to control your symptoms.”Or stop the pollen getting up my schnozz in the first place, says Dr Megha Pancholi, clinical lead atBoots Online Doctor. “Simple things can reduce your exposure, like wearing wraparound sunglasses and applying petroleum jelly around your nose.” Well, that’s a look.The more experts I spoke to, the more hay fever cures were touted. To find out which ones actually worked, I set about squirting them up my nose, swallowing them, wearing them and, in a few welcome cases, sleeping with them. Here, I reveal the remedies that won by a dribble-free nose.Why you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing consumer products, fromheated clothes airersto computer software, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. As a long-term freelancer, I also have a solid background in running away from work to hang out with trees, which feed my soul and torture my sinuses with pollen.People’s hay fever triggers and symptoms vary widely, so my own experience wasn’t enough for this test. I shared products with my similarly sneeze-ravaged husband, Alan, and also consulted doctors, pharmacists and allergy experts to find out what remedies we should be using and why they might work.How I testedView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianTesting hay fever cures is by necessity a long-winded process, and not just because I kept stopping to blow my nose, or whichever part of my face the snot was coming from. Many remedies can be safely “layered”, or combined with each other, but I wanted to find out how well each one worked on its own. So I used them separately for a few days each, beginning in March, when 2025’s balmy spring began.I wasn’t exactly comparing like with like. Unlike, say, thebest mattresses, which all have similar benefits in similar ways, hay fever cures take a wild array of different approaches. Some soothe symptoms while others block allergens; some are drug-based and others adamantly not; some provide immediate relief while others take weeks to make a lasting difference. Then there was a rollercoaster of other variables that changed by the day, such as pollen count, time spent outdoors and degree of cat cuddling.View image in fullscreenAlan applies HayMax balm in an attempt to control his hay fever.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThis meant I couldn’t get too hung up on details such as the precise number of minutes each product took to stop me sneezing, or the exact daily weight of soggy tissues. But I wanted meaningful test results, so I got Alan to try all the remedies as well, if only to stop him and his nose from costing us an extra loo roll a day. We then compared notes on each product’s efficacy, convenience and value for money.How to stop hay feverView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAir purifier with Hepa filterI don’t sleep in the woods, but my hay fever symptoms are worse at night. I regularly wake up at 3am with a scratchy throat, and Alan and I both greet the morning alarm with sneezing fits. What’s going on?Indoor air is relatively static, so dust and pollen build up unless you clear them. “Humidifiers can help by moistening the air, meaning dust and pollen find it harder to float around,” says Hannah Shore, head of sleep science atMattress Online. “Air purifiers can take a lot of the floating particles out of the air. Look for one with a ‘quiet’ setting so you can use it overnight.”I tried a couple of air purifier models: a large wifi-connected MeacoClean, whose Hepa (high efficiency particulate air) filter powerfully rid our bedroom of allergens within a few hours, and a compact Vitesy Eteria. The MeacoClean’s night mode was unobtrusive while I fell asleep, and neither of us woke up sneezing. The desktop Vitesy helped keep my nose relatively clear while I worked.Relief:our symptoms cleared within hours, albeit indoors only.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianMeacoClean CA-Hepa wifi air purifier£199.99 at Meaco£199.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianVitesy Eteria compact air purifier£129 at AmazonVaseline – or a less icky barrier balm“A thin layer of petroleum jelly inside the nostrils helps trap pollen before it enters the nose,” says GP and authorDr Roger Henderson. Turns out the Vaseline trick actually works, genuinely calming my nose down. Alan found it effective but “disgusting”, noting that it smells of a petrol forecourt, which may be to some people’s taste but not ours. It’s also slimy and makes your nostrils glisten snottily in the light, which I’m guessing isn’t high on our fashion editor’slooks of the season.I found a more palatable alternative in organic barrier balms. The beeswax and seed oil formulation of HayMax gives it a firmer texture than Vaseline, and its frankincense, aloe and lavender varieties all smell delicious. Alan was an instant fan when it stopped his nose from running. I found it more effective for symptom prevention rather than cure – and the lavender version helped me sleep.Relief:won’t stop a full-on sneezing fit, but helped me breathe and soothed symptoms for a couple of hours.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianHayMax balm£8.49 for 5ml at Boots£8.49 for 5ml at Holland and BarrettView image in fullscreenVaseline original petroleum jelly£1.80 for 50ml at Boots£1.80 for 50ml at SuperdrugSaline nasal spray“I regularly deal with patients suffering from summer allergies, primarily allergic rhinitis,” says ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgeonDr Anil Joshi. “Saline (salt water) sprays moisturise the nasal mucosa, aid in the clearance of allergens and reduce inflammation. This can provide significant relief for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal allergies, especially when coupled with other therapies.”My own GP recommended saline spray years ago, and although I hated it at first (feeling much as I imagine it would to be water-boarded in the sea), it soon became a powerful ally in my war on a runny nose and sore throat. I like using straight-up saline, but Alan hated the “salty aftertaste” and preferred xylitol-sweetened Xlear.Relief:within half an hour, although you’ll need to blow your nose a lot.View image in fullscreenXlear nasal spray£10.23 for 45ml at iHerb£9.99 for 45ml at AmazonView image in fullscreenBoots saline nasal spray£6.99 for 100ml at BootsSteroid nasal spray“Beconase and Flixonase contain small amounts of steroid such as beclometasone,” says Dr Naveed Asif, GP at the London General Practice. “These help to reduce the body’s allergic response to triggers such as pollen.” Steroid sprays aren’t drug-free like saline spray, but they’re safe for medium-term use (up to about three months, says the NHS) and they’re brilliant value.Their main downside is that it takes a couple of weeks to feel the effects. I continued with the other remedies while Alan started on the Beconase. “It took ages to work,” he said after two sprays a day for three weeks. “But it’s definitely helped, because I’ve stopped going through an entire kitchen roll to blow my nose.” For that, I am very grateful.Relief:takes two weeks to have an effect, then provides long-term relief from a range of symptoms.View image in fullscreenBeconase hay fever spray£10.99 for 180 sprays at Superdrug£11 for 180 sprays at BootsNon-drowsy antihistaminesAntihistamines were recommended by most of the experts I spoke to, including those who were advocates of more natural approaches. “Your symptoms are driven by excess histamine production,” says medical herbalist Siobhán Carroll. “Antihistamines quell inappropriate histamine production and reduce the snowball effect of increased inflammation in the body.”The key is finding the antihistamine that works for you. “They all work in a similar way, but people may respond differently to each one,” says Pancholi of Boots Online Doctor. “Some antihistamines may be more effective for certain individuals than others, providing longer relief or causing less drowsiness.”I took cetirizine (Piriteze) and loratadine (Clarityn) for a week each, and they both reduced my symptoms, but not quickly or consistently. Cetirizine also triggered an attack of zits on my chin. Not just once, but within a few days of every single attempt to take it.I found my ideal match in the newer “second-generation” non-drowsy antihistamine fexofenadine (Allevia), which has proved especially good at soothing my itchy eyes. I find my symptoms return by evening, though, rather than the advertised 24 hours.Relief:within 30 minutes and lasting several hours, but not the whole day.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianAllevia tablets£11.49 for 30 x 120mg tablets at Superdrug£12.49 for 30 x 120mg tablets at BootsHepa vacuum cleanerVacuuming is a hay fever sufferer’s nightmare in the short term because it disturbs dormant dust, but it’s also essential for ridding your space of allergens. “Vacuums with Hepa filters are certified to trap more than 99.97% of airborne particles, including pollen, dust mites and pet dander,” says Dr Daisy Mae, allergy expert for Bed Factory Direct. “In your bedroom, this can hugely impact sleep.” And don’t forget to vacuum your mattress, she adds.I gave Alan the job of blitzing the bedroom with an Ultenic Hepa vacuum, whose alarming headlight revealed revolting levels of dust under the bed. Sneezing his way through the task, an hour later the room felt more comfortable and we slept soundly, with no runny noses to greet us in the morning.Relief:aggravates symptoms at first, but relief is powerful and lasting if you keep up the vacuuming.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianUltenic U16 flex cordless vacuum with Hepa filter£135.97 at AmazonEye dropsI love using eye drops that have been stored in the fridge, and pharmacist Rita Ghelani approves. “Using eye drops daily keeps your eyes hydrated and feeling less sore,” she says. “You can use special allergy eye drops, or those that lubricate and soothe the eyes.”My favourite budget choice is Boots hay fever relief eye drops, whose 2% sodium cromoglicate content relieves that niggling summer itch in my lower eyelids. If you wear contact lenses, then your best bet is Pollinosan hay fever eye drops from A Vogel, whose natural hyaluronic acid content soothed my eyes for several days during the great dandelion seed blizzard of April 2025.Relief:immediate but not long-lasting.View image in fullscreenBoots hay fever relief 2% w/veye drops£4.85 for 10ml at BootsOptrex hay fever relief 2% w/v eye drops£6.25 for 10ml at Superdrug£6.49 for 10ml at BootsView image in fullscreenAVogel Pollinosan hay fever eye drops£10.49 for 10ml at Holland & Barrett£13.99 for 10ml at Victoria HealthWraparound sunglasses and wide-brimmed hatPharmacist Kiran Jones ofOxford Online Pharmacyrecommends wearing sunglasses as part of a layered strategy. “Start a nasal steroid two weeks before the hay fever season, use a barrier balm around the nostrils, wear wraparound sunglasses and check the Met Office three-hour pollen forecast.”My cheap, decidedly un-stylish pair of wraparounds proved surprisingly effective at blocking pollen and other airborne intruders (including midges) – and also stopped me from rubbing my eyes.When I upped the pollen-blocking ante by adding a wide-brimmed hat, the relief was even more noticeable – at least for my eyes. Sadly, my respiratory symptoms marched on. I tested this outfit in a particularly floral bit of park and nearly blew the glasses clean off with my pollen-triggered coughing fit.Relief:stopped my eyes feeling puffy and itchy within a few minutes when outdoors, but did nothing to relieve coughing and sneezing.View image in fullscreenBollé wraparound sunglassesskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

We slept well, and I especially enjoyed the cooling, cushioned feel of the mattress protector. The pillow protector was scratchy against my face, though, so I added an old pillowcase – which possibly defeated the whole point.Relief:helped us sleep without sneezing, but more of a long-term strategy than instant relief.View image in fullscreenSilentnight anti-allergy pillow protector£12 a pair at Argos£12 a pair at AmazonView image in fullscreenSilentnight anti-allergy duvetFrom £19 for a double at Silentnight£24 for a double at ArgosView image in fullscreenSilentnight anti-allergy mattress protector£17 for a double at Boots£14.30 for a double at AmazonHepa filter maskIf high pollen days leave you so ravaged by symptoms that you fear going outside, then a mask with a built-in Hepa filter may be your only option. For those of us who just want to breathe and see more easily in summer, however, these fabric gas masks are a bit too much.When I wore a Respro Allergy Mask for walks in my local parks and nature reserves, I looked like I was heading for the trenches. My sneezing did stop after a few minutes, but I also felt hot and daft, and my eyes stayed itchy. The main relief it gave was the pleasure of taking it off once I was back indoors.Relief:didn’t relieve my itchy eyes, but powerfully prevents respiratory symptoms while wearing.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianRespro allergy mask N95£39.95 at Allergy Best BuysFacial cleanserCleaning the pollen off your face before bed was a strategy mentioned by a few of the experts I spoke to. “Make sure you get rid of any pollen particles on your skin, particularly your hands, face and any long hair,” says sleep expert Shore. Even a quick wipe with cleanser helps, saysCultskinfounder Dr Tijion Esho: “Cleansing around the eye area can help ease itching and prevent allergens from being transferred into your eyes.”And don’t forget to moisturise. “Moisturiser provides a strong skin barrier,” says dermatologistDr Benjamin Chun-Man Lee. And that doesn’t apply only to adults: “Studies have shown the value of moisturising in infancy to halt the progression of hay fever and allergic rhinitis.”An extra cleansing session at night didn’t make much difference for me, because I always have a bath and wash my face before bed anyway. But every little counts, and it’s worth starting now if you’re not in the habit of cleaning muck – including allergens – off your face before bed.Relief:extra cleansing at night helps fend off symptoms by morning.View image in fullscreenByoma Milky moisture cleanser£13.99 for 175ml at Cult Beauty£14 for 175ml at Space NKView image in fullscreenNo7 cleansing balm£10.75 for 125ml at BootsHydration and electrolytes“When your body is dehydrated, it can produce more histamine,” says sports nutritionist Jess Hillard. Cutting down on booze can help, says pharmacist Ghelani. “Some alcoholic drinks contain histamine, the chemical that sets off an allergic reaction in the body. Alcohol also dehydrates you, and that can make your symptoms worse.”Electrolyte powder in water can help your body retain water even when you’re sweating a lot, so I tried that. I wouldn’t say the cocktail washed away my symptoms, but a few days of careful dosing made me feel more alert when the weather was hot and the pollen was high.Relief:not immediate in my experience, but good hydration is a long-term anti-allergy strategy.View image in fullscreenWarrior Creatine plus electrolytes£17.99 for 80 servings at WarriorDecongestant oil“A natural decongestant can make it easier to breathe,” says Henderson. “Aloe-vera-infused decongestants also help soothe irritation.”The strong snot-banishing fumes of Vicks VapoRub and Olbas Oil proved a hit with my husband, but I opted for Olbas patches. I evicted Alan to the spare room, slapped a patch on the empty pillow and slept like a dream – although my hay feverish eyes turned a bit pink from the mild vapour.Relief:quick and moderately effective relief for blocked noses, but may irritate eyes.View image in fullscreenOlbasBreatheEasy patches£6.49 for six at the Independent Pharmacy£5.95 for six at AmazonView image in fullscreenVicks VapoRub£6.75 for 100g at Boots£6 for 100g at AmazonAnd what not to try …View image in fullscreenBeware of influencer claims about local honey.Photograph: Arda Sari/Getty ImagesLocal honeyUnprocessed local honey is the hay fever cure du jour forInstagraminfluencers. Duly influenced, Alan and I spent weeks feasting on the handiwork of Hampshire bees in early spring. But my eyes still itched and Alan’s nose still required lockdown-stockpile levels of loo roll, so I can’t say it worked.“Some people believe that eating local honey helps build up your body’s resistance against local pollen,” says Crystal Wyllie, GP atAsda Online Doctor. “But there isn’t enough scientific evidence to support this. If eating local honey is your only hay fever remedy, you could be wasting money and leaving yourself at risk on high pollen days.”Sedating antihistaminesA cheap, easily available pill that stops you sneezing and sends you to sleep? Sign me up! Actually, don’t, because first-generation antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine (Piriton) left memoretired than before. They made me drowsy, but this didn’t translate into satisfying sleep – and I woke up during the night with a hay fever-triggered sore throat.It’s not just me. “One study found that sedating antihistamines cause non-REM sleep, which doesn’t involve dreaming but a lot of snoring,” says Chun-Man Lee. “Participants in the study woke up feeling unrefreshed because of the lack of true rest.”Sedating antihistamines do work for many users, as sleep aids as well as hay fever treatments. But they didn’t do the trick for me.Blocked nose sprayI was once a xylometazoline addict. The active ingredient in Sudafed Blocked Nose Spray and others, xylometazoline, opens a blocked nose by shrinking your blood vessels, and the relief feels magical if you’re bunged up by hay fever or a cold. But it soon creates a physical dependency – so it actually made my symptoms worse.“Many brands of nasal decongestant sprays contain xylometazoline (or oxymetazoline), which works by causing the blood vessels in the lining of the nose and sinuses to contract and narrow,” says Ghelani. “Initially, the ingredient appears to help reduce swelling and the general feeling of congestion. However, products containing it should not be used continuously for more than seven days, as they can cause rebound congestion.”I ignored this advice in my early days of using a blocked nose spray to soothe hay fever symptoms. After weeks of daily use, I eventually struggled to breathe without it, especially at night. I weaned myself off it by only using it in one nostril, then every other night, and eventually – at last – not at all.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhat is hay fever, and what are the symptoms?Hay fever, also known as seasonal allergic rhinitis, is a set of symptoms triggered by your body’s response – or overreaction – to pollen.If you’re one of the unlucky 49% whose immune system sees pollen as a threat, your body “protects” you from it by producing histamine and other chemicals that make your nose run, your eyes itch, and your head ache. I make light of how my body’s own snotty overreaction affects my loo-roll bill, but for many people, the symptoms have a ruinous impact on their ability to work, sleep and simply enjoy summer.“There isn’t a ‘one size fits all’ in terms of symptoms,” says Desai of Nuffield Health. “It comes down to the type of pollen you’re allergic to and how your body responds to the allergies.” Some of the less common symptoms she mentions are allergic conjunctivitis, tightness in the chest and wheezing when breathing out. “In some cases, medication may be needed to treat all three areas. If you suffer from severe hay fever, a GP can provide inhalers or oral steroids to help manage your overactive immune system.”When does the hay fever season typically start and stop?Hay fever season lasts much longer than summer. Tree pollen arrives first, as early as February, when trees start to pollinate. This lasts until about mid-May, at which point grass is the chief offender, especially when the massive council lawnmowers are out. Flower pollen (known by some killjoys as “weed pollen”) comes next, from about June to September.More bad news: hay fever season is getting longer, and it’s down to the climate crisis. TheMet Officecites research that “highlighted how increasingly unusual weather – as a result of climate change – coincided with increasingly erratic pollen seasons”. Other studies forecast that the climate emergency willincrease the severity of hay fever season by up to 60%. Perhaps I then won’t feel so silly going out in a Hepa mask and wraparounds.Jane Hoskyn is ajournalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and“testing’ coffee machines while deadlines loom.

Even now, viewed through the lens of history, it feels as though you broke through everything that could be broken, before crossing over into pop culture. Has society become any freer? Has art become any less commodified?Dmitry_SI think it has become more commodified. Nothing comes to my attention that would make me think that art has become anything other than a business. That’s down to people wanting a career. I can understand that in today’s economic climate, as opposed to in the 70s, where there was nothing – you could squat or get very low rent, so you just did what you wanted. You don’t have those opportunities now. But I think about art being about self-expression before thinking:can I sell it? That’s whywhat Kneecap are doing is uncomfortablefor people. There’s such power behind them because the motivation is true and honest. That’s the difference. If your art or music is true and honest, it does hold a power and strength that some people might find uncomfortable, and therefore it gets hit.I sometimes get the impression that there were times when you just wanted to do normal stuff and not be transgressive 24/7. Is this the case?ArthurCatRIPI think it would be exhausting to be transgressive 24/7. How do you go from A to B?! We used to go back to Beck Road [squat in Hackney, London] and have hot chocolate. People have lives to live. I don’t remember thinking: I’m going to push some boundaries now. That’s not the way I look at it. Everything I do is just about following my own intuition and my own interests.You were at the cutting edge of an artistry that was confrontational and transgressive, but guided by a considered and intelligent concept.Kanye Westis publishing work steeped in fascist iconographywithout any philosophy other than “pay attention to me”. Do you think that sort of work a continuation of your legacy or a corruption?EdsaykayIt’s definitely not a continuation. And I don’t think it’s a corruption either, because I don’t think it relates to what we did. In my opinion, it’s dangerous and cruel, and I don’t consider anything we did as dangerous and cruel. It was transgressive, and that made people open things up to discussion. Conversely, Kanye West shuts discussion down. I can’t even get my head around that kind of mentality.Heartbeat [the 1981 debut album by Chris & Cosey, AKA Tutti and Chris Carter] was seismic. Every track was prescient andinfluential on so much emerging music for the next 20 years. How do you look at that album now?1leon1Heartbeat was the beginning of our musical career and our relationship. I have a very special affection for Heartbeat, maybe because I was pregnant during the time. It was a crossover album, anyway, because we recorded some of it when we were doing the lastThrobbing Gristlegigs. So in that respect, it’s quite important: bringing a new life, literally for me and Chris, but also a new life into our music having left TG. I went into labour when we were signing off the TG contract with the publishers in Denmark Street: all right, we’ve signed off, now I’m signing on and the baby’s coming. It was a great time and a very confusing time, with relationships and one era ending and another beginning. It was very positive.View image in fullscreenTutti performing as one half of Chris & Cosey at Click festival in Denmark, 2014.Photograph: Gonzales Photo/AlamyWhat do you like about living in Norfolk?Does it inspire your art in any way?RobShepWhere we live is really quiet. When you think about TG and everything else we do, it’s kind of a contradiction. But I need that peace. Living in Norfolk is wonderful because we have huge skies, so sunrise and sunset are really fabulous. Living in a small village really does suit me. We like to go to the beach: Heacham is very Zen. Or we go up to Hunstanton, with the sand dunes. I swim a mile four times a week, but I won’t go in the sea any more. I once had a holiday in Yugoslavia and I got a Portuguese man o’ war sting on my arm.View image in fullscreen‘I’m not going to be sitting on the sidelines’ ... Tutti at Throbbing Gristle’s studios in 1980.Photograph: Courtesy Cosey Fanni TuttiAs someone who used to talk about sexuality so much in your art, what do you think of the fact we lose so much of it as we get older?IdontmindSexuality, sex and lust is on an up-and-down anyway, whether to do with age or not. I think the main consideration as you get older is that you’re physically restricted in certain ways, so you’re not quite as gymnastic in your sexual activities. But if you’re inventive you find ways around it.I used to follow youon Xand enjoyed your updates about your cat, Dexter. I recall that he passed a few years ago, and wonder if you have other cats in your life now?ScraggsDexter [first] turned up in the garden. We tend to adopt cats from cat sanctuaries, and orphans that turn up in our garden for some reason, but we’re glad they do. Spook is our new cat. He was very tiny when he came. I think he was savaged by a dog on his back leg. He was going to be called Hiss and Spit, because that’s all he did when we first went near him, but then he decided he would stay. He’s the most affectionate cat we’ve had. He’s a sweet little thing, the opposite of Dexter, who was named after the series. Dexter was a serial killer with mice. I think he’d been ill-treated, because he didn’t like legs much. He’d been kicked a lot.I get the impression that early COUM was quite whimsical andhippy-ish. Over the years the direction became darker and more transgressive as it went in a more body art direction.By the time of early Throbbing Gristle you have songs likeVery FriendlyandSlug Bait, whichdeal with the darkest of subject matter. It must take its toll inhabiting those worlds;how did you and the others deal with that psychic load?Marko_I think the only toll it took was with me from the ICA [the COUM exhibition there in 1976, Prostitution, caused outrage and was condemned in British parliament]. My parents disowned me. Nobody else had that happen to them. The guys got away with it, but the girl didn’t. I was the one judged, not them. How do you deal with it? You have to get on and think: that side of my life is over with now. Maybe I’ll come back to it later, or maybe not, but I’m not going to be sitting on the sidelines, waiting and begging.View image in fullscreenIndustrial might and magic ... Throbbing Gristle in 1979. From left: Peter Christopherson, Genesis P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti and Chris Carter.Photograph: Throbbing Gristle Industrial RecordsWhich of your works do you feel has been most misunderstood by audiences or critics?mrstoreyI don’t think it’s the work so much as people misunderstanding me and the ideas behind it. We’d have to go back to 1976 and the [adult] magazine work. [Critics] weren’t even interested in finding out what it was about; they were just outraged over whatever. It completely surprised me.What I was going through then is still happening now. That’s the saddest part – things haven’t moved forward so much. But it doesn’t mean that you stop being who you are, making sure your presence is felt and seen and heard. I think that’s important.Re-Sisters by Cosey Fanni Tutti review – take three outsider womenRead moreWhen we did castings for who was going to play me in the first version [of the adaptation] of my memoir Art Sex Music , it blew my mind because I had the first inkling of how much my work had influenced people. Two hundred people came forward to play me. They had to write a thing about why they wanted to play me. I was in tears at some of them. It was really touching.In your book you mention dancing in the strip club toCandi Staton’s Nights on Broadway, then recently you posted thatPatti Smith’s Because the Nightwas a regular in your striptease routine. What other songs do you remember dancing to?SophiepenroseI’ve got all the singles still, about 140 of them. The thing with records for stripping is that the guys had to be able to relate to it. So the records shifted over time – whatever was popular or suggestive: Diana Ross’s Muscles. Hot Legs by Rod Stewart. I did Alternative TV’s Love Lies Limp as an ironic nod to the guys in the audience. Hard Workin’ Man [by Captain Beefheart and Jack Nitzsche] was for the Dagenham Ford workers – it had percussion like hammers. I used to love dancing to that. I used to dance to Abba’s Dancing Queen because Chris bought me that single, and just have a jolly time thinking about him. I used to forget to take my top off at times if I was really enjoying the record.You have been a great influence on techno;did you ever go raving?francoisPNo, and I regretted that so much. I wasn’t in a position to do that. I remember driving home one day past an illegal rave and thinking, God: I wish I could go. What was stopping me? Life and my heart condition.

But I’m glad he did, because it taught me quite a lot. I grew broad beans at Beck Road. Then I didn’t have a garden until Chris and I moved to Tottenham. Then we moved here, into an old school. We had the paved playground smashed up and taken away to form a garden.At this time of year the asparagus is really great. So at the moment, my favourite is asparagus, because we can have some every day and it’s absolutely delicious. The strawberries are going to be nice because all the flowers are out. But also, the flowers have been amazing – the aquilegias and forget-me-nots. I’ve got a pathway of lavender down one side of the driveway, and that’s just coming through. As you come through the gates and go to the front door, you can smell it already, and it’s not even come out in flower.

But don’t expect it to stickZoe WilliamsElon Musk is tapping out, and a court has stepped in on tariffs. But the wheels coming off doesn’t mean the bus is stoppingThu 29 May 2025 10.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 14.41 EDTShareNothing is going according to plan for the Trump administration. Thebig, beautiful bill, originally vaunted to save the US taxpayerat least $2tn, so far, according to projections, delivers savingsin the region of $9.4bn. Elon Musk has exited government, saying he wasn’t in favour of the bill, which could be big, or beautiful, but in this case, not both. Musk’s government contract ran for only 120 days, so it would have been up at the end of this week anyway.Just to try to lasso those words back to an observable reality where they might mean something, the bill isn’t all that big; there are some very vindictive moves around Medicaid entitlement, intended to fund tax cuts elsewhere, that will have seismically bad outcomes for vulnerableindividuals without necessarily burning a hole in anyone else’s pocket. Tips and overtime are exempted from tax, but probably the only thing that’s legitimately big, or if you like, huge, is the increase of the debt ceiling by $4tn. So it gives with one hand, takes away with the other, promise-wise – those tax exemptions were mentioned often on the campaign trail, but a government that causes havoc trying to shrink the state while simultaneously increasing the amount it can borrow isn’t going to please anyone in either party but sycophants.As for “beautiful” – thesupplemental nutrition assistance program(Snap) will see reforms that throw more costs on to each state. Forty-two million low-income Americans are on Snap, and there would be more requirements upon those who are childless. Centring cuts on those who are already hungry has a cruelty that glisters in an age of necropolitics, but it lacks the scale, the granite finality, that “beauty” would connote to these people.“We have to get a lot of votes, we can’t be cutting – we need to get a lot of support,” Trump said, in response to Musk’s criticism, which seems to have enlivened in the president some fresh appreciation of how democracy works, though whether it will last until lunchtime is anyone’s guess. The worry about Musk’s departure is not that Doge will be lost without him, but that his criticism will embolden the hawks in Congress, who didn’t want to vote for the bill in the first place. Then it really will be a puddle of words without meaning.Meanwhile, aUS federal court struck downalmost all Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, in the classic judicial way, by deeming them an overreach of his powers. The ruling is purely on legislative grounds (Trump didn’t wait for the approval of Congress) rather than on any economic grounds (that they would make everything much more expensive for the US public, obliterating the impact of any big or beautiful tax cuts with a single big-ticket purchase, particularly if any part thereof was made in China, which means almost everything). The justice department has filed an appeal.The observer could file all this under “government: harder than it looks”. Moving fast and breaking things doesn’t work. Borrowing and spending while slashing and burning in a formless, ad hoc fashion doesn’t work. Billionaires with fragile egos, trying to cooperate while reserving the right to say whatever they like about each other, well, this has never worked.It would be the gravest imaginable mistake, though, to think that just because the wheels are coming off it this bus is losing its destructive power. One of the global indignities of the US spectacle is having to lose hours analysing the hidden meanings and augurs of the acts of men who don’t, themselves, give one second’s thought to anything. Did Trump mean to humiliate Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and if he didn’t, what came over him, and if he did, what could we predict of the future of Europe?Did Musk mean to Sieg Heil, and if he didn’t, has he lost his mind, and if he did, has he lost his mind? Did they mean to fall out, will they get back together, is this a pantomime, will one chase the other further from reality or back towards it?These questions fundamentally debase us, at the same time as giving the false sense of security that, once these guys step away from public life, singly or together, sense will be restored. The dangerous thing about them is the thing that makes them infinitely replaceable: there will always be another richest guy in the world; there will always be another high net-worth individual who has become separated from social values, not by the wealth itself but by the single-minded solipsism of its accretion. Trump and Musk could get to a place of such enmity that they eschewed the offices of state to spend the days mud-wrestling, and there would be no comfort to take from it, just a new double-act, with new peccadilloes that would be strikingly like the last.The federal court’s decision is another matter, and can be mutedly celebrated until it fails to act on some other gross constitutional transgression.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskTrump tariffsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

For starters, in Reform the Tories face a challenge from the right; one that, unlike Nigel Farage’s previous parties, is – at least for now – well organised, heavily funded and able to win elections.Even more importantly, the sense of a party spiralling around the political plughole is shared by increasing numbers of people from a constituency Badenoch should care about – her own party.“A lot of people are spitting feathers about how the party is being run,” said one senior local Conservative activist in a very traditionally Tory area where the party fared terribly in the local elections.“We’ve been effectively wiped out over the last two years – we’ve lost control of every part of local government and have lost almost all our MPs,” they said. “What is so scary is that people don’t really see a route out of this. It’s not even about Kemi or [Robert] Jenrick or whatever. The brand is broken on the doorstep.“If we can’t win places that are so traditionally Conservative, because there’s another rightwing party that doesn’t have our baggage, then we’re in real trouble.”Such sentiment is understandable even from the raw numbers. After a general election in which its 2019 contingent of 317 seats was slashed to 121, in this month’s local elections the party lost nearly two-thirds of its 1,000 or so council seats, shedding control of 16 councils.And the losses have continued.Analysis by the BBCthis week showed that since the local elections the Conservatives had lost another 47 councillors, some of them to Reform, with others quitting to become independents.As party activists of all persuasions know very well, such attrition is only sustainable for so long. As they also understand, political hopefuls generally enjoy winning elections and are drawn towards parties that look like they can do this.“We are very quickly reaching that point where it all pivots towards Reform,” the senior Tory activist said. “I know a lot of people, really senior people, some on the parliamentary candidates list, who are considering defecting to Reform. It is not good.”Badenoch has begun restructuring her increasingly cash-strapped party, with a series of local officials asked to reapply for their jobs – in some cases just before the local elections.“Fantastic people who have been in the party for 20 or 30 years, and who have been brilliant and loyal, were basically sacked,” the senior activist said. “And what amazed us all is that they were doing this during the final two or three months of the local election campaign, when stability is really important.”How can the Conservatives fight back? The response to Starmer’s comments from Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, was to present the Tories as the only remaining beacon of fiscal credibility, contrasting this with what he called “Jeremy Corbyn’s uniparty” in Labour and Reform.Aside from the slight mental stretch required to see either Starmer or Farage as Corbynistas, the challenge for the Conservatives is that many traditional Tories who prize sober fiscal policies were scarred by the brief Liz Truss experiment, and often dislike Badenoch’s shift towards the culture war, Reform-mimicking harder right.Increasingly, the grassroots disquiet is directed at the top. Badenoch is safe for now, mainly because party rules forbid a challenge in the first year and she was only elected last November. But what then?The general acceptance had been that nothing would happen before another set of local elections next year. For at least some Tories, matters are now accelerating. It is not only Starmer who can see the abyss ahead.Explore more on these topicsConservativesKemi BadenochanalysisShareReuse this content"

This hasn’t been the best few weeks for the prime minister. Headlines dominated by thewinter fuel allowanceand theChagos islands deal. Little credit for his trade deals withIndia, the US and the EU. An economy that still feels as if it’s on life support. All reflected in the latest YouGovvoting intention polls, which put Reform on 29%, eight points ahead of Labour. Hold an election now and Nigel Farage could be heading for No 10.Or not. Because on Tuesday,Keir Starmerwas handed a lifeline. By Farage himself. Quite what Nige thought he was doing is another matter. Maybe he just wanted everyone to know he was still alive. Had bothered – briefly – to return to the UK from his holiday, reportedly in France, not realising he could have spent an extra week on the sunbed as parliament is now in recess.But even if no one had been missing Nige, Nige had been missing himself. He only truly feels alive when there is a camera to record his presence. If he speaks when there is no microphone to record his words, has he actually said anything? It’s a major philosophical and existential dilemma for any narcissist. So Nige did what he always does on such occasions. He announced he would be giving a press conference.That was the start of it all unravelling. Normally, Farage just likes to talk about himself, immigration and all things woke. These are his safe spaces. The ones where he indulges himself and is, in turn, indulged by his audiences. Only this time, Nige decided to stray off-piste by talking about the economy. Quite why he did this is anyone’s guess. Maybe he felt invincible with such a large lead in the polls. Maybe he has convinced himself he is now an expert on anything on which he pronounces himself expert.Either way it was a big mistake. Because while Nige thought he was parking his tanks on Labour’s lawn – the city trader turned man of the people – what he was actually doing by pledging anend to the two-child cap on benefitsand a new basic rate tax threshold of £20,000, was revealing a policy portfolio costing £50bn to £80bn. The sort of thing that wipes out a politician’s hard-won credibility in an instant.Back in No 10, Team Keir couldn’t believe their luck. Could Farage really have been this halfwitted? They played back the recording of the press conference several times, hardly believing what they were seeing. But it was there in front of them. They hadn’t been mistaken. It was time to arrange their own entirely pointless press conference to point out the fault lines in Nige’s own entirely pointless press conference.First find a location. “We need a factory,” said Morgan McSweeney.“What kind of factory?” a junior member of the comms team asked.“A factory that makes something. It doesn’t matter what. Just so long as it is about three hours from London. Preferably somewhere the train services are usually delayed. Be good to get a quick plug in for nationalising the railways at the same time.“That will be the west coast mainline then. Can’t go wrong. How about Glass Futures in St Helens? There’s bound to be an hour’s taxi ride involved once the train is stuck at Crewe.”“Glass Futures sounds ideal. Just the right degree of pointlessness.”One phone call to Glass Futures later, to assure them the press conference would indeed be entirely pointless and wrapped up in under 20 minutes including questions, and all was agreed. Thursday morning would be a day to remember.Keir began his speechlet by trying to remember where he was. Ah, yes! Glass Futures. When he found out what they did, he was sure he’d be impressed. “I’m thrilled to see what you are doing here,” he said, “because when you see what you are doing, you can see what you are doing.” One day, Starmer might learn to talk human, but this wasn’t that day.Then on to the main substance. Farage was a bad man. Someone not to be trusted. While Starmer had fought tosave jobs at Jaguar Land Rover, Nige wanted the company togo bust. Just because he had taken a dislike to one of their adverts.More than that, Nige couldn’t be allowed near anyone’s mortgage. His policies were fantasy economics. He would crash the economy. No wonder he was planning to make his next speech from a casino inLas Vegas. Farage made LizTruss look positively sane. That took some doing. So stick with me. I might be boring. I might sound like faulty Amstrad software. But your jobs and futures are safe with me.0:58Nigel Farage is ‘Liz Truss all over again’, says Keir Starmer – videoJust time for a handful of questions. Most of the unhelpful variety. Centred on why he had arranged for so many Westminster journalists to travel to Merseyside for what was essentially a five-minute party political broadcast. Wasn’t this all just a bit weird?A government with 403 seats running scared of a party with just five MPs, four years out from the next election. Keir shook his head. It was vital the whole country be informed of the damage a Reform party could do as soon as possible. There wasn’t a moment to waste.A couple of journalists tried to ask whether Starmer had any plans to lift the two-child benefits cap himself, but his memory went hazy at that point. The Guardian’s Peter Walker then wondered if it was not answering questions on the cap that made Starmer less popular than Farage, who could at least approximate sentient approachability. That “approximate” was damning. Both for Keir and Nige. Starmer thanked the Guardian for reminding him of the two-child limit before taking a minute or so to not answer it for a third time.Perhaps the most telling line came from ITV, who asked about the Tories. Starmer could barely stay awake. They were nobodies. Out of road.Sliding into the abyss. They were no longer a credible opposition. Losers. The real battle was between Labour and Reform. And this time it was personal.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerNigel FarageReform UKLabourChild benefitsBenefitsIncome taxcommentShareReuse this content"

John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019)Wielding a Belarusian accent like a weapon, Huston joins the Wickiverse as The Director, head of the Ruska Roma syndicate, who is forced to help Wick when every assassin in Manhattan is trying to kill him. She can also be seen bullying a dancer, a taste of things to come since The Director will be back very soon, in Ballerina, the new Wick spin-off starring Ana de Armas (out on 6 June).9. Enemies, A Love Story (1989)In 1949 New York, a Polish refugee finds himself married to three women. Paul Mazursky’s adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer’s tragicomedy is like straight-faced Woody Allen, and Huston nabbed her second Academy Award nomination for playing Tamara, a cynical yet sensitive concentration camp survivor. A pity the film doesn’t revolve around her instead of her less compelling husband.8. Ever After (1998)View image in fullscreenWicked stepmother … Huston as Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, in Ever After.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarDrew Barrymore makes an adorable proto-feminist heroine in this daft but charming revisionist Cinderella. Meanwhile, Huston’s eyebrows are working overtime, but she still imbues her wicked stepmother with more nuance than we usually see in a panto villain. If only Disney had taken this as the model for their live-action fairytale remakes.7. Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989)In Woody Allen’s darkest film, Huston plays Dolores, a flight attendant whose lover (Martin Landau) takes drastic action when she threatens to ruin his marriage. Allen himself stars in a lighter parallel thread, but it’s the Dostoevskian half that packs the punch here, helped by Huston’s fearlessly uningratiating performance as a woman at the end of her tether.6. The Grifters (1990)View image in fullscreenSmall-time scammers … with John Cusack in The Grifters.Photograph: Palace Films/AllstarStephen Frears’ film of Jim Thompson’s novel about a trio of small-time scammers in Los Angeles is powered by Huston’s Oscar-nominated performance as a bleached-blond con artist whose feelings towards her adult son (John Cusack) may be more than just maternal. It’s scrappy, lowlife Greek tragedy, capped by Huston’s gut-wrenching howl of despair.5. The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)View image in fullscreenWacky … Ben Stiller, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow and Anjelica Huston in The Royal Tenenbaums.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIn the first of her five films for Wes Anderson, Huston plays Etheline, wife of a neglectful patriarch (Gene Hackman), and holds her own amid the wacky characters and directorial quirks by playing it low-key, almost naturalistic. No wonder her accountant (Danny Glover) is smitten.4. The Addams Family (1991)Was there ever such a delightfully romantic couple as Huston and Raul Julia as Morticia and Gomez Addams? Barry Sonnenfeld’s directing debut is little more than a procession of deliciously morbid sight gags and punchlines ripped straight from the original New Yorker cartoons, but who cares when Huston is giving a masterclass in deadpan delivery, and looking fabulous with it? “Don’t torture yourself, Gomez. That’s my job.”3. Prizzi’s Honor (1985)On the set of John Huston’s black comedy, Anjelicaoverheardsomeone saying, “Her father is the director, her boyfriend’s the star, and she has no talent.” She duly silenced any whispers of nepotism by stealing every scene she was in, as Maerose, a scheming mafia princess trying to win back her ex (Jack Nicholson, with whom she had a long-term relationship). She was the third generation of Hustons to bag an Academy Award.2. The Witches (1990)View image in fullscreenFormidable … revealing herself to be the Grand High Witch, in The Witches.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIn a perfect world, Huston would have won another Oscar for her formidable German-accented turn as the Grand High Witch in Nicolas Roeg’s film of Roald Dahl’s kiddie horror-comedy. Roeg insisted she wear a “sexy” dress, and before she removes her wig to reveal her true witchy self in all its Jim Henson Creature Shop hideousness, she does indeed look splendid, as well as terrifying.1. The Dead (1987)Huston, who grew up in her father’s house in Galway, fits right in with the Irish ensemble cast of the director’s small but perfectly formed final film, adapted (by her brother Tony) from a story by James Joyce, set during and after a party in snowy Dublin, 1904. She is deeply affecting as a woman whose melancholy reminiscence of a long-lost love triggers a bittersweet epiphany in her husband. “One by one, we are all becoming shades,” he reflects. Sublime.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedAnjelica HustonJohn HustonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sources close to the negotiations in the oil-rich region said the deal was now at its final stages and they expected UK agreement imminently.The deal is likely to be particularly beneficial for the car industry and financial services, though estimates suggest that a free trade agreement would be worth less than 0.1% of GDP over the next decade.However, there is likely to be a backlash over a deal on chicken imports, where lower animal welfare standards could significantly undercut British farmers.The TUC is among those who have urged caution over the deal and has raised concerns with ministers, the Guardian understands.Human rights groups have previously said the UK should not finalise a free trade agreement without legal commitments on human rights improvements, especially for migrant workers.They said that the UK and GCC should have strong human rights conditions in any future agreement and the UK should provide its own independent impact assessment transparently on the potential consequences of deepening trade ties.Another source close to the talks suggested that though there were likely to be some language around human rights as part of the commitments, there were no legal obligations involved.A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: “Negotiations on a trade deal with the GCC are ongoing. Our priority is to get the right deal, and we’re not setting a deadline.” A departmental source said there was a possibility a pause would be needed for Eid al-Adha, which begins on 6 June.The UK-GCC trade agreement is also likely to have an impact on the UK’s net zero ambitions, with all six GCC countries ranking in the top 10 per capita for carbon emissions.The TUC’s general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: “The TUC has raised concerns directly with ministers about a trade deal with the Gulf states and we will continue to do so.“Our view on trade deals is consistent – the government should not agree deals with countries that abuse human rights and workers’ rights, and violate international law. It was right for the government to suspend trade talks with Israel.“We will continue to make the case with ministers for a trade agenda with workers at its heart – and to press the issue of labour standards and human rights in the Gulf states and other countries.”Tom Wills, the director of the Trade Justice Movement, said: “The UK-GCC trade deal is a values-free agreement that will offer minimal benefit to the UK economy while signalling that human rights and environmental protections are not a priority in UK trade policy.“The government has chosen to finalise this deal without publishing a human rights impact assessment, securing binding commitments on labour rights or environmental standards, or allowing parliament any meaningful scrutiny. It’s a continuation of a secretive, short-term approach to trade that puts corporate access above public values.”Wills said that warm words around rights in the deal would still mean it fell short of comparable standards. “When we see progressive language in a trade deal – around supporting workers or the environment – we always ask the same question: is it binding? Will there be consequences for failing to uphold standards? If not, these warm words aren’t worth the paper they’re written on,” he said.Ministers are also likely to face a backlash from the National Farmers’ Union over the agricultural aspects of the deal. Industry figures told the Guardian that the deal could include uncapped access for chickens if the imports met hygiene standards.Those standards do not cover welfare, sparking alarm among farmers who have recently had to meet new, higher requirements under British law.Negotiations have been led by trade minister Douglas Alexander, who is set to conclude work started under the Conservatives, which was once seen as a more concrete prospect than the India deal, signed a fortnight ago. Alexander is expected to meet his counterpart for final signoff.The previous trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan had promised in parliament that the deal “will not come at the expense of human rights”.MPs have pointed out that there is precedent for including rights concerns in trade deal, such as the chapter on Indigenous peoples in the New Zealand deal which makes commitments on their part in their nation’s future progress.Nick Thomas-Symonds, who was then shadow trade secretary,said in oppositionthat it was “crucial that human rights, women’s rights and workers’ rights are embedded in UK trade negotiations”.But in the most recent exchanges under the Labour government, Lords trade minister Baroness Jones said that although the UK was a “leading advocate for human rights around the world … this work takes place separately to negotiations on free trade agreements.“While aspects of trade policy can provide the opportunity to address other issues in a bilateral relationship, free trade agreements are not generally the most effective or targeted tool to advance human rights issues,” she told the Lords last year.The UAE trade minister Dr Thani bin Ahmed al-Zeyouditold Politico in 2023that the UK and other western countries must “tone down” standard human and workers’ rights provisions in trade deals “if they want more market access and more business opportunities”.Trade with the bloc is worth about £59bn a year, according to government estimates, as the UK’s seventh-largest export market, with a trade deal expected to increase trade by about 16%. Individual Gulf states could also pursue their own deeper partnerships with the UK and sovereign wealth funds in Gulf nations includingSaudi Arabiaand the UAE have been some of the biggest foreign investors in the UK.The trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and Alexander chose the Gulf for their first joint international visit after the election. Starmer visited Saudi Arabia in December.The UK has previously pledged that the deal will not compromise environmental, public health, animal welfare and food standards, made all the more pressing because of the agrifoods deal the UK hopes to seal with the EU in the coming months. The NHS and health services are excluded from the deal.Technology, innovation and financial services will form a key part of the deal which is also likely to have some work and visa provisions for businesspeople from both the UK and the Gulf states – another area that could provoke attack from the Conservatives and Reform, though most of the deal was negotiated under the Tories.Joey Shea, a Saudi Arabia and UAE researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “Finalising a UK-GCC trade agreement without concrete rights protections would be a grave mistake with grim consequences for migrant workers across the Gulf.”Polling conducted by the Trades Justice Movement in November 2024suggested there was public opposition to the deal, with just 21% of people in favour.The TUC previously submitted evidenceduring the Conservative negotiations over the deal, saying that the“kafala” system– which involvesbinding migrant workers to a specific employer – had entrenched modern slavery and exploited millions of migrant workers.Explore more on these topicsTrade policySaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesQatarBahrainKuwaitOmannewsShareReuse this content"

His LinkedIn profile says he is a former Royal Marine commando who has since enjoyed a successful career in IT and cybersecurity.The charges he faces relate to six victims, and two of the charges – wounding with intent and attempted grievous bodily harm – relate to a child.Thousands of people had gathered in the city to watch the title winners display the Premier League trophy on an open-top bus when the incident took place at about 6pm on bank holiday Monday.At least 79 people were injured. The North West ambulance service said 27 people were taken to hospital, with two of the injured, including one child, having sustained serious injuries.Four children were injured in total, the youngest aged nine, and 20 people were treated at the scene, the ambulance service said.In a press conference at Merseyside police headquarters on Thursday, a senior officer said seven people remained in hospital being treated for their injuries.1:22Police name man charged with grievous bodily harm after Liverpool parade collision – videoThe assistant chief constable Jenny Sims, of Merseyside police, said the force was “determined to gather as much evidence as possible” and that detectives were analysing volumes of CCTV footage, dashcam material and police body-worn video.The Crown Prosecution Service said the charges against Doyle, a father of three, would remain under review as the investigation progresses.Sims said: “I fully understand how this incident has left us all shocked and saddened, and I know many will continue to have concerns and questions.“Our detectives are working tirelessly, with diligence and professionalism, to seek the answers to all those questions. When we are able to, we will provide further information.”She added: “We know Monday’s shocking scenes reverberated around the city of Liverpool, and the entire country, on what should have been a day of celebration for hundreds of thousands of Liverpool FC supporters.

TheTrump administrationis expected to take the case to the supreme court if it loses.The ruling by a three-judge panel at the New York-based court of international trade came after several lawsuits argued Trump had exceeded his authority, leaving US trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashing economic chaos around the world.On Thursday, the Trump administrationfiledfor “emergency relief” from the ruling “to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake”.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the judges had “brazenly abused their judicial power to usurp the authority of President Trump” in what she characterised as a pattern of judicial overreach.“Ultimately the supreme court must put an end to this,” she said.Leavitt’s comments came as a second judge, Washington DC district court judge Rudolph Contreras, called the tariffs “unlawful” and ordered a preliminary injunction on the collection of tariffs from a pair of Illinois toy importers, which brought the case.Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress but Trump has so far bypassed that requirement by claiming that the country’s trade deficits amount to a national emergency. This had left him able to apply sweeping tariffs to most countries last month, in a shock move that sent markets reeling.Elon Musk announces exit from US government role after breaking with Trump on tax billRead moreThe court’s ruling stated that Trump’s tariff orders “exceed any authority granted to the president … to regulate importation by means of tariffs”.The judges were keen to state that they were not passing judgment on the “wisdom or likely effectiveness of the president’s use of tariffs as leverage”. Instead, their ruling centred on whether the trade levies had been legally applied in the first place. Their use was “impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because [federal law] does not allow it”, the decision explained.Financial markets cheered the court’s ruling, with the US dollar rallying in its wake, soaring against the euro, yen and Swiss franc. In Europe, the German Dax rallied 0.9%, while France’s Cac 40 rose 1%. The UK’s FTSE 100 blue-chip index ticked up 0.1% at the start of trading. Stocks in Asia also climbed on Thursday, while in the US stock markets all rose marginally.The ruling immediately invalidated all of the tariff orders that were issued through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law meant to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during a national emergency.The judges said Trump must issue new orders reflecting the permanent injunction within 10 days.White House officials have hit out at the court’s authority.The ruling, if it stands, blows a giant hole through Trump’s strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners, draw manufacturing jobs back to US shores and shrink a $1.2tn (£892bn) US goods trade deficit, which were among his key campaign promises.Without the help of the IEEPA, the Trump administration would have to take a slower approach, launching lengthier trade investigations and abiding by other trade laws to back the tariff threats.The decision is also likely to embolden other challenges to Trump’s policy. Last month, California’s governor,Gavin Newsom, filed a lawsuit against the tariffs, arguing they were “illegal, full stop”.The court was not asked to address some industry-specific tariffs Trump has issued on cars, steel and aluminium, using a different statute, so these are likely to remain in place for now.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that there could be other legal avenues for Trump to impose across-the-board and country-specific tariffs, saying: “This ruling represents a setback for the administration’s tariff plans and increases uncertainty but might not change the final outcome for most major US trading partners.”Other options for the president include sections under various trade acts that grant him powers to intervene on trade policy, albeit in an often slower and, in some instances, more limited way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of ‘TRUMP?’ What other reason could it be?” the president asked, without noting that he had appointed one of the judges himself in 2018.Trump’s curiosity as to what could possibly explain the decision did not, apparently, extend to reading any ofthe 49-page explanationwritten by the court, because his post did not deal with any of the legal issues raised in the opinion.At least seven lawsuits have challenged Trump’s border taxes, the centrepiece of Trump’s trade policy.The court made its ruling in response to two cases. One was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, VOS Selections, whose owner said the tariffs were having a major impact and his company may not survive.The other was filed by a dozen US states, led by Oregon.“This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim,” said the Oregon attorney general, Dan Rayfield.Trump allies rail against court ruling blocking wide swath of tariffsRead moreTheplaintiffsin the tariff lawsuit argued that the emergency powers law did not give the president the power to apply tariffs, and even if it had done, the trade deficit did not qualify as an emergency, which is defined as an “unusual and extraordinary threat”.The US has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.Trump also targeted imports from Canada, China and Mexico, claiming his decision was meant to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the US border.His administration pointed to the court’s approval of Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and claimed that only Congress, and not the courts, could determine the “political” question of whether the president’s rationale for declaring an emergency complied with the law.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpTariffsInternational tradeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s not acting. So, I did.”Jenrick is seen approaching people near tube barriers and asking them if they think “it is all right not to pay”.Addressing the camera during the minute-long clip, Jenrick – whoin 2020 acceptedthat his approval of Richard Desmond’s building project had been unlawful – said it was “so annoying watching so many people break the law and get away with it”. He added that the state needed to “reassert itself and go after lawbreakers”.Transport for London (TfL) said fare evasion had actually fallen slightly, down 0.3% from 2023-24 to 3.5%. And officials claimed it was lower than many cities around the world, citing the 13% rate in New York City. They said they hoped to cut fare evasion in the capital to 1.5% by 2030.Nevertheless, it is a serious problem in London, costing an estimated £130m a year. Siwan Hayward, TfL’s director of security, policing and enforcement, said: “Fare evasion is unacceptable. That is why we are strengthening our capability to deter and detect fare evaders, including expanding our team of professional investigators to target the most prolific fare evaders across the network.”The Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association said it had “consistently called for a fully resourced British Transport Police and trained revenue protection officers to tackle fare evasion effectively and safely”.The union added: “The latest incident involving a Conservative MP, who took it upon himself to confront fare dodgers on public transport, highlights the dangers of vigilante justice.”Jenrick said in the clip: “It’s the same with bike theft, phone theft, tool theft, shoplifting, drugs in town centres, weird Turkish barber shops. It’s all chipping away at society.”Asked to explain what he meant, Jenrick said: “Obviously, many Turkish barber shops are good local businesses. However, when small towns have as many as 14 barber shops, many of them Turkish-styled and sitting empty, there are questions to answer.“The NationalCrimeAgency set out earlier this year that it’s investigating the boom in ‘Turkish barber shops’ over concerns many are being used as fronts for money laundering drug and criminal profits. The authorities should continue to pursue suspicious premises.”Hours after the video emerged, Jenrick accepted he had not got permission to film on TfL premises, telling LBC radio he did not want to forewarn the local government body of his plan to potentially embarrass it.While it is understood he did not breach the letter of TfL’s rules, a spokesperson said: “We expect permission to be sought for filming of this nature.”It is understood TfL expects elected officials to work with it in such circumstances.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickLondon UndergroundTfLCrimeTransportLondonRail transportnewsShareReuse this content"

It has already helped hundreds of thousands with advanced prostate cancer to live longer.But some countries, including England, havestopped shortof offering the “spectacular” drug more widely to men whose disease has not spread.Now a team from the US, UK and Switzerland have built an AI test that shows which men would most likely benefit from abiraterone. The “exciting” breakthrough will enable healthcare systems to roll out the drug to more men, and spare others unnecessary treatment.The AI test is being unveiled in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world’s largest cancer conference.Nick James, professor of prostate and bladder cancer research at the Institute ofCancerResearch in London and a consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, co-led the team that built it.“Abiraterone has already hugely improved the outlook for hundreds of thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer,” said James. “We know that for many men with cancer that has not yet spread, it can also have spectacular results.“But it does come with side-effects and requires additional monitoring for potential issues with high blood pressure or liver abnormalities. It can also slightly increase the risk of diabetes and heart attacks, so knowing who is most likely to benefit is very valuable.“This research shows that we can pick out the people who will respond best to abiraterone, and those who will do well from standard treatment alone – hormone therapy and radiotherapy.”The test uses AI to study images of tumours and pick out features invisible to the human eye. The team, funded by Prostate Cancer UK, the Medical Research Council and Artera, trialled the test on biopsy images from more than 1,000 men with high-risk prostate cancer that had not spread.The AI test identified the 25% of men in the group most likely to benefit from the abiraterone – for these men, the drug halves the risk of death.In the trial, patients received a score – biomarker-positive or -negative – which was compared with their outcomes. For those with biomarker-positive tumours, one in four of the men, abiraterone cut their risk of death after five years from 17% to 9%.For those with biomarker-negative tumours, abiraterone cut the risk of death from 7% to 4% – a difference that was not statistically or clinically significant, the team said. These men would benefit from standard therapy alone and be spared unnecessary treatment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it has been available for men with this indication in Scotland and Wales for two years.“Abiraterone costs just £77 per pack, compared with the thousands of pounds that new drugs cost,” said James. “I truly hope that this new research – showing precisely who needs the drug to live well for longer – will lead to NHS England reviewing their decision not to fund abiraterone for high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread.”Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, described the AI test as “exciting”. He added: “We therefore echo the researchers’ urgent call for abiraterone to be made available to those men whose lives it can save – men who, thanks to this research, we can now identify more precisely than ever before.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerArtificial intelligence (AI)Medical researchCancer researchCancerHealthComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

This would cut capital gains tax on cryptoassets from 24% to 10%, turning the UK into a “crypto powerhouse”, he said. Farage added that the crypto legislation that his party had drawn up would include a “bitcoin digital reserve in the Bank of England”.Farage said the bill would make it illegal for banks to debank customers who use and trade in cryptocurrency.On Thursday the Reform website was updated to accept cryptocurrency donations. There was a disclaimer stating that all donations were subject to Electoral Commission rules and that anonymous donations were not permissible.At the conference, Farage called the acceptance of political donations “innovative”, before commending America for being “ahead” with their stance on digital assets.“My message to the British public, and my message particularly to young people, is to help us to help you bring our country properly into the 21st century,” he said. “Let’s recognise that crypto and digital assets are here to stay.”UK government drops plans for NFT made by Royal MintRead moreDuring his talk, Farage criticised the current Labour government and the previous Conservative regime’s lack of action in the cryptocurrency world. He said: “Rishi Sunak, when he was briefly prime minister, made one speech about crypto … and how London used to be a global financial centre. One speech and nothing else. Labour, well we have 25 men and women in cabinet and not a single one of them has worked in private business.”AReform UKspokesperson said cryptocurrency donations would be accepted by the party and details were expected to be announced on Friday.Reform UK is listed on Companies House as a private company majority controlled by the leader, not a members’ association like other parties.

Since then, successive governments have tried to permanently cement Israelicontrol over the land, in part by declaring swathes as “state lands”, which prevents private Palestinian ownership.The motion was said to have been put forward by the far-right defence minister,IsraelKatz, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Kedumim, which is considered illegal under international law.Map of the West Bank showing Israel’s 22 planned settlements.Katz said the settlement decision “strengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria”, using the biblical term for the West Bank, “anchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism”.He added it was also “a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel”.A spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem said: “Israel continues to promote Jewish supremacy through the theft of Palestinian land and the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank. The Israeli government is openly and blatantly working to destroy the Palestinian people, and any chances for a normal future for the people living between the Jordan River and the sea.”The spokesperson added: “The international community is enabling Israel’s crimes by standing aside while millions of Palestinians are subjected to this racist and brutal regime of the Israeli government.”The government intends to use the 22 settlements to bolster Israel’s presence around Route 443, which connects Jerusalem and Tel Aviv via Modiin and was described by Israel Ganz, the head of the Yesha council umbrella group of West Bank Jewish municipalities, as “the most important decision since 1967”.The minister said on X: “We have made a historic decision for the development of settlements: 22 new communities in Judea and Samaria, renewing the settlement of the north of Samaria, and reinforcing the eastern axis of the state of Israel.”Last July Israel approved the largest seizure of land in the occupied West Bank in more than three decades, accordingto a report releasedby Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog.At the time, the Israeli government approved the appropriation of 12.7 sq km (nearly 5 sq miles) of land in the Jordan valley, indicating it was “the largest single appropriation approved since the1993 Oslo accords”, referring to the start of the peace process.In aleaked recording captured by Peace Now last year,Smotrich, during a conference for his National Religious Party-Religious Zionism, disclosed that the land confiscations in 2024 surpassed previous years’ averages by approximately tenfold.He said: “This thing is mega-strategic and we are investing a lot in it. This is something that will change the map dramatically.”In May 2023, Smotrich, who said his “life’s mission is to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state”, instructed Israeli government ministries toprepare for a further 500,000 Israeli settlersto move into the occupied West Bank.On 20 June,the Guardian revealedhow the Israeli military had quietly handed over significant legal powers in the West Bank to pro-settler civil servants working for Smotrich.An order posted by the Israel Defense Forces on its website on May 2024 transfers responsibility for dozens of bylaws at the Civil Administration – the Israeli body governing in the West Bank – from the military to officials led by Smotrich at the defence ministry.In March, astatement issuedby Peace Now said that between 1 January and 19 March, 10,503 housing units were promoted, surpassing the 9,971 units approved throughout the whole of 2024.The approval of new settlements by Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government represents a further implementation of its longstanding goal to annex the occupied Palestinian territory – an objective bolstered by the Trump administration.Mike Huckabee,nominated as Trump’s new ambassador to Israel, signalled his support for Israeli claims on the West Bank in an interview last year. He said: “When people use the term ‘occupied’, I say: ‘Yes, Israel is occupying the land, but it’s the occupation of a land that God gave them 3,500 years ago. It is their land.’”Rightwing settlers have described top officials in Trump’s new administration, which rescinded sanctions imposed on violent Israeli settler groups, as a “dream team” that would offer a“special opportunity”to permanently end any prospect of a Palestinian state.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Pelicot rose to international fame last year for waiving her right to anonymity in the trial of her ex-husband and other defendants. He wassentenced to 20 years in prison.Darian was at the festival to promote her book, I’ll Never Call Him Dad Again. Asked by a male audience member how men can “step up” and be part of breaking cycles of abuse, she said “you need to talk between guys” about pornography, because it is “part of the system” of misogyny and violence.Caroline Darian, daughter of Gisèle Pelicot, speaks: ‘How can you rebuild when your father is the worst sexual predator in decades?’Read moreThe actor and activist Jameela Jamil, who was chairing the event, said that “there are so many men in my life, even, who don’t know all of the facts of this case in the way that women do”.What we “desperately need” men to do “is to check your mates” and challenge their misogynistic comments and behaviour, she said.Darian is a pen name, a combination of her brothers Florian and David’s names, because she wanted to honour the fact that they have been so involved in the process of telling her story.The author spoke with great compassion and admiration about her mother, but explained that they were not currently on speaking terms. In her book, she wrote that they reached a “point of no return” in their relationship after her mother did not believe Darian when she claimed her father had raped her.Darian told the Hay audience that she thinks her mother’s reluctance to support her was a “way for her to protect herself”.It’s “quite difficult” to accept that your child has been abused, she said. “I think my mum is not able to recognise it because otherwise I think she’s going to die.”Dominique Pelicot’s actions have “really impacted the whole family, and everyone from her family had a different position”, she added. “But I just have to be grateful for what [Gisèle Pelicot] did.”Telling her son, who was six at the time, about her father’s actions was particularly hard, Darian said. She felt a responsibility to tell him the truth but “it was a shock” as he had previously had a good relationship with his grandfather and “loved him very much”.Her son saw a psychiatrist for almost four years after finding out the news, and Darian said she was “trying to educate him about what is consent”.Raising a young man in a positive way was “a question of open dialogue”, she said, and “a question of education”.Explore more on these topicsHay festivalFranceGisèle Pelicot rape trialEuropeRape and sexual assaultPornographynewsShareReuse this content"

However, Which? said pet owners were often put off making a complaint when there was a problem, and that those who did often had limited options for taking the matter forward or were left feeling their issue had been unfairly dismissed.Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at the consumer body, said: “It is completely unjust that many pet owners feel not only unhappy with the service and treatment received by their vet when their pet is taken ill, but also lack the means to make a complaint that will be properly investigated.”In its survey of more than 1,000 pet owners who had experienced some kind of problem with their vet during the past two years, pricing was the most common issue raised. More than half said the price of care or treatment was excessive, while more than a quarter said the cost was higher than they thought it would be.The third most common issue was quality of care, followed by customer service, not being given the relevant information, being charged the wrong price, and the vet or practice making a mistake.The first port of call when making a complaint is usually the practice itself. Many of the pet owners in the survey who had been put off making a claim said they did not think they would be successful, did not want to fall out with their vet, or did not know how to complain in the first place.“Very few” owners then went on to escalate the complaint, and those who did found that the options available were often inadequate,said Which?.There is the Veterinary Client Mediation Service (VCMS), but this is a voluntary complaints scheme. Meanwhile, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) has the responsibility for investigating all “concerns” raised with it about vets – but Which? claimed it had “very high thresholds” for investigating and progressing a complaint, “leaving pet owners feeling dismissed, or that the process is biased in favour of veterinary professionals”.Steph Drew, from Lincoln, told Which? that the complaints system was “designed to protect vets”. Her dog Daisy was left injured when her vet operated on the wrong leg. Drew complained to the RCVS, but her case was initially dismissed after a year, said the consumer organisation. After appealing against the decision, the case went on for three years, finally ending in a disciplinary hearing. The vet has now been struck off and found by the RCVS to have failed to provide adequate care to 18 animals in total, said Which?.Earlier this monththe UK Competition and Markets Authority – which has been investigating rising costs and other issues in the multibillion-pound sector – said it had “concerns that … firms’ internal complaint handling processes may be inconsistent and operate poorly, and that the external redress mechanism provided by the VCMS is not as effective as it could be”. It also found there were “shortcomings” with the RCVS code of conduct.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We support proposals to enhance consumer protection, and mandatory practice regulation.”It said that under current legislation it could only investigate allegations of serious professional misconduct.

Though he promised efficiency and modernization, Musk leaves behind a trail of uncertainty and reduced functionality.The timing of Musk’s departure lines up with the end of his 130-day term limit as a “special government employee” but also plays a part in an effort by the billionaire to signala wider shift away from Washingtonas he faces backlash from the public and shareholders. Musk has recently made a show of refocusing his efforts on his tech companies in interviews, saying that he has spent too much time focused on politics and plans to reduce his political spending in the future.As Musk moves on, he consigns a mess of half-realized plans and gutted agencies to his acolytes installed in key positions across the federal government. His departure throws Doge’salready chaotic impact on the governmentinto an even grayer limbo, with questions over how much power the nebulous taskforce will have without him and who, if anyone, might rebuild the programs and services it destroyed.Doge’s debrisMusk’s initial pitch for Doge was to save $2tn from the budget by rooting out rampant waste and fraud, as well as to conduct an overhaul of government software that would modernize how federal agencies operate. Doge so far has claimed to cut about $140bn from the budget – although its “wall of receipts” isnotorious for containing errorsthat overestimate its savings. Donald Trump’s new tax bill, though not part of Doge and opposed by Musk, is alsoexpected to add $2.3tn to the deficit, nullifying any savings Doge may have achieved. Its promises of a new, modernized software have frequently been limited to AI chatbots – some of which werealready in the works underthe Biden administration.The greater impact of Doge has instead been its dismantling of government services and humanitarian aid. Doge’s cuts have targeted a swath of agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization, which handles weather and natural disaster forecasting andplunged otherssuch as the Department of Veterans Affairs into crises. Numeroussmaller agencies, such as one thatcoordinates policy on homelessness, have been in effect shut down. Doge has brought several bureaus to their knees, with no clear plan of whether the staff Musk leaves behind will try to update or maintain their services or simply shut them off.Elon Musk announces exit from US government role after breaking with Trump on tax billRead moreIn one early example of its cuts and the holes in government they have created, Doge targeted the government tech group that partnered with federal agencies to provide tech solutions,known as 18F.When Doge staffers entered the General Services Administration agency that housed the 18F Office, former employees have said they appeared to fundamentally misunderstand how the government operates and the challenges of creating public services.Former 18F director Lindsay Young, who is now part of a legal appeal that contends the firing of 18F violated legal requirements, is concerned that Doge’s cuts will have long-lasting effects on government functions.“In government, it’s just so much easier to tear things down than it is to build things up,” Young said.Themass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Servicesrepresented a similar loss of institutional knowledge that Doge does not seem intent on replacing.Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who has been tracking Doge’s cuts, used the agency’s tobacco unit as an example, which was severely affected by the cuts. “The loss of so much expertise, especially in the healthcare area will mean that more Americans will become sick or die earlier than they might have,” he said. “It also may take many years and great expenditure of resources to restore that experience and expertise.”Musk’s gutting of USAid, formerly the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, is one of the starkest examples of the disarray and harm that Doge’s cuts have caused. TheUS canceled approximately 83%of USAid programs, imperiling services around the world aimed at humanitarian assistance and disease prevention. Onepioneering program under USAid, Pepfar, whichcoordinates the US HIV/Aids response, has seen its services reduced worldwide and its staff left in confusion over what they can still do for people who relied on their organization. Doge’s cuts to the program have likewise threatened the rollout ofa new anti-HIV drugthat researchers have hailed as a “miracle” for its effectiveness.As Musk returns to Tesla and SpaceX, the agencies he laid waste to are left to pick up the pieces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the largest questions about what Doge’s future looks like is whether these staffers, some of whom gained near unfettered access to the government’s most sensitive data, will retain the same powers they enjoyed under Musk.Doge staffers, such as billionaire investor and Musk ally Antonio Gracias, have embedded themselves at key agencies such as the Social Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration. They have worked as a sort of parallel government task force, operating with a lack of transparency as their attempts to access databases and migrate data hascaused disarrayand technical problems. Whether Trump and agency heads allow them to continue on with carte blanche remains unseen.Already at least two prominent Doge staffers have followed Musk to the exit. The billionaire’s longtime top lieutenant Steve Davis, who was running the day-to-day operations of Doge, left his role on Thursday. Spokesperson Katie Miller, wife of Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, also left the White House to work full-time for Musk,according to CNN.Musk is pivoting from DC and Doge’s failures – and wants investors to knowRead moreSome of Musk’s dictates have already been rolled back since he left Washington earlier this month, including a much-derided mandate that required federal employees to send a list of five things that they accomplished each week. The weekly email, which was initially introduced with the threat of being fired for non-compliance, was largely ignored and viewed by many as pointless busywork. On Wednesday, the Pentagonformally announcedthat it would halt the practice.Doge is not being left leaderless, however. Taking over for Musk, accordingto the Wall Street Journal, is Christian nationalist and key figure in the rightwing Project 2025 manifesto Russ Vought. A longtime believer that the president should have sweeping executive powers, Vought has said that he wants federal employees to beleft “in trauma”and to slash federal funding.Musk has praised Doge’s work and pledged that it will continue without him, and as recently as this week is stillremoving veteran officialsit disagrees with from federal agencies. Even at reduced numbers, Musk’s allies also still have access to immense amounts of sensitive and confidential data they arereportedly intending to useto surveil immigrants.What seems farther away than ever in the chaos, however, is Musk’s promise to make the government more efficient and better serve the public.“You don’t need that many people to decide to just cut things,” 18F’s Young said. “But if you actually want to build things, that takes thought. It takes effort.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationUSAIDUS immigrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Now that the third season (OK, discourse treadmill) ofThe White Lotusis sinking into the horizon, and its many fans flock to Thailand in the hope of catching a whiff of Walton Goggins (who I’m in no doubt smells absolutely lovely), I’m grateful that Sicily, the location of season two, might finally be a little less busy. Not least because of its wines.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Wine has been made on Sicily for thousands of years, and the island’s been colonised by just about every ancient civilisation before the Italians took over in the late 1800s. Mass emigration to the US coupled with the two world wars meant that the local wine industry suffered for much of the 20th century, and it’s only been in the past 30 years that it has moved away from an association with bulk cooperative production to prioritising excellence (a story shared with many wine regions internationally).To understand Sicilian wine, you need to get to grips with a handful of native grape varieties that are unique, and vital, to the region. Nero d’avola is the most widely planted red variety, and it produces an inky, dark-fruited wine with suggestions of something herbal such as liquorice and toasted tobacco. Its ready-to-drink iterations are endlessly reliable, but some of the best require time in the bottle. Nerello mascalese and frappato, meanwhile, which I would say are the next two most popular red grape varieties, are sprightly and aromatic in comparison. Often used in blends, they also produce elegant, pretty and perfumed wines in their own right.In terms of whites, cataratto takes the title of the most-planted grape. Of the others, saline and mineral carricante and crisp, savoury grillo are both used to make marsala, the island’s famous fortified wine that hails from the coastal town of the same name. There are 22 other DOCs on Sicily, Marsala being probably the most famous, but there is also Faro out east, which is known for its supple, oak-aged reds made from nerello mascalese and nerello cappuccio. Then there’s Etna with a terroir defined by millefeuille layers of soil and rock from centuries of volcanic eruptions, which create fertile and mineral-rich wines that brim with tension and excitement.Etna wine, in particular, has become much more coveted in recent years. Why? Because ofThe White Lotus, of course. “Apparently, the wine has, like, a bunch of volcanic minerals in it,” swoons Daphne in episode five of season two. “So, we can get drunk, and then tomorrow our skin and our hair and our nails will be glowing.” Unfortunately, I am contractually obliged to inform you that drinking Sicilian wine is very unlikely to have this effect – you’re far more likely to wake up with sallow skin and several missing acrylic nails.Four Sicilian wines to get excited aboutPaolini Grillo BioTerre Siciliane2022£12.50 Good Wine Good People, 12%.

It is not a medical disaster. It is a bodily process, like giving birth or like going to the bathroom or coughing,” she continues. “Your body knows what to do.”The patient will eat and drink less, for example, and sleep a lot more; she won’t get out of bed and might become delirious. Eventually, her breathing will slow down until the death rattles take over. She might even experience “the rally”, the nurse says, or a burst of energy and mental clarity days before her last breath.The scene is based on real events in the life of Molly Kochan, who received aterminal breast cancer diagnosisin 2015 and embarked on a sexual journey until her death four years later. Kochan, who died at age 46, documented her experiences in apodcastwith her best friend, Nikki Boyer, which inspired the TV series.I’m a death expert. I designed eight questions to help you think about dyingRead more“There’s this assumption, understandably, that dying isn’t something an audience wants to look at. It feels too scary or sad,” says Kim Rosenstock, the show’s co-creator, writer and executive producer. “So we felt like we had an opportunity to depict death in a different way. And in doing so, to hopefully make death feel even a tiny bit less mysterious and scary.”To some extent, each death is unique because it depends on a person’s age, health status and reason for dying, says Julie McFadden, a hospice nurse and online educator in Los Angeles, California. But for those unaffected by a traumatic event, such as a car accident, most people will experience certain stages and symptoms.Experts say that knowing more about death – which they call “death literacy” – can actually help quell fears of dying. Here’s what they said about the science and psychology of the death process.The transition phaseMonths before death, the transition phase begins, says McFadden. This entails spending more time in bed, eating and drinking less, and needing more help with daily tasks such as getting dressed and going to the bathroom. During this time, it can be hard to keep up with conversations and sleep will take up most of the day.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’This stage can be particularly difficult to notice in people who have conditions such as dementia or Parkinson’s disease, adds McFadden, because the signs mirror those of their illness.The transition phase could also involve a “detachment from the world” in a way that makes time feel non-existent, saysCole Imperi, a certified thanatologist, a specialist who studies death, dying, grief and loss. Senses will begin to dull as well, she says, so sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch won’t be as intense.When we die, our bodies get less efficient at running like clockworkDue to a lower food and beverage intake, at this point it’s possible to enter ketosis, a state in which the body burns fat for energy instead of glucose. Imperi says some people may experience pain relief or euphoria as a result, but it’snot entirely clear why. Someresearchsuggests the neurotransmitter Gaba increases during ketosis, which makes you feel calm, while cortisol, the stress hormone, decreases, says Imperi.Active dyingAll these symptoms will worsen until the last stage of life, called “active dying”, says McFadden. This can begin a few days or hours before death. For the most part, a person is unconscious, she says, and breathing and heart rate can become irregular.If respiration or heart rate becomes too erratic and causes discomfort, hospice workers can bring in a music-thanatologist to help stabilize vitals and ease anxiety, says Imperi. These trained professionals play the harp and use their voice at bedside. “When we die, our bodies get less efficient at running like clockwork,” says Imperi, “so when music-thanatologists come in, the body sort of tethers itself to the pattern of their music.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I designed eight questions to help you think about dyingRead moreThis stage is also when “the rally” happens. About a third of dying people undergo this sudden rush of mental clarity shortly before they die, according to McFadden. For a brief couple of days, hours or even minutes, personalities return, loved ones’ names are remembered and favorite foods are craved yet again.“There’s not a definitive scientific reason why this happens,” says Imperi. “But I will say that it is a beautiful, beautiful gift.”It’s also very common, at any point during active dying, to experience hallucinations or visions that typically involve loved ones who have passed. Imperi says dying people often talk about needing to pack their suitcase or waiting to be picked up at an airport.Terminal secretions, or the ‘death rattle’The last thing that happens before death is a change in breathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes respiration, says Imperi. Like a fish out of water, a person experiences a series of rapid breaths followed by long periods of no breathing. As a result, one can’t swallow mucus or saliva, so it thickens and builds up in the back of the throat, making each breath sound a bit gurgly, says Imperi.These noises are called terminal secretions, commonly referred to as the “death rattle”. Although it sounds painful, Cheyne-Stokes breathing doesn’t hurt – just like most of the active dying process, says McFadden, who says she can tell based on patients’ non-verbal cues.“A dying person is like a baby,” McFadden says. “Babies can’t say they’re hungry or teething, but you can tell something is wrong by how they’re acting. Dying people are the same.”Why death literacy is important“In American culture, death is largely feared and seen as this disaster to avoid at all costs,” says Rosenstock. “It was important to us to convey the dying process in a truthful way.”It’s normal to be scared of death because it’s in our nature to survive, says Imperi, but the best way to quash a fear of dying is to educate yourself. Severalstudiesshow that the more we learn about and contemplate death, the less anxiety we have about experiencing it.Death literacy can be especially helpful for people who are already dying, McFadden says.The new science of death: ‘There’s something happening in the brain that makes no sense’Read more“Most people are not comfortable talking about it, so everyone skirts around the issue. But at the end of the day, they do want answers, and generally speaking, we have some,” McFadden says. “We don’t know exactly what it’s going to be like after you’re gone, but we know enough about what you can expect [during the process], and in most cases, my patients and their families sigh with relief once they learn more about it.”That’s because one of the hardest parts about dying is losing control, says Imperi, and death education can help put the ball back in your court. On the other hand, some people might find a sense of control by refusing to learn more about what’s happening to them or their loved one, adds Imperi, which can be equally as therapeutic.“Supporting that resistance is sometimes more important,” says Imperi, because that might be what a person needs at that point in their journey.Above all, “we are built for death just like we’re built for birth”, says McFadden. “The more we understand that, the better we will live – and the more peaceful we will die.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthDeath and dyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It lays out plans to shake up defined contribution pensions, the funds that invest workers’ regular payments in stocks, shares and other assets to grow the money. These provide workers with an income on retirement based on the value of their stake; the size of this income will depend on how much they have paid in and how well the investments have performed.Am I going to be £6,000 better off?Probably not. That figure is based on a specific set of assumptions, but it’s not necessarily bad news. The report says: “It is important to recognise the actual benefits will differ for all savers and may be higher or lower.”The £6,000 is based on the pension savings of a man on the median annual salary – currently £37,382 – who works from the age of 22 to 68 and pays into his fund throughout that time. His contributions are based on the minimum an employee must pay when auto-enrolled into a pension (4% of his earnings, matched with 3% from his employer and 1% in tax relief).The government says that after charges and investment growth, the man’s fund would currently be worth £163,600 when he reaches retirement. It says changesto consolidate smaller schemes into pension megafundswould reduce charges and add £2,500 to his pot, while encouraging providers to invest in a wider range of assets could add £3,300. In total that would be £5,900 more to spend in retirement.In reality, the benefit would depend on how much charges actually fall by as a result of the new megafunds, how much the assets increased in value, and how much the person had in their pension.Women stand to gain less on average because they typically earn less – median earnings are £31,672 – and they are more likely to take career breaks and miss contributions.What are megafunds?As the name suggests, megafunds are big schemes that will look after billions of pounds of workers’ cash. Currently, there are no rules regarding the minimum sums that providers can manage. The government is concerned that this leads to lots of small schemes that may not have economies of scale, meaning higher charges for their members and potentially poorer investment outcomes compared with bigger schemes.It said on Thursday it plans to tackle this by bringing in a law that providers must have at least £25bn in invested assets by 2030, although there will be transition rules in place until 2035. The new rules will mean smaller schemes have to join forces.For an individual saving into a defined contribution pension either privately or via their employer, there may be changes in who administrates their savings scheme and – if the plans work – their charges should go down.Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that scale is important in delivering better outcomes for savers, but it “must not come at the cost of reducing competition, member choice and much needed innovation”.She adds: “If the market is to thrive, then there needs to be space for smaller, innovative providers. It’s a lesson learned in the retail banking market, where competition from smaller, challenger banks has put pressure on larger incumbents to improve user experience and product offerings.”What will the funds invest in?At the moment, although there are many other assets that they can buy, pension schemes’ holdings are dominated by publicly listed global shares and bonds, because they are easy to trade. The government says that by making funds bigger it will make it easier for them to invest in a wider range of things, including private markets – these include infrastructure, property and loans to startups. These take longer to generate returns, even though the yields may eventually be higher.The government wants some of this money to be invested in the UK – and although lots ofbig providers have already committed todoing this – it says it will bring in a “reserve power”, which will let it set targets for private investments.Tom Selby, the director of public policy at the advice firm AJ Bell, says the power “essentially puts a gun to schemes’ heads and will create those mandatory targets in all but name”.He adds: “There is a clear danger that conflating government policy goals – namely driving higher levels of investment in the UK and ultimately economic growth – with those of savers and retirees means the latter will be risked in pursuit of the former. It is vital the needs of pension scheme members remain the priority.”What do experts think?Selby is sceptical about the reforms. “Many of the claims about the benefits of these reforms to pension savers and retirees need to be taken with a fistful of salt,” he says.“While there may be some efficiency benefits to consolidation, these are difficult to quantify with certainty, and reducing competition in the market may stifle incentives to deliver innovation. In addition, private equity investing is notoriously high-cost and high-risk, meaning it is entirely possible people will end up worse off if those investments fail to perform over the long term.”However, Jonathan Lipkin, the director of policy, strategy and innovation at the Investment Association, says the plans mark “the beginning of a new era for the UK pension system”.He adds: “With the greater resources available to larger pension schemes, investment expertise and governance can be strengthened to achieve sophisticated scale. This will give pension savers access to a wide range of asset classes and strategies that can both improve member outcomes and contribute to better capital allocation, including for the UK economy.”Explore more on these topicsPensionsConsumer affairsConsumer rightsPensions industryRetirement planningexplainersShareReuse this content"

In 2023, Goma said he wasintending to sue the BBCfor unpaid royalties over the experience.Guy Goma ending up on air by mistake2.Standing in entirely the wrong placeLive broadcast can be a tricky arena for not paying attention in public. Sometimes you just have to style it out. “You can pretend like you haven’t noticed,” the BBC News presenter Martine Croxall said after the camera zoomed in on her empty chair at the start of a news bulletin, while she was standing at the other end of the studio ready to do her piece to an entirely different camera.Martine Croxall in the wrong place for BBC News3.Holding entirely the wrong thingSometimes it is the props that can reveal how unprepared you are.

Ever the professional, he continued with the news.Simon McCoy baffling viewers with his paper4.Never work with animals or children – even if they are your ownProf Robert Kelly is a highly qualified and renowned international political analyst, with a distinguished career, and is chiefly famous for the nonchalant way his then four-year-old daughter strode into the middle of a live TV interview. Kelly continued unabashed as the chaos – which also involved his wife and his nine-month-old son – unfolded behind him.Robert Kelly’s amazing moment5.‘Unbelievable, Jeff!’Perhaps, though, the pièce de résistance is the much-loved ex-footballer Chris Kamara looking like a confused labrador and saying “I don’t know Jeff, has there?” when the Sky Sports Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling went to him live at Portsmouth’s Fratton Park to ask him about a sending-off that Kamara had entirely failed to notice. “The rain must have got in my eyes, Jeff,” he says at one point in a clip that seems destined to provoke tears of laughter for years to come.Pro tip: your phone almost certainly has settings on it that will always allow calls and notifications from key numbers to bypass silent or sleep modes.

Not only has she discovered some of the best form of her career, but she has sneaked into the White House correspondents’ dinner as a guest and adopted a kitten called Biscuit.Morgan will now be hoping to enjoy the sweet taste of success with England and the Washington Spirit defender believes the American NWSL’s summer calendar can help her arrive at July’s European Championship in Switzerland in peak fitness because of the schedule, compared to going to a major tournament during what is – for Europe-based participants – the off-season.“The calendar running from March to November was something that I looked at as a real positive of coming to this league, in terms of setting you up for being able to sort of peak for international tournaments,” Morgan says. “I think that’s part of the reason the US have historically had so much success in the international windows because a lot of the European teams, the majority of their players, are obviously either at the end of a very long season or really at the start of pre-season so that can be quite difficult. So I feel like it’s a really positive thing that – if selected – myself and other players playing over here would be in the midst of playing high-level, competitive football and in that rhythm and hopefully feeling really sharp.”View image in fullscreenEsme Morgan trains with England at St George’s Park this week.Photograph: Jacob King/PAMorgan is preparing for England’s Women’s Nations League meeting with Portugal at Wembley on Friday but, speaking after Washington Spirit’s 3-2 win at Chicago Stars and before their 2-1 away victory against Seattle Reign, adds: “I feel in really good form, to be honest. Coming back in to pre-season, I felt fit and strong. I’d worked hard over Christmas back in the UK to kind of get into good shape, so I just felt really sharp and confident. And like a lot of the things that I worked on last season while I was still adjusting to the league and the types of opposition we play, over the off-season, I’ve kind of been able to consolidate and heavily focus each training session on specific things that I want to work on.”Morgan’s side – who were runners-up in the NWSL playoffs last November, five months after her switch from Manchester City – are enjoying a strong start in 2025, sitting fourth in the table after 10 games, eight of which Morgan has started. She says: “I feel comfortable and confident on the pitch now that I know all my teammates a lot better and the style of playing the league, I feel like you’ve got a lot less time on the ball here than you do at home and the strikers are slightly different in terms of the threats that they offer, so getting used to that and the challenges that they pose and working on the things that I wanted to I feel has helped me this season.”View image in fullscreenEsme Morgan on life in the NWSL: ‘I feel like you’ve got a lot less time on the ball here than you do at home.’Photograph: Hannah Foslien/NWSL/Getty ImagesThe 24-year-old from Sheffield hails her new coach, the former Barcelona coach Jonatan Giráldez, as “super detailed”, and also describes the NWSL as “super intense and competitive”. Morgan says: “Really, the gap between the teams at the top and those at the bottom is minuscule. Any one on any given day can take points off another team. Everyone here is so fast and athletic and it is more transitional than the WSL. When I played at City often when we’d play teams who’d just kind of low block and sit back and hope to just frustrate and then hit on the counter attack – whereas here it’s very rare that teams low block, which is probably why you see some of the crazy scorelines and endings to games that you do.”Morgan starred in one such game at the start of May, a dramatic 4-3 loss at home to Angel City in which she scored twice, her first competitive goals in four years. What spurred on such rare attacking prowess? Biscuit. The match was designated as Washington Spirit’s ‘Pitchside Pups’ game, where the club encourage the adoption of animals by raising awareness for a local shelter. Fans were also allowed to bring their dogs and cats to the match.“I just fell in love with this little kitten,” Morgan says with adoring eyes. “She’s so cute. She was at the game before the Angel City game, so I got to see her and cuddle her. And people keep saying that’s why I scored two goals, because I had the power of Biscuit with me!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But bribing women to have babies will never lead to a healthy societyThu 29 May 2025 12.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 12.39 EDTShareTurning children into capitalists – that’s the purpose behind the new “Trump account”, which will give every new baby born in the US during the president’s second term$1,000 to be investedin the stock market. Now, little shareholders can identify with the US companies they invest in. “Hey … I own 50 bucks of McDonald’s” was an example given by senator Ted Cruz. This is a surprise element in Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill”, which gives $1.1tn in tax cuts to the very rich funded by cutting Medicaid, food assistance and the education department.This joins a range of policies from rightwing parties around the world which look, on the face of it, to be pro-child or pro-family. In Hungary, Viktor Orbán announcedan income tax exemptionfor mothers of two or three children – previously, only mothers of four or more children were exempt. Meanwhile,Nigel Farage in the UK has proclaimedthat Reform would end the two-child benefit cap.Yet in reality, the policies are anything but. Trump’s baby bond is not a pro-familypoverty alleviation scheme, but his way of creating the “shareholding democracy” Margaret Thatcher dreamed of when she promised in her 1985 conference speech to make “owning shares as common as having a car”. Her government sold off nationalised companies cheap to encourage the capitalist impulse in British citizens: that’s when we lost gas (“If you see Sid, tell him”), water and electricity alongside British Airways and others. It didn’t work, as most sold these underpriced shares for a quick profit: by 2022,only 14%of British people directly held any shares.Britain had achild trust fund (CTF)for every baby until it was brutally axed by the coalition government. (Abolition was in the Liberal Democrats’ 2010 manifesto: they weren’t always nice.) Labour had introduced it in 2005: £250 for all, or £500 in low-income families, with a top-up of £250 at seven, and double that for poorer seven-year-olds. Parents who were able to could contribute extra. But Labour’s intention was radically different from Trump’s. The idea was to make a small dent in the colossal injustice of the inheritocracy so that every child at 18 would have something to see them on their way.The average £2,000 pot is only a wren-sized nest egg, but for those with no bank of mum and dad at least it can contribute towards driving lessons, renting a flat or education costs. When8.4 million people have no savings at all, those from families with nothing risk being forced into bad jobs with no escape, for lack of the choices a little money can buy. Right now, restoring it is nowhere on the agenda; in these far harder times, the government must strive first towards its manifesto promise to cut child poverty.Gavin Kelly, the begetter of the CTF inside Gordon Brown’s Treasury, laments that there is no research on its effects: this real-life experiment should be comparing those receiving the CTF with previous or later generations without it. The impulse for research dried up once the policy itself was killed off, but in one study done before the CTF came in, Abigail McKnight of the London School of Economics’s Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion found that “early asset holdingdoes have positive effectson later wages, employment prospects, excellent general health and in reducing malaise”. She says it allows young people to take risks, “andrisk-taking is very importantfor higher returns in later life”.Kelly has plentiful anecdotes. He just met a family in rural Suffolk with no savings whose son used his CTF to buy an old car he could never have afforded without it so he can travel to an apprenticeship 45 minutes away. Roughly 55,000 18-year-olds every month come into their fund, but it ends in 2029, when today’s 14-year-olds will be the last recipients (18- to 22-year-olds, there are lost child trust fundswaiting to be claimed).Back in 2005, Labour already had child poverty falling steeply, and this was a small attempt to ease the gap between the richest and the poorest. But it was far more than that. Here was another symbol of Labour’s pro-child spirit – welcoming every baby and enhancing their lives with Sure Start centres. Labour was never consciously pronatalist, but its “every child matters” policy strove to set children on their feet, with child tax credits among its pro-child impulses. Labour inherited afalling birthratein 1997, but it rose until 2010,and then fellfrom two births a woman to 1.5 in the Tory years. Correlation is not causation, but unwelcoming years of cutting child and youth services can’t have helped, with rising housing and childcare costs acting as barriers to child-bearing, andyoung people worse offthan their parents were at baby-producing age.Children’s pleasures were stripped bare, as school arts and sports were lost, and further education colleges, leisure centres, parks and every support to childhood were depleted, alongside savage benefit cuts. Even the infant mortality rate rose for first time in generations. So did the child death rate, up 8% in England in 2023, a third of it avoidable, according to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. This was all under the rightwing governments that savoured the two-child benefit cap, a (failed) eugenic attempt to prevent the wrong kind of children increasing the population.The sadness is that most women in the UK and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries wish they had more children than they do. In 2016,they wished on average for 2.3– well above the population replacement rate of 2.1, let alone the current rate of 1.57.By delaying its child poverty plan, Labour has a chance to reverse 15 years of inequality | Gordon BrownRead moreRightwing leaders such as Trump andViktor Orbánwish to own the pronatalist argument – don’t let them. As the Social Market Foundation (SMF)reportsin Baby bust and baby boom: Examining the liberal case for pronatalism, a country that celebrates childhood is often a better place for everyone. Just as abortion is a right, so is the right to bear children.That’s why abolishing the two-child benefit limit – asministers have hinted they are considering– is about even more than alleviating child poverty. Scrapping it would signify the renewal of a hopeful attitude to children that was always in Labour’s DNA. Any vision of the future has to embrace a younger population: old people are not a nation’s dynamism or innovation. Falling fertility means long-term stagnation. Punishing the children we have only leads to long-term social and economic damage.For the children who receive one, the “Trump account” may do some good. But whatever his motive, the president’s version of pronatalism is doomed.Experience from around the worldsuggests bribery has a minimal effect: France and Sweden both have higher birthrates than Hungary, regardless of the tax breaks. So Trump’soffer of $5,000 to mothers for every birthmay be doomed without a social environment that nurtures all children. Nor is his bill really likely to turn babies into mini-capitalists.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionLabourBenefitsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s nothing more than a deadly PR stuntEyad AmawiAs an aid worker, I despaired at news of Israeli troops opening fire on people seeking food. This is no answer to our sufferingThu 29 May 2025 12.52 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 14.40 EDTShareTwo days ago, Israeli soldiers fired on a massive crowd of starving Palestinians who just wanted to eat. Some of them had walked more than 10km to reach what was then the only aid distribution point in Gaza. They were looking for help from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a newly formed Israeli-backed logistics group that had set up a distribution centre in Rafah. Israel and GHFlost control of the crowd; Palestinians were shot and killed for seeking food, and dozens were injured.What the GHF is doing is nothing more than a public relations campaign: it is promoting the illusion that aid has begun entering the Strip in a meaningful way. What we have learned is that GHF only distributed eight trucks’ worth of food on Wednesday. Moreover, a US charity, Rahma Worldwide, which had food parcels that it couldn’t get into Gaza and so allowed them to be “taken custody” by GHF, has accused the organisation ofusing its logo without permissionin the aid distribution. (Rahma said it’s opposed to working alongside GHF because of its use of armed security contractors.)Ultimately, there are tens of thousands of people across the Gaza Strip who will not be able to reach the newly created centres. Even if they function, they will not meet the ever-growing daily needs of the population here.As an aid worker, I heard the news this week in despair. This is not sustainable. It is no answer to the total siege thatIsraelhas placed upon us. The unconditional entry of aid overseen by UN agencies is the only solution.Nineteen months ago, the catastrophe that we are experiencing would have been unimaginable. The scale of suffering and pain is beyond comprehension. People here walk the streets without food or drinkable water, and the standard of living has hit its lowest point in recent history, with crippling inflation and empty shelves.For more than 600 days, aid workers like myself have dedicated ourselves to caring for the people of Gaza under Israel’s brutal occupation and bombardment. Israeli government ministers havedeclared their intentionto ethnically cleanse all the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. With the comprehensive ban on all types of humanitarian and medical aid – and the only humanitarian crossing, Kerem Shalom in the south, closed since March – aid distribution has faced innumerable challenges.Our local aid distribution committee has been working in partnership with local and international entities to try to ease the suffering of civilians, especially children, amid the waves of displacement. Nineteen months of evacuation orders, where people are forced to flee with barely any notice, often under bombardment and in fear, has left everyone in a state of panic. People are unsure of where to go or what essential items – like food, water or blankets – to take with them.During the first waves of displacement, relief agencies set up dozens of camps in every region and established temporary infrastructure for water drainage and drinking water supply, depending on our ability to provide wells or coordinate with the remaining local municipalities in different areas of the Strip.But as the bombing and military operations intensified, our humanitarian efforts were constantly threatened. Despite repeated setbacks, we remained determined to continue reaching children, the injured and displaced people – many of whom have been forcibly displaced, an average of five times a family.1:19Palestinians return to Rafah food centre where Israeli troops opened fire – videoGaza has been under fire for almost 20 months, but the most horrifying chapter has unfolded over the past 90 days, with rockets and famine ravaging the bodies of children. I personally know many people who have been killed or injured. Aid organisations have continued our work amid this incomprehensible complexity, but at this stage, even the most basic proposals are unrealistic – trying to feed and care for thousands who can barely find daily sustenance.The turning point that wasn’t: the way the world talks about Israel’s war has changed. Nothing else has | Nesrine MalikRead moreAs the director of the UN World Food Programme (WPF) stated: the aid trucks that have entered are “a drop in the ocean”. We cannot carry out our work unless the international community applies genuine pressure on Israel. Even the roads are closed and buildings are reduced to rubble, making aid delivery impossible. It cannot be clearer: we need unconditional access for food aid to avoid a more devastating catastrophe.Gazaneeds at least 500 to 600 trucksevery day to meet its humanitarian needs. A handful of centres operating in the south of the Strip is no replacement for the hundreds of distribution centres linked to UN programmes and institutions that have been forced to stop operations by the blockade. What must be said clearly is that there is an urgent need to stop the genocide and allow the unconditional entry of aid. It is only through distribution by UN agencies and the international community – not Israel – that we will begin to alleviate this crisis.Eyad Amawi is a coordinator for local NGOs.

But what if the public moves further to the right?Thu 29 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 08.39 EDTShareIt requires an effort to keep reminding yourself of the sheer historical oddity of monarchy’s healthy survival into the modern democratic age. Yet so rooted is the monarchy in the mental furniture of Britain that most people in our politics barely think about it. This week, however, the modern British monarchy has stood up and demanded to be counted, doing something new and perhaps genuinely consequential.Judged by any yardstick,Charles III’s visit to Canadawas an audaciously disjunctive event. The idea that a vibrant democracy such as Canada, with a highly sophisticated sense of its own complex identity, might summon an elderly hereditary monarch from across the ocean to provide a focal point for itsresistance to Donald Trump’s existential threattakes some believing. Yet that was exactly what played out this week, when the king travelled to Ottawa to open the new Canadian parliament.No monarch had bothered to make this trip for nearly 50 years. During that time, however, Canada has transformed itself into a major global power and has decisively slipped its old colonial bonds. Yet Trump’s threat to Canada is such that the country’s prime minister,Mark Carney, judged a summons to Buckingham Palace would send a useful newsworthy signal about its national sovereignty that would help bind the nation while sending a shot across the US president’s bows.At least as significantly, when seen from Britain, King Charles was happy to oblige. Just as with the speech he delivers at Westminster at the start of a parliamentary session, Tuesday’s in Ottawa will have been scripted by the elected government. Butthe Ottawa speechhad a far looser and more personal format than the Westminster version. This allowed the king to speak words that clearly mattered to him, and by which he will be judged.Trump was not mentioned by name. Even so, he permeated the speech. The king endorsed Canadian national pride and said democracy, law, pluralism and global trade were on the line. He said Canada’s relationships with Europe would be strengthened and, speaking in French, he saidCanadafaces challenges unprecedented in the postwar era. He was proud that Canada was “an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good”, and he ended, quoting from the Canadian national anthem, by saying “the true north is indeed strong and free”.All this is an unmistakable rebuke to Trump’s rudeness, aggression and greed. The words are not neutral but committed. Whether the kingsought approvalfrom Keir Starmer for his visit and speech is not clear. His main adviser concerning the visit will have been Carney, who may have liaised with Downing Street. Starmer, committed to engaging with Trump, will have been content to keep his distance. The larger point, however, is that this was a willed act by the king. Charles did not have to travel and did not have to make the speech. But he did both, even while continuing to be treated for cancer.The contrast with his mother is impossible to miss. Elizabeth II’s hallmark throughout her 70-year reign was a studied neutrality on public affairs. She was much praised for it during her lifetime, leading some commentators to assume that neutrality was now a precondition for monarchy’s survival, and others into infantile speculations about the symbolic messages that may, or may not, have been implied by what the queen was wearing. Even when Elizabeth didlet slip a view– as in her “think very carefully about the future” comment during the 2014 Scottish referendum – the words could be as gnomic as they were rare.1:38King Charles tells Canadian parliament that country will stay 'strong and free' – videoDuring his long years as heir to the throne, however, Charles became a controversialist. He expressed views about a wide range of issues, from architecture to farming and the climate crisis. He lobbied ministers in handwritten“black spider” memosabout them. This habit led some to predict that, when he succeeded to the throne, Charles would continue to be a protagonist on causes that mattered to him. In Mike Bartlett’s 2014 play King Charles III, the future monarch even abdicates rather than give his assent to a government bill restricting the freedom of the press.In nearly three years as king, however, Charles has proved many doubters wrong.Monarchywatchers who suspected he would not change his ways now concede he has not overstepped any significant constitutional lines. Yet he has done the job his own way, not his mother’s. As the palace itself acknowledges, the king is walking a tightrope.Charles’s visits and speeches push the boundaries. Ottawa is now the most dramatic example, but it is not the only one. At home, Charles has championed the UK union against national separatists. He took Starmer and Angela Rayner tovisit a housing projectin Cornwall. He has made visits to EU capitals,most recently to Rome, which harmonise with Starmer’s attempt to improve relations with Europe. Hevery publicly hostedPresident Zelenskyy only days after Trump’s savage assault on the Ukraine leader in the Oval Office. His most recent Christmas messagefocused on praising health workers.So far, Charles has gotten away with it. Public concern for his own health, and for that of his family, has probably helped him. So has public sympathy over the behaviour of the Sussexes. To criticise Trump is also popular rather than risky. Amid all this, the public has cut Charles enough slack to be more himself. Those who warned that his more committed approach to public affairs could threaten the monarchy and boost republicanism have, at least at this stage, been proved wrong.Canadians are happy to cling to King Charles – as long as he keeps us safe from Trump | Jen GersonRead moreBut this benign circle may not continue indefinitely. Monarchy is still an oddity. The tightrope is still there. Charles is still balanced on it. His approach to the job has won him approval, including grudging acknowledgment from some who previously disapproved of him. But these things are not static. Charles’s role carries risks which, when faced with a less patient public mood or different circumstances, could cause trouble for him and for the monarchy.Assuming that Charles remains in good health for years to come, how might he handle a change of government? If the current feeding frenzy about a Nigel Farage prime ministership really came to pass in 2028-29, Charles could be faced with a government that might embrace a Maga president in Washington, abandon European alliances, dismiss the net zero agenda, and go out of its way to antagonise Scotland and Wales.That would present Charles or the future King William with a very different Britain from the one with which they appear in sympathy. Yet it is a Britain that may be only three or four years distant. According to most evidence and most received wisdom, a generally well-disposed public is content to stick with the monarchy. Yet when so much else about the British state is struggling to adapt, and when monarchy remains historically improbable, why would the monarchy itself not struggle too?Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIOpinionMonarchyCanadaMark CarneyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

At face value, this order promises a commitment to federally funded research that is “transparent, rigorous, and impactful” and policy that is informed by “the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available”. But hidden beneath the scientific rhetoric is a plan that would destroy scientific independence in the US by giving political appointees the latitude to dismiss entire bodies of research and punish researchers who fail to fall in line with the current administration’s objectives. In other words: this is Fool’s-Gold Standard Science.According to the order, “Gold Standard Science means science conducted in a manner that is:(i) reproducible;(ii) transparent;(iii) communicative of error and uncertainty;(iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary;(v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions;(vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses;(vii) subject to unbiased peer review;(viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and(ix) without conflicts of interest.”The order mimics the language of an active reform movement in science to increase rigor and transparency of research – a movement commonly called the open science movement, to which some of us are contributors. Science is, by nature, a continuous work in progress, constantly self-scrutinized and always looking for opportunities to improve. We should all be able to celebrate any administration’s investment in improving the openness, integrity and reproducibility of research.But, with this executive order, we cannot.Instead of being about open science, it grants administration-aligned political appointees the power to designate any research as scientific misconduct based on their own “judgment” and includes the power to punish the scientists involved accordingly; this wouldweaponize governmentcounter to the public interest.The consequences of state-dictated science can be catastrophic. When Trofim Lysenko, a researcher who denied the reality of genetic inheritance and natural selection, won favor with Joseph Stalin and took control of agriculture in the Soviet Union, thousands of scientists who disagreed with him were fired, imprisoned or killed. His disastrous agricultural prescriptions ultimately led to famines that killed millions in the USSR and in China.Science does not proceed by sequentially establishing unassailable conclusions, but rather by steadily accumulating numerous lines of evidence, scrutinizing weaknesses, and pursuing additional evidence. Almost any study, any source of evidence, any conclusion, falls short of meeting every aspect of the White House’s list of best practices. This has nothing to do with laziness, let alone misconduct by individual scientists; it’s simply a consequence of the fact that science is difficult. Scientists constantly grapple with uncertainty, and nevertheless can ultimately arrive at robust, valid conclusions, such as the fact that vaccines do not cause autism, and that the burning of fossil fuels is warming the planet andwreaking havoc on our climate.Under the terms of the executive order, political appointees loyal to the president can willfully find justification to labelanyresearch finding as scientific misconduct, and then penalize the researchers involved accordingly.This administration hasalreadyappropriated the language of open science to assert control over anddeal heavy blowsto the scientific ecosystem of the United States – includingcancelling thousands of active research grantsinclimate science,misinformation and disinformation,vaccines,mental health,women’s health,LGBTQ+ healthandstem education. Calls to “revisit” decades of work that establish vaccine safety beyond a shadow of a doubt “because the only way you can get good science is through replication”, and demands forunethical vaccine clinical trial practicesand additional data, further echo the bad-faith adoption of open science language.Trump has also advanced a congressional budget calling formassive cuts to federal spending on research and developmentand leviedsignificant retaliationagainst universities that have not fallen in line with his demands. He has gone so far as topropose a rule change by the office of personnel managementthat would install policy police at all levels of federal agencies, converting thousands of employees into presidential appointees who can be summarily fired without due process for any arbitrary political reason. This new executive order raises the concern that many of ourbest scientistswould be targeted in Lysenkoist purges. Meanwhile, the threat of such actions is already having a chilling effect on all scientists.Science is the most important long-term investment for humanity. Interference in the scientific process by political arbiters stifles scientists’ freedom of speech and thought. Science depends on unfettered speech – free and continuous discussion of data and ideas. We, like the rest of the scientific community, aspire to achieve greater openness, integrity and reproducibility of research to accelerate discovery, advance treatments and foster solutions to meet society’s greatest challenges. Meeting that objective will not occur by centralizing power over science and scientists according to the whims of any political administration. We see this executive order for what it is: an attempt to sell the US’s future for pyrite.Colette Delawallais a PhD candidate at Emory University and executive director of Stand Up for Science.Victor Ambrosis a 2024 Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine at the Chan Medical School, University of Massachusetts.Carl Bergstromis professor of biology at the University of Washington.Carol Greideris a 2009 Nobel laureate in medicine and distinguished professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.Michael Mannis the presidential distinguished professor of earth and environmental science and director of the Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media at the University of Pennsylvania.Brian Nosekis executive director of the Center for Open Science and professor of psychology at the University of VirginiaExplore more on these topicsScienceOpinionClimate crisisTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But I’m ready to start the conversationThu 29 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 19.33 EDTShareIn case you aren’t related to me and didn’t know, it was my dad’s birthday last week. Looking through photos and various paraphernalia to make the perfect post about him that he almost certainly wouldn’t see, I found a note I had written to him as a child. In it, using language that would now be considered “toxic” and “victim- blaming”, I apologise for yelling at him for picking his nose (while also pointing out how disgusting I found it).Not to try and excuse my behaviour which I would describe medically as “being a little shit”, but occasionally in life we can look back at our child selves and understand something we didn’t know at the time. This is one of those instances. To me, I can see the little shittery, but I can also see something else that probably caused this behaviour towards my dad, a condition outside my control:misophonia. Now that ADHD has had its moment in the sun, I am here to push formycause.View image in fullscreenThe handwritten note Bec Shaw penned to her father when she was a childMisophonia: how ‘sound rage’ destroys relationships and forces people to move homeRead moreI have explained misophonia before, but essentially it is a disorder where specific sounds or movements from people around you act as triggers, causing extreme disgust, distress or even hatred. It’s not the feeling you get when you’re a bit annoyed at someone’s open-mouth chewing; it’s more like your entire body suddenly overflows with rage and sometimes vomit.The small amount of research into misophonia (it was onlynamedin 2001) indicates it starts in childhood and may initially be focused on one particular family member. Hence, yelling at my dad for picking his nose. Which is disgusting by the way. My misophonic focus soon expanded to the rest of humanity, and since then barely a day has passed in which I haven’t experienced some form of trigger.A few days ago I was watching a new Netflix show where one of the main characters was upset by a colleague eating an apple (very familiar) and she said he probably has misophonia, and then explained what it was. I was really surprised by what I felt when she explained it so matter-of-factly, and had it taken into consideration. It was the same feeling I get when I talk to someone else who has this condition, a relief that someone else understands and can give you appropriate support. The feeling that it has been taken seriously as a real thing. Because I know it sounds weird, and probably a bit made up.It’s embarrassing to admit that a sound someone is making without even thinking about it has turned your insides into one of those primary school science fair volcanoes with vinegar and baking soda. That you can’t listen to a conversation because someone is scraping a bowl. That you can’t go to a movie with a friend who slurps their drink too loud.Even though I’ve written about misophonia, I still find it hard to talk about in real life. I find it hard to admit to a new friend and I find it very difficult to ask anyone to adjust their normal behaviours for me. I don’t want to be a nuisance, or burden them. I’d rather put myself through the unpleasantness than ask them to change. But to feel able to ask for these things is a huge relief.Misophonia has clearly been with me forever, but as an adult I’ve also had the fun addition of some new mental health struggles. I have had a couple of depressive episodes in recent years, one right now as it happens (yes I am a hero), which is another thing I have found it very difficult to talk to people about. I still find it hard to be depressed around other people, even those who love me and will take my company in whatever state it’s in. I am on a slow journey with it, but I have found that being open about my mental health with people – employers, colleagues, housemates, etc – has only been helpful.Ordinary noises fill me with rage – then I got a neighbour so loud they can only be a fancy horse | Rebecca ShawRead moreMisophonia feels like a different thing, but it’s still related to my mental health – they sort of egg each other on. I am also on the slow journey with talking about it. I want to be more open about it – for most of my life I have gritted my teeth and blocked my ears, only letting the closest people in my life into my unusual reality.It’s something that has heavily affected my day-to-day and I have been too embarrassed to tell most people about it. But alongside society’s growing awareness around neurodiversity and mental illness, I am getting better at knowing it is OK to ask people for adjustments to their behaviour, or more care, or a different way of doing things, if it will help.Whether it’s depression or misophonia, having it taken seriously by other people is so important. So I am here to start the conversation. I am willing to become the face of misophonia. The face is scrunched up angrily at the sound of someone stirring their tea, but it’s out there.In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14 and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

Last week, in a troubling sign of escalating repression, Salvadorian policedetained Ruth López Alfaro, a prominent Salvadorian human rights lawyer atCristosal, an organization fighting for human rights in Central America.Last year, theBBC recognizedLópez Alfaro as one of the 100 most inspiring and influential women in the world, describing her as “an outspoken critic of the country’s government and institutions” who “conducted a broad social media campaign to promote political transparency and public accountability overseen by the citizens themselves”. This year, on 18 May, Salvadorian security forces detained her at her residence on embezzlement charges and held her incommunicado from her family and legal representativesfor more than 40 hours. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rightshas expressed “deep concern”over reports of her enforced disappearance, and numerous human rights organizations havecalled for her releaseand protection of her safety and due process rights.López Alfaro’s detention comes at the crest of a repressive wave sweeping the country over the past month. In the week immediately preceding her arrest, 14bus company owners were detainedfor allegedly disobeying Bukele’s order on X that bus service be free for a week in response to the chaos caused by the collapse of one of the president’s signature public works projects. The crackdown continued when the military policebroke up a peaceful demonstrationnear the president’s private residence by members of an agricultural cooperative called “el Bosque” pleading for his help to protect their homes and land against an eviction notice.Several people were arrested, including an evangelical pastor, Jose Perez, and the next day, the group’s lawyer, Alejandro Henriquez. (Earlier this year, Henriquez hadfiled a case with López Alfaro before the Salvadorian supreme courtchallenging the Bukele regime’s repeal of a seven-year ban on gold mining in El Salvador, despite the repeal’s risk of causing severe environmental damage.)Two days after López Alfaro’s detention, El Salvador’s legislature, controlled by Bukele’s New Ideas party,passed a Russian-style “foreign agent” lawrequiring anyone who receives foreign funding to register with the government and pay a 30% tax on such funding or else face sanctions. Bukele had previously announced the legislation as a reprisal for civil society organizations’ support of el Bosque’s pleas to keep their land. The law, which aims to crush independent journalism and civil society organizations that have constituted the last remaining vestiges of democracy in El Salvador, wasenacted in an hour and 24 minuteswithout debate by Bukele’s legislature.This campaign of repression has been bolstered by Trump’s agreement to pay Bukele millions of dollars to confine up to 300 US deportees – mostly Venezuelans – in El Salvador’s maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot). (López Alfaro was leading the legal team supporting families of the Venezuelan detainees to document their cases and present habeas corpus claims to the Salvadorian courts.)The United States does not lack detention facilities to hold immigration detainees. But Bukele’s detention facilities offer a zone unconstrained by US court orders, the rule of law or even the most basic of human rights protections. These are powers Bukele has accumulated at alarming speed, by dismantling institutional checks, purging courts, eviscerating due process protections and weaponizing pretrial detention.In May 2021, Bukele’s party used its legislative super-majority tofire all five justices of the constitutional chamber of the supreme courtas well as the attorney general, thereby dismantling constraints on his power. Then, using the same fast-track procedure, alegislative decree forcedevery judge older than 60 or with more than 30 years’ service – about a third of the bench – into retirement. Later that year, the reconstituted constitutional chamber foundBukele eligible for re-electiondespite seven articles in the Salvadorian constitution that clearly prohibit presidential re-election.The following year, El Salvador’s Congress imposed a state of exception to counter gang violence. The state of exception suspended constitutional due process rights and granted extraordinary powers to security forces to detain citizens at their discretion. Although it was initially introduced for 30 days, it has continuously been renewed and remains in place.While the murder rate did fall significantly, the human rights violations caused by the state of exception have been staggering. Since March of 2022, more than 85,500 people have beenarbitrarily detained in mass round-ups, leading to thehighest incarceration rate in the world. Torture and abuse of prisoners is rampant, and have led, according to Cristosal’s investigations, to the deaths of 387 people – including four infants – in custody.Many prisoners have been held for years without trial and without their families even knowing whether they are alive. A 2023 procedural overhaul allows unnamed “faceless judges” to conductmass trials of up to 900 defendantsat a time – a clear violation of their right to a defense and the presumption of innocence. Many of these lawless procedures are now being used to persecute López Alfaro and others who have stood up to the Bukele regime.The agreement between the US and El Salvador is not only itself unlawful; it enables and rewards lawlessness. It violates the US’s obligation to ensure due process and to comply with its “non-refoulement” obligation that prohibits sending any person to a place where there is a substantial risk of torture and/or cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment.The agreement also appears to aid Bukele’s cover-up of a secret deal he allegedly struck with the MS-13 gang to boost his popularity at home. A 2022US justice department indictment of MS-13 gang membersdescribes in detail how Bukele agreed to protect the gang in exchange for it engaging in fewer public murders and supporting his party during the 2021 legislative elections. US deportations of MS-13 gang leaders facing criminal prosecution in the US was reportedlya priority for Bukele, apparently to prevent them from disclosing details of thatsecret dealin US courts. Bukele has denied the deal, but seems intent on suppressing the facts. Several journalists from the leading independent news outlet el Faro were forced to flee the country after learning that his regime was preparing to arrest them for publishing interviews with MS-13 gang members describing the deal.Trump and Bukele peddle a brand of punitive populism that offers security at the expense of democracy and human rights – a seductive promise for electorates anxious about public safety. But this false bargain serves as a pretext to expand their own power, exploit public office and diplomacy for personal gain, and institutionalize cruelty in public policy.The people of the United States and El Salvador deserve better. The lawless collaboration that led to the disappearance of hundreds of men – transferred from the US without due process into indefinite detention at Bukele’s Cecot – has forged a common cause. It unites Americans who fear the loss of their democracy with Salvadorians like Ruth López Alfaro and countless others who have already lost their freedom to autocracy. The futures of democracy in both nations are now inextricably linked through the mutually reinforcing tyranny of their leaders.Noah Bullock is the executive director of Cristosal, a human rights organization based in El Salvador.

The failure to build enough homes to keep up with need, and replace those sold off under the right-to-buy scheme, has adversely affected millions of lives. In parts of England, the wait for family-size homeshas reached 100 years, with long waiting lists also in Scotland and Wales. Charities rightly call this a national scandal.While the slowdown dates back decades, the 60% cut in the affordable housing budget in 2010 made the situation far worse. The resulting shortages mean millions of people are stuck in privately rented accommodation with no prospect of buying their own. Hundreds of thousands of others areofficially homeless, and trapped in overcrowded temporary flats and rooms.But another problem has now crept up on this one. With complaints from tenants about repairs soaring, the social housing sector is increasingly failing people with homes as well as those without them. The housing ombudsman for England, Richard Blakeway, warned this week that “simmering anger” about substandard living conditions, includingmouldand damp, could boil over.This is a crucial moment for housing campaigners and concerned professionals such as Mr Blakeway. In less than two weeks, the chancellor’s spending review will set out how much money the government will commit to spend on housing between now and 2029. The£2bn announcedso far is regarded as a downpayment, enough for 18,000 homes. Billions more will be needed if affordable homes are to be a substantial portion of the government’s 1.5m target. Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, is widelyunderstood to be dissatisfiedwith the Treasury’s offer so far.She is right to insist that social housing is prioritised. This means capital budgets, but also funding for temporary accommodation, repairs and improvements, including those that reduce emissions and bills. For too long, social housing failures have been dismissed as second-tier concerns, largely because the tenure is for people on lower incomes.British homeowners and landlords have reaped huge advantages in recent years on the back of rising prices. Therenters’ rights billbegan a process of rebalancing housing policy towards those without property assets. Now ministers must go further and show that they recognise access to affordable housing as a fundamental entitlement.Other changes besides budget increases are already in progress. Social tenants should soon see the benefit of rules making housing associations more professional and accountable. Specialist qualifications will be rolled out, and providers will for the first time be subject to freedom of information laws. From October,Awaab’s law– primarily focused on England – imposes a 24-hour deadline for emergency repairs. Longer-term rent settlements will help housing providers, which do not all deserve to be painted as villains. There have been grave failures, none more appalling than the fire atGrenfell Towerin London, but many of the problems are systemic rather than the fault of particular people or organisations.Again and again, polls show how highlyhealthcare is valued by voters. But housing and health are closely connected. When the government announces its spending plans, it should spell this out to voters. Ensuring that everyone has a safe, suitable and affordable home is a crucial step on the road to national recovery.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So must CongressEditorialThe worst of all outcomes would be for US legislators to agree to strengthen the president’s executive powersThu 29 May 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 14.44 EDTShareIf one thing is more challenging to the rule of law than a genuine emergency, it is the invention of a phoney one. Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has upended global trade and international relations, wiping billions off the stock market in the process, by imposingtariffsthat he claims are a necessary response to an emergency. Yet that emergency does not really exist, except in the manner that Mr Trump himself has created it.The president claimed,on 2 April, that a lack of reciprocity in US overseas trade arrangements was “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States”. He claimed that this justified him in declaring an emergency and governing by executive decree under the 1977International Emergency Economic Powers Act(IEEPA). Congress, which normally has the responsibility to decide US trade policy, was thus wholly ignored. Statutory consultative arrangements, traditionally an essential preliminary, went out of the window too. Mr Trump was effectively exercising an executive power grab.Now, afterthis week’s rulingby a US federal trade court, most of Mr Trump’s tariffs have been blocked. In a case brought by a coalition of businesses and US states, the court of international tradefoundthat most of the tariffs “exceed any authority granted” to the president under the 1977 law. The White House will appeal. Meanwhile, trade talks aimed at creating so-called deals between the US and nation-state victims of the Trump policies are likely to be paused, while existing deals, including thatwith the UK, may be affected too.There will be a worldwide sense of relief for as long as it lasts. But the higher courts now face an important political responsibility as well as a judicial one. The ruling has left nations and businesses hanging. Some tariffs will remain, such as those on steel, aluminium and cars. Many others are suspended.Marketshate uncertainty.The issues at stake are very large. They are immediate, because the ruling suspends many but not all tariffs, and also strategic, because it challenges Mr Trump’s wide-ranging attempts to rule by executive order. Both are extremely important. Global trade and economic recovery, in Britain among many other countries, rest on the outcome. But so does Mr Trump’s strategy, which dates back to his first term, of using IEEPA powers to rule by decree, not merely on trade issues but, for example, in sanctioning officials from theinternational criminal court.The good news is that the president’s plans to impose tariffs on almost every country on the planet will now be subjected to something approaching the legal and constitutional scrutiny that they should have had in the first place. The rule of law, thankfully, has struck back, at least for now.The bad news is that Congress still shows no sign of reining Mr Trump in, as it should. Ironically, the IEEPA was originally a Jimmy Carter-era legislative attempt to boost congressional oversight of presidential emergency powers. Under Mr Trump, that role has been trashed. The worst of all outcomes would be for Congress to now give Mr Trump the powers to which he has laid claim. That is a real danger. The best outcome would be for Congress to give the IEEPA a fresh set of teeth. These would ensure that emergency powers are properly defined and applied, and never again abused by this or any other overmighty president.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Photograph: Reuters/AlamySwitzerland is home to more than 370,000 nuclear bunkers – enough to shelter every member of the population. But if the worst should happen, would they actually work?ByJessi Jezewska StevensThu 29 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 00.19 EDTShareAt first, Zora Schelbert, the chief operating officer and tour guide at the Sonnenberg nuclear bunker in Lucerne,Switzerland, wasn’t sure whether the requests she was receiving were a joke. It was February 2022, and Russia had just dropped the first bombs over Kyiv. “People were asking me what kind of measures they should take, where they would have to go,” Schelbert said. She quickly realised they had confused the historical society she works for, Unterirdisch Überleben (Surviving Underground), for the local department of civil protection.To the alternating fascination, bewilderment and envy of its European neighbours, Switzerland, population nearly 9 million, has more bunkers per capita than anywhere else in the world – enough to guarantee shelter space to every single resident in the event of a crisis. (Sweden and Finland are a close second, covering all major cities.) The queries Schelbert was receiving came from frightened people trying to locate their assigned places. Today, however, the Sonnenberg bunker is mostly a museum. Originally built in 1971 to protect up to 20,000 people, it remained one of the largest nuclear shelters in the world until 2002, when its capacity was reduced to 2,000 to improve efficiency and reduce costs.“Of course I took my replies seriously,” Schelbert said, explaining how she redirected concerned parties toward the appropriate people. “But then more emails came in. And phone calls.”Faced with unrelenting Russian aggression and the simultaneous withdrawal of American military and diplomatic support, European countries across the continent are reinvesting in defence. Butcivilianprotection – non-military measures for civil defence, including the construction of nuclear and air raid bunkers – has also emerged as a fresh priority. In January, Norway reintroduced a cold war-eramandate to build air raid sheltersin all newly constructed residential buildings – a requirement Switzerland has upheld continuously since 1963. In Germany, which recently passed groundbreaking legislation tofinance billions in new military spending, the question of how and whether to build civilian bunkers is once again a matter ofactive public debate. Partly inspired by efforts in Germany and Norway,in March of this year, the European Union issued official statements urging residents to keep an emergency stockpile containing 72 hours’ worth of supplies on hand at all times. The exposure to war and human-made disaster feels more acute than it has since any other time since the end of the cold war.In Switzerland, the redoubled interest in civilian protection is more a bellwether for shifting public attitudes than a sign of an actual change in policy. Before 2022, “the shelters were seen by a big part of the population and even some politicians as unnecessary”, said Daniel Jordi, Switzerland’s federal director of civil protection and training. “And this definitely changed.” Silvia Berger, professor of Swiss and contemporary history at the University of Bern and a leading expert on the cultural history of bunkers, confirmed that Russia’s invasion ofUkrainehas deeply affected public perceptions of civil protection: “We’re in the middle of a transformation” of public attitudes “that is not yet finished,” she told me.Switzerland’s policy to provide shelter to every single resident in the event of a crisis was first enshrined into law more than 60 years ago. Every new residential building must either include an on-site bunker, or else developers are required to earmark funds for a nearby public one maintained by the state. As a result, Switzerland is now host to 370,000 bunkers designed to protect civilians underground for anywhere from a few hours to two weeks. Ventilation systems have a shelf life of about 40 years, and neutralise the effects of radiation, nuclear fallout and chemical and biological weapons.The maintenance and construction cost per person, borne largely by developers and property owners, is comparable to annual premiums for Swiss health insurance. Historically, the price per spot is about 1,400 Swiss francs in bunkers with a capacity of 50 to 200, or about 3,000 Swiss francs for smaller ones. In peacetime, most Swiss use them as wine cellars, storage facilities or saunas. In the 1990s, as cold war tensions relaxed, bunkers even played host to paintball and band practice, or served as community centres.View image in fullscreenA bunker in Andermatt, Switzerland.Photograph: Kecko/FlickrA second type of bunker – command posts for civil protection and emergency personnel who manage operations – is designed for longer stays, and is equipped with showers, kitchenettes and internet access. In recent years, these command centres have been used,not without controversy, as overflow housing for refugees, asylum seekers and the homeless.“This is what we wanted,” Jordi said of the bunkers’ extracurricular uses, “a system which is normally used, but when it comes to the worst, you can rather quickly change it into a protected room.” Current regulations require bunkers to be crisis-ready in less than five days. Of the notice period, Jordi said: “War does not happen tomorrow without any introduction.”My own apartment block in Geneva, where I live, is outfitted with a typical residential bunker, though I didn’t know it was operational until Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when the public mood shifted. I heard about friends of friends packing suitcases and stocking up on iodine. (At the cantonal level, Swiss civil protection units are responsible for stocking enough iodine for the entire population at all times to counteract exposure to radiation.) I learned the expression “Chornobyl baby”, an idiom equivalent in meaning to the anglophone: “Your mother must have dropped you on your head.” I went to the basement of my own building, home to more than 100 families, to visit our on-site nuclear shelter, now divided with raw wooden barriers into 10 separatecaves, or storage spaces. A painted green door of reinforced concrete, a foot thick (and always propped open), seals hermetically with the help of a heavy mechanism. There’s a drain in the middle of the floor. My neighbours’cavesare filled with skiing equipment and old cookware. Ours holds suitcases and American electronics not compatible with European voltage, nor likely to be of much use in the event of a nuclear attack. If our lives depended on it, I estimate we could clear it out in a few hours or less.The entrance to the Sonnenberg bunker is a brisk 15-minute walk from the Lucerne central train station. I arrived on a drizzling Sunday morning and walked along the glacial lake, past tourists balancing heavy, panoramic camera lenses, through the cobblestone streets of the historic city centre and to the hills that rise above it, until I reached a playground made lush by heavy recent rains. A cement ramp led along the far end of the park, just beyond the swings, to a set of heavy grey doors set in the hillside. If you weren’t already looking for the entrance to a nuclear bunker, you could easily mistake it for some far more mundane piece of municipal infrastructure, like a water treatment plant.About 20 of us gathered for a public tour of Sonnenberg organised byUnterirdisch Überleben. Aside from Schelbert, our guide, only five of us were women. A father, here with his 13-year-old son, joked that interest in nuclear bunkers appears to be decidedly male-coded; his son insisted on a visit after his younger brother came home raving about a school field trip to the facility a few weeks earlier. The family lives in a prewar home in central Lucerne, which means they have no on-site bunker in the basement. The father admitted he had no idea to which public shelter they’ve been allocated. “We’re more of a music family,” he said by way of justification.In addition to the father and son, there were two tourists from London; an Austrian family of four who were drawn to the bunker after seeing a TV documentary; a rowdy group of young friends on a Sunday lark; a middle-aged couple from the nearby town of Aarau; and two attentive Swiss thirtysomethings in hiking boots. We were joined at the last minute by a young Norwegian woman and her elderly father. As we headed in, our most committed member, another Swiss man with an expensive-looking camera, volunteered to act as caboose; he lingered behind to take photos.What we were visiting was not the Sonnenberg bunker itself, but rather the former command centre – the seven-storey, subterranean concrete block where emergency squads were meant to implement the technical and logistical operations that sheltering 20,000 people underground entails. The original civilian “bunker”, in fact, was no less than the four lanes of traffic whizzing below our feet: an underground highway. The Sonnenberg Tunnel was conceived in the 1970s to ease traffic flow through mountainous central Switzerland, but when construction coincided with national efforts to bolster civil protection, the twin throughways were reinforced to serve a second purpose as emergency shelter space. In the event of a nuclear attack, traffic would halt, and instead civilians would stream in, sealing off the tunnel entrances with the aid of four concrete doors 1.5 metres thick and capable of withstanding a nuclear detonation just half a mile away. The command centre overhead stocked a whole town’s worth (450 tonnes) of equipment – including bunk beds, dry toilets, water and other supplies – ready to be mobilised into the tunnels below by way of dolly carts.It’s a tall order to erect a small city overnight. While today’s bunkers are ready for emergency use within five days, and often less, the timeline for Sonnenberg was two weeks. In the one and only trial run, conducted in 1987, emergency squads managed to erect only a fraction of the necessary infrastructure. They were also unable to close one of the four, 350-tonne concrete doors; left ajar, it is unlikely to have been much protection against a nuclear bomb dropped at any distance. The failure fed suspicions over the feasibility of maintaining Sonnenberg at scale, culminating in the local government’s decision to reduce capacity. Still, it remains an exception: most shelters in Switzerland house anywhere from a single family up to 200 people.View image in fullscreenAn officer of the Swiss civil defence closes the door of a private concrete nuclear shelter in the city of Meyrin near Geneva, March 2022.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesNor does your typical civilian bunker double as a semi-permanent museum, as Sonnenberg does today. Exhibitions preserving original equipment complement the tour, giving visitors a sense of what life might have been like within the command centre during the cold war. The LED strip lighting, exposed pipes and spotless concrete hallways gave the impression of a brutalist prison. We moved from floor to floor via sloping ramps originally designed to accommodate carts for delivering supplies into the tunnels below. The kitchen was a row of glistening steel vats, domed tops raised like hood dryers at hair salons, set with ladles the size of human heads. A gallon-sized food tin was labelled, unpromisingly, “Überlebensnahrung” (“survival food”). The kitchen and its canned menu were intended for the command staff only; even today, civilians are required to bring their own nonperishables underground.The original command centre was also outfitted with a hospital; the pre-op room contains the only shower in the entire facility. There were tall stacks of dry toilets – glorified grey plastic buckets – of the kind still allocated to shelters today, which protect against the spread of faeces-borne disease, emergency water tanks and internal phone lines to facilitate communication between departments and floors. There were no windows. The analogue clocks on the walls included a little red bulb to indicate whether it was day or night above ground.Is it worth it? In the surgery, the Norwegian man in his mid-70s, visiting with his daughter, shared that he doesn’t put much stock in the idea that nuclear war is survivable. He reasoned that “if the Swiss go underground for two weeks, when they come back out, still they won’t be able to live”. He added wryly that “the greatest protection the Swiss have is money”. Certainly, it’s no accident that Switzerland, with thesixth highest GDPper capita in the world, and his native Norway,with the ninth, have historically boasted some of the world’s strongest civilian protection programmes.In truth, the efficacy of the bunkers depends on the type and scale of the crisis. The worst of the fallout from an atom bomb typically dissipates within days or weeks, conceivably within the intended length of stay, and when reducing radiation exposure is life-saving. A meltdown at a nuclear plant the scale of Chornobyl, by contrast, can render the surrounding area uninhabitable for centuries.The Austrian family also expressed doubts about surviving a worst-case scenario. They pointed out that while Vienna was even closer to the iron curtain during the cold war, with the Hungarian and then Czechoslovakian borders only an hour away, no comparable infrastructure was built, nor do they wish Austria had followed Switzerland’s path. The family consensus was that there are “better things to spend money on”, and that “diplomacy is more effective”.Scepticism comes easily to life underground. How will large groups of strangers in great psychological duress cooperate for days in cramped concrete cells? (One early recommendation from the 70s – to channel rivalrous or aggressive impulses into card and board games – seems less than foolproof.) What about commuters far from their allocated spaces when crisis strikes? Can hospital patients and elderly people be efficiently ferried to the bunkers that have been built specially for them? And while ventilation systems will protect civilians from radiation, nuclear fallout or chemical weapons – invisible dangers that simply hiding deep in the London underground system, say, would fail to counteract – no bunker can withstand a direct hit from a nuclear bomb.Nevertheless, the Swiss attachment to universal civil protection remains notable, and the reasons behind it go deeper than finances alone. Bunkers are simply “an integral part of Swiss identity”, argued Guillaume Vergain, deputy head of service for civil protection and military affairs for the canton of Geneva, and whose job it is to make sure shelters are built to code and at capacity within his jurisdiction. “It’s in our DNA.”That DNA is inherited directly from the second world war, when bunkers were already an established part of Swiss military strategy. In the early 40s, when neutral Switzerland was entirely surrounded by Axis powers, the army stocked the Swiss Réduit (“National Redoubt”), a series of military fortifications in the central Alps dating to the 1880s, with supplies and ammunition to prepare for a potential Nazi invasion. The rate of civilian casualties in air raids elsewhere across Europe, however, proved the need for an equivalent civilian protection programme.View image in fullscreenA Swiss army provisions warehouse in a nuclear bunker, circa 2000.Photograph: Dino Fracchia/AlamyThe nuclear arms race during the cold war made civilian protection programmes all the more urgent. The result, historian Silvia Berger said, was a new mentality of “total national defence”, including the ideological defence of “core values of Switzerland”, such as federalism, independence, participatory democracy and political neutrality, ideals positioned in contrast to Soviet authoritarianism.Other cultural factors made bunkers a logical strategy. Compared to the United States, Berger added, where during the cold war going underground could be viewed scornfully as weak or culturally “un-American”, in Swiss military history, the mountains and the subterranean were always seen as a “safe space”.To expand access to civilian bunkers, however, the government first had to sell the public on the extraordinary effort; in 1945, only about 30% of the Swiss population had access to a shelter. Early propaganda videos and cartoons from the 1950s and 1960s featured theMurmeltier, or marmot, drawn or filmed at peace among alpine wildflowers – then quickly ducking into its hovel at the sight of an eagle or other threat passing overhead. A later video dating to the 1960s, shown on the Sonnenberg tour, features mountain vistas, couples dancing at the disco and nuclear families sharing a peaceful meal around a red checkered tablecloth. A voiceover acknowledges that while war and crisis may seem “far away” and confined “to the TV”, and that while it may seem as if the worst that could fall from Swiss skies is a “flowerpot” from someone’s window box, the threat of war is in fact all too real.Early implementation of the 1963 policy to build shelters in new buildings was met with little protest; rare critics could be cast as Russian sympathisers or communists. With the rise of the peace movements in the 70s and 80s, however, more people began to question whether nuclear bunkers were necessary – or practical. One of the most enduring criticisms is whether bunkers in fact enable nuclear war: what’s to stop countries from using the nuclear option if it is, in fact, survivable? In the late 80s, sudden, human-made disasters like the meltdown of the Chornobyl nuclear facility in Ukraine in 1986, or the major chemical spill at the Sandoz pharmaceutical plant outside Basel that same year, made bunkers seem even more suspect and obsolete, shifting the focus of civil protection from war to disaster preparedness.Along with Finland, Switzerland is also a top exporter of bunker design and knowhow, providing plans, construction materials and other expertise that can expose firms to geopolitically motivated critiques. In 2003, at the start of the Iraq war, the Swiss firm Zellweger Luwa, which produces ventilation systems, came under fire for having taken on Saddam Hussein as a client in the 80s.View image in fullscreenVisitors in the Sonnenberg nuclear bunker tunnels.Photograph: Verein Unterirdisch UeberlebenThe debate has continued to wax and wane according to the public perception of the threats. In 2011, just before a tsunami engulfed the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, the Swiss parliament had discussed discontinuing the 1963 shelter mandate. After the Fukushima meltdown, however, the existing policy was continued.The horrors in Ukraine and Gaza have had a similar effect on public opinion. Schelbert, the guide, has noticed that today visitors to Sonnenberg, once sceptical of the value of maintaining bunkers in a land as peaceful and insulated from crisis as Switzerland, are now more likely to see them as a “privilege”, even a luxury. Public messaging accords with this new attitude. Today, official communications focus on promoting Switzerland’s “culture of preparedness” – and remind the Swiss public that while spending money on shelters is unpopular during peacetime, continual maintenance is essential for readiness in the event of war.In a small cell crammed with civilian sleeper bunks meant to model how closely packed people would have been in a shelter like Sonnenberg, I ducked into a lower berth. It was as comfortable as a hammock, and more comfortable than a couchette on a night train. It was made from green mesh slung across metal supports and came complete with a pillow and thick wool blanket. Schelbert urged us to imagine this same space overwhelmed with screaming, crying, terrified people with no more than 1 sq metre to call their own. I closed my eyes. I couldn’t.The entire time I was underground, it was impossible to shake off a latent sense of the absurd. The planning was exceptional, the engineering impressive; Swiss civil protection services thought of everything. But to house an entire nation underground for even a few days is akin to trying to colonise the moon. There are so many unknowns that even the most brilliant and thorough plans can easily fail. As, in the case of the Sonnenberg trial run in 1987, they did.A new nuclear arms race is beginning. It will be far more dangerous than the last oneRead moreExiting back into the sunlight, it was hard not to feel, therefore, that deterrence, diplomacy and nonproliferation are more urgent than ever. Yet supporters of diplomacy are now fighting a losing battle, especially along the transatlantic axis. When I mentioned that I’m American, one person pulled up screenshots, shown on the local news, of the invasive letters Elon Musk’s Doge initiative had sent to European universities that have received American grants or funding, with profound ripple effects for researchers in Switzerland and elsewhere. When two visitors avoided speaking to me, I wondered, for a fleeting moment, whether it had been a mistake to mention that I’m an “amerikanischeJournalistin”. Then I reminded myself that’s just the paranoia talking – the slow creep of a nationalist strain of thought that conflates individuals with their passports, and which I’d rather resist.If there was one impression that the Swiss civil protection system leaves, it’s that impulsiveness is no way to deal with a crisis, and that the very best civilian protection programme is one whose bunkers need never be used. The opposite tack translates to a world ruled by belligerence, unpredictability and close calls – a world of “America first”, where diplomacy is reduced to an outrageous race to press the red button before your enemy can.An earlier version of this piece appeared inthe DialListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readNuclear weaponsSwitzerlandEuropeUkraineRussiaChornobyl nuclear disasterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s a wrap. At first glance it might be tempting to see the 2025Champions Leaguefinal as one of the more obviously high-European occasions in recent football history.Twenty thousand Parisians and Milanese will trace out a thousand mile right-angle this weekend, north from Lombardy, east across Alsace and the Rhineland, there to spend a long weekend wandering the white stone streets of Munich, with its reassuringly terrifying gothic cathedral, its pounded-meatcuisine de terroir, itsaltstadtboutiques selling wristwatches priced at roughly the same the cost as the average human arm, and finally on to the lighted dome of the Allianz Arena, dumped down in the green fringes to the north like a giant alien doughnut.For the first time in five years there isn’t a single English person involved asParis Saint-Germainand Inter meet in the capital of Bavaria. Premier League, Club World Cup. Look upon our Euro splendour and tremble. This is heartlands stuff, a moment of pure Schengen-ball.A different kind of Champions League final is something to be cherished | Philipp LahmRead moreExcept, of course, it is something else entirely too, an opportunity to complete a brilliantly enacted subversion of that old order from within.PSG have been the best team in Europe this year. In Munich they will kick off as favourites to take the trophy to France for the first time since 1993. But victory would also represent something much more significant, the moment Qatar basically completes football – and in a way that feels far less brittle, far more permanently entrenched than might have seemed possible a few years ago.Every drama needs a ticking clock. This one came bonging into existence in November 2010 with the staging of the most iconic lunch in modern football history. Summoned to the French president’s Élysée Palace by Nicolas Sarkozy (thepre ankle-tagversion), Uefa’s Michel Platini found a surprise guest at the table. This was Tamim al-Thani, crown prince of Qatar and a footballing nobody at this point, but the same Thani who would, as the emir, hand the World Cup to Lionel Messi in Qatar 12 years later.It is important to state that Platini denies this interaction had any bearing on his vote, 11 days later, for the 2022 World Cup hosts. Sarkozy has also denied influencing or even appearing to influence the Uefa president’s choice.Qatar did gain the decisive Platini backing all the same. Coincidentally, Qatar’s state broadcaster almost immediately bought up the unsold TV rights to Ligue 1. In another unrelated act, six months later Qatar Sports Investments bought PSG, who were at that time in financial difficulties. A year later France sold 50 Airbus planes to Qatar Airways, a key step in a process that has led, 15 years on, to Qatar standing elbows-deep in French infrastructure funding.Fast forward to Saturday and the emir may well be present again as the jewel in his sporting outreach arm completes a key stage towards overhauling Real Madrid as the most commercially successful club in the world. Make no mistake, this will be a coronation even in defeat. We all wear thebishtnow.View image in fullscreenTamim al-Thani puts a bisht on Lionel Messi after Argentina’s World Cup triumph in Qatar in 2022.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt is worth being clear on how that final phase has played out, a wonderful example of football’s instant amnesia. Until six months ago PSG were still struggling to free themselves from the idea that this was some kind of debauched celebrity waxwork museum, defined by a mental image of Neymar breakdancing on crutches at his own gala birthday party dressed only in a chinchilla fur thong and solid gold bowler hat, before driving off into the night in a special car made entirely from cheese.Fast forward through one tactical rejig and a key jettisoning of stars and the talk in France is of how this team has “seduced the French people” with its youth and verve, transformed now into a kind of kitten collective, not just the good guys, but the best guys. This is the new PSG. Soulfulness, graft, sweat, doing woodwork in a shed. It turns out humility might actually be a good way to win after all. So we will buy the greatest humility available to mankind. Kneel before our self-effacing collectivism.There was always a gulf between the keep-ball style of successive PSG coaches and the desire to stack the squad with strolling superstars. So the new sense of grit is present in the tactical patterns too, a team that take to the pitch wound up into a kind of tackle fever, whose superpower is not being more famous than you, but counterpress and rapid team transitions. It is a brilliantly drilled, brilliantly obedient group, like watching a kind of cubism-ball in action, a world of rigorous geometric patterns,nature morte, all squares, angles, order, clean lines.The basic material here is young, high quality and ego-free. So instead of Neymar we have the anti-Neymar Désiré Doué, acme of the orderly modern prodigy, a football obsessive who takes timed daytime naps to improve his energies. The midfield is defined by Vitinha, who loves the ball and nothing else, who looks as though the only time he would cancel training is when he wants to do even more training, triple training (he will also do your training first, and at twice the speed).View image in fullscreenPSG’s all-action Vitinha tackles Arsenal’s Kai Havertz during a Champions League group game in October.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut it would also be entirely wrong at this point to imagine the current success springs from the rejection of the superstar era. In fact the opposite is true. One hand washes the other. All parts are connected. For all the occasional moments of on-field farce, it was the Neymar-Messi-Mbappé era that gave PSG the current fully realised team.All clubs like to talk about the Brand. Paris really, really like doing this, the current boilerplate boasts running to “a cultural icon … at the intersection of sport, fashion, and entertainment… a globally recognized lifestyle brand …The Club of the New Generation … shaping the future of sport and society.”The most astonishing part of this encomium is that it’s actually true. The Hollywood stuff, the bolt-on fame, the army of likes and follows: this wasn’t simply naivety or cash thrown into an empty pit. Qatar worked out early on that money buys you success, but it can also buy you the stuff everyone else’s success is based on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bought for €70m (£59m) in 2011, PSG is valued between €3.5bn and €4.2bn. The real killer is commercial revenues, once a third of Manchester United’s annual haul but now leaving them in the dust for the foreseeable future.There have been three phases. The first was the frontier age of blunt state sponsor-led investment. Reeling in Zlatan. Changing the logo (previously: club badge) to Paris, firing up the chain of loss-leading global boutiques. The Nike Jordan deal in 2018 was an act of marketing prescience, positioning PSG as NBA-adjacent, fashion runway-curious.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé (right) in his Nike Jordan-produced PSG kit after scoring against Liverpool.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAPhase two was 2017-2021 and the basking superstars team: no good at enforcing a high press, but hugely successful in ramping up the cashflow. Commercial deals have flooded in, high-end stuff rather than noodle partners by numbers. Matchday revenues are unexpectedly big, fruits of a one-big-club city that loves glitz and spectacle. That star project worked. The club are closer than ever to becoming an independent mega-brand. Messi may have hated being in Paris. But he gave a lot more than he might have realised.It obviously helps that none of this was ever really a gamble. For a club with bottomless owners of last resort there are no hard consequences to shedding a slew of duff star players. Manchester United may have spent years unable to pay off a bloated and sullen squad, but this is a lesson in the power of a truly nation-state owner. Slash and burn. Swallow the losses. You don’t have to be backed by one of the world’s largest gas producers to build a champion team without fear of the end cost. But it does help.As will the £300m spent on what is, again without bluster, “the best training centre in the world”, Campus PSG at Poissy, with its pristine acreages, its market garden, its chauffeurs’ ping-pong room, its hypoxic oxygen chamber, luxury living quarters and hairdressing salon, the panic room in case of terrorist attack.It helps also that the real genius of Qatar has been building power rather than simply working in its shadow. This month the club president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, was seen meeting Jeff Bezos at the Cannes film festival to work out a possible collaboration, the kind of thing that seems logical now for a man who is also president of BeIn Sports, a minister in the Qatari government, head of the European Club Association (ECA), a Uefa executive committee member and even an unexpected face at the recent Gaza peace talks at the Élysée Palace (not the kind of thing Ken Bates, for example, was ever likely to get an invite to).Now or never? Inter ready to seize moment in Champions League final | Nicky BandiniRead moreSome people are said to have a finger or two in the pie. Khelaifi has both fists jammed in there so deep it’s hard to know where the pie starts and finishes. Heisthe pie.It has been a nontypical rise for the son of a pearl fisherman, born outside power, but expert in the macro-hustle.Al-Khelaifiused the Super League chaos brilliantly, standing with Aleksander Ceferin just when European football needed someone with no fear of consequences. This led to his current role at the ECA, which has become the real power behind the power, and a key driver of the new Champions League. Yeah, don’t do the super league. Do this instead with me in charge.It is worth remembering as PSG present themselves in Munich as a vision of hopeful young talents beaming in sport-couture kit, that this is still nation-state power finding a way. It is also an entity that doesn’t need to say please any more.One notable absence from the club’s invited guests in Munich is the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, whose tenure has been bruised by the refusal to sell the publicly owned Parc des Princes to QSI. It feels like a fitting bookend to that formative lunch at the palace. We don’t actually need to sit with you now. We are the entire buffet these days. Win or lose on Saturday, that table is set.Explore more on these topicsParis Saint-GermainChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He found himself playing a few too many drop shots, bailing out of points instead of slamming the door shut. His first serve had vacated the premises.These things often happen in Gaël Monfils’ lair, Court Philippe-Chatrier, where his magnetic personality draws his home crowd into a frenzy and his singular style plays tricks with an opponent’s mind. Despite being pushed to his limits and standing on the verge of an uncertain fifth set, Draper gave another demonstration of his mental durability by finding his way through to the third round of theFrench Openwith a 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 win.Brits rise and fall at French Open as Boulter bows out and Norrie battles onRead more“No offence taken,” Draper told the crowd afterwards. “This is why I play tennis, to play in front of big crowds, whether they are with me or against me. That’s the entertainment of tennis, so this is why I play.”In the short time that Roland Garros has held night sessions, Monfils, 38, has become their most reliable headliner and over the years he has found himself embroiled in many battles on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Two nights earlier, Monfils had orchestrated another magical evening after recovering from two sets down to defeat Hugo Dellien. It remained to be seen how he would recover after such a tough match.Although Draper, the fifth seed, worked through a dominant opening set, dictating comfortably with his serve and forehand, it soon became clear that Monfils was up to the challenge. Every time Draper committed an error, the crowd tried to force itself into the conversation. Eventually, it had its way. First Draper began to lose control of his forehand, unforced errors piling up as Monfils’ defence made him to overplay. Then came some magic from Monfils, who had the ball on a string as he continually turned points around from impossible positions with his athleticism, hand skills and timing. He quickly levelled the match at one set all.As Monfils’ focus waned and Draper re-established his forehand dominance, it seemed for a while that the Briton would ease away. After closing out the third set, he generated four break points in Monfils’ opening service game of the fourth. Somehow, Monfils survived with a hold and then he put together a remarkable series of games, veering between drawing errors from Draper, chasing down every last ball and stepping inside the baseline to obliterate forehands. As Draper tried to figure Monfils out, he lost control.View image in fullscreenGaël Monfils left to a standing ovation from the crowd in what could turn out to be his last match at Roland Garros.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPA“My brain was fried out here,” said Draper. “I’m not sure if I’m gonna go to sleep tonight, my brain is just all over the place with what he’s doing out there. That’s why he’s had such a successful career. That’s why he is loved by all the fans. The players love to watch him play as well, but not to play against him.”Monfils established a 5-2 lead in the fourth set, and then he later generated double set point on Draper’s serve at 5-4. But every time he truly needed to, on the most important points of the match, Draper played focused attacking tennis and the 23-year-old was much fresher physically than his veteran opponent. Draper reeled off five consecutive games, closing out a victory that will only strengthen his rapidly growing self-belief.At the end of an unforgettable night at Roland Garros, the two players finished their tussle with a long hug and before Monfils departed, he enthusiastically encouraged his victorious opponent. After being subjected to the notorious French crowd’s scorn for more than three hours, Draper finally received their congratulations.“I think I have to acknowledge Gaël,” said Draper. “It is the first time on the court but what a battle, what an experience against someone I admire as a tennis player, but off the court the guy’s incredibly nice. Such a joker, he’s a magician. He does everything. Huge respect to him and I hope he is able to play here one more time again.”Another great challenge awaits Draper in round three as he will next face the 18-year-old Brazilian wonderkid João Fonseca, whom he beat on his way to the title in Indian Wells earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenJack DraperTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether Harry Brook’s captaincy can deliver silverware like Eoin Morgan’s transformative reign remains to be seen butthis 238-run mauling of West Indiesmade for a handy start.Not only did Brook’s men amass 400 for eight after being put in by Shai Hope but, for the first time in the format’s history, they did so without a centurion on the day. Instead it was a collective assault of the bowlers and the poor boundary riders, with four half-centuries and – in another first – every member of the top seven making at least 30.Brook was among those to tuck in, flaying 58 from 45 balls and clearing the rope three times – a statement innings that was later followed by five outfield catches to equal the ODI record held by Jonty Rhodes. But as has already been the case this season – albeit in his first appearance of the summer – Jacob Bethell also commanded some headlines.England beat West Indies by 238 runs in first men’s one-day cricket international – live reactionRead moreStraight back from the Indian Premier League, and having generateda fair bit of angstafter missing the Test match against Zimbabwe, the 21-year-old top-scored with a 53-ball 82 that had his home supporters in clover. Not that the Warwickshire faithful see Bethell too often these days, nor will they if his current trajectory is anything to go by.It was a calculated intervention. Bethell strode out with the score 221 for four at the start of the 32nd over and patiently chiselled out 19 runs from his first 26 balls. Then came the afterburners, with 63 ransacked from his next 27 that, along with 39 from Will Jacks in his new role at No 7, slammed the door shut on West Indies.Faced with a wall of runs as sheer as El Capitan, West Indies needed to get off to a flyer. Instead they were derailed by a slippery opening burst from Saqib Mahmood, who claimed three for 32, and three for Jamie Overton despite a finger injury. Bethell was in the action, too, his left-arm spin outfoxing Jewel Andrew as the tourists crumbled to 162 all out. Only a 10th-wicket thrash worth 39 prevented England’s biggest win by runs.“It was a pretty exceptional start from the boys – the tempo was spot on – and hopefully we can top that,” said Brook, his side having arrested a run of seven straight defeats. “This is a new era, we’re trying to forget about the past and take one game at a time.”On Bethell, who was named player of the match, Brook added: “He is a confident lad and does not need much more bigging up. We all know he is an exceptional player who is going to have a very long England career. He brings so much to a side.”Even robbed of 23 overs, the sell-out crowd had witnessed 562 runs, 18 wickets, and some pretty unreal fielding along the way. Roston Chase delivered two stellar catches but could only make the podium in this category, Brydon Carse pipping him in the reply with a full-stretch one-handed take on the rope a laBen Stokes in the 2019 World Cup.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook scored 58 from 45 balls for England at Edgbaston.Photograph: Nigel Parker/ShutterstockAs well as Ben Duckett continuing his impressive run at opener – the left-hander struck 60 from 48 and averages just shy of 51 in ODI cricket – there was an early look at Jamie Smith up top. England fancy these two can strike up a similar little-and-large partnership to one Duckett enjoys with Zak Crawley in Test cricket and a quickfire 37 from Smith, in an opening stand of 64 from just seven overs, provided some supporting evidence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But after Smith smashed one hard to Brandon King at mid-wicket, the master was content to cruise his way to 57 from 65 balls. An outswinger from Jayden Seales eventually found his edge amid what it is fair to say were mixed-bag figures of four for 84 from nine overs.The day looked ripe for Brook. After an early sighter – something he later stressed he wants his players to note – his bat was suddenly glowing. A charged six off Justin Greaves signalled his intent, followed by a tumbling swept six that was pure innovation. Even the cut shot he got out to – caught at deep point off Seales – was utterly marmalised.Jos Buttler’s first outing back in the ranks briefly crackled to the tune of 37 from 32 balls but the impetus came from Bethell and Jacks – his first 50-over knock at No 7 – adding 98 in just seven overs.Bethell brought out the swivel pull to devastating effect here but a feathered edge behind in the final over saw the wait for that first senior century roll on.But then this has been the Bethell way to date: the promise of what is to come. Brook, beaming after a winning start to the job, and pretty chuffed about the Rhodes record, will be hoping the same goes for his side England at large.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamHarry Brookmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But there have always been breakthrough moments that have opened the door for a bigger future and asLuke Humphrieslifted the Premier League Darts trophy aloft inside a sold-out O2, it was not unreasonable to assume where this game heads next.In the 1980s, it was Eric Bristow’s pomp and circumstance while dominating in the slightly more low-key venues of Stoke’s Jollees Cabaret Club and the Lakeside. Then it was Phil Taylor who dominated the PDC’s formative years and, yes, while he had the odd rival along the way, it is a fair argument that the 16-time world champion single-handedly broke down barriers for the sport.But any good sport thrives on elite rivalries. Federer versus Nadal. Frazier versus Ali. Darts’ newest boom has undoubtedly been supercharged by the arrival ofLuke Littlerbut it takes two players to make a great rivalry and goodness, Littler and Humphries underlined how they are the dominant pair in this sport by some distance.In the end, it was Humphries, who became only the fourth man in history after Taylor, Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson to win darts’ triple crown of the world title, the World Matchplay and the Premier League, who would claim the £275,000 cheque and the title.But what makes this rivalry special is that it is so unpredictable. This was their 23rd meeting – it is 13-10 in Littler’s favour – and in barely 18 months they have contested two world finals and won one each, and now met in the last two Premier League finals, withLittler winning last yearand Humphries here.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler takes aim as Luke Humphries walks away from the oche during the latest close match in their rivalry.Photograph: John Walton/PANeither were quite at their brilliant best in the semi-finals, Littler defeating Gerwyn Price before Humphries knocked out Nathan Aspinall, but it almost felt like an inevitability that the two Lukes would meet in the final here. Littler, who plays with such an assurance that you could almost imagine him playing Taylor in the smoke-filled Circus Tavern in the 90s, started magnificently.He went into a 3-0 lead but just as they do every time they meet, Humphries responded to level the scores before the pair went tit-for-tat for 15 engrossing minutes. Whoever blinked first would be struck a fatal blow given the quality this duo possess and here, it was Littler who did that. Humphries made no mistake to win 11-8.“That one means the world to me – it’s the one I was missing,” said Humphries, who has had Taylor in his corner in recent weeks offering him advice. “If I don’t win another title that’s fine because I’ve won the three hardest ones to win. He wasn’t at his best tonight and nor was I, but I managed to get one over on him. I’ll get these wins in early before he trounces everyone.”Humphries, despite all of the hype that engulfs Littler, brings the best out of his rival and that can only be good for the game. They will do this on many more occasions – and who knows how much the venues and the interest can grow with this pair driving it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I had a little moment when I lost there, but I’m fine,” Littler said afterwards. It has on occasions felt like a matter of when, not if, Littler usurps Humphries at the top of the rankings and becomes the world No 1. That wait may have to go on for a while yet, but this rivalry will keep delivering for years to come.Darts’ powerbrokers have struck gold not only with Littler, but with this epic pairing. These two will keep meeting in finals and keep sharing titles. The rest of the game has a long way to go to catch up: we can all sit back and enjoy it.Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke HumphriesLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

Ratcliffe has ­previously said hesaw United’s men’s teamas “the main issue” and “what moves the needle” at the club.He was not at WembleywhenManchester United lost to Chelseain the Women’s FA Cup final two weeks ago, nor whenthey won last year’s finalagainst Tottenham.Williamson ‘devastated’ by Earps’ England exit but Wiegman quiet on talksRead more“If I was a woman working in United and heard the language Ratcliffe uses, he’s sending a signal to me about what he thinks about women not just the women’s game,” she said. “I’m not sure people recognise how powerful that language is in a negative way. It’s so disappointing.”Simmons was speaking at the Fair Game conference in London, where financial sustainability and issues around equality and inclusion within football were discussed. Simmons oversaw the professionalisation of the Women’s Super League a decade ago and argued the further growth of women’s football was being stymied by a lack of investment at club level.“We are not there as a sustainable sport,” Simmons said, likening the current situation to that during the half-century when the Football Association banned women from playing the game in England between 1921 and 1970. “This is a second ban where clubs are treating the women’s teams as a community endeavour, not treating it as a startup, not investing in it.“Absolutely nothing is locked in for women’s football. We’re not in the conversation for funding flows. If you are going to scrutinise clubs to see that finances are robust, then you need to look at the women’s game because you know where the money is going to be cut from first; it’s the women’s team.”View image in fullscreenKelly Simmons, during her time at the FA.Photograph: The Fa/ShutterstockSimmons said there was growing interest from private equity groups in investing in the women’s game and that she welcomed the prospect. “A number of clubs in this country and on the continent and Europe are in discussions with private equity,” she said. “It will bring in a mindset of treating women’s football like a business and that is much needed.”While Ratcliffe was not present for the FA Cup final, where United lost 3-0 to Chelsea, the club did send a senior delegation that included co-chair Avram Glazer, as well as representatives from Ineos, Ratcliffe’s conglomerate. The United chief executive, Omar Berrada, meanwhile, has made public remarks saying the club are “very proud” of the women’s team and arguing: “It’s really incumbent on us to be there to help them.”Ratcliffe has also spoken of his desire to see the women’s team succeed. “The women’s team wear the Manchester United brand and the Manchester United logo, so in that sense they’re every bit as important as the men’s team and frankly they’re doing better than the men’s team,” he said.Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenJim RatcliffeWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s been amazing to work with, he’s a great guy, working so hard. We both are.“We don’t always get it right every weekend. Do we have disagreements? Like everyone does in relationships but we work through them. We’re both in it together. We both want to win a championship together. We’re both working towards lifting the team up.”Afterthe race in Monacothe Ferrari team principal, Fred Vasseur, similarly dismissed it as the pair learning to work with one another, combined with some radio issues specific to Monte Carlo.Hamilton finished fifth, well behind his teammate Charles Leclerc who was second. During the race there was some terse communication between the British driver and Adami, with Hamilton believing he was not receiving enough information from his race engineer about the gaps on track.It followed Hamilton’s ratherdismissive query to the team, suggesting they were having a tea break rather than making strategic decisions at the Miami round.Expectations were enormously high when Hamilton joinedFerraribut their car is not up to scratch and every aspect of his relationship with the team has come under scrutiny. He has been clear he expects himself and theScuderiato do better but was unequivocal his relationship with Adami was not an issue and the focus on it was an irrelevance.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton struggled with the pace at Monaco.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/Reuters“It’s just all noise and we don’t really pay any attention to it,” Hamilton said. “It can continue if you want but it doesn’t make any difference to the job that we’re trying to do.“Our relationship is great. And there are no problems. We are constantly learning more and more about each other and adapting the way we want to work. He has worked with lots of different drivers before.

Their strategy of targeting the best young talent in the world is starting to bear fruit and there is no desire to put undue pressure on Maresca or his maturing squad.Chelsea, who have given their squad 10 days off before focus switches to participating in the expanded Club World Cup next month, will try to be clinical in the transfer market this summer. Signing at least one new forward is the priority and the club have a provisional agreement with Delap, who has also been targeted by Everton, Manchester United and Newcastle.The 22-year-old favours a move to Chelsea after hearing their pitch. Delap wants to play in Europe and he already knows Maresca from his time in Manchester City’s academy. Ipswich have signalled a desire to take Marc Guiu on loan during their talks with Chelsea but the 19-year-old forward is yet to be convinced.It remains to be seen if the club restrict themselves to signing one forward. Bringing in two would raise questions over the future of Nicolas Jackson, who scored his side’s second goal against Betis. Chelsea are monitoring Hugo Ekitike but feel Eintracht Frankfurt’s £84m valuation is too steep.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson scores Chelsea’s second goal against Real Betis – but signing Liam Delap could cast doubts over his future.Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/ReutersThere is also admiration for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, who is on Arsenal’s radar, but he is much more expensive than Delap. Chelsea have held talks with their partner club, Strasbourg, over a pre-agreement for the Dutch striker Emanuel Emegha to join in 2026.Chelsea’s budget has been boosted by their qualification for the Champions League for the first time under Boehly and Clearlake, the private equity fund run by Behdad Eghbali and José E Feliciano. There is recognition that Maresca’s system thrives on width. Chelsea are seeking to add a right-footed left-winger to their squad. There are indications they will opt against taking up their £25m option to turn Jadon Sancho’s loan from Manchester United into a permanent deal.Chelsea will have to pay a £5m penalty clause if Sancho, who came off the bench to score against Betis, is sent back to Old Trafford. Maresca likes the former Borussia Dortmund winger but must consider whether the 25-year-old has been consistent enough. Chelsea have tracked Dortmund’s Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and are monitoring developments around Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams. It is felt that Williams, who is wanted by Arsenal and Real Madrid, could be too expensive. Madrid could move for the winger if they sell Rodrygo, who has interest from City.There is a possibility of Chelsea bolstering their defence. Ajax’s Jorrel Hato, who can operate as a left-back or in the middle, is on their shortlist. A consideration for Maresca is Wesley Fofana’s unreliable fitness record, while there is a possibility of Chelsea raising funds by selling Benoît Badiashile, Trevoh Chalobah and Axel Disasi. It is unclear if they will sign a new goalkeeper or keep faith with Robert Sánchez and Filip Jörgensen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Portuguese Dário Essugo, 20, will add cover in midfield. The Brazilian Willian Estêvão and Ecuador’s Kendry Páez, two of the best attacking talents in South America, are moving to England this summer. Estêvão and Páez will need time to adapt. A deal has been agreed for the Sporting Lisbon winger Geovany Quenda, 17, to join Chelsea in 2026. Andrey Santos, a 20-year-old Brazilian midfielder, is returning from a productive loan at Strasbourg.The influx of young talent explains why Chelsea are not getting carried away after finishing this season in fourth. They will be patient with Maresca, who has battled to convince supporters of his worth since replacing Mauricio Pochettino last summer. The aim for next season is to go far in the Champions League, challenge for the domestic cups and push on in the league. The sense is that Chelsea are two years away from being ready to win the title.Delap has been included in England’s Under-21 squad for the European Championship but could pull out of the tournament because of Chelsea’s involvement in the Club World Cup. It will be up to the club and player to decide on the best course of action. Thomas Tuchel, England’s head coach, stressed the importance of representing the under-21s last week.Explore more on these topicsChelseaTransfer windowIpswich TownnewsShareReuse this content"

YEAHWhileManchester Unitedended the season trophyless and 15th in the Premier League, they did at least get to join their comparatively triumphant Liverpool, Crystal Palace, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle counterparts in having an open-top bus parade. Currently serving club-enforced penance for their shambles of a season on a money-spinning post-season tour of Asia, the players – well, four of them at least – were forced to endure the indignity of being paraded through the streets of Kuala Lumpur on a heavily branded giant red doubledecker with ‘Glory, Glory, Man United’ blaring through its speakers, presumably to try to drum up interest in upwards of 12,000 unsold tickets for their Maybank Challenge Cup match against a scratch Asean All Stars side, scheduled to take place the following day.‘It sends a signal’: Jim Ratcliffe rebuked for Manchester United Women remarksRead moreWith no obvious route mapped out, the roads resolutely unclosed and ne’er a trophy to show off to the largely indifferent pedestrians they passed, it would be fair to say Matthijs De Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu looked at a loss to know what exactly to do, much as they have all season. In clips Football Daily has seen, the two Dutchmen at least had the good grace to smile and wave half-heartedly at passing commuters. Their younger teammates wore the thousand-yard stares of young recruits upon whom the realisation has dawned that this wasn’t what they signed up for when the United recruiting department pointed a meaty forefinger in their direction and said “Big Sir Jim wants you!”.Elsewhere in the city, a raft of their teammates were also performing the role of appointed volunteers, seated behind a long table in a sports retail outlet to meet and greet their sizeable Malaysian fanbase. Not long off a 14-hour flight and having been told to find a new club by his manager, Alejandro Garnacho looked as if he would rather defecate in his own hands and clap than sign shirts or pose for selfies with his adoring public. While he stifled yawns, alongside him his older and wiser skipper, Bruno Fernandes, at least made a genuine effort to play the game.Which is more than can be said for United’s players when they finally got round to lining up against the invitational side assembled to play them at the National Stadium Bukit Jalil. A 72,550-strong crowd, who had not paid good money to watch Unitedlose to the only goal of the gamescored by a player from a side that finished mid-table in the Thai top flight, made no secret of their displeasure after seeing United sunk by Maung Maung Ling’s strike. The crowd barracked the losers, who looked like they would rather be anywhere else. At least the good news for Fernandes, Garnacho and chums is that they are now somewhere else, almost certainly being forced to jump through similarpartnership-friendly hoopsin Hong Kong.“The boos from the fans, maybe it is something we need because every game that we lost in the Premier League they were always there,” sighed Ruben Amorim after a defeat that while entirely inconsequential, has still managed to be source of much mirth for people of a certain age who never tire of seeing United lose. “We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. We should win these kind of games, no matter what.”While the Portuguese’s commendable frankness in the face of each new obstacle his team trips over never ceases to be entertaining, it is surely only a matter of time before his brutal honesty when it comes to discussing his own and his team’s shortcomings results in him talking himself out of a job.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I was sick of getting the ball and going backwards or sideways. I thought when I next get the ball, I’m just going to go [forward] and it worked” – Cole Palmer,in his inimitable style, explains that apparently the way to completely turn European finals on their head with multiple moments of elite quality, is to go forward towards the opposition’s goal. Coaches and fellow players, take note! “If you saw what Cole did today, it was crazy,” elaborated teammate Tosin Adarabioyo. “He showed bundles of quality to provide both assists. He changed the game, that’s what he does.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These findings allow us to rethink the understanding of the ceremonial and socio-political organization of pre-Hispanic Petén,” said the ministry.In April, scientists discovered a 1,000-year-old altar from Mexico’s ancient Teotihuacán culture atTikal, elsewhere in the Petén department.That find was interpreted as proof of ties between the two pre-Hispanic cultures, which lived about 1,300km apart.Tikal, about 23km from Uaxcatun, is the main archaeological site in Guatemala and one of its biggest tourist attractions.Explore more on these topicsGuatemalaArchaeologyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Channel programme is for the most serious cases where there is a “genuine risk” of radicalisation.Having obtained previously undisclosed equality impact assessments carried out in 2023, RSI is concerned that the government is not adequately addressing the risk of “overreporting” autistic people.Sarah St Vincent, the executive director of RSI, said the documents suggest the government is taking a “casual and even careless approach” to understanding the impact of Prevent on autistic people.“The government needs to seriously rethink its approach to the Prevent programme, and in the meantime, authorities need to properly monitor the programme’s equality impact,” she said.RSI argues that the 2021 report, titledAutismSpectrum Condition: Support within the Channel Process, raises concerns about the potential discriminatory impact of the programme on autistic people.The report said: “Survey findings indicate that an estimated 14% of Channel cases had diagnosed Autism Spectrum Condition. In 12% of cases Channel practitioners considered that someone might be autistic although they lacked the clinic diagnosis.”In legal correspondence with RSI, the Home Office has indicated that data about the protected characteristics of referred persons is often not available. It said existing Prevent and Channel data does not allow for a comprehensive analysis of all protected characteristics of individuals referred.RSI has argued that the failure to collect adequate data to support equality monitoring constitutes a breach of the home secretary and police’s public sector equality duty.The duty is the requirement to have “due regard” to the equality objectives in section 149 of the Equality Act, which include the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between people who share protected characteristics and those who do not.As part of its letter, the human rights organisation has asked for a formal alternative dispute resolution meeting to try to resolve its concerns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our client believes that the data it has obtained bolsters its argument that the government needs to change its approach.”Since coming into office last July, the government has introduced youth diversion orders and a new tsar to ensure Prevent, the official scheme to deter people from terrorism, is effective.A Home Office spokesperson said the government was reviewing the Prevent programme in light of concerns over neurodivergence.“We understand that those referred to Prevent often present with a range of vulnerabilities, and we take our safeguarding duties very seriously.“That’s why the home secretary has already announced a strategic review to identify and drive improvements in how individuals referred into Prevent who are neurodivergent or suffer from mental ill-health are supported and managed, while keeping pace with the increasingly complex and evolving terrorist threat,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsPrevent strategyUK security and counter-terrorismAutismHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

He faces up to life in prison if convicted on all counts.Mia said that Combs’s conduct towards her was “the most shameful thing of my life” when challenged by his defense about why she hadn’t reported him, adding that having to talk about it now was a traumatic experience but that being scared into silence would not help others.Judge denies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs lawyers’ bid for mistrialRead moreSometimes he treated her like a best friend, and sometimes he was terrifying and humiliated her in front of others, making her feel like “a worthless piece of crap”, she told the jury in New York.She also described feeling trapped in the situation, finding that in previous interactions with police the officers were simply awed to be dealing with the famous artist Diddy, and also being terrified of him.“I didn’t want to die or get hurt,” she said. She had assumed she would take her secret to her grave, but now had felt able to take the stand.“I couldn’t tell him ‘no’, like, about a sandwich. I couldn’t tell him ‘no’ about anything. There’s no way I could tell him ‘no’,” Mia said, adding that if she had left or been fired she feared that Combs would “ruin my future”.Testimony in the closely watched trial in Manhattan federal court is in its third week. Prosecutors say Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, coerced women over two decades to take part in days-long, drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers known as “freak-offs”.Mia’s testimony was not about sex parties but about allegedly being raped in private, at his home when she was assisting him, such as in packing for a trip. He made her feel “like trash”, she said.Mia told jurors Combs climbed on top of her while she was sleeping and raped her while she lay frozen with fear. In another incident, she testified that Combs grabbed her head and put his penis in her mouth, while she did not fight back. As she testified on Thursday, she fought back tears and often looked down at her lap, speaking about his alleged assaults in barely a whisper at times.Combs’s lawyers have acknowledged he was at times abusive in domestic relationships but said any sex was consensual.They have also said that women who participated in the so-called “freak-offs” did so consensually.Over four days of emotional testimony during the first week of trial, Combs’s ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura told jurors Combs physically and emotionallyabused herthroughout their tumultuous 11-year relationship.Ventura, a rhythm-and-blues singer known as Cassie, said she participated in the “freak-offs” because she feared Combs would release sex tapes of her if she didn’t, but also because she loved him.Mia told the court on Thursday that she had more than once witnessed Combs physically assaulting Ventura, her friend.In one instance, she said, while on a trip to Turks and Caicos, Ventura ran to Mia’s room to wake her up, screaming: “You gotta help me” and saying of Combs, “he’s gonna kill me.”Friends and associates of Combs and Ventura have also testified about Combs’salleged abuse, describing Combs as a domineering figure who relied on bodyguards and associates to enable his alleged crimes and keep victims in line.Dawn Richard, a former member of the pop group Danity Kane,testified last weekthat she felt threatened when Combs told her to keep quiet about what she saw.Richard faced a sharp cross-examination by one of Combs’s lawyers, who sought to point to inconsistencies between her testimony and what she said during interviews with prosecutors.Last week, Scott Mescudi – the rapper known as Kid Cudi –testified that his car was set on firein 2012, shortly after Combs learned that Mescudi had a romantic relationship with Ventura.Former employee testifies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs said ‘we’re going to kill’ Kid CudiRead moreProsecutors say the alleged arson of Mescudi’s car was one of several violent or illegal acts that Combs or his associates undertook to prevent women from leaving his orbit and keep his abuse quiet.The trial has drawn intense media coverage due to Combs’s cultural influence and role in taking hip-hop mainstream through legendary artists such as the Notorious BIG.Combs was arrested in Manhattan last September and is being held at a federal prison in Brooklyn when not in court.The trial will resume on Friday and is expected to last several more weeks.Reuters contributed reportingInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Now fossil hunters say these beasts shared their turf with a host of different birds.Researchers believe their discovery of more than 50 bird fossils from the Prince Creek formation in Alaska is the oldest evidence of birds nesting in polar regions, pushing back the date by more than 25m years.“The previous oldest evidence for polar nesting is a penguin colony from the Eocene of Antarctica [that lived about 46.5m years ago],” said Lauren Wilson, first author of the work from Princeton University.More than 200 species of bird nest in the Arctic today, with the researchers saying they are crucial members of the ecosystem, helping with essential tasks such as pollination and seed dispersal. And the latest findings suggest their presence is nothing new.“These new fossils fill a major gap in our understanding of bird evolution,” said Prof Patrick Druckenmiller, director of the University of Alaska Museum of the North and a co-author of the studypublished in the journal Science.While the earliest birds emerged in the Late Jurassic, about 150m years ago, the delicate nature of bird bones means such animals are rare in the fossil record. “Prior to this work, and with the exception of a few footprints, bird fossils weren’t known from Alaska,” said Druckenmiller.View image in fullscreenThe team at work on the dig.The discovery involved far more than mere good fortune, with the team carefully excavating bones as well as washing and sieving material from small, sandy deposits to isolate tiny fossils, many of which were less than 2mm in size.“It was literally like panning for gold, except bird bones are our prize,” said Druckemiller.Wilson added that many of the bones were from embryos or hatchlings. At least one species of bird, she said, belonged to a now-extinct group called Ichthyornithes, and would have resembled a toothed seagull, while the researchers also found at least one member of another extinct group called Hesperornithes: foot-propelled diving birds with teeth.Many of the fossils came from toothless birds that may have resembled ducks. That, the team note, is significant because features such as a lack of teeth are a hallmark of Neornithes, the group that includes all living birds and their most recent common ancestor. It suggests the prehistoric birds nesting in the Arctic were close relatives of modern birds.View image in fullscreenThe fossils were tiny, with many less than 2mm in size.Druckenmiller said that, like the Arctic today, the Prince Creek ecosystem of 73m years ago would have experienced about six months of continuous daylight in the summer, during which it would have been very green. As a result there would have been an abundance of food. However, the winter would have been chilly.“While [winters were] not as harsh as today, year-round residents would have to endure freezing temperatures, occasional snowfall, and about four months of continuous winter darkness,” he said.Wilson said the newly discovered fossils showed the birds were breeding in the Arctic, but she said it was unclear if they spent the winter there, adding it was highly likely at least some of them were migratory.Steve Brusatte, a professor of palaeontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work, said that while the fossils discovered by the team were “absolutely minuscule”, they told a huge story.“These fossils show that birds were already integral parts of the these high-latitude communities many tens of millions of years ago, and thus that these communities are a long-term norm of Earth history, not a recent ecological innovation of modern times,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyArcticPalaeontologyDinosaursBirdsEvolutionFossilsnewsShareReuse this content"

That goal is lookingincreasingly out of reachas emissions continue to rise, but the scientists said that every tenth-of-a-degree rise that was avoided would save 2.7tn tonnes of ice.Glaciers will sustain huge ice loss even at lower levels of global heating - chartGlaciers in the western US and Canada were severely affected, the study found, with 75% already doomed to melt. Those in the high, cold mountains of the Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges are more resilient but will still shrink significantly as global temperatures rise.Unlike previous studies, the research uses multiple models of glaciers to examine their fate well beyond the end of the century. About 20% of glaciers were already known to be doomed to melt by 2100, but the longer term view revealed that the total glacier loss that is already inevitable is 39%.As well as sea level rise, glacier loss will increase ice lake collapses that devastate downstream communities and the loss of wild ecosystems, while regions dependent on glacier tourism will also suffer.“Our study makes it painfully clear that every fraction of a degree matters,” said Dr Harry Zekollari at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, who co-led the research. “The choices we make today will resonate for centuries, determining how much of our glaciers can be preserved.”View image in fullscreenThe situation will be grim at 2.7C of global heating, with all but seven of the 19 major glacier regions of the world eventually losing at least 80% of glaciers, from central Europe to the eastern Himalaya chain.Photograph: Harry ZekollariDr Lilian Schuster, at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, and co-lead author, said: “Glaciers are good indicators of climate change because their retreat allows us to see with our own eyes how climate is changing. However, since they adjust over longer timescales, the situation for glaciers is actually far worse than visible in the mountains today.”Schuster added that it was “not too late to act now, because this study shows every tenth of a degree less of global warming matters”, potentially reducing the human suffering caused by glacier loss. “We hope the message gives people some hope that we can still do something.”The baseline year for the analysis was 2020, but glaciers had already lost huge amounts of ice before this due to global heating over the last century. Quantifying this loss is difficult, however, due to the scarcity of historical data. “Glaciers were way bigger [in 1850] than they are today,” said Zekollari.The study,published in the journal Science, used eight different glacier models, each calibrated using real-world observations. These estimated the ice loss of the world’s 200,000 glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica under a range of global temperature scenarios, with that temperature remaining constant for thousands of years.The researchers acknowledged significant uncertainties in the models but said glaciers are certain to lose significant ice and this could be a lot higher than the average estimate. For example, the average prediction that 40% of glaciers are doomed at today’s level of global heating could be as high as 55% in the worst case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Glaciers would vanish from the Russian Arctic, the western US and Iceland.Two-thirds of glacier ice in the Alps ‘will melt by 2100’Read moreGlaciers currently contribute about a quarter of sea level rise and those already doomed will lead to another 11cm. If global heating reaches 2.7C, it will result in 23cm of sea level rise from glaciers alone. Limiting global heating to 1.5C limits reduces that to 14cm.Prof Andrew Shepherd, at Northumbria University in the UK, said the study brought together all of the glacier model projections into a single assessment. “Glaciers are the most iconic example of the impacts of climate change, and they are in all corners of our planet,” he said.“This study shows that glacier melting will continue for centuries, even if climate warming stops today, and that’s a sobering thought – dramatic changes will take place in our lifetimes. Our mountain landscapes will be unrecognisable if we continue to burn fossil fuels as we are today.”Glaciers could seem remote, said Zekollari, but their loss mattered to everyone. “Everything is connected. If you drive around in your car in the UK, you’re emitting greenhouse gases and this helps melt a glacier maybe 10,000km away,” he said. “The oceans then rise, so you’ll have to have better coastal defences and that will cost a lot of taxpayers money.”The UN’s High-Level International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation begins on Wednesday in Tajikistan, part of theInternational Year of Glaciers’ Preservation.Explore more on these topicsGlaciersClimate crisisSea levelMountainsShareReuse this content"

The Haweswater and Thirlmere reservoirs are at 47.5%, compared with 94.8% last year. These are the reservoirs which serve areas including Cumbria and Manchester, in the drought area.An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “The north-west of England has entered drought status due to low water levels in reservoirs and rivers. No other areas in England are in drought and we continue to monitor the situation closely.”Climate breakdown will make droughts more likely, scientists have said, as rainfall becomes less predictable.Richard Allan, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said: “The lack of rainfall across the UK in spring 2025 constituted a meteorological drought and this quickly depleted the soil’s moisture, leading to concerns over agricultural drought. Lowering river and reservoir levels are a concern for the north-west of the UK as further dry spells could threaten the supply of water as part of a hydrological drought.“Droughts are expected to onset more rapidly and become more intense as the planet warms since the atmosphere’s thirst for water grows. A warming climate means moisture is more readily sapped from one region and blown into storm systems elsewhere, intensifying both wet and dry weather extremes with wilder swings between them. The only way to limit the increasing severity of wet and dry extremes is to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of society.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is on top of the huge death toll resulting from armed conflicts.“There is a real concern around the way that we are prioritising short-term security and sacrificing long-term security,” said Ellie Kinney, a researcher with the Conflict and Environment Observatory and a co-author ofthe study, shared exclusively with the Guardian.“Because of this kind of lack-of-informed approach that we’re taking, you’re investing in hard military security now, increasing global emissions for that reason, and worsening the climate crisis further down the line.”That in turn is only likely to lead to further violence, with climate change itself now increasingly seen as a driver of conflict, albeit indirectly. In Sudan’s Darfur region, conflict was linked to competition over scarce resources after prolonged droughts and desertification. In the Arctic, receding sea ice is leading to tensions over who should control newly accessible oil, gas and critical mineral resources.View image in fullscreenIsraeli tanks and armoured vehicles near the border with the Gaza Strip in May. Steel and aluminium used in weapons are very carbon-intensive to produce.Photograph: Ariel Schalit/APFew militaries are transparent about the scale of their fossil fuel use, but researchers have estimated that collectively they are already responsible for 5.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.That figure is expected to rise as tensions escalate in a number of regions and as the US, for decades the world’s biggest military spender, indicates that it expects its Nato allies to devote significantly more resources to their armed forces.According to theGlobal Peace Index, militarisation increased in 108 countries in 2023. With 92 countries involved in armed conflict, in places ranging from Ukraine and Gaza to South Sudan and DRC, with tensions seething between China and the US over Taiwan, and with the frozen conflict between India and Pakistan flaring, governments fearful of war are investing heavily in their militaries.In Europe, the increase has been particularly dramatic: between 2021 and 2024, EU states’ weapons spending rose by more than 30%, according to theInternational Institute for Strategic Studies.In March, the EU, disconcerted by Donald Trump’s cutting of military aid and diplomatic support for Ukraine, indicated this would go further, withproposals for a further €800bn spendacross the bloc outlined in a plan called “ReArm Europe”.In analysis for the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, Kinney and colleagues looked at the potential impact of increased militarisation on meeting climate goals. What they found was sobering: the likely increase in emissions from Nato’s remilitarisation alone would be the equivalent of adding the cost of a country as large and populous as Pakistan to the world’s remaining carbon budget.“Our analysis specifically looks at the impact onsustainable development goal 13, which is climate action – to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,” Kinney said. “And what our analysis finds, looking at the various sub-targets of that … [is] that there is a real threat to global climate action caused by global increase in military spending.”Of all functions of states, militaries are almost uniquely carbon-intensive. “First of all, with the equipment that they purchase, which is mainly a lot of steel and aluminium, which is very carbon-intensive to produce,” said Lennard de Klerk, of the Initiative on the GHG Accounting of War, another co-author of the study.“Secondly is during operations, armies are very mobile. And in order to move around they use fossil fuels – that’s diesel for ground operations and kerosene for air operations. Or for maritime operations it’s mainly diesel as well, if they’re not nuclear-driven.”Given the secrecy that usually surrounds militaries and their operations, it is difficult to know just how much greenhouse gases they are emitting. Only Nato countries report enough of their emissions for scientists to attempt an estimate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

So it’s not that we particularly want to focus on Nato, but simply because they have more data available,” De Klerk said.The researchers calculated by how much greenhouse gas emissions would increase if Nato countries excluding the US – since it already spends far more than the others – made a two percentage point increase in the share of GDP they devoted to their militaries.Such an increase is already under way, with many countries in Europe significantly increasing military spending in response to the crisis in Ukraine. Although Nato countries have publicly committed to increasing spending to 2% of GDP, the researchers say the ReArm Europe plan could lead to an eventual rise to 3.5%, from about 1.5% in 2020. The researchers assumed a similar eventual increase in Nato members that are not members of the EU, such as the UK.I’ve studied geopolitics all my life: climate breakdown is a bigger threat than China and Russia | Anatol LievenRead moreBorrowing methodology from a recent paper that argued each percentage point increase in the share of GDP devoted to military spending would lead to an increase in national emissions of between 0.9% and 2%, they estimated that a two percentage point spending shock would lead to an increase across the bloc of between 87 and 194 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) a year.The researchers say that not only would such a huge increase in emissions supercharge climate breakdown but the increase in global temperatures would hurt the economy. Recent estimates of the social cost of carbon – a monetary indicator of the damage of CO2emitted – put it at $1,347/tCO2e, suggesting the annual cost of Nato’s military buildup could be as much as $264bn a year.And that is only a fraction of the true carbon cost of militarisation, Kinney points out. “The calculation in the paper, it’s 31 countries – that only represents 9% of total world emissions. If you consider … the impact of that, there’s a lot of the world that we haven’t taken into consideration of this specific calculation.”The analysis notes that spending more money on militaries also reduces resources available for policies aimed at mitigating climate change. This already seems to be the case, with the UK, for example, funding its increase in spending by reducing its overseas aid budget – a move mirrored in Belgium, France and the Netherlands.“This increase in military spending is impacting the kind of core trust that is necessary for multilateralism,” Kinney said. “At Cop29, global south countries like Cuba in particular pointed out the hypocrisy in the room of states being willing to spend increasing amounts on their military spending, but offering … completely, unacceptably low climate finance commitments.”The Guardian has contacted Nato for comment.Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisNatonewsShareReuse this content"

I recognise that none of this is without cost, but governments need to level with society about the risks that we face today.”Some other European countries have already taken climate security issues into their revamped defence plans. In Germany, the Green party managed to squeeze climate action into a radical defence and infrastructure spending plan. In Spain, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, announced that 17% of this year’s €23bn ($26.2bn) military spending would go to climate resilience programs.Lt Gen Richard Nugee, a retired army officer who held several key posts during his 36-year military career, said the UK should be thinking along similar lines.He argued that although there was a need for more military spending in light of the threat from Russia and the perceived weakening of US support for Europe, the discussion about the UK’s security in the 21st century needed to be much broader.Alongside direct military spending, Nugee said there were “five and a half other securities” that the government should consider as it looks to spend billions to protect the UK: energy security and resilience; water security and resilience to floods and drought as well as sea level rises; food security, capacity and resilience; health security; and border security as we enter an era of mass population displacements.Nugee argued that another “half security” was the potential weaponisation of geoengineering – hostile actors using the latest geoengineering technology to manipulate weather patterns.He said all these matters were intrinsic to the country’s security in an era of climate crisis, but was concerned they were not part of the conversation about how best to protect the UK.“I think there’s a very real chance that what I’m talking about just gets ignored … as the pull for increased security spending will focus solely on direct military spending, rather than the wider issue of national security, threatened also by the effects of climate change.”He said the government needed something like a climate security centre to feed these arguments into the decision-making process around security matters rather than delegating them to other departments such as Defra.“What we need is a centre or a body of people to be looking at national security in the round and how it is being profoundly affected by the changing world that we are seeing as a result of climate change.”The UK government is expected to announce the results of its defence review within the next three weeks, after nearly a year of work by the former defence secretary George Robertson.Some in the Labour party have argued that diverting spending to defence from other areas – including climate and foreign aid – could boost economic growth. However, economists warned against any “magical thinking” in relation to spending on military hardware.“Defence spending is an economic dead end,” said the economist James Meadway, pointing toresearch by the Scottish governmentthat showed military spending was one of the most inefficient ways to boost the economy. “It has almost no ripple-out economic benefit … and increasingly it is focused on tech and cyber, not the large-scale production of military hardware that offers good jobs to lots of people.”He said any government that wanted to stimulate useful economic activity should look elsewhere.“If Labour was serious about creating good jobs in the country … it would go and create good jobs in the country ideally in areas that are also socially useful – like social care, education or healthcare.”Additional reporting: Ajit NiranjanExplore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryClimate crisisKeir StarmerFloodingExtreme heatFood securitynewsShareReuse this content"

More than 100 signed a letter saying they could not support them at the vote.Ministers are looking at potential tweaks tomollify Labour backbenchers. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the changes being looked at is a tweak to the proposed Pip assessment rules so that individuals who receive a high overall score continue to be eligible, even if they do not receive at least four points in any category.A government source told the Guardian this was “an option they’re considering”, although sources in Downing Street and Whitehall denied it was on the table.Under the government’s planned changes, claimants would not qualify for Pip unless they scored a minimum of four points on a single daily living activity. Assessments score the difficulty from 0 to 12 that claimants face in a range of living activities such as preparing and eating food, communicating, washing and getting dressed.Another potential tweak could mean more time is given to claimants who lose access to one disability benefit to apply for other support they may be eligible for.The Times reported this weekthat benefit claimants could be given longer “transitional periods” to ease the impact of losing support.Keir Starmer has been under pressure over his welfare cuts since they were blamed for Labour’s poor local election results in England this month. Ministers are looking at potential changes to the disability benefit cuts as a way of staving off a major backbench rebellion against them.Last week the prime ministerannounced a U-turn over the winter fuel allowancefor pensioners, which is worth up to £300 a year and was taken away from 10 million people in one of the Labour government’s first moves last July.At prime minister’s questions last Wednesday, Starmer told the Commons he wouldease the cut by changing the thresholdto allow “more pensioners” to qualify again.The government has yet to set out more details on what the change will mean, but Angela Rayner said last weekend that the payments would not be restored in their entirety.Nigel Farage hassought to outflank Labour on welfareby committing to fully reinstating winter fuel payments and scrapping the two-child benefit cap.Eluned Morgan, the Welsh first minister, urged the government to scrap the two-child benefit cap on Wednesday and said it was “damaging for lots of families in Wales”. She has previously criticised the winter fuel cut.Starmer told a press conference on Thursdaythat he was looking at “all options” to drive down child poverty when asked if he would like to get rid of the two-child benefit cap. “One of the proudest things that the last Labour government did was to drive down child poverty, and that’s why we’ve got a taskforce working on this,” he said. “I think there are a number of components. There isn’t a single bullet.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareDisabilityBenefitsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

This change matters | Richard NguyenRead moreThe numbers are the first time a publicly available estimate has been made of how common the condition may be among the population. Of the 2.5 million people estimated to have ADHD across England, more than a third (741,000) are children.ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, disorganisation and difficulty focusing.Previous researchhas found that prescriptions for ADHD medications have risen 18% year on year since the pandemic, increasing from about 25 per 1,000 people in 2019-20 to 42 per 1,000 in 2023-24.The analysis also found a strong association between factors such as ethnicity and deprivation and ADHD prescription rates. The researchers said the south-east and north-west of England, which have significant white populations, have higher prescription counts overall compared with more ethnically diverse regions such as the Midlands and London.Henry Shelford, the chief executive of ADHD UK, said theNHSwas presiding over a “wildly failing system” for the condition.“At ADHD UK we did this same population analysis years ago and arrived at similar numbers,” he said. “While it is great to see NHS England catching up, we need to note that Nice first published guidelines for ADHD in the year 2000. For NHS England to take 25 years to create any population estimate is an expression of their abject failure to properly manage and resource ADHD. That failure has meant ruined lives, wrecked families, and lost lives.”Shelford added: “Worse still, ADHD assessment and support is being excluded, and squeezed, by the government’s NHS improvement schemes. ADHD is excluded from the government’s 18-week waiting list target. ADHD is not counted towards, so excluded from, the required expansion of mental health services in the NHS. NHS England has finally twigged that there are over 2 million of us. It now needs to mandate every area to have an NHS ADHD service that fits our need and numbers.”Louise Ansari, the chief executive of Healthwatch England, said the figures were “a first step in understanding the scale of demand for ADHD care”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the Labour government introduced “flexibilities” into the rules after the car industry lobbied heavily toargue that they were economically unsustainable.Experts had previously highlighted apparent flaws in the government’s analysis. They told the Guardian they believed the flexibilities would result in much higher sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which emit far more carbon than electric cars because they combine a polluting internal combustion engine with smaller batteries.T&E, a campaign group on transport and environmental issues, said the changes would mean as many as500,000 extra PHEVson UK roads by 2030.Graph showing sales of plug-in hybrid carsHeidi Alexander, the transport minister, claimed the ZEV mandate changes would have a“negligible change to the carbon emissions”. However, the CCC highlighted that Department for Transport analysis assumed carmakers would not use greater flexibilities to sell more PHEVs – an assumption thought to be incorrect by experts. It outlined its analysis in aletteron Wednesday from Piers Forster, the CCC’s interim chair, to Lilian Greenwood, a transport minister.Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of the thinktank New AutoMotive, said: “The CCC’s verdict is clear: ministerial meddling with electric car rules risks creating damaging uncertainty. Drivers will be the ones picking up the tab, waiting longer to benefit from EV savings, while net zero defeatists cheer from the sidelines.”Some people in the electric vehicle industry said they were disappointed that the CCC did not call for the government to reconsider the proposed policy changes, given the possibility that they would result in higher emissions.Tim Dexter, the vehicle policy manager for T&E, said: “The CCC’s letter reveals a critical weakness in the government’s revised zero emissions vehicle mandate, jeopardising its climate goals and increasing costs for drivers.”Colin Walker, head of transport for the campaign group Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “The increase in vehicle emissions could be considerable. As well as driving the uptake of more polluting and expensive PHEVs, the government’s changes risk distracting the UK’s car industry from making the shift to building EVs, leaving it stuck building obsolete hybrids while the world moves to EVs – a recipe for factory closures and mass redundancies.”However, the CCC said the government changes were “pragmatic” and “minor” relative to the trend of increasing EV sales, to the chagrin of some in the industry.The CCC also criticised the government for failing to ban petrol and diesel van sales by 2030, instead opting for 2035. It said: “We are disappointed that the phase-out date for vans has not also been restored to 2030.”A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: “Our recent changes strike a practical balance – giving manufacturers flexibility to sell plug-in hybrids until 2035, while sticking to our commitment to the 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars.” The changes “will have a minimal impact on emissions”, it added, and would protect jobs.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsRoad transportAutomotive industryTravel and transportMotoringGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate Change CommitteenewsShareReuse this content"

Those shares were worth €1bn on Thursday. Ryanair was valued at more than €25bn.Hildyard said: “Lavishing another €100m on someone who already enjoys billionaire status is a morally questionable and practically inefficient way of sharing the wealth that accrues to large companies.“The value of a payout this size as a reward or incentive to someone who already possesses more wealth than they could spend in multiple lifetimes is limited. Imagine what difference this award would make if it was shared with all the workers that have all contributed to Ryanair’s success.”The company’s latest annual report said O’Leary would qualify for the bonus if profits rose above €2.2bn “and/or the share price of the company exceeds €21 for a period of 28 days between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2028”.Ryanair’s share price first closed above €21 on 2 May and stayed above that level for 28 days, closing at €23.74 on Thursday.O’Leary would be able to buy 10m shares at just €11.12 each, a price of €111.2m. When those shares vest in three years he could then sell them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After landing at the Casement aerodrome, McGovern is expected to be taken under armed guard to the special criminal court to be formally charged.Shawna Coxon, the deputy commissioner of Ireland’s police force, An Garda Síochána, said it was a significant development in international law enforcement. “Transnational organised crime gangs cause misery to communities not only in Ireland but throughout the world. They engage in murder, human trafficking and drug dealing.”Ireland’s justice minister, Jim O’Callaghan, thanked his Emirati counterpart, Abdullah bin Sultan bin Awad Al Nuaimi, and the Dubai police for their cooperation.The UAE has become a base for Irish criminals and their associates partly because the state has no extradition treaty with the EU. However, a decade of lobbying by Irish officials paved the way for an extradition treaty that became operational on 18 May.It was not retrospective and did not apply to McGovern but authorities in both jurisdictions made a separate, one-off arrangement to transfer the suspect. McGovern was shot in the stomach in 2016 when a rival gang’s hit team stormed a Kinahan-organised boxing weigh-in at a Dublin hotel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

ERO is in charge of immigration enforcement, including arrests, detention and deportation, while HSI typically focuses on investigating transnational crime, such as drug trafficking, human smuggling and the spread of online child abuse.The 21 May meeting in Washington DC is the latest example of the increasing pressure being placed on officials nationwide toincrease the number of arrestsof immigrants, as the administration doubles down on its anti-immigration agenda.The latest phase of the crackdown includes new tactics, such as mandating federal law enforcement agents outside Ice to assist in arrests and transports, more deputizing of compliant state and local law enforcement agencies, and arresting people at locations that were once protected, like courthouses.Trump officials increasingly recruit local police for immigration enforcement despite ‘red flags’Read more“ This administration came into office with the illusion that they had been given a broad mandate to effectuate an aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, and they are doubling down now on that agenda,” said Nayna Gupta, the policy director for the American Immigration Council. “ Public polling is showing decreasing support for Trump’s immigration agenda, as Americans wake up to the reality that mass deportation means arrests of our neighbors and friends, masked agents in our communities and people afraid to go to work and show up to school, in ways that undermine our local economies.”Helter-skelter action has led tocitizens caught upin the dragnet, Iceskirting due process– tothe chagrinof thesupreme courtandlowercourts –over-crowdingin detention centers, arrests basedon ideologyand officialsdeportingpeople to thirdcountries.“The sweeping Ice raids and arrests are hitting families, longtime residents, children and communities in a way never seen before,” said Jesse Franzblau, the associate director of policy for the National Immigrant Justice Center.As the number ofpeople crossingthe border into the US without authorization hasplummetedevenfurther thanafter the final Bidencrackdown, operations in the US interior have increased.“Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump’s and the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe,” Tricia McLaughlin, the homeland security assistant secretary, said in a statement.But even if the new target is fulfilled, it’s a far cry from Trump’s election campaignpledges to deport15m to 20m people, which itself is more than the estimated 11m undocumented population.Agents with the FBI, HSI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other federal law enforcement agencies have been co-opted from normal priorities to carry out immigration enforcement work. Current and former federal officials told the Guardian there is concern that important non-immigration-related investigations are falling by the wayside as a result.There has also been ahuge escalationby local police and sheriff’s departments assisting, deputized by Ice to perform federal immigration arrests under aprogram called 287(g).Ice has also been targeting unusual places.On Tuesday, Ice and several other federal law enforcement agencies arrested roughly 40 people on theMassachusetts islandsof Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard. The US Coast Guard transported those apprehended,Ice said, angering some residents, local mediareported.The agency has also been arresting people at courthouses throughout the country – a trend that has troubled advocates and policy analysts.“We’re seeing theTrump administrationtake the unprecedented step of arresting non-citizens who are following the government’s rules and procedures, and showing up for their court hearings,” said Gupta. “ They are desperate to reach a certain number of arrests per day. And the only way they can find non-citizens easily and quickly is to go to the courthouses, where they [immigrants] are doing exactly what they’re supposed to do.”On Wednesday, sources told the Guardian that officials had arrested people at two separate immigration courts in New York City. The outletthe City observedseven people arrested in a lower Manhattan court.Internal documentsaccessed by the Washington Postshow Ice officers in more than 20 states have been instructed to arrest people at courthouses immediately after a judge orders them deported or after their criminal cases are dropped and they try to leave.The number of people held in detention by Ice reached 49,000 by 18 May, an increase of more than 10,000 since Trump took office, with the agency using local jails andfederal prisonsto hold immigrants, amid overcrowding.Austin Kocher, an assistant research professor at Syracuse University whoclosely tracksimmigration detention data, said of the 3,000 daily arrest quota: “ The big question for me is: where are they going to put people?”Meanwhile, last month, the Trump administrationordered immigration judgesto quickly dismiss cases by denying asylum seekers a hearing. The directive “has nothing to do with efficiency – it’s about slamming shut the courthouse door on people who have the right to seek asylum and a fair day in court”, Shayna Kessler, the director of the Advancing Universal Representation initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice,said.On Capitol Hill, themajor spending billpassed by the House would balloon spending for immigration enforcement, at theUS-Mexico borderand in the interior, whilecutting everyday services.Trump’s new border wall will threaten wildlife in an area where few people passRead more“The administration is on a reckless spending spree, counting on Congress to bail them out for overspending hundreds of millions of dollars in private prison contractswith tiesto top-level officials,” Franzblau said.He concluded: “It is beyond cruel to superfund Ice’s rampant violations of constitutional protections and expand the deadly immigration detention and enforcement apparatus.”Miller confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday that the White House was setting a goal for Ice to arrest at least 3,000 migrants per day, far above an earlier 1,000 per day arrest quota.Reuters reported later on Thursday that the Trump administration was removing two senior immigration enforcement officials amid demands to step up enforcement, three people familiar with the move said.Top Ice officials Kenneth Genalo and Robert Hammer will be pulled from their posts, the people told the news agency, requesting anonymity to discuss the shift. DHS denied that they were pushed out.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationKristi NoemDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her conduct caused harm both to the prosecution and to the defence.”Judge in trial of Maradona’s medical team steps down over TV show roleRead moreHe lamented: “The trial was being properly conducted by everyone, except for one person.”His colleague, Judge Verónica Di Tommaso, added: “There was one person who made a mistake and will have to keep giving explanations, but that person is not the justice system. Justice cannot be stained.”Two of Maradona’s daughters who were in court for the hearing, Dalma and Gianinna, began to cry,according to Argentine newspaper La Nación. Another daughter, Jana, was also present, along with the mother of Maradona’s youngest son and the seven defendants.Maradonadied in November 2020, at the age of 60, days after undergoing surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain.His medical team – four doctors, two nurses and a psychologist – is beingcharged with simple homicide with possible intent, for having allowed him to recover at home.According to prosecutors, the medical attention Maradona received during his home care was “reckless, deficient” and “unprecedented”.After Makintach’s involvement in the documentary series was revealed, prosecutors, defence attorneys and members of Maradona’s family called for the trial to be annulled. The case had already gone through 21 sessions since it began in March.Now, the Chamber of Appeals and Guarantees in Criminal Matters of San Isidro, in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, is expected to hold a new draw to appoint a fresh panel of judges who will conduct the trial from the beginning.The turning point in the case came a few days ago, when allegations emerged that Makintach was involved in covert filming of the legal proceedings.The trial was suspended for a week so that prosecutors could investigate the claims, and last Tuesday, they presented their findings in court – including aone-minute-50-second trailerthat showed the judge being filmed from several angles as she arrived at and walked around the courthouse.In the video, she is described as “the judge behind D10S”, a reference to Maradona’s “divine” nickname – a play on the Spanish word for God (Dios) and the iconic number 10 jersey worn by one of the greatest players of all time. The name of the series was “Divine Justice”.Diego Maradona medics go on trial accused of criminal negligenceRead moreBesides giving an interview for the miniseries, the judge allegedly allowed the film crew unauthorised access the courthouse on a Sunday, two days before the trial began, according to prosecutors.Footage was also reportedly taken during the trial sessions, which is not permitted.Faced with the revelations and criticism from all sides, the judge agreed to step down. The following day, the supreme court of the province of Buenos Airessuspended Makintach for 90 days, describing her conduct as “incompatible with decorum and prudence”.The outcome is being widely treated inArgentinaas an “international embarrassment” for the country’s judiciary.One of Maradona’s daughters, Jana,told reportersas she left the courthouse that she felt angry and “hates” the justice system after the trial was annulled. Her sister Dalma said: “The only thing we want is for the process to continue.”Explore more on these topicsDiego MaradonaArgentinanewsShareReuse this content"

Does it?Comprising 10 productions and four world premieres, itdoescontain all the signature-marks of Goold’s tenure: a smattering of star names (including Josh O’Connor and Romala Garai, the former the American classic, Golden Boy, the latter in a version of A Doll’s House by Anya Reiss); a big-ambition project with Jack Holden’s adaptation of Alan Hollinghurst’s Booker prize winning novel, The Line of Beauty, about 1980s gay life (how do you turn Hollinghurst’s glorious prose into glorious theatre? We’ll see this autumn, I suppose); and a revival of the musical thrillerAmerican Psycho, based on Bret Easton Ellis’s book, which featured in Goold’s first programme at the Almeida in 2013, and brings a nice circularity to this last one. A play about masculine psychopathy, it is in the mould of previous musicals that combined hard-edged subject matter with song, fromSpring Awakening, featuring teen depression, rape and suicide, to the rise and fall of a TV evangelist,Tammy Faye(both of which Goold directed).There is also another production by Rebecca Frecknall – a revival of Sarah Kane’s searing play, Cleansed. Frecknall, a star director whom Goold has long championed, is joining Goold at the Old Vic as associate director when he takes over as its artistic director, so this does not mark the end of their impressive collaboration.View image in fullscreenA giant swimming pool? No problem! … Rupert GooldPhotograph: Marc BrennerFew could dispute that Goold has made this little but mighty theatre, nestling in the heart of leafy north London, all the mightier. Openings there have become unmissable events and many have transferred to the West End, including American Psycho (then to Broadway, in fact).For good or bad, Goold is also one of the leading industry figures to have brought screen talent closer to the stage. In fairness, most of his power celebrity castings have been well judged, alongside causing a stir – fromSaoirse Ronan’s Lady Macbethto Daisy Edgar-Jonesas Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roofand Paul Mescal as Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire, as well as musical collaborations with Elton John and Jake Shears for Tammy Faye.But what I see as Goold’s greatest accomplishment is his collaborations with the most exciting writers and directors of our time. It is this that has made this programming so formidable. He has a long track record with Robert Icke, each play ever more sensational, from his monumentalOresteiatoThe Doctor,which transferred to the West End, and Hamletstarring Andrew Scott.View image in fullscreenWell-judged … James McArdle and Saoirse Ronan in The Tragedy of Lady Macbeth.Photograph: Marc BrennerThere have been several plays by Mike Bartlett (the biggest highlight wasKing Charles III), as well as the supremely talented Omar Elerian and Beth Steel. These are rich associations, alongside those with Frecknall. I look forward to Alice Birch’s Romans: A Novel, opening in September.Like Goold, Birch has shuttled between TV and stage work, having recently written television versions of Sally Rooney’s Normal People and Conversations With Friends. She will make her Almeida debut with this examination of masculinity across two centuries.Some of my personal highlights have been the more high-wire moments in Goold’s tenure:Elerian’s exquisite revivalof Eugene Ionesco’s The Chairs, a production of Jeremy O Harris’sDaddy: A Melodrama, featuring a giant swimming pool across the span of the stage. And, of course,The Years, which is one of the best plays I have seen in the past five years – and in which Garai also featured. So several circularities – and the promise of a very strong swansong indeed.Explore more on these topicsTheatreRupert GooldAlmeida theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And we can’t wait to show all of you why.”FTX, one of world’s best-known cryptocurrency exchange platforms with an A-list roster of celebrity proponents, collapsed in spectacular fashion in 2022 after a run on customer withdrawals revealed amissing $8bn in customer funds.Bankman-Fried, a leading proponent of the movement known as “effective altruism” and a major donor to both political parties, wasconvictedin November 2023 on seven charges of fraud and conspiracy; he wasorderedto forfeit $11bn in assets and spend 25 years in prison.Ellison, who was CEO of FTX’s associated hedge fund Alameda Research, as well as Bankman-Fried’s on-and-off girlfriend,served as the star prosecution witnessafter pleading guilty to other charges.The Altruists marks a return for Garner to Netflix – she played another notorious scammer, Anna Delvey, in the 2022 seriesInventing Anna, and won three Emmys for her role on the Netflix hit Ozark.

Q review – this excellent crime drama is a grimy, gothic treatAfter getting another officer killed, a detective is forced to head up a cold-case department in a dank basement. This Scotland-based adaptation of Jussi Adler-Olsen’s Danish crime novels is fantastic, rich TVLucy ManganThu 29 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 13.29 EDTShareIt must be so galling for an actor to be blessed with just the right face for one kind of part. Galling for good actors anyway. Pretty sweet for the others – “You need a face someone would definitely kill for? Put this useless hunk/babe in there and just move the scenery round them.”Matthew Goode is, nomenclaturally and otherwise, one of the former, but cursed with a face best described as “modern patrician” and has therefore been the first port of call for just about every period drama there has been for the last 20 years. He’s been in everything from Brideshead Revisited (as Charles Ryder) on the big screen, toDownton Abbey(Henry Talbot) and The Crown (where at least he got to play that bounder Lord Snowdon) on the small one. Judging by the relish with which he seizes the chance to play contemporary and ignoble in his new outing, the psychological thriller Dept. Q, he must have been going quietly mad with frustration throughout.Goode takes the part of detective Carl Morck in this excellent adaptation by Scott Frank (The Queen’s Gambit, plus innumerable hit films as a credited writer or uncredited rewriter) of the Danish crime novelist Jussi Adler-Olsen’s bestselling series of the same name. Morck may have a flair for the job, but he is a terrible man and colleague. After his ceaseless arrogance gets a young uniformed officer killed, and his own partner paralysed by a bullet that then passes through Morck’s own neck, he is put on long-term leave and must wrestle, possibly for the first time in his egocentric life, with the idea of his mortality. This is accompanied with a rising guilt that he fights every step of the way; watching the latter perfuse his soul as the nine episodes unfold is at least as compelling as the dense, twisty, cleverly structured and hideous plot playing out above it.When Morck returns unwelcomed to work, he is assigned to head a new department (the Q of the title). It is set up to investigate cold cases, in the hope of providing good optics for the troubled Edinburgh police force (granite and gothic are subbed in for snowy Nordic bleakness, which works a treat) while they work on unyielding new ones, including the search for Morck’s attacker. His new office is located in the dank, grimy basement beneath the station, so that’s Morck told. Oh, and he also turns out to be the entire department, as his boss allocates its supposed funds to the cash-strapped officers above ground.Gradually, he assembles a motley crew to help him. It includes: cadet Rose (Leah Byrne), recovering from a breakdown and hoping to get away from the desk duty she has been given; Morck’s partner DI James Hardy (Jamie Sives), operating from his hospital bed; and Syrian refugee and former police officer Akram Salim (Alexej Manvelov), who picks their first case – the disappearance four years ago of ambitious young advocate Merritt Linguard (Chloe Pirrie). For the audience, her story – which I think stays the right side of voyeuristic, though it is occasionally a close call – runs in parallel to the main, though the claustrophobic may have to watch some of it through their fingers.It is all fantastically well, and rigorously, done. The pacing has a leisurely confidence that some may find a touch slow, but allows for a character-first approach, creating a richness that amply rewards initial patience. Soon, we are immersed in a narrative that involves a missing necklace, a brutal historic beating, the perils of isolated village life, urban horrors and institutional failings ranging from simple incompetence to outright corruption. Plus a plentiful dash of the mental, emotional and physical suffering human beings are capable of inflicting on one another, in the name of love, revenge or just for the sheer fun of it.The performances – which also include Mark Bonnar as Linguard’s unsettling boss and Kelly Macdonald as Morck’s unfortunate but mandated police therapist, Dr Irving – are all first rate. (Goode, as the bearded, gaunt, increasingly haunted detective, is the blackly shining centrepiece.) The script is sharp and lean, and especially good at channelling Morck’s spitting sarcasm. Writers Chandni Lakhani and Stephen Greenhorn enable the audience to thrill to his keen and ever-whetted edge while also making us sympathise with the colleagues who would rejoice to see him head over the side of the same ferry from which Linguard supposedly fell. A slightly harrowing treat, but a treat all the same.Dept. Q is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

The women at the pistol range, mostly late-middle age and grandmotherly, were reacting to rhetoric from Richard Nixon’s presidential campaign, which fixated on a so-called crime wave. They were scared, defensive, willing to pick up a gun as a guard against what Nixon called “cities enveloped in smoke and flame”.The neighboring city of Detroit was 40% Black, and the “crime” supposedly overtaking US cities meant, in this context, Black people, and white suburbia’s racist fear of them. Nixon knew this, though he didn’t say it outright – “You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the Blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to,” he once said, as quoted in the opening minutes of White with Fear, a newdocumentaryon decades ofRepublicanpolitical strategy to stoke and manipulate white racial resentment.‘We need to do something’: the company releasing Palestinian films no one else willRead moreAs White with Fear immediately makes clear with footage of the old ladies with their pistols braided into clips of contemporary Republican “migrant crime” soundbites, the political tradition of dog-whistling white fear remains strong. The only difference between Dearborn housewives with, as a 1968 newscaster put it, “suburbia’s new tranquilizer”, and the viral photo of a white Missouri couple pointing an AR-15 at Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020, is the quality of the footage and the openness of the hostility.That couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, went on to speak at the 2020 Republican national convention and folded easily in Donald Trump’s “Make America great again” (Maga) movement, which harnessed and turbocharged the “white fear industrial complex”, as CNN host Brian Stelter put it in the film. Over 90 minutes, White with Fear traces the development and success of said complex post 1968, when Nixon rode the so-called “southern strategy” – subtly endorsing racial segregation, discrimination and resentment to court erstwhile white voters in the South – to the White House. Nixon’s approach demonstrated that “when you appeal to whites on the basis of race, they will go all the way to changing their political party,” said Andrew Goldberg, the film’s director. “Nixon takes this slightly used strategy and puts it on steroids and makes it national policy.”And it stayed national policy, at least as a conditional strategy of the right and propellant of the ongoing culture wars. White with Fear outlines numerous waves of the white fear industrial complex, such as anti-bussing actions in the 1970s, the popularity and endurance of Fox News, the post-September 11 anti-Muslim agenda, the Obama birtherism conspiracies first propagated by the US president, all the way through to the current Maga movement built on 55 years of Republican dog-whistling.“Back in the 60s and 70s, they’d say: ‘I’m not talking about Blacks, I’m talking about bussing,’” said Goldberg. “Now you would say: ‘I’m not talking about Chinese people, I’m talking about Covid.’” (Trump, of course, called the virus “kung flu” as president.) “Or: ‘I’m not talking about Muslims, I’m talking about terrorism.’ But after we’ve used those phrases so much, who comes to mind?”“These are words that are silent about race. And yet, when you say the word ‘thug’, who do you think about?” he added. For most white Americans, there’s an association with the color of one’s skin. “And that’s the nature of how these words are dangerous.”The film differentiates between the emotions provoked in white constituents, and the cynical political thinking that sees such emotions as a way to win elections. “From a strategic point of view, there’s a certain intelligence to how they approach this, and it’s very successful,” said Goldberg.Steve Bannon, a chief architect of Trump’s anti-immigrant campaign strategy, appears in the film to confirm an approach based around the idea of appealing to white voters scared of outsiders and alienated by the Democratic party. “They’re so willing to talk about it,” said a bemused Goldberg. “They don’t blur the actions, as if they’re trying to make it sound less or more virtuous or not. Bannon just loves to tell you what he does.”Goldberg spoke to several former or current Republican operatives who attest to numerous examples of politicians knowingly stoking racial resentment, includingformer Breitbart writer Katie McHugh; Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesperson for the Oath Keepers who defected andwarnedagainst the rising risks of rightwing militant groups; and former Fox News host Carl Cameron. “We really tried to avoid having a collection of Democratic pundits pointing their finger and making accusations of Republicans,” said Goldberg. “It was so important to us to have as many first-person sources who told us whattheydid. Or if there was an opinion to be cast on a situation, we wanted to get a Republican, or at least a former Republican, to tell us that story.”The Six Billion Dollar Man review – WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s rise, fall and limboRead moreThe stories are indicative of a line of political thinking that has only grown more dominant and cynical. Tim Miller, a former Republican National Committee spokesperson who was one of the early GOP critics of Trump in 2016, remembers how Republican campaign mailers in 2008 referred to the Democratic candidate as “Barack Hussein Obama” because “Hussein” drove engagement among older white voters. McHugh recalls working directly with Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of policy and arguably the most racist andextremistof his advisers, while a writer at Breitbart. A political consultant expresses no moral qualm with dog-whistling, as the job of a political consultant is to attract as many votes as possible, motivation irrelevant. At one point, Goldberg asks Sam Nunberg, a 2016 Trump campaign staffer, why Trump doesn’t do normal Republican talking points like small government and lower taxes. He responds: “Because that shit is boring and we’re not going to win! Straight up policy? That’s Mitt Romney, and we’re not winning.”What is winning, at least at the moment, is outright racial baiting – decrying “migrant crime” that doesn’t exist, claiming that immigrants who are in factreviving US citiesare instead “destroying” them, fanning flames that critical race theory is hurting children, in the latest mutation of fear-based rhetoric that has converted moresuburban mothers into rightwing political activistsviaMoms for Liberty. Even Hillary Clinton, who appears briefly to comment on the rise of Trumpism, concedes that “it’s brilliant” to stoke fears that books with diverse characters could threaten the safety of white children.Some do believe it; many others know better. “The amount of planning and strategy that goes into all these actions are designed to keep the base engaged,” Goldberg noted. “When you win elections, you hold power. This is all a cynical ploy to hold power.”White with Fear is available to rent digitally in the US on 3 June with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsRaceBlack Lives Matter movementBlack US cultureMichiganRepublicansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are certainly ambitious works with which to launch a recording career on Supraphon, but Tomáš Vrána is undoubtedly dauntless; his performances are full of confidence, verve and faultless technical accomplishment. At times, though, they do seem rather sluggish; Vrána’s tempi are often on the slow side, but the textures from the Janáček Philharmonic tend to be rather muddy too, though there is plenty of neat, alert solo playing from its wind and brass. For all his keyboard agility, Vrána seems to be at most imaginative in the concertos’ slow movements, especially the central Adagio of the second, one of the most atmospheric examples of Bartók’s “night music”, to which he adds wonderful colour and subtlety. The excellent sleeve notes are also written by Vrána himself.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Gibbons, who was born in Oxford in 1583, was one of the last significant English madrigalists, and is often viewed as a transitional figure between Renaissance music and the baroque, though historically he has been overshadowed by the more prolificWilliam Byrd, with whom he may have studied.View image in fullscreenMy Days: Orlando Gibbons and Nico Muhly.As well as vocal works, Gibbons wrote a wealth of string chamber music, and Fretwork’s selection includes Fantasias in two, three, four, five and six parts, as well as a Pavan and Galliard for six viols. Placed at the centre of the sequence isNico Muhly’sMy Days,originally commissioned for Fretwork and the Hilliard Ensemble; it’s a setting for four male voices and viols of Psalm 39, with an extract from a report on the autopsy that was performed on Gibbons; Muhly describes the result as “a ritualised memory piece about Orlando Gibbons”.Muhly’s composition, with its urgent string figures, contrasts beautifully with the flowing imitations of Gibbons’ fantasias, around it. Its vocal lines are built out of a single falling melodic figure, with the quartet of counter tenor, two tenors and baritone moving in luminous rhythmic unison through the psalm, before the autopsy is delivered as a series of Gibbons-like responses, until a final section with the voices surrounded by plucked strings before settling on the words “my days”, with the viols fluttering around them. It sets off the string pieces around it, perfectly.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

It seems unlikely, to say the least, thatJohn Legendknew this when choosing Glasgow to open his Get Lifted 20th Anniversary world tour. Still, his appearance is appropriately arresting, strolling on stage in the sort of dazzling white suit that looked so fine on Marvin Gaye and Al Green. “Can I be sexy tonight?” he asks – the very definition of a rhetorical question – ahead of She Don’t Have to Know, a breezy ode to cheating.The tour is a celebration of his classic debut, an album that announced Legend as a soul man who could, it seemed, be spoken of in the same breath as giants of the genre. In his 20s when Get Lifted was released, he’s now 46: a middle-aged star playing the songs of a hungry – and horny – young musician; a husband and father singing of infidelity and reconciliation.Perhaps because he no longer feels the words he wrote back then, there’s something bloodless about much of the performance. He is a wonderful singer and his nine-piece band skilled, but the set is drilled to the point of being dull. Legend is a former management consultant – as he mentioned during one of the interminable “my musical journey” talky bits – and one suspects that somewhere backstage is a PowerPoint plotting every priapic strut and yelp.

His parents divorced when he was two, after which he and his mother moved in with his grandparents in the South Bronx, where violence and drugs were rife. One day, six-year-old Pacino was playing outside with his friends when he saw an ambulance pull up outside his grandparents’ tenement. He ran towards the building “and there, coming out of the front doors, carried on a stretcher, was my mother. She had attempted suicide.”Pacino, now 85, is our gravel-voiced narrator and his performance here is wonderful: warm, fitfully jovial and more intimate than you might expect from an actor who has spent much of his life keeping the public at arm’s length. As well as detailing early traumas – Pacino’s mother died when he was 22 from an accidental overdose – Sonny Boy covers the actor’s burgeoning love of cinema (his mother used to sneak him into movie theatres when he was little) and his time as a struggling theatre actor working menial jobs before finding fame with The Godfather.Though the book is short on details about his recent life, it digs satisfyingly deep into his acting career. While appearing in a stage version of Strindberg’s Creditors, Pacino suddenly had an epiphany: “Words are coming out, and they’re the words of Strindberg, but I’m saying them as though they’re mine. The world is mine, and my feelings are mine, and they’re going beyond the South Bronx. I left the familiar. I became part of something larger.”Further listeningDreams: The Many Lives of Fleetwood MacMark Blake, WF Howes Ltd, 12hr 58 minThis wildly entertaining account of the life and loves of Fleetwood Mac is read by David Thorpe.The PartyTessa Hadley, Penguin Audio, 2hr 54minThe Free Love author reads her novella, set in the late 1940s, in which two sisters attend a party in the Bristol docks and grapple with the constraints and freedoms of early adulthood.Explore more on these topicsAutobiography and memoirAudiobook of the weekAl PacinoAudiobooksShareReuse this content"

Now we all have a set of preformed mental images of things we might never have seen – or won’t ever see – in real life, from plane crashes to zombie apocalypses. Sometimes, a novel comes along with a climactic scene that’s so exact a fit for a particular movie’s aesthetic (Ghostbusters, in this case: we’re talking angry spooks! SFX! Manhattan!) that it’s practically an extension of the franchise. Daria Lavelle’s debut is an amalgamation of hypermodern satire, slushy romance and savvy cultural allusion that is as vigorously brought together as its lead character’s recipes.Konstantin “Kostya” Duhovny has been plagued since childhood with a strange affliction. Tastes he has never experienced invade his mouth. He seems to be having other people’s food memories. But whose? A lowly restaurant dishwasher, he has a big advantage over the other kitchen serfs: pinning down these evanescent flavours has given him a huge repertoire of tastes and techniques, fast-tracking his culinary skills, and soon he is rising in New York’s haute restaurant scene.When he recreates a cocktail he has fleetingly tasted, a ghost appears, sending Kostya in panic to a psychic, who luckily turns out to be a beautiful young woman. Goth girl Maura offers a diagnosis: what he suffers from is clairgustance, which allows him to taste the favourite foods of the departed,connecting him with the dead. As movie lore dictates, Maura and Kostya can’t link romantically just yet. Dispatching him with a baleful warning never to repeat the experiment, she disappears from the narrative – for now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

An episode with Kostya meandering glumly through a pretentious sea-themed pop-up nightclub is also terrific in its caustic observation of hipster types. Chapter headings uphold the culinary theme: Mise en Places, Entrée, Backburners, as well as the more intriguing Hard to Swallow and Discomfort Food. Working at Saveur Fare, an El Bulli-style gastrodome, Kostya experiments with menus in spare moments, then opens his own secret supper club, promising punters the chance of a final meeting with a departed loved one. Sometimes full materialisation ensues, sometimes it doesn’t, but a mystery investor gets wind and offers an upgrade: Kostya’s own restaurant.Interpolated passages in italics represent the banter of an overeager tour guide to “The Konstantin Duhovny Culinary Experience” (“All right! How we doing? Getting a taste for our guy’s secret sauce?”). The moment when we twig just who is leading the tour is expertly timed. Maura and Kostya soon reconnect, but it’s strange that someone who can write so scathingly about the sillier aspects of modern life can also come up with dialogue like this: “No! Konstantin, that isn’t – that might be how it started, but it isn’t how it stayed! I fell for you. It would have been so much easier if I hadn’t.”Hungry spirits are now jostling for attention and the veil between worlds is fraying. There has already been a sneaky reference to Ghostbusters, and sentences such as “A waiter slipped behind a thick velvet curtain, only to be driven out by a cackling ghost” suggest that Bill Murray and crew will charge through the door at any moment. But the novel is seasoned with plenty of imagination, pathos and novelty: it even updates the famous literary principle of Chekhov’s gun in foodie terms, but I won’t spoil that particular innovation. Aftertaste pulls together familiar elements of romance and the supernatural, adding a dash of Anthony Bourdain-style bullishness and a pinch of Davelle’s own authorial smarts. I’ll bet there’s a run on fleur de sel right after publication day.Aftertaste by Daria Lavelle is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

How, in the early 1960s, he gave LSD to his psychology students at Harvard, to the inmates of a maximum-security jail to see whether it would stop them reoffending, to artists such as Charlie Mingus and Allen Ginsberg to map how it expanded their creativity.The Beatles’ song Tomorrow Never Knows was based on his writings. Mick Jagger flew to Altamont in a helicopter with him. He had perma-smile good looks, evangelical patter and likened himself to Socrates and Galileo. He even had a Pied Piper invitation: “Turn on, tune in, drop out”. No wonder Richard Nixon believed he was “the most dangerous man in America”.What of Rosemary Woodruff? She was the fourth of his five wives, helping take care of his children in the long wake of their mother’s suicide. She buffed the branding of the self-styled “wisest man of the 20th century”. She fitted him with a hearing aid and sewed his clothing. She helped write speeches and the books that made him a must-read for any would-be prankster or beatnik. In 1970, she aided his escape from prison after he had been landed with a 30-year sentence for possessing drugs. She herself was forced underground for two decades. So much has been written about Leary, observes Susannah Cahalan: why so little about Woodruff?Her life had been eventful long before she met the US’s most notorious trip adviser. She was born in 1935 in St Louis, Missouri to a father – Victor the Magician – who performed card tricks at local taverns, and a mother who was an amateur cryptologist. Early on, Woodruff wanted out. She needed, she said, “things to be grander than they were in my little neighbourhood, in my little home”. She decamped to New York, took amphetamines to ensure she was skinny enough to be hired as a stewardess for the Israeli airline El Al, and landed an uncredited role in a naval comedy called Operation Petticoat.She zigzagged through Afghanistan where she used a burqa to hide contrabandWoodruff was looking for otherness. She read Antonin Artaud and science fiction, explored theosophy, smoked cannabis and hung out at jazz clubs. She married a Dutch accordionist who yelled at and cheated on her; then a tenor saxophonist who, when he wasn’t shooting up, beat her and cheated, too. “I subscribed to ‘the genius and the goddess paradigm’,” she later reflected. “I wanted genius men.” She met Leary at a gallery and was taken by his talk of “audio-olfactory-visual alternations of consciousness”. They shared a ride to a psychedelic commune he’d established in upstate New York. What did she hope to find there, he asked. “Sensual enjoyment and mental excitement.” “What else?” “To love. You, I suppose.”The following years are the stuff of legend. Leary titillated and horrified the US in equal measure, telling Playboy readers that women would have hundreds of orgasms during sex on LSD, and claiming that the drug would “blacken” white people so that they could pursue “a pagan life of natural fleshly pleasure”. When he ran for the governorship of California against an actor called Ronald Reagan, Woodruff devised the campaign slogan: “Come together, join the party”. Lauded for her cheekbones and elegance, she fed the press zingy one-liners, and was, says Cahalan, “a natural high priestess”.Does this add up to the greatness that Cahalan believes Woodruff sublimated during her life with Leary? Cahalan describes him as a “so-called psychedelic guru” and “a sweet-talking snake charmer”. Does that make her heroine a gull? Cahalan astutely observes that, for much of the 1960s, “women were confidantes, calming tethers for the men to embark on frightening journeys into the psychic unknown”. In practice this meant, even when they were on the run, Woodruff ensured Leary never lacked for smoked oysters and fine wines.Like the children of many LSD proselytisers, Leary’s son, Jack, got high at a young age. Home life was chaotic. He was so hungry and tired by the time he got to school that he could barely read the blackboard. Meanwhile, Leary’s daughter, Susan, taunted Woodruff for being “frigid and barren”, and played Donovan’s Season of the Witch at maximum volume for hours on end. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, she later killed herself in jail while awaiting trial on charges of shooting her sleeping boyfriend in the head. This is what Yippies co-founder Abbie Hoffman meant when he told Leary: “Your peace-and-love bullshit is leading youth down the garden path of fascism … ripe for annihilation.”Biographies of lesser-known figures often end up high on their own supply. Their subjects are reappraised as radical, transformative, historical missing links. Cahalan is pleasingly sharp and satiric. She characterises some of Leary’s extended circle as “people who belittled their maids, fed their tiny dogs with silverware, and complained of the cost of shipping priceless art overseas”. Was Leary a visionary who foresaw today’s boom in microdosing? “Psychedelics have become too big not to fail,” Cahalan writes. “The twin issues that helped curtail the study of these substances in the 1960s are back: evangelism and hubris.”Woodruff and Leary divorced in 1976, but her later life was far from boring. Travelling on a “World Passport”, a document created by peace activists, she zigzagged through Afghanistan where she used a burqa to hide contraband; travelled to Catania where she met a count and “made love in a secret grotto by a waterfall, drank grape brandy, and helped raise chickens”; to Colombia where she had encounters with venomous spiders and drug cartels. For many years she lay low in the US, lacking social security or health insurance, “an exile in her native land”. Only in 1994 was she able to emerge from hiding. While she never did publish the memoir she’d been working on for many years, The Acid Queen is a fond, imaginatively researched tribute to her free, forever-seeking spirit.The Acid Queen: The Psychedelic Life and Counterculture Rebellion of Rosemary Woodruff Leary by Susannah Cahalan is published by Canongate (£22).

Emerging from woodlands on the Goodwood Estate in West Sussex, you see a massive concrete cast of a staircase in a lush green field – a spectacular, surreal collision of urban grit and English pastoral. This is Rachel Whiteread’s Down and Up, a brutal intruder in the landscape.Leafy woods and glorious views – I contemplated Down and Up through a veil of rain but was assured you can see down to the sea on a sunny day – create a dramatic setting for her stark sepulchres. In a forest clearing stands another work, Untitled (Pair) – two bone-white rectangular slabs that look like death. That’s no accident, for their shallow concave tops were cast from mortuary tables. Alone with this monument, the tall trees standing guard around me, I don’t so much ponder mortality as silently scream.House, the famous, lost masterpiece that won Whiteread the 1993 Turner prize, also once stood in the open air, as ungainly and insistent against an east London sky as these remorseless objects look in a much more tranquil context. It wasdemolished in a culture warthat’s forgotten now, but Whiteread is no sensationalist. Her art hits you for a moment with harsh modernism, but then – unless you refuse to look and feel, as the local council did – its sombre poetry creeps up on you.Down and Up is cast from an old staircase in a synagogue in Bethnal Green, east London. You can see why these stairs fascinate her: they are curiously narrow and sloped, as if pushed out of shape by multitudes of long-gone feet. Odd, baffling details like this give her art warmth and passion, while the blank masses of cast material, in this case grey concrete, fill it with silence and terror. You can’t care about life, her art suggests, without recognising death. She sees ghosts everywhere.View image in fullscreenDetached II by Whiteread at Goodwood Art Foundation.Photograph: Lucy Dawkins/Courtesy of the Goodwood Art FoundationHer exhibition launches the GoodwoodArtFoundation. In its low-slung, partly glass-walled gallery, Whiteread’s eye for decay and loss infects a new series of brightly coloured but emotionally serious photographs. Wherever she goes, in Essex or Italy, Whiteread in these pictures sees the crack in the teacup, the rusty stain on the mosaic floor. She notices bin bags like shrouds, a rotting community centre that refuses to be picturesque.Sometimes their foreboding is a bit false, even descending into bathos. We can all be spooked by crows gathering on a telephone wire and sometimes an abandoned child’s toy is just that, however wretched it looks on the doorstep.Yet this is how Whiteread’s imagination works: she sees a continuum between everyday melancholia and collective grief. In 2023, she had a show in Bergamo, Italy – which was severely hit by Covid – creating tombstone-like sculptures to mourn the lost. Some are here. Based on casts of the spaces under chairs – a favourite Whiteread motif – they are marked by recesses where legs and struts once were.View image in fullscreenPhotos of Carmarthenshire, Wales.Photograph: © Rachel Whiteread. Courtesy the artist and Gagosian/© The artistShe aspires to public monuments yet also flees into secret recesses of introspection and memory – which is why a pastoral landscape is such a resonant setting for her art. Two photographs in the gallery show rotting, abandoned places, a shed and a caravan, in each of which someone seems to have lived a hermitic existence, but these shelters rust and rot away, surrendering to weeds. In front of them she recreates this spectacle of solitude and dissolution in her sculpture Doppelgänger, a reconstruction of a smashed, forgotten shack, its broken walls pierced by fallen branches, painted in white emulsion, a ghostly covering that with brilliant simplicity makes reality metamorphosise into art.Outside in the woods, at the end of a long, narrow vista, she has placed a concrete cast of a sealed shed, its windows opaque, its door closed for ever. You feel more and more alone walking around it, trying to find the way in. It is called Detached II. This is a poem to solitude and here in the garden, surrounded by unruly spring growth, it feels as eccentric and lost as the rotting caravan and shack in her photographs. Dissolution and decay are part of nature. They are also part of our lives and time’s arrow only points one way. Thoughts like these are not consoling but they feel as if they belong in the woods, like intoxicating mushrooms of melancholy.Whiteread is a great modern artist and her sculptures blight this pastoral, beautifully.Rachel Whiteread’s exhibitionis at Goodwood Art Foundation from 31 May to 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsSculptureRachel WhitereadArtMuseumsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Two sisters, Kamaljit (Kiran Landa) and Surinder (Anoushka Deshmukh), first come together to share dreams and intimacies and then head in opposing directions, into estrangement, after their father (Jaz Singh Deol) dies and their mother (Avita Jay) begins organising their arranged marriages.It is charming in its essence, bubbling with spirited performances and smart period costumes (1970s era cardi-and-trouser combos with shalwar kameez) set alongside an elegant stage design by Good Teeth – the Bains’ home folds out from flatness and then turns into their shop in a few deft steps.But flatness remains elsewhere, while the story sprawls. The many meaty themes here feel unwieldy and too briefly touched on while the narrative unity of the original story is lost in an exuberant but untethered adaptation by Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti. The production ranges widely and loosely, not finding its emotional fulcrum, with characters who seem cut from generic 70s sitcom cloth.Dialogue is beached by exposition and short scenes that telegraph plot above all else. Mr Bains talks about his dreams of being a Somebody in Britain; “What about my life?” says Surinder, who wants to be more than the wife of a Somebody, and her teacher reminds us that the Vikings were immigrants too. It is all too baldy stated in primary colours, with comedy that does not land hard or sharply enough.The first act is emotionally brisk so we do not connect enough with characters to feel their jolts, from the daily indignities of racism to untimely death and family woes. The second is strangely plodding, although it brings more emotion, certainly in the meeting between the sisters after estrangement.Time and perspective changes between the first and second halves of the play leave you more unmoored around its focus. Is it a drama about the limits placed on the women of this community or an exploration of cross-generational assimilation? Surinder’s relationship with a controlling white British man is interesting but underexplored. Arjan’s mixed race relationship feels tacked on, with passing reflections on what sounds like theTebbit cricket testby Kamaljit’s husband Tanvir.Its spirit of levity is reminiscent ofEast is East, whose fabulous stage incarnation was directed by Iqbal Khan, who directs here too, as well as, to some degree, Emma Rice’s adaptation of Hanif KureishiThe Buddha of Suburbia. But it feels like Kureishi lite, paler for the comparison.It does exude a warm energy in its more successful first act and there is lovely evocation of time and place through music, from the dhols of Arjan’s grandparents’ generation to period pop (Sugar, Honey, Honey, etc). This cannot make up for the holes in its drama, which skates too lightly across all the surfaces and never quite forms a centre.At theLyric, Hammersmith, until 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreLyric HammersmithBritish identity and societyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the composer’s own springy numbers are the best reason to catch this rarely seen musical based on ancient Greek satire.Aristophanes, writing at the fag end of a protracted war, conjures demigod Dionysos, accompanied by Xanthias, his slave (“though I prefer ‘intern’”). He braves the underworld to reclaim a dead genius, picking Aeschylus over Euripides. The musical’s Dionysos considers George Bernard Shaw, but eventually plumps for Shakespeare.Originally staged at Yale in 1974 (Sondheim: “One of the few deeply unpleasant professional experiences I’ve had”), it was expanded for Broadway in 2004 (Sondheim: “It suffered from inflation”). The extended version takes a jape too far.We open with the best number: a fanfare plus jaunty injunctions to the audience (“Please – don’t fart. / There’s very little air and this is art”). Dan Buckley’s droll Dionysos and Kevin McHale’s Xanthias, all wriggle and snicker, begin their quest, though Burt Shevelove’s book makes scenes feel more like skits. Herakles (Joaquin Pedro Valdes) is a himbo totting up his abs, the boatman Charon (Carl Patrick) a lugubrious stoner and Pluto, lord of the underworld, has a breathy cabaret number delivered by regal guest star Victoria Scone in a brushed steel bouffant.View image in fullscreenOn a quest … The Frogs at Southwark Playhouse.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe musical never develops Dionysos’ daddy issues or frog phobia, or nails its notion that the ribbiting amphibians represent stick-in-the-mud grouches impervious to change. The frogs get a waddling ballet, in goggles, bobble toes and spangly waistcoats – choreographer Matt Nicholson devises nifty, wide-legged moves. But Shaw’s battle with Shakespeare, trading smug aphorism and voluptuous word-painting, is an awful slog, unleavened by Georgie Rankcom’s heavy-footed production.“You can stop rhyming right there,” snaps Dionysos, but it would take more than a testy god to halt Sondheim, for whom rhyme was reason. “Hippy-dippy insurrectionists” meet “hasty pasty-faced perfectionists,” while a song to Shaw moves from animosity through pomposity to verbosity. Melancholy songs also slide between the shtick (Sondheim has a bittersweet tooth). The god’s final call to arms can’t give gravity to this show – but however stodgy the setting, the songs still shine.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsStephen SondheimTheatreSouthwark PlayhouseAristophanesreviewsShareReuse this content"

She was born in Ethiopia, but also lived in Yemen, Cyprus, Canada and, for a short time, England. There was a spell in Sunderland for about eight months when she was six: “My mother was dating a guy from the UK,” she says. “I have very distinct memories of England. I went to school briefly, but I didn’t really speak any English. I remember the cold and the grey skies.”More than 40 years later, Muluneh returns to the UK, invited by Impressions Gallery to make new work across Bradford, Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow for this year’s UK City of Culture programme. Comprising 22 images, The Necessity of Seeing was made over a month-long road trip. She crammed all her equipment into two cars and a minivan, along with a mobile studio, painted backdrops and clothing brought over from Africa, and five core crew members. “It was basically like getting a crash course in UK history and contemporary life,” says Muluneh.The resulting images explore themes such as gender, labour, religion and diaspora. Incorporating pieces of each city’s architectural landmarks – from cathedrals and mosques to cotton mills and war memorials – Muluneh connects historic wounds with contemporary struggles. The decline of industry, the history of labour union movements, women’s rights, and the exploitation of immigrants: in these images, as in reality, everything is connected.The artist shining a light on water poverty in Ethiopia – in picturesRead moreThis work is now part of a touring exhibition, Nationhood: Memory and Hope,shown alongside A Portrait of Us, 15 black-and-white portraits of “unsung heroes” in each city, made by Muluneh, as well as a presentation of seven emerging British photographers.Muluneh’s journey around the UK required a lot of planning, as well as learning, talking and translating her reflections into art. “Being prepared allows me to tap into another part of my mind,” she says. “Along the way, I’d find other things I hadn’t expected, just from simple conversations.”These conversations, as well as each city’s unique social and urban fabric, make up all the layers of meaning in Muluneh’s work. “I’m creating my own universe within an existing reality and reshaping it to reflect how I was feeling at the time,” she says. The title, The Necessity of Seeing, is emblematic of the deep political awareness driving Muluneh’s work. “Growing up displaced has given me a kind of anger that fuels my work,” she says. “I’ve always been drawn to communities dealing with division and cultural identity. My aim wasn’t to come here and try to reflect something I don’t fully understand. I can only reflect my experiences of trying to understand the complexity of the UK – what I saw, witnessed and felt.”What she felt most of all, Muluneh says, was division. “But within that, everyone is facing the same challenges,” she says. “I was looking at what women and children went through in the Industrial Revolution, while also thinking about slavery and colonial history. What I realised is that these shared histories have the potential to connect people, rather than divide them.”Location finder: four works by Aïda MulunehThe Handmaid of Hunger, 2024 (main picture above)“For many of us in Africa, it’s hard to imagine that a country like the UK has people going hungry.

She said her daughter felt really comfortable wearing a hijab, because no one stared at her.

It’s no wonder, perhaps, she went on to a career playing quirky characters in quirky comedies. She was a bridesmaid in 2011’s Bridesmaids, the bride-to-be in 2012’s Bachelorette, and an eccentric employee at a breastfeeding boutique in What to Expect When You’re Expecting from the same year. She starred alongside Anne Hathaway in The Hustle, the female-centred remake of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. She was the ginger tabby cat Jennyanydots in 2019’s ill-fated Cats, and played Fat Amy in all three (so far) Pitch Perfect movies.Wilson now stars as Lady Capulet in the forthcoming Shakespeare-inspired musical Juliet & Romeo, the very title of which would have your old English teacher tutting with disapproval. Rupert Everett stars as Lord Capulet, Derek Jacobi as the Friar, and Jason Isaacs as Lord Montague.This turn to (relatively) highbrow material shouldn’t necessarily be a surprise. Wilson originally studied to be a lawyer and moved to the US after winning an acting scholarship funded by Nicole Kidman, and had Matt Lucas as a Hollywood flatmate. She’s presented the MTV movie awards, launched her own plus-sized clothing range, and won $250,000 for charity on the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Wilson has said she decided to become an actor after catching malaria and hallucinating that she had won an Oscar.So: did Prince Williamfind her royal jokes funnythat time she presented at the Baftas? And did she reallysnogElton John at an Oscars after-party? Only you can ask.

(The first time was summer 2023, on the strength ofBarbenheimer.) To be clear, this wouldn’t guarantee an all-time summer record; the numbers would need to get a lot closer to $5bn for that to happen. But something in the $4bn range would be closer to pre-pandemic business as usual, in line with most of the 2010s.Is it curtains up on a new generation on Broadway?Read moreGiven the struggles so many movie theaters and studios have faced while hoping to find their way back to that old sense of normal, it’s surprising to learn that a different and far pricier style of box office record was just shattered. The 2024-2025 Broadway season is ending up as thehighest-grossing in history, its $1.89bn surpassing the 2018-2019 season’s $1.82bn. Given the specialized nature of Broadway productions – they’re less accessible, more expensive, and frankly less physically comfortable than going to the movies, even just within New York City – this seems like a spectacular triumph. What happened?Some of that boost can probably be attributed to the proliferation ofstarry, limited productions with sky-high prices. But unlike cinemas, which can usually add more showtimes to meet any outsized demand, there are ultimately limits on how much a handful of shows can contribute to the total. George Clooney’s Broadway debut inGood Night, and Good Luckrecently set an individual weeklong record and has raked in a ton of money. Yetgrossesfor the final week of the season reflect a far deeper bench than just Clooney, Denzel, and the boys ofGlengarry Glen Ross. Other shows playing right around 100% capacity over the holiday weekend include fixtures such as Wicked, Hamilton, and The Lion King; relative newcomers to the musical game such asBuena Vista Social Club,Just in Time,Death Becomes Her, andMaybe Happy Ending; and straight plays – traditionally considered a less tourist-friendly proposition – such asOh, Mary!,Purpose, andJohn Proctor Is the Villain.None of those rely on movie stars; relatively few are even based on movies or past productions, in contrast to the heavy dose of IP regurgitation and uninspired revivals that dottedBroadwayin years past. (In fact, the splashy and effects-packed Stranger Things companion play seems to be doing less overall business than the original drama starring that show’s Sadie Sink.)View image in fullscreenSadie Sink at the John Proctor Is the Villain opening night.Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/REX/ShutterstockSo is it as simple as Broadway offering an unusual number of good and often original shows – or at least balancing out its revivals with major stars while taking chances on crowd-pleasing originals? Yes and no – specifically, “no” to the simple part. Some of the record is probably that lucky break of an unusually strong slate, though that doesn’t necessarily explain an uptick for a production like The Lion King, which has been on the boards for nearly 30 years at this point. For that matter, anyone with a Disney+ subscription can watch the original cast of Hamilton. Maybe this means scarcity, while powerful in supporting high ticket prices, is less important than it seems. In other words, the movies might have helped, in a roundabout way – not just by donating big-screen star power but with the smash success of Wicked over the 2024 holidays, which may have served to remind less dedicated theatergoers (or out-of-towners who don’t have as many chances at a Broadway show) how thrilling it can feel to be in on a cultural phenomenon that isn’t a direct remake or a part eight.That’s what might hold Hollywood off from a record summer, even if 2025 shapes up to be the strongest one in a while. Lilo, Stitch, and Ethan Hunt have proven that remakes and sequels can still sell, but can they sell on a weekly basis for the next three months? The next summer weekend that’s not powered by a sequel or reboot of some sort is ... 22 August. There are certainly more eclectic or original choices available before then: Wes Anderson’s The Phoenician Scheme, Celine Song’s Materialists, and Pixar’s Elio in June alone. The 2024-25 Broadway line-up more closely resembles that kind of eclecticism, rather than the metronomic appearance of supposed sure things. There’s a kind of trust that the audience can sit for a culturally specific, long and frankly kind of messy play likePurpose.That doesn’t always pay off; plenty of great plays don’t do gangbusters business, especially without crucial Tony support. But in its specialized and half-accidental way, Broadway is currently doing a great job of offering material for a variety of demographics. Theater and film will always be an apples-to-oranges comparison – in price, presentation, time commitment and a host of other elements. But both can be, at their best, habit-forming. Right now, Broadway has the big stars, variety of material, and reliable spectacle that used to keep multiplexes full.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayUS theaterTheatreNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Morris’s life was one of contradictions: a radical socialist who was simultaneously a successful businessman designing wallpapers and upholstery for middle class houses andearning £1,800 a year for his troubles(enough to afford his family six servants).View image in fullscreenXaymaca Awoyungbo in Walthamstow.Photograph: Talia WoodinIn many ways contradictions have followed Morris into the afterlife. A manwho warned patronsagainst his imitators andargued that“machines can do everything – except make works of art”, is now being imitated by generative artificial intelligence with the resulting products beingpassed off as art on Etsy and Temu.In a world where Morris’s designs are divorced from his radical thinking and his patterns have come to symbolisea return to traditional Victorian valuesor thoughtlessly adorn cheap mugs, there is one contemporary object that perfectly embodies all that Morris stood for.In 2023 Walthamstow FC, the William Morris Gallery, Wood Street Walls and Admiral Sportswear collaborated to create Walthamstow FC’s 2023-25 home and away kits. It was the first time that a museum had collaborated with a football club on a kit and the result wasone of the best kits of the year, anywhere. Now, I like this kit for a few reasons.First, I’ve lived in Walthamstow all my life. I don’t mean to brag but the first game I ever attended was a Walthamstow FC game (or Waltham Forest as they were known then). Seeing my local club’s kit and learning aboutits ambition to create a women’s teamusing the money raised from kit sales filled me with a great sense of pride.Second, there was something poetic about a side in the eighth tier of English football showing billionaire-backed Premier League outfits how to properly design a football kit. Forget the first kit, copy and pasted from last season; the away kit, a retro remake of the classic 1980s kit; the third kit, a neon number that nobody wears; and the limited edition fourth, a collaboration with a fashion house desperate for a piece of the sweet football pie. Instead, tell a story about a hometown hero and pay homage to football heritage by teaming up with the creators of thefirst replica football kit.Third, and most importantly, the kit is something Morris would probably have approved of. What better way to make art accessible to all than through the game of the people? Giventhe game’s working class roots,the Walthamstow FC kit has achieved what Morris could never quite do in his lifetime: make art that is carefully crafted yet affordable for the masses. “Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful,”Morris said. A shirt that functions as a football kit and a fantastic fashion piece ticks both boxes.So, I decided to direct a documentary about it. Made in Walthamstowexplores the history of replica football kits, the significance of Morris and the power of community in Walthamstow. Featuring the major players in the project – from Hadrian Garrard, the director of theWilliam MorrisGallery, to local MP Stella Creasy – the documentary is a celebration of all it means to be from Walthamstow.It was a real labour of loveand not in the William Morris sense of the phrase. I funded the film, shot the interviews, edited the footage and organised screenings atthe William Morris Gallery, Orford House andForest School.It was all worth it for a story so close to my heart. And, just as Morris would have wanted, the documentary is out now, available for all to see.Made in Walthamstow: a film byXaymaca Awoyungbo.Explore more on these topicsFootballWilliam MorrisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We have lived together for almost five years now and this has been a problem for a while.When I plug my phone in overnight, I often find it uncharged in the morning. It’s very annoying. Or sometimes when I get home from work and fancy playing a game on my laptop, I’ll settle down on the sofa with my snacks ready, and there will be no charge on my laptop. I then have to get off the sofa and recharge it. Now I make Amber get up to plug my laptop in if she’s unplugged it.She says it’s a minor inconvenience, but waking up to go to work with an uncharged phone ruins your day. She’s also done it with my electric toothbrush – I’ve gone to brush my teeth before work and found it dead.Amber says it’s for safety, but then why does she unplug things in such an inconsistent way?I never know what is going to be unplugged. Sometimes she switches off sockets at the wall; other times she physically unplugs my chargers.Amber says it’s for safety, but then why does she unplug things in such an inconsistent way? There’s either a fire hazard with all of them or none – I don’t understand her reasoning.Amber’s dad was a firefighter and he drilled this stuff into her. I get that there are safety guidelines but there aren’t fires breaking out all over the place because people leave their phones charging overnight. When I asked Amber’s dad about it, he was very chilled. He said: “It’s better if you don’t leave things plugged in,” and shrugged.I have house insurance. I’d rather risk burning the house down. Amber thinks I don’t care about our cats getting toasted, but of course I do. I just don’t think there’s much chance of that happening. As a compromise, she now doesn’t turn off switches at the wall. But she still unplugs chargers if she leaves the house and no one is in, so I still find some of my devices uncharged and get irritated.The defence: AmberI would rather unplug things and live with the slight inconvenience than burn the house downI always unplug my chargers before I leave the house – then plug them back in when I get back and actually need to use them. I turn off all Dillon’s stuff too, which annoys him.It’s not about wasting electricity, as the amount a phone charger costs to run is very small; it’s about safety. I’ve always had a habit of turning things off as my dad was a firefighter and used to tell me stories of things catching fire. I probably take fire safety more seriously than Dad does now.Dillon likes to leave his laptop charging overnight, which I think increases the risk of fire. When he comes home and it’s not fully charged, he only has to lean forward maybe half a metre to plug it back in, but he complains. He moans and says to me, “Can you plug it back in?”We’ve been together for six years but this problem has been more pertinent over the last year or so since we got three cats. I’ve always been worried about things catching fire, but I particularly don’t want our cats to be burned alive while we’re out.Phones are not designed to stay on overnight. If I wake up and touch our phone batteries, they’re really hotI’d rather unplug things and be just a little bit inconvenienced than set the house on the fire. Phones aren’t fridges, they are not designed to stay on overnight. If I wake up and touch our phone batteries, they’re really hot.I think Dillon is overreacting. For example, when I unplugged Dillon’s toothbrush, he just used a manual one instead – it wasn’t a big deal.Now as a compromise, if Dillon has left something charging, I will unplug it, but I don’t turn sockets off at the wall any more as that seemed to annoy him more. He would assume the switch at the wall was on and when he realised it wasn’t and something wasn’t charged, he would get upset.From a fire safety perspective, I’d rather err on the side of caution. It’s similar with security: if you don’t double lock your door, it doesn’t mean you will get broken into, but you increase the risk a little by not doing it.The juryof Guardian readersShould Amber stop unplugging things?I get the fear of fires from electronics as I live in an old house, but that is no reason to unplug everything every night. A compromise would be to only buy electronics from certified venders that provide trustworthy devices.Ludovico, 23It seems as though Amber just wants some peace of mind. If she grew up hearing about house fires, they’ve probably stuck with her. It would be much easier for Dillon to charge his devices during the day than for Amber to change her mindset.Amelia, 18As long as you’re using devices that meet high safety requirements, the risk is small. Maybe compromise by unplugging things when you’re both away for a while, but doing so every night is unreasonable.Alan, 52I honestly had never even considered this as an issue before reading this case. But now I’m convinced that Amber is right and this is a fire hazard. I’ll be unplugging all my devices tonight!Anna, 45Amber isn’t guilty as technically she’s right about the fire risk. But she shouldn’t unplug things Dillon thinks are charging without telling him, while he should be more understanding of her concerns (although Amber might want to reflect on whether her habit of unplugging things points to an underlying anxiety).Taylor, 33Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who you think is in the wrong?The poll closes on Wednesday 4 June at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherKady should get a tattooon her travels, like she promised her friend she would.2%of you said yes –Kady is guilty98%of you said no –Kady is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whether your poison is a flat white, a filter or an oat milk latte, a little treat makes easing into the working week significantly less painful.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But habits are changing.More than half of the respondents to a Deloitte study of 7,000 coffee drinkers said price rises have put an end to their coffee pit-stop en route to work. And with a coffee shop cappuccino often commanding prices upwards of £4, it stands to reason that more of us are learning to recreate barista-quality coffee at home.Happily, many wonderful independent coffee shops sell beans for home use. But if your favourite cafe isn’t nearby, or like me, you’re always running out of beans, a coffee subscription could be the answer.With a good coffee subscription, you can enjoy a world of speciality beans without leaving the house – and at a fraction of the cost. From light and bright washed beans with acidic, fruity floral notes to cocoa and caramel-rich blends from Guatemala, Indonesia, Brazil and beyond, there’s a whole flavour wheel to discover. And sometimes by subscribing to these independent coffee brands, you’ll be supporting worthy causes in coffee-producing countries, too.As a long-time coffee fan, I’ve tried a lot of beans over the years. As a rule, I buy whole beans, grind them myself and brew them either in aBialetti stovetop coffee maker, cafetiere or in mySage Barista Pro machine. I drink it black; but there are a few exceptions – like when I fancy a lazy Sunday cappuccino. I tested all of the coffee black and made it using my machine, unless it was in pod format. So, after a heavily caffeinated few weeks, here’s just a selection of my favourite coffees for your drinking pleasure.The best coffee subscriptions in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: gerenme/Getty Images/iStockphotoBest discovery coffee subscription:RaveView image in fullscreenFrom £7 a month at Rave CoffeeI’ve been a fan of Rave for years, and if you’re serious about getting to grips with speciality coffee, it’s the one to choose. With every box, Rave sends useful advice on the best brewing techniques, educates you on varietals, grind, extraction and how to texturise milk, and provides a flavour wheel with tasting cards to help get the most from your coffee.Sign up for theDiscovery Subscriptionand you’ll receive a hard-to-find, single-origin coffee from one of Rave’s 52 chosen farms around the globe, roasted to order and delivered to your door, along with the roastery’s tasting notes. The Tanzanian Mbili Twiga this month was exceptional, if you like dark roast coffee.Best pod subscription:GrindView image in fullscreenFrom £10.69 for 30 pods at GrindSince opening its Shoreditch coffee shop in 2011, Grind has gone from strength to strength, selling sustainable, directly traded coffee everywhere from Soho House to the supermarket. Its house blend is a universally pleasing high-quality coffee that can be taken in beans, ground, pods or cold brew cans; I’m here for the pods. Nespresso-compatible, genuinely delicious and with a decent strength, the pods are also completely compostable – as is all of Grind’s packaging.Choose from 15 different blends, single-origin coffee and flavoured pods, or go for a mixture, then pick out your refillable Grind tin (there’s a special editionClueless tinavailable at the moment). Plus, with each pod, cop or can of coffee sold, the company will recover ocean-bound plastic – to the tune of 60,000kg in 2023.Best multi-brand coffee subscription:RiseView image in fullscreenFrom £13 every four weeks at RiseOne of the joys of coffee is experimenting with different roasteries, beans, processes and types of drinks. If that sounds like you, then a Rise subscription is sure to brighten your mornings. Each month, you’ll receive a selection of ethically sourced coffees from independent UK roasters such as Oxford-based Routes or Tamp in London, which this month produced a sweet, tropical-tasting Colombian coffee I loved black.Rise also throws in cute treats and surprises like a dreamy ready-to-drink pistachio latte, chocolates and other coffee-adjacent goodies. And 1% of your purchase helps to send Ugandan children to school through the FriendlyCoffeeFund.From beer to books: 16 subscription services to save you time and moneyRead moreBest coffee blend subscription:Kiss the HippoView image in fullscreenFrom £9.45 every four weeks at Kiss the HippoKiss the Hippo’s eight coffee shops have some of the best baristas in London, in my opinion. Its coffee never misses the mark, and while most of it is in the mastery of the making, it’s also a delight to have a go yourself using Kiss the Hippo’s signature beans direct from its roastery to your door. Its blends are brilliant, withDonna(dark chocolate, caramel, walnut notes) among its most popular. Try them all, then get your favourite delivered fresh – you won’t regret it.Best healthy coffee subscription:ExhaleView image in fullscreenFrom £16 every four weeks at ExhaleAfter an extended bout of ill health and the discovery that he was developing an autoimmune condition, Exhale co-founder Alex Higham committed to a healthier lifestyle. The realisation that coffee can be contaminated with mycotoxins and pesticides – while losing the good stuff – saw him launch Exhale, an organic, health-focused coffee that harnesses the benefits of the coffee cherry.More lightly roasted but still packing a flavour punch, Exhale’s deliciously nutty dark(ish) roast from Colombia is antioxidant rich, a good source of vitamin B3 and optimised for polyphenols to counter any potential jitters, while the decaf option still offers the same health pros without the caffeine cons. Incredibly, one cup contains the same antioxidants as 12 punnets of blueberries and 55 oranges. Exhale is also B-Corp certified and pays farmers higher prices than Fairtrade.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The company grows, harvests and processes several varieties of arabica coffee by hand at its family-owned and operated mountainous Rainforest Alliance certified farms before it’s shipped to the UK for roasting.You can subscribe to Tambia’s house coffee, Finca La Sierra, which is so abundant with plum, coffee and chocolate flavours that it can stand up to your roast of choice. Choose from deliciously fresh whole beans (if you can), or pick your grind level to suit espresso, Moka pot, filter or cafetière. It’s not available on subscription, but I’d also recommend the company’s limited-editionGeisha light roast, which is delicate and unusual for those up for trying something different.Best affordable coffee subscription:Ueshima Coffee CompanyView image in fullscreenFrom £8.08 every four weeks at Ueshima Coffee CompanyJapan was a centre of coffee innovation long before the west, pioneering techniques such as pour-over, siphons and flannel-dripped coffee with typical Japanese precision. Ueshima is Japan’s number-one coffee brand, using responsibly sourced arabica beans (although note there’s no more detail than that provided) in three blends: House Blend, Tokyo Roast and Fuji Mountain. All are harmonious, smooth and bold, and the company boasts six Great Taste Awards. A subscription offers beans, ground or Nespresso-compatible pods in various sizes and frequencies: a good value option for everyday coffee.Everything you need to make great coffee – and the kit that’s not worth your moneyRead moreBest single-origin coffee subscription:Voyager CoffeeView image in fullscreenFrom £12 a month at Voyager CoffeeEach month, Voyager selects a single-origin coffee with a unique character to roast in-house at its roastery on the edge of Dartmoor national park to showcase to subscribers. From the sweet, clean Brazilian house favourite to the standout Kenyan coffee I tried that was fizzing with fruity notes thanks to its unusual anaerobic natural processing, and the Guatemalan washed coffee with notes of candied orange, a Voyage subscription really is a treat for coffee connoisseurs. There are extensive tasting notes to make the most of your experience, and all the coffee is sustainably sourced, and the bags are 100% compostable.Best caffeine-controlled coffee subscription:TrueStartView image in fullscreenFrom £5.53 every four weeks at TrueStartWhether beans or ground, bags or – whisper it – instant, plus cold brew, a subscription from sustainable family-owned roaster TrueStart is sure to have something to please all coffee drinkers out there. With an emphasis on coffee that’s free of added chemicals, mycotoxins and heavy metals, yet retains high antioxidant levels, TrueStart’s slow-release caffeine speciality coffee offers you the ability to choose your roast, flavour and strength. I like the super-strongSuper Blendmedium roast – a blend of intense Brazilian, Ethiopian, Indian and Vietnamese varieties – to kickstart the morning.Best coffee gift subscription:Monmouth CoffeeView image in fullscreenFrom £8.75 a month at Monmouth CoffeeMonmouth Coffee was the first independent coffee roaster in the UK back in 1978, and its Covent Garden coffee shop remains, along with two more shops. It’s worked with some of its farmers for decades, and all of its beans are top-notch. For a prepaid subscription, select your favoured roast profile (Monmouth is known for its darker roasts) and duration – any coffee-loving recipient will be thrilled. Personally, I’d self-gift a rolling medium-dark subscription and hope that it included the delightful Brazilian Fazenda Santa Inês in all its chocolatey, nutty wonder.Create your perfect cup of coffee with our expert guides tothe best coffee machinesandthe best espresso machinesJoanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Unlike the rest of the unmarked boxes with identical sky-blue lids and opaque sides, I knew exactly what this was: a mix of parsley, garlic and lemon zest (otherwise known asgremolataorgremolada) made last June to go with braised chicken, but not finished, so the leftovers were put in the freezer. I exchanged messages with Carla all the time and, knowing how much she loved freezer-talk, I consulted her as to how long she thought the mix would keep in there. She gave two replies: an official one of three to six months, and an unofficial one of a year, which must have sunk into my unconscious like a preset alarm because, almost a year later (and 10 months since she passed away), I find myself in front of my chaotic freezer, holding a tub of finely minced things and thinking, “There you are!” and, “Thanks, Carla!”Gremolata is a typically Milanese mix, and the name means to reduce into grains. And that is precisely what you do to a clove of garlic, a handful of parsley and the zest of a large unwaxed lemon in order to make a fine and fragrant rubble, which can be made by hand or in a food processor. While gremolata is closely associated and served with braisedosso bucoandrisotto alla Milanese, it is a fantastically versatile addition to all kinds of other dishes. Even though it can be used raw, the best of gremolata is brought out by heat, which wakes up the garlic (and softens its pungency, too) and the natural oils in the lemon zest. Also in my freezer were some peeled prawns; not a year old, but nearing freezer burn.It is still asparagus time, so the addition of a few spears cut into strips are an option here. However, new season courgettes, especially pale or striped varieties with dense, creamy flesh, work particularly well with prawns and gremolata. While the strips of courgette don’t have to be as slim as strings of pasta, they should be of similar proportions, so they mix well with the spaghetti (if you have one, a wired puntarelle cutter or electric spiraliser would be helpful here, otherwise just stick to a good sharp knife).As ever, the pasta cooking water that clings to the strings of spaghetti (which are also full of starch) is a helpful ingredient, because it combines with the oil to give the sauce a creamy consistency and brings everything together. I find two forked or wooden spoons are the best tools to toss thoroughly, or simply jolt the pan – remember, you are waking up the garlic, parsley and lemon zest, too, so the tossing should be energetic. Make sure the prawns and courgettes are evenly distributed, then serve with more olive oil on top.Spaghetti with prawns, courgettes and gremolataServes4600g courgettes1 smallgarlic clove, peeledHandfulflat-leaf parsleyFinely grated zest of1 large unwaxed lemonSalt1 onion, peeled and finely diced4-6 tbspolive oil,plus extra for serving300–400g small peeled prawns(cooked or uncooked)400-500g spaghettiTop and tail the courgettes, then cut them into long, thin strips. Prepare the gremolata by very finely mincing the garlic with the parsley, then mix in the lemon zest.Bring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta. Working in a large frying pan, fry the onion and a pinch of salt in the olive oil until the onion starts to soften. Add the courgettes and fry until both are soft and floppy.Meanwhile, salt the boiling water, drop in the spaghetti, then set a timer. Keep a close eye on the timings; a minute before the pasta is ready to come out, add the prawns and gremolada to the courgettes (if the prawns are cooked, they will need just seconds; if they are raw, they will need a minute or so).Lift the spaghetti directly into the courgette pan with a little of its cooking water clinging to the strands, then toss thoroughly. Serve with little more olive oil on top.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkSeafoodShellfishPastaVegetablesSpring food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

To my left, laid out on a table, are a gold Versace bag and a pair of daintily embroidered blue silk shoes dating from the 1720s. To my right, a Vivienne Westwood corset and a Balenciaga pink taffeta evening dress from the 1950s. It’s a fashion lover’s fever dream and it’s all here, at my fingertips.I’m at theV&A East Storehousein east London, a radical new museum experience that allows anyone to order up any item from the V&A’s vast collection – for free – and to examine it at close quarters. Housed in the former Olympics Media Centre, on the edge of theQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park, this lofty warehouse space gives unprecedented access to more than 250,000 objects, from an 11m wide stage cloth designed by Picasso to a cross-section of a maisonette from theRobin Hood Gardenscouncil estate in Poplar. Gone are the glass cases, white walls and carefully curated exhibits of a traditional museum space. Instead, visitors are invited to look behind the scenes of a working museum, to wander among open shelves stacked high with deliriously eclectic objects and to peer into the workshops where conservators are at work. The effect is part Ikea showroom, part Victorian cabinet of curiosities. It’s bold, slightly bonkers and I love it.View image in fullscreenThe Weston Collections Hall at V&A East Storehouse.Photograph: © Hufton+CrowThe opening of this new V&A outpost marks the latest chapter in the reinvention of the Olympic Park as a “new cultural quarter” for London. At the time of the London 2012 games, I lived in Bow, on the edge of the Olympic Park. On the night of the opening ceremony we watched from the window of my flat as fireworks lit up the sky above the stadium. It was the culmination of one of the most ambitious regeneration projects that London had ever seen and we had a ringside seat as this brave new world rose up from a 560-acre brownfield site.As well as providing a deprived area of east London with world-class sporting facilities, part of the Olympic legacy was the promise to build a new creative hub, somewhere that would inspire locals and visitors alike. We moved out of the area shortly after the games finished, so I was curious to see for myself whether that promise had been fulfilled.The V&A East Storehouse is part Ikea showroom, part cabinet of curiosities. It’s bold, bonkers and I love itOn a bright spring morning the park is quietly humming with activity. Teenagers glide along wide boulevards on roller skates and toddlers play in the water fountains in front of the London Stadium. On the canal, families drift by in pedalos in the shape of white swans, watched over by Zaha Hadid’s imposingAquatic Centrewhich carves a graceful arc in the blue sky.My daughter and I make a beeline for a cluster of new buildings which are lined up along the canal. TheEast Bankproject represents the largest single investment in culture by a London mayor since the Great Exhibition of 1851. The first phase launched in 2023 with the opening of cutting-edge new campuses for University College London (UCL) and the London College of Fashion. Both sites have been designed to be open and accessible to the public. So you can wander into the reception of UCL East and see public art installations – on our visit Luke Jerram’s “Gaia”, an inflatable replica of the Earth, was floating serenely above the atrium – or head to the cafe where your coffee will be delivered to you by a robot waiter.View image in fullscreenA postgraduate show at the London College of Fashion, East Bank.Photograph: Ana BlumenkronAt the London College of Fashion, the public areas host regular showcases of student work. We stroll around the lobby, all bare concrete and curving staircases, and admire a display of outlandish undergraduate creations – although my daughter is far more interested in what the fashion students themselves are wearing.Next door isSadler’s Wells East, a new outpost of the dance theatre which opened in February. The open-plan foyer is home to a light-filled bar, cafe and dance space – when we drop in for a coffee there’s a community dance class in mid-flow. The 550-seat auditorium will provide a home for visiting dance companies of every genre, from ballet to hip-hop. We have booked tickets for that evening’s show, a family-friendly performance of Snow White by theballetLorent.I corkscrew down the metal tube at terrifying speed, emerging 40 seconds later feeling like I’ve been flushed down the S-bendOur next stop is theArcelorMittal Orbit, the twisted red steel sculpture that towers over the Olympic Park. We take the lift up to the viewing platform, a dizzying 80m above the ground. Far below us the London Stadium, now home to West Ham football club, is laid out like a Subbuteo pitch. As a general rule of thumb, I try to avoid any activity that involves having to don an Australian Rules Football helmet and elbow protectors. And yet here I am, joining the queue of teenagers waiting to launch themselves feet first down the Helix, the high-speed helter skelter that snakes around the outside of Anish Kapoor’s look-at-me landmark. My teenage daughter takes one look at the foam helmet and refuses to go any further. “It’s just a big slide!” I tell her. “Come on, it’ll be fun!”View image in fullscreenThe Helix slide on the ArcelorMittal Orbit at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.Photograph: Mark Mercer/AlamyThese words – and others that cannot be published here – ring in my ears as I corkscrew down the metal tube at terrifying speed, emerging 40 seconds later feeling like I’ve been flushed down the S-bend.

We’ve booked a table atHera, one of the park’s newest openings, which has been winning accolades for its authentic Greek food.It does not disappoint. From the basket of homemade bread and dip of smoked aubergine with thyme, honey and balsamic vinegar, to the elegant sea bass carpaccio and charcoal-grilled chicken skewers, everything is sensational. But the standout dish is the feta saganaki – feta cheese, wrapped in angel hair, deep-fried and drizzled with lemon honey. My daughter and I are still dreaming about it weeks later.View image in fullscreenSwan pedalos in the Olympic Park.Photograph: Queen Elizabeth Olympic ParkIt’s the kind of lunch that needs to be followed by a long walk, so we trace the course of the canal, fringed with head-high whispering grasses, into the northern half of the park, eventually reaching the iconic Olympic rings – which have found a permanent home on a raised mound overlooking the Lee Valley VeloPark.A group of women dressed head to toe in sequins shimmer past in the late afternoon sunshine, on their way toAbba Voyage. The virtual concert experience has attracted more than two million visitors since opening in a purpose-built arena on the edge of the Olympic Park in 2022. In September, they will be joined by an army of David Bowie fans when the V&A Storehouse becomes the new home of the David Bowie archive, comprising stage costumes, song lyrics, instruments, makeup charts and sketches. And there’s more to come. Next year will see the relocation of the BBC Music Studios from Maida Vale to Stratford and the opening of the V&A East museum in a striking new building inspired, apparently, by an X-ray of a Balenciaga dress.I’ve enjoyed being a tourist on my old home turf. It may not have the gravitas of South Kensington, the architectural cohesion of the South Bank Centre or the neoclassical elegance of Covent Garden, but East Bank is an invigorating and inspiring addition to London’s cultural scene. And it’s fun. Where else can you slide down Britain’s tallest sculpture, handle vintage haute couture, or dance in front of an Abba avatar, all in one day?The V&A East Storehouse opens to the public on 31 May.

They’re also a terrible way to cook. Should shops stop selling them?Sam WollastonThu 29 May 2025 05.00 EDTShareToby Tyler can still hear his son William’s scream. “That will never, ever leave us,” he says, speaking on a video call from the family home in Stockport, Greater Manchester. “But we didn’t understand what had happened. We thought he’d stood on something that had gone into his foot. It was only when he got to us and we grabbed him that we could see his foot completely stripped – all the skin had gone.”It was 2020, in a break between lockdowns, and the Tyler family – Toby and Claire, their kids Lily and William, who was nine at the time – had gone to the beach at Formby. “There was another family who’d brought a disposable barbecue which they’d used on the sand in the morning. The whole unit had cooled, so they had moved it because they were worried about the kids standing on it, mainly because it was sharp.” You know the type: foil tray full of charcoal, topped with a mesh grill.The sand had cooled at the surface in the wind. “But dry sand is an extraordinary insulator. The heat had penetrated down into the sand, so even a couple of hours later when William ran though and his feet sunk in, it was still 400-500C. It enveloped his feet; the worst burns were actually on top.”View image in fullscreenWilliam Tyler in hospital after stepping on hot sand where a disposable barbecue had been.The sea was miles out, so they poured the water they had on William’s feet, then Toby put him on his shoulders and ran for 20 minutes over the dunes to the car. “That was the most horrific time – I’ve got William on my shoulders, bouncing up and down, clinging to my head, with his feet just there, and he’s just in such extraordinary pain.”They rushed him to the nearest hospital, in Ormskirk, and then he was transferred to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, which has a burns unit. The burns were so bad they took skin from his thigh to graft on to one of his feet, and kept him in for eight days. He continued to go in for regular treatment at both the burns unit and the psychosocial support unit. Five years on, William is still under their care. There might be another operation; the scars are permanent.A year after the accident William, who has autism and suffers from anxiety, wanted to do something to raise awareness of the danger posed by disposable barbecues. He did a fundraising event that involved going back to Formby beach and doing a sponsored walk, and ended up raising nearly £9,000 for the burns unit that treated him. Toby starteda petition to get disposable barbecues banned, which got over 27,000 signatures but failed to change the law. “While there are no plans to introduce a blanket ban on disposable barbecues, the government is taking actions to keep people safe,” was the (previous) government’s response.And yet, accidents continue to happen. Earlier this month, at Murlough beach in County Down,a young girl suffered burnsto her feet after walking on sand that had a still-hot barbecue buried underneath. The local coastguardwarned of the dangers on Facebook, urging beach-goers not to bring them. The same happened to Allison Ogden-Newton’s son. “He would have been 16 at the time – lost all the skin from the bottom of his foot, then he got an infection. It was really nasty,” she tells me.It’s not the only reason she hates disposable barbecues. Ogden-Newton is CEO of Keep Britain Tidy. They are “the worst of all possible forms of litter”, she tells me. “They say you shouldn’t touch them for eight hours after use. Nobody who buys a so-called disposable barbecue intends to stay with it for eight hours. Even after being covered with water, they can reignite. People put sand on them to try to extinguish them, and that sand and the sand underneath the barbecue gets heated to such a degree that it can burn flesh a long time after the barbecue is over.”The other thing people do, Ogden-Newton says, is try to dispose of them before they are cool enough. “They put barbecues that have not been extinguished in the bins and burn the bins down. It is common on beaches and other places that we desperately need not to be littered.” Again, earlier this month,firefighters were called to a blazecaused by a smouldering disposable barbecue left in a bin in the Kent town of Ramsgate.In a growing list, the fire risk is probably the biggest black mark against the disposable barbecue’s name, leaving actual big black marks burnt into the landscape. Ogden-Newton mentions a couple of large fires believed to have been started by disposable barbecues. “Wareham Forest in 2020, which took millions and millions of gallons of water to put out, then the 11th century wood in Helford [Cornwall]that burned down in 2022– we’re not going to see that again. All because we allow people to light these things wherever they so chose. It is staggering to me that you can go into a beautiful place that’s been standing there for a millennium and light something that you cannot possibly safely manage.”View image in fullscreenNext stop, landfill?Photograph: Ian Georgeson/AlamyEarlier this month, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service (LFRS)posted, on Facebook, pictures of moorland fires started by disposable barbecues. And a warning: “A disposable BBQ might look harmless, but when placed directly on the ground it scorches the surface and starts a smouldering fire underground. It might seem out when you leave, but the heat can linger below the surface.” Pack a picnic instead, says LFRS.In Scotland, in theGreat Trossachs forest, an area of precious native woodland wasdestroyed by firethis month. The cause? Nick Hall, head of health and safety of the Woodland Trust, which manages the forest, sends me a picture. On the blackened ground, among the charred scrub: the inevitable aluminium tray.A fire like that destroys fauna as well as flora. “Anything that lives on the ground that can’t outrun the fire – and that’s most things, because fire spreads very quickly,” says Hall. “So it is terrible for things like lizards and amphibians, insects, rodents, you name it. And, especially, ground-nesting birds.The idea you can take a big source of ignition into the countryside and use it is inherently dangerousNick Hall, the Woodland Trust“Using one in your own home, or on a hard surface, that’s fine,” Hall tells me (he doesn’t mean actually inside the home, because that would probably give you carbon monoxide poisoning). “But they’re too portable, too easy to carry into places you shouldn’t. Taking them out into the countryside, which is probably where they are most used, they pose a really significant risk, especially at times like this when we’re on high alert for wildfires. We’ve had a very dry spring. Fire and rescue services are worried about water shortages in reservoirs. So the idea you can take a big source of ignition into the countryside and use it, I think, is inherently dangerous.”Hall says a big fire, especially on moorland and drained peat, is difficult to contain and harder to put out. He points to the 2018 Winter Hill fire in Lancashire: “We couldn’t put it out – we had to wait for autumn and enough rainfall to soak into the peat. I think it burned for 46 days in total.”The Woodland Trust doesn’t have the power to ban barbecues on its sites, Hall explains, “but if someone is posing a public safety risk, then we call the police and have them intervene. And we have worked with local retailers previously, asking them to stop selling disposable barbecues on the edge of our estate.”Several local authorities have implemented bans in parks and on beaches through public spaces protection orders. Hall would like to see them banned outright, as would London’s fire chief, Andy Roe, whocalled for a total banafter one of the service’s busiest ever weeks in July 2022.Aldi and Waitrosestopped selling disposables in 2022, because of the detrimental impact they have on the environment. Some supermarkets don’t sell them during periods of dry weather.Ifind a disposable barbecue in Sainsbury’s – cooks for eight to 10 people, it says, mine for £6. Yes, I’m afraid that in the name of journalism I need to try one out for the first family barbie of the year. We do actually have a non-disposable one (the sort that looks like a UFO on a tripod), but after a winter spent not in the shed but in the hedge, it is looking a little sorry for itself – rusty and full of snails.And how much damage can we do at home? I find a couple of bricks to lift it off the “lawn”, and put a match to the lighting sheet, the paper that lies on top of the charcoal. A disposable barbecue can smell like a fire at a petrochemical plant at this stage, because of the flammable accelerant the paper is soaked in. But this one doesn’t smell too bad – it’s wax paper. In fact, the labelling is keen to point out that the whole thing is minimising its environmental impact: made in the UK, sustainable charcoal, recyclable.View image in fullscreenWilliam Tyler after leaving hospital. Five years after the accident, he is still receiving treatment.Chicken – thighs marinated in a tikka masala paste and yoghurt – will take the longest to cook, so that goes on first. Eight thighs pretty much take up the whole grill, so it will have to be dinner in stages. In the UFO barbecue, there are different areas – very hot in the middle over the piled-up charcoal, less so round the outside – and I can move things around. There’s a lid; I can slow things down, turn it into an oven. I’m in control. On a disposable there’s none of that – just a grill very close to a thin layer of charcoal. Ready to cook after 20 minutes, good to cook on for maybe another 30, after which it becomes increasingly useless.It soon becomes clear that not only will the flames not last for the halloumi and veggies, but even the chicken is not going to cook through. Charred on the outside, raw in the middle. There’s a horrible irony in that – that a device so adept at burning human flesh, not to mention causing fires that incinerate nests full of wild birds, is so useless at cooking a piece of chicken.We have the advantage of not being at the beach but at home, so off comes the chicken, into a dish and into the oven. On to the grill go the halloumi and courgettes. Against the odds – some might say heroically – I have saved dinner. But the victory is a hollow one, the halloumi and courgettes ending up more par-grilled than chargrilled. Followed, half an hour later, by a kind of chicken tikka casserole, served with flat bread done in the toaster. Yet another black mark: disposable barbecues are rubbish at barbecuing.Now to dispose of it. Again, being at home makes things easier. I can pour cold water on it, let it cool down overnight, then dismantle it, take the grill and tray to the recycling centre, the shrinkwrap to the soft plastic recycling at the supermarket, put the cardboard in the paper bin, tip the ashes into the garden etc … Realistically though, are people going to do that? Of the estimated one million-plus disposables sold in the UK each year, the vast majority are going straight to landfill.There’s a horrible irony in that a device so adept at burning human flesh is so useless at cooking chickenOgden-Newton also has concerns about what goes into them. “The majority are made in China, and we don’t know an awful lot about their composition. We do know that mangroves have sometimes been used to create the charcoal. So you’ve got ancientmangroves being burned to create charcoalwhich is covered in flammable gel and put into these nasty pieces of tin, so people can take them wherever they so choose and potentially put our environment at risk, harm our children … They break your heart on every conceivable level.” It turns out, from the small print on the one I got, that the charcoal comes from Namibia.Ogden-Newton has some idea why Keep Britain Tidy’s#BanTheFlamingThings campaigndidn’t achieve its goal. “We’re very cynical about the so-called nanny state, but that has allowed us to put our most valuable environmental assets at risk because we don’t want to be seen to be telling people what to do.”William Tyler’s dad, Toby, agrees. “Politically, banning stuff is something everybody wants to avoid.” His own message, though, is clear: “Don’t sell them, don’t buy them, don’t use them.”I won’t – I’m totally sold. Or rather, never sold to again, I promise. I’m not a big fan of banning things, either, but this one’s a no-brainer. The UFO’s coming back, descaled and desnailed.Wait, though. How much greener is the non-disposable variety?Burning charcoal releases pollutants– including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and trace metals – into the air.Scientists at Sheffield University calculatedthat a typical summer barbecue for four people releases more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than an 80-mile car journey.Maybe I can limit the damage. A gas barbecue’s carbon footprintis only about a third thatof a charcoal one; as well as the production and burning of carbon, the Sheffield research also takes into account food production, so sweetcorn from the allotment is going to have less environmental impact than beef burgers. I’m thinking of sustainable seafood and a glass of rosé – a blanket barbecue ban is not something I’m quite ready for yet. It doesn’t have the same ring to it, does it: put another shrimp in the air fryer?Explore more on these topicsBarbecueRetail industryFirefightersWildfiresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She reveals the grief, horror and hope that defined her time thereBethan McKernanThu 29 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 09.45 EDTShareThree days before Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack onIsrael, I was helping friends who live in Gaza City gather armfuls of guava in their orchard in Beit Hanoun, in the north of the Strip, when something strange happened.Hamid and Rania* had bought the small plot the year before. It was overgrown, but over the changing seasons they’d worked hard on their expensive acquisition. I called it the secret garden, a tiny oasis in the midst of the dry, dirty misery ofGaza.As well as guava, there were apple, fig, lemon, orange and olive trees. The couple planted grapefruit and pomegranate saplings, and dug vegetable beds for tomatoes, herbs and spices. Rania also put in yellow and red chrysanthemums in flowerpots made out of stacks of worn-out car tyres.The couple bought a water tank and fixed the broken outhouse. The existing shack, originally little more than breeze-blocks, a dirt floor and tin roof, was refurbished, complete with a bed and a shady roof terrace.From the terrace, you could see the Mediterranean sparkling in the distance. To the north, usually only half visible through the mist, were the towers of a desalination plant in the Israeli city of Ashkelon. The plot was surrounded by Gaza’s biggest area of open, flat agricultural land, which mostly amounted to a few other small walled orchards and strawberry fields. Teenage boys often herded scraggly goats and sheep through the area.View image in fullscreenMcKernan.Photograph: Mariam DwedarIt had been a day like any other until the sound of men’s voices, shouting in unison, carried to us over the wind. It sounded like a military drill.We went up to the roof terrace, from where we could see several dozen men, standing in formation, in a fallow field. Even from a distance it was clear they were wearing the bright green insignia of Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades.None of us had ever seen so many fighters in Gaza out in the open before, let alone training in full view of the farmers around them and Israeli drones above. Outside wartime, that uniform was usually reserved for funerals and rallies. Along with the rest of the world, we found out the purpose of the drill soon enough.I left for Jerusalem the next morning, through the border fortress the Israelis called Erez, and went to Shabbat dinner with Jewish and Arab Israeli friends that night. How was Gaza, they asked, always curious about a place they could never visit. Quiet, I said. So quiet, in fact, I’d been able to interview people for a feature about the revival of beekeeping there. I thought the fact that the bees could travel further than their Palestinian owners, flying over Israel’s border fence to greener pastures, would make a good story.But, of course, I never wrote that article. Instead, I was soon on the other side of the barrier from Beit Hanoun, running from incoming rockets, getting caught in crossfire between Hamas and the Israeli army still fighting in a kibbutz, and retching at the smell of the bodies of murdered families decomposing in the unseasonal heat.Itook the job as the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent in 2021, although I was reluctant about it. I was happy living in Istanbul as the paper’s Turkey and Middle East correspondent, from where I got to travel widely – and the Jerusalem gig was notoriously thankless. Every single word published under my name would be forensically examined for signs of bias. Plus, I found the holy city difficult – tense and unfriendly. Jerusalem is a place that attracts fanatics and zealots; one American man withJerusalem syndromewas always wandering the streets of the Old City, barefoot, staff in hand, convinced he was Moses. I had visited several times before, but what did it say about me, I wondered, that I was willing to move here, and take on this challenge?My partner was encouraging, even though we knew holding an Iraqi passport would make it difficult for him to join me. Any outsider or journalist who wants to truly understand the Middle East should spend some time in Israel and Palestine, he said.In the end, I took the job – and now, four years later, I am leaving Jerusalem and returning home to take up a post in the UK. I have learned a lot, and the experience has changed me.I never understood the Strip until I visited it. None of the reporting could get across the claustrophobia, the suffocationBefore I arrived in Jerusalem, I thought the Israel-Palestine story was an old one: a cycle of attritional violence and a slow march towards inevitable annexation because of Israeli settlement building in the West Bank.TheAbraham accords, diplomatic agreements brokered in 2020 in which several Arab nations agreed to recognise Israel, seemed to suggest that the rest of the Middle East had lost interest in the question of Palestine. The conflict had also been pushed down the global agenda by the regional wars and crises triggered by the Arab spring, the war in Ukraine and China’s increasing power. Even so, during my time there, it was becoming more likely that something big was going to happen.11:14How Israeli settler violence is forcing Palestinians to flee their homes – videoMany years ago I interviewed a pilot who explained that plane crashes don’t happen without warning signs first: system A fails, or is faulty, and then B, and then C, and then D. It’s always a series of events, rather than a one-off incident, that leads to a plane falling out of the sky. Israel and Palestine before October 2023 felt like that – like the dominoes were being lined up.Before 7 October, 2023 had been a difficult year. In December 2022, Israel’s pugnacious prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had returned to office as the head of a new coalition that was the most far right in Israeli history.It proposed an overhaul of the judiciary that would essentially give the government full control over the courts, which critics said undermined democracy. In early 2023, there weremass protestsin the streets and by July military reservists wererefusing to report for duty. Israel’s enemies and friends alike warned the government it made the country appear weak.Meanwhile, in the West Bank, 2023 had already beaten 2022’s record as the bloodiest year since the close of the secondintifada, or Palestinian uprising, of the 2000s, and I spent much of the year driving back and forth to cover massive Israel Defense Forces raids in Jenin and Nablus.View image in fullscreenMcKernan crossing through a breach in the West Bank barrier, 2022.Photograph: Quique KierszenbaumIt’s strange to say this now, but in comparison with Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the West Bank, Gaza had been relatively quiet. After the last major war in 2021, Israel had gradually increased permits for men from the Strip to enter for agricultural and construction work, an incentive for Hamas to keep quiet by doing something to alleviate the besieged territory’s dire poverty and accompanying social unrest.The money was making a huge difference. Every time I visited the Strip, new shops and cafes were opening, and the rebuilding from the last war had almost finished. Friends, sources and people I interviewed told me that the cash had helped them clear debts from failed investments and business ventures – a common story in a place where the economy could not function normally.There is now a tendency to wax lyrical about how wonderful Gaza was before 7 October, but life there was still very hard. One elderly friend of a friend went blind because Israel did not consider cataract surgery a valid reason to be allowed to seek medical treatment abroad, even though the treatment was not available in the Strip. Another woman I interviewed needed chemotherapy for a recurrence of breast cancer, but nine travel permit applications were refused. Permission only came through after Iwrote a story about her.I never felt that I properly understood the reality of the Strip until I visited it. None of the reporting I’d read or watched could adequately convey the claustrophobia, the busyness, the dirt, the suffocation, the feeling of being trapped. It was a struggle in my own output, too. There is – or was – nowhere else like it.The Strip was the first place I went to when I started the job – and from there, I went straight to Tel Aviv. I remember sitting on the beach in nearby Jaffa early that morning and feeling a maddening cognitive dissonance. How could people be out and about, doing pilates, walking their dogs, as if everything was fine – when just 50km down the road, on the same stretch of the Med, was an open-air prison? I was worried that I too would start finding the situation normal. But it never happened.Another time, I stopped off at an Ikea on my way home from Gaza, a mistake I didn’t make again. My brain couldn’t handle the switch between the slum-like Shati refugee camp and a world of well-lit, flat-packed plenty in the space of a few hours. I had to go outside to get some air.Still, everyone clings to their memories of the before times: Gaza’s spicy food and fresh fish, the bountiful orchards, clambering around Ottoman ruins, late nightnargileh(hookah) sessions – and most of all, the beach. In the summer of 2022, Israel allowed more electricity to reliably reach Gaza’s sewage treatment plants, and for the first time in years, most of the Strip’s coastline becameclean enough for swimming. On the busy beaches, children ran in and out of the waves, begging their parents for camel rides and candy floss.It was a glimpse of what a different Gaza and a different future could look like. Now, all of that is gone, replaced by an apocalyptic moonscape so unrecognisable that friends tell me they get lost in their own neighbourhoods. A long time ago, I ran out of things to say in messages and voice notes to the people I know there. My pleas for them to stay safe became meaningless. Instead, we don’t talk about what they are going through, mostly reminiscing about old times, or we make plans for the future. No one acknowledges that we can’t be sure they will materialise.View image in fullscreenInterviewing an Islamic Jihad leader in Noor Shams refugee camp, West Bank, in 2024. He was killed a few months later.Photograph: Ayman Abu RamouzIf I think about the first few weeks of the war now, what surfaces first is the prickly, uncomfortable memory of the heat. The semi-desert western Negev, which makes up Gaza and southern Israel, is totally different from high-altitude Jerusalem, and for much of the year the landscape is so barren and harsh it feels as if the sunlight bounces off it with a vengeance.It was such a warm autumn, far too hot: still over 30C at the end of October. Then comes the feeling of chaos, the fear and panic, rather than specific incidents – the Guardian’s hotel in Ashkelon getting hit by a rocket, or stumbling across the headless corpse of a Hamas fighter. (To this day I still don’t understand where it could possibly have gone; he was otherwise in one piece, and so were the bodies around him.)I told my family and editors, all far away in the UK, that I was OK – which, to an extent, I was. I was still in shock, so I focused on the work and adrenaline carried me through. I was far more affected by the stories that traumatised 7 October survivors told me – and about what was going to happen to Gaza – than by what I saw first-hand. Nothing was clear at that point except that many, many more people were going to die.‘Extinguished too soon’: hundreds mourn at funeral of British-Israeli familyRead moreThe dam broke about three weeks in, when I went to report on thefunerals of a British-Israeli family: mum Lianne, and teenage daughters Noiya and Yahel. Their father, Eli, was taken hostage. He didn’t find out his wife and children had been killed until he was released during the ceasefire earlier this year.Watching the grief of those gathered to mourn loved ones taken away by such senseless and shocking violence, I began sobbing uncontrollably and had to leave the graveside to sit in a corner of the cemetery where I wouldn’t disturb the eulogies. A member of the family came over to ask if I was all right, and whether I had known them; I didn’t know how to explain what I was feeling. I just cried on her shoulder instead.I am leaving the Holy Land at a strange juncture. I never planned on staying much longer than three years, and I never signed up to cover a war like this. Unlike my Israeli and Palestinian friends and colleagues, I have the freedom and ability to leave.View image in fullscreenIn Jinba, in the West Bank, where families still live in caves.Photograph: Quique KierszenbaumFundamentally, I feel the same as when I arrived – that the occupation is wrong, and it doesn’t make Israelis safer. For decades, Israel told itself a lie that the conflict could be contained and managed, sustaining a perpetual occupation and suppression of Palestinian rights without any major diplomatic, financial or security cost.That myth was shattered in the early morning of 7 October 2023. I understood what was at first a blinding Israeli need for revenge, even if I didn’t agree with it, and I knew that they needed to make sure nothing like that bloody day could ever happen again. But since then, the last hope anyone I know had for a diplomatic solution to the conflict has been extinguished. Israel has doubled down on force. The slow suffocation of Palestinian hopes of dignity and statehood that was unfolding when I arrived has accelerated at a pace no one could previously have imagined.When I started out in journalism, as an assistant at the London offices of the Associated Press, I’d spend all day fielding phone calls, copy and video files from our correspondents around the globe; I used to note down their locations and loglines enviously, eager to get out and see the world for myself. I used to think journalism could help right wrongs, and I could play a role in that, but covering the wars in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and now Gaza over the past decade has taught me that is not necessarily the case. My coverage didn’t do anything to stop those horrors unfolding, but at least it showed the rest of the world the reality on the ground.Martha Gellhorn, one of the greatest conflict reporters of the 20th century, wrote about feeling like a “war tourist” in her work. In Gaza – where Israel has blocked access for international journalists – I haven’t even been that. Thanks to the sacrifices of my brave colleagues in Gaza, no one with an internet connection can say they don’t know the truth of what has happened in Israel and Palestine over the past 18 months.There is no silver lining here, only lessons we may not fully understand for years to come.The latePope Francis, who called the congregation at Gaza’s sole Catholic church every night until the day before he died,used to comfort his flockby reminding them that all wars end. I remember a Gaza where hope of a better future was still alive. As soon as it is possible, I will return to the Strip to sift through the rubble of ruined lives and help reclaim what has been lost.* Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesHamasMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unbeknown to passengers on the number 493 bus, up ahead rifle-toting police were storming one of the scores of favelas that line the road, hoping to capture a notorious drug lord.View image in fullscreenBrazil Avenue, a Rio motorway which was designed as a monument to development but has become a symbol of the government’s failure to control crime.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianA gun battle broke out, sending motorists scattering for cover behind the concrete central reservation. Oliveira was hit by a stray bullet as he dozed. Soon after, a neighbour broke the news to his family. “We thought it was a lie,” said the victim’s sister-in-law who, like many caught up in the bloodshed blighting Rio, asked not to be named.WhenBrazilAvenue was built in the 1940s, during the Getúlio Vargas dictatorship, it was conceived as a patriotic statement of the South American country’s economic ascent, said Pedro Moraes, the author of a book about the motorway.Eight decades later, the 36-mile highway – which bisects more than 25 neighourhoods as it leads from Rio’s western outskirts towards its heart – has become an emblem of something else: the government’s inability to control urban violence.“Nowadays, citizens in Rio can’t even take a nap on the bus to work,”a leading newspaper protestedafter Oliveira’s killing, calling Brazil Avenue “a symbol of the Brazilian state’s failure to combat organized crime”.According to the Instituto Fogo Cruzado, a group that tracks gun violence, Brazil Avenue suffered 637 shootouts from 2017 to 2024 – one every five days. The bullets killed 160 people and wounded 383. Last week three police officers were killed on the motorway after losing control of their vehicle during a high-speed chase.a mapa map“Brazil Avenue is an avenue that is so profoundly revealing about what our country is … It faithfully represents the name it bears,” said Antônio Carlos Costa, the head of Rio de Paz, an anti-violence NGO.While the thoroughfare’s builders envisaged creating a monument to development and industrialization, Costa believed it exposed “a country of brutal inequality, injustice and social exclusion”.Costa recalled how millions of poverty-stricken north-eastern migrants had flocked to Rio and made their homes along the motorway since the 1950s, building lives in deprived housing estates and favelas that were “ignored by society and authorities” and are now mostly controlled by armed criminal groups.Millionaires, celebrities and opinion makers used the motorway to reach beach paradises and mansions, oblivious to “the real Rio de Janeiro” they drove past on the way.All walks of life are exposed to the deadly violence afflicting Brazil Avenue thanks to decades of state neglect. Recently, Costa’s son was driving home on the highway when tracer bullets lit up the night sky. “He told me it looked like fireworks flying across the road,” said the activist, speaking 24 hours after a policeman’s body was foundin a bullet-riddled vehicleabandoned on the same motorway.The families supported by Costa’s group include that of 43-year-old Cátia Sebastiana de Lima.View image in fullscreenCátia Lima.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianHer husband, an Uber driver called Paulo Roberto de Souza, was also killed during last October’s botched police raid in which Oliveira lost his life. Three others were shot but survived.“He had so many dreams … he was such a great dad,” Lima said, shedding tears as she recalled saying a 5am prayer with her husband the morning he was shot.Autistic children bear hidden cost of violent police raids in Brazil’s favelasRead moreSix months later, Lima has yet to receive any compensation and was struggling to make ends meet. “I never ever imagined I’d lose my husband to gun violence … A heart attack, maybe. But it never crossed my mind that it’d be something as tragic as this,” she said.Brazil Avenue’s reputation for traffic chaos and gunfights has earned it a series of grim nicknames. Some call it the “Avenida da Morte” (‘Avenue of Death’), others “Avenida Ziquizira” (‘Bad Luck Avenue’). The violence-stricken region around the road is known as the Gaza Strip.Washington Rimas, a social activist raised in one of Brazil Avenue’s favelas in the early 80s, admitted that infamy was not entirely undeserved.As a boy, he remembers criminals dumping victims in the undergrowth across the motorway from his home in Amarelinho. “It was this frightful scrubland. Loads of people would just come from other places and chuck the corpses over there in the bushes,” said Rimas, whose mother was one of the first inhabitants of the community built for construction and factory workers.View image in fullscreenBrazil Avenue, Caju Neighborhood.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianBut Rimas, 49, insisted Brazil Avenue was about more than bloodshed and pushed back against its notoriety. The motorway was also an essential means of transport for workers with jobs in Rio’s richer central and southern zones. The road’s favelas were places of talent and graft.Rimas, a reformed drug traffickerwho abandoned crime over a decade ago, said his new mission was helping local kids with extracurricular activities such as music, IT and dance. “It was here that we sold poison – and it’s here that we’re going to produce the antidote,” he said of his quest to improve his corner of Brazil Avenue.Community leader Vanessa Galdino also rejected the negative portrayal of Avenida Brasil and the working-class areas the road connects. “I’m proud of living here,” said Galdino, 29, a student who runs an ice-cream parlour for Amarelinho’s youth.Galdino had no plans to leave despite losing her father to violence when she was 17. “We are resilient, welcoming people,” she said. Warts and all,Brazil Avenue was home.View image in fullscreen‘Community leader Vanessa Galdino also rejected the negative portrayal of Avenida Brasil and the working-class areas the road connects.’Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianAmong victims of Brazil Avenue’s violence, such optimism is harder to find.Sitting at home surrounded by pictures of her dead husband, Lima urged authorities to change their strategy of combating drug gangs withwarzone-style raids on the favelas.“You don’t just fight crime with police, shooting and invasions … You need social projects, schools, music, sport, healthcare and education … We need to convince our children that they’re Brazil’s future,” said Lima, who doubted authorities would listen.As she absorbed her loss, she clung to her Christian faith. “I like to say that I didn’t lose my husband,” Lima said. “I returned him to God.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasDrugsGun crimeRio de JaneirofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus a letter fromGraeme Booth, also replying to a Gaby Hinsliff columnThu 29 May 2025 12.34 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 13.28 EDTShareI’m writing in response to Gaby Hinsliff’s column (White men are apparently terrified of doing the wrong thing at work. I have some advice, 26 May). I was sexually assaulted at work by a man twice my age – my boss. I reported it to my company and to the police. I pursued legal justice. I spoke openly about what had happened. And I lost my job and haven’t worked since.This isn’t from a lack of trying. I would love to be working again. I’m a well-educated woman in my 30s – I have a postgraduate degree, I’ve worked for the Foreign Office and the BBC, I speak Arabic and French. I’ve been working since I was 13. Even as I changed countries and careers in my 20s, I was never unemployed – until now.I’ve applied for hundreds of roles. I’ve networked. Nothing sticks. My hunch is that when prospective employers Google me and find my name linked to a story of sexual violence at work, the conclusion is swift: she’s trouble, or she’s troubled. The great irony is that I believe I’m far less trouble or troubled than I would be had I stayed silent – this stuff festers if you swallow it. Speaking up wasn’t about getting my own back and it wasn’t about wallowing. I made an impossibly hard choice to protect my dignity.Womenshould be allowed to work without betraying themselves to get it.I agree with Gaby that some of the anxiety that Tim Samuels identifies is real, but it should be some relief to those behind the YouTube show that he presents, WhiteMenCan’t Work!, that, time and time again, men who are called out for bad behaviour in the workplace bounce back. It’s the women who had the courage to call them out who suffer the devastating professional fallout.If you publish this, please keep me anonymous, as my days of believing it’s empowering to speak up are long gone.Name and address suppliedIt’s easy to sneer about white men being discriminated against at work. But I’ve been in precisely that situation myself on two occasions – once in a civil service department and once at a charity. On both occasions, the discrimination, which was humiliating and hurtful, was perpetrated by white women in positions of power. I suppose I could have just accepted it, as Gaby Hinsliff suggests, by acknowledging that others suffered much more (which was undoubtedly true), but I felt forced to leave the job instead. The experience has had a profound and lasting effect on my health.Name and address suppliedWhat I find objectionable in Gaby Hinsliff’s piece is the treatment of white men as some kind of homogeneous group. As if the combination of whiteness and maleness alone confer privilege. Some white men are indeed very privileged and have a sense of that privilege being diminished, as Ms Hinsliff suggests. Other white men are very far from privileged.White males are greatly overrepresented among those failing at school, among the homeless living on the streets, among those injured and killed in industrial accidents or through self-destructive reckless behaviour, among the isolated and lonely, and among those who take their own lives.Hinsliff writes: “So if white men genuinely don’t think work is working for them, welcome to the club, boys. Just don’t forget that some of us have been here rather longer than you.” For many white working-class men (and black men too), it’s not just work – the education system, the criminal justice system and social structures have never worked for them. They don’t need to be told to check their privilege.Graeme BoothCanterburyExplore more on these topicsDiscrimination at workMenWomenRape and sexual assaultSexual harassmentWork & careersUK criminal justicelettersShareReuse this content"

Inside the debate sparked by London festival row, 24 May), could not be more wrong when she says the Protect Brockwell Park campaign is about “a small number of people trying to limit a larger number of people’s access to space”. Parks are open to everyone, all year round, except during the weeks leading up to and during such festivals.For centuries, local parks have preserved the sanity of parents with young children, allowed children to meet each other and create play with the simplest of means, and permitted elderly people a break from the loneliness of being stuck at home. Parks need preserving because they are egalitarian and provide a meeting space that helps build communities.Very few object to short festivals that treat a park and the local community with respect. What we are seeing now is events companies preying on cash-strapped local authorities to get concert venues on the cheap, make a quick buck from large, prolonged events and move on, often leaving the park with extensive damage that takes months to repair. There is very little transparency as to what changes hands, how much money is actually made, what it is used for and how much the damage costs to fix. Years of savage local authority cutbacks have left parks with skeleton staffing, inadequate to produce the regeneration that these events necessitate. The effects can be cumulative and permanent.The chief executive of the Association of IndependentFestivalssays the local authority is “a representation of the local community”. Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? Not many local people feel so represented.Victor PaceForest Hill, LondonThe imposition of loud music on others is as unacceptable in public parks as it is from a phone on the bus or a speaker in the garden. The elementary social decency of not inflicting stressful noise on neighbours and fellow travellers is rapidly disintegrating. And public parks belong to all, not just the minority who want to attend pop concerts.Paul KeelingWelling, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Of the remaining votes, Maimbo won 20%, with the former Senegalese economy minister Amadou Hott gaining 3.5%.The president-elect will be the ninth chief of the 60-year-old development finance institution, which boasts a broad ownership structure: 54 African countries are shareholders, as are G7 nations, including the US and Japan. Nigeria is its single biggest shareholder.The bank is responsible for backing several large-scale infrastructure developments within the continent, in part using resources from the African Development Fund (ADF). International partners replenish the ADF’s resources every three years, with the next round of funding due to begin this November.However, with the Trump administration committed to cutting US funding to the AfDB by $555m (£411m) to focus on domestic matters, the bank will have to find creative ways of doing more with less or finding new donors. Adesina has said the current capital of the AfDB has grown to $318bn.Tah has pledged to collaborate more with Gulf states around infrastructure development.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAfricaBankingInfrastructureEconomicsEnvironmental sustainabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Joshlin has still not been found, despite an extensive police search.During the trial, a witness said Smith had told her she had sold her daughter to a sangoma, a traditional healer, for 20,000 rand (£830) and that the girl had been desired for her “eyes and skin”.Another witness, a pastor, said Smith told him in 2023 that she planned to sell her daughter.“There is nothing that I can find that is redeeming and deserving of a lesser sentence than the harshest I can impose,” the high court judge Nathan Erasmus said. Erasmus also imposed a 10-year kidnapping sentence on the three, to run concurrently with the life sentence for human trafficking, and ordered their names be entered into the child protection register.View image in fullscreenA member of the public wears a T-shirt with a picture of the missing child, Joshlin Smith, on it in court.Photograph: Rodger Bosch/AFP/Getty ImagesErasmus said the fact Smith, Appollis and Van Rhyn were drug users was no excuse and described Smith as “a person who is manipulative and manipulates the facts as it suits you”.“[You] went as far as to blame your parents for your conduct in this matter,” the judge said during the sentencing in Saldanha Bay, a fishing town 85 miles north of Cape Town. “The evidence presented as to the disappearance of your own daughter was clear. Besides on one occasion earlier and yesterday, I saw no indication of remorse, but it didn’t start there because we know from 19 February 2024 the lack of concern.”Smith’s mother, Amanda Daniels, was present at the sentencing, wearing a white T-shirt emblazoned with a photograph of Joshlin’s face. The day before, a court officer read out a victim impact statement on her behalf, describing how she had “cried my eyes out” on Mother’s Day earlier in May.Daniels’statementsaid: “Kelly, you have made our lives hell on earth. I feel like my heart has been ripped from my body. You have broken [this family] apart.”Daniels is now caring for Smith’s two other children, of whom Joshlin was the middle child, and said she was constantly afraid they would go missing too.South Africa police said they had extended the search for Joshlin outside the country. Soon after her disappearance, Gayton McKenzie, the leader of the populist, minority Patriotic Alliance party and now sport and culture minister, offered a 1m rand (£42,000) reward for her safe return.Kidnappings have soared recently in South Africa, with more than 17,000 in the 12 months to 31 March 2024, almost treble three years earlier, according toSouth African police data.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

These findings allow us to rethink the understanding of the ceremonial and socio-political organization of pre-Hispanic Petén,” said the ministry.In April, scientists discovered a 1,000-year-old altar from Mexico’s ancient Teotihuacán culture atTikal, elsewhere in the Petén department.That find was interpreted as proof of ties between the two pre-Hispanic cultures, which lived about 1,300km apart.Tikal, about 23km from Uaxcatun, is the main archaeological site in Guatemala and one of its biggest tourist attractions.Explore more on these topicsGuatemalaArchaeologyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The country has been hit with devastating fires in recent years, including in 2023, themost destructive on record.There are now 134 active fires acrossCanada, including in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Half are considered out of control.View image in fullscreenA wildfire burns near Wanless in Manitoba, Canada on 27 May.Photograph: Manitoba Government/ReutersThe evacuations include the town of Flin Flon, where 5,000 residents were told earlier to get ready to flee on a moment’s notice as a major wildfire bore down on the mining town, which is named after a fictional character in a 1905 paperback novel.Residents of several other remote towns and Indigenous communities have also now been told to leave.Most of the evacuees are expected to be transported to the Manitoba capital of Winnipeg.Evacuee Sheryl Matheson said the wildfires had surrounded her small town of Sherridon, northeast of Flin Flon.“It’s been overwhelming,” said the owner of a fishing lodge. “It was very smokey. You could see the fires four or 5km away and moving fast.”She added, “The flames were shooting over 121ft high and firefighters couldn’t get close enough to the fire to do anything.”Elsaida Alerta told public broadcaster CBC she was having “major anxiety” as she and her family readied to leave Flin Flon, where she has lived for three years.“Especially for somebody that lived in a big city [previously], that never had to evacuate, this is definitely nerve-racking,” she said.The only highway out of Flin Flon still open was jammed with traffic and local stations had run out of petrol, she said.“We basically gathered all our essential things, important documents, medications and, you know, things that our animals will need,” she said. “We’re just gonna make our way and hope for the best.”Premier Kinew said the widespread nature of the fires was cause for alarm.“For the first time, it’s not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to,” Kinew said.Twenty-two wildfires were active in the province.Nearly 200,000 hectares of forests have been scorched in just the past month, or triple the annual average over the previous five years, Kirstin Hayward of the Manitoba wildfire service said.“Manitoba has the highest fire activity in Canada so far this year, due in part to a prolonged period of warm and dry conditions,” she said.About 1,000 residents of Lynn Lake and Marcel Colomb First Nation in Manitoba and 4,000 people from the northern village of Pelican Narrows and other communities in neighboring Saskatchewan had already been evacuated earlier in the week.A firefighter was also severely injured when he was struck by a falling tree while battling blazes. He was being treated in hospital, Kinew said.The Manitoba premier said emergency shelters were being set up and companies and communities across the province were being asked to “open your doors” to displaced residents.Earlier this month, two residents of the small community of Lac du Bonnet died after being trapped in a major wildfire northeast of Winnipeg.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasClimate crisisWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

When I took to the skies at 80 I felt completely freeRead moreVideo from Peng’s mounted camera showed him above the clouds and covered in icicles as the temperature dropped to a reported -35C, as he tried to control his equipment.In a video filmed shortly after landing, Peng recounted the experience.“My hands were frozen outside. I kept trying to talk on the radio,” he said.Authorities praised Peng’s survival, conceding it was an accident. A “normal person cannot be exposed at 8,000m without oxygen [so] this is not something that can be done voluntarily” said a sports bureau official, according toSixth Tone.But Peng, who has about five years’ experience paragliding, never intended to leave ground level and so had not registered any flight plans, meaning his ordeal was “not subject to relevant approvals”, the report said. In response he was banned from flying for six months.The bureaureport, based on an interview with Peng, said he was in the air for more than an hour, and had stayed in radio contact with his friend, Gu Zhimin, who was still on the ground.The report said he had attempted to descend but his efforts were “ineffective”, and as he flew higher he became confused and briefly lost consciousness.Peng was eventually able to land about 30km from the launch site, where he was met by Gu and another friend.Gu later posted a video of Peng’s flight and comments on the ground to Douyin, China’s domestic version of TikTok, where it soon went viral.The video sparked shock and admiration from viewers, some suggesting he had broken records, but it also drew the ire of authorities.“Gu Zhimin posted a flight video without permission, which had a bad impact,” the report said. “He was grounded for six months and asked to write a report to deeply reflect on the negative impact of his behaviour.”The bureau said any record broken by Peng’s flight would not be officially counted because his flight was not registered.His flight nears the world record of 9,946m set by German paraglider Ewa Wiśnierska in 2007, whenshe was caught in a similar updraftwhile paragliding in Australia. Wiśnierska was unconscious for about 40 minutes, only learning how high she had flown after safely landing and checking her flight data.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaExtreme sportsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Convert Glebe Island for housing instead of ships? Move Long Bay Jail? Build on Callan park?The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has promised to unveil a “Plan B” to repair the hole punched in his government’s housing blueprint after members of the Australian Turf Clubvoted against selling the Rosehill racecourse siteto make way for 25,000 new homes.The loss of the envisioned mini-city at Rosehill leaves the state government scrambling to address the city’s housing crisis.Earlier this week, Minns said he was disappointed but not put off by the failure of the Rosehill proposal.View image in fullscreenThe NSW government is faced with finding alternative housing sites across Sydney after the Rosehill development was blocked.Photograph: Katharina13/Getty Images“It is important to test these things, even if the risk is failure, because the task in front of us when it comes to housing in NSW is so monumental that we cannot just take the safe option,” he said.“We cannot just take the sure bet. If we take the sure bet on every housing proposal and only do uncontroversial things that will not make nimbys irate, nothing will move in NSW.”Are there other sites that could be developed to boost housing inSydney?Glebe Island and the Bays precinctThe Bays precinctis a large area around Rozelle and Blackwattle Bay. It has been earmarked for development but planning is in the early stages. It will have a Metro station on theMetro West lineand the existing plan has earmarked sites for commercial property and 5,000 homes.The plan does not currently include developing the port facilities at Glebe Island, formerly used to unload imported cars. Today, the port is used intermittently for overseas cruise ships that fit under the Harbour Bridge and for concrete batching for major projects, including the Metro and Barangaroo.Its proximity to the city and proposed public transport links mean it could accommodate more housing.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailUrban Taskforce’s chief executive, Tom Forrest, said it would create few shadowing problems for surrounding houses – allowing for greater density.The downside is that it would lead to the loss of marine infrastructure in Sydney Harbour.Asked about this site in parliament on Wednesday, the NSW planning minister, Paul Scully, did not rule it out.Sydney Olympic ParkDevelopers are already advocating for greater housing densities at Olympic Park to replace Rosehill.View image in fullscreenOlympic Park is on the Metro West line and already has a significant amount of new housing planned for the area.Photograph: David Gray/Getty ImagesThemaster plan for 2050calls for 13,000 new homes, but developers say the 43-hectare site could house more.The upside is that Olympic Park is on the Metro West line and has good sport and recreational facilities. The downside is that planning is advanced and changes could delay development.Callan parkThe Metro West line goes directly under this 62-hectare government-owned waterfront site in Rozelle which was once home to Callan Park hospital.View image in fullscreenCallan park could be developed and a Metro station added.Photograph: Ann Hodgson/AlamyNo station is now planned but one could be added, in the same way the government proposed an additional station for Rosehill.However,the site is now parklandand has several heritage-listed stone buildings. Development, especially high-density housing, would set the government on a collision course with inner-west residents and heritage experts.The state government also owns the 25-hectare Gladesville hospital site on Victoria Road, although it is not on the Metro line. It is now used for some health facilities and is also heritage listed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He notes there isa partially constructed stationin Woollahra on the eastern suburbs rail line that was mothballed in the 1970s due to resident objections.Simon said the government’sTransport Oriented Development (Tod) programdoesn’t include any eastern suburbs sites. The program allows development within 400 metres of transport hubs, and in the case of accelerated precincts allows heights up to 30 storeys. The policy has led to several sites being proposed by developers on Sydney’s north shore.Simon said the forgotten Woollahra station could be developed quickly and developers would be keen to assemble sites from small holdings as they have on the north shore. “We would be calling for very tall buildings,” he said.Again, this proposal would meet resistance from the residents and heritage experts because homogenous Victorian housing characterises Woollahra.More density at Camellia and pockets of ATC land at RosehillThe government appears to have ruled out building a Metro station at Rosehill after the proposed sale was rejected by turf club members.But developers say the area remains a good location for more homes and a rail link.The development director at Billbergia, Rick Graf, said the area remains a highly suitable site for high-density development and a modified Metro station closer to the Camellia town centre should be considered by the government.Graf, who is also the convener of the Rosehill-Camellia Landowners Alliance, suggested thecurrent plans for Camelia, an old industrial area 1.5km from the Parramatta CBD, were undercooked and should be revisited.The current master plan envisages 13,000 dwellings serviced by the Parramatta light rail and a ferry wharf. But with the addition of the underused lands owned by the ATC around the racecourse, Graf said the area could support 25,000 homes in towers of 40 to 50 storeys, serviced by a Metro station.“The racetrack could be part of the green space. In other parts of the world, playing fields are incorporated in the centre of race tracks,” he said.Graf said Camellia landowners had not talked to the government since the Rosehill plan was defeated, but there was still a compelling case for a mini-city in the area.Relocate Long Bay jailAnother state government-owned site, Long Bay is now used as a remand centre. The 32-hectare site is serviced by buses along Anzac Parade but is only 5km from the existing last light rail stop at Kingsford.The prison would need to be relocated but the proximity to the CBD and beaches would make it attractive for new housing development.Redevelop Randwick barracksDevelopment at the 20-hectare commonwealth-owned Randwick barracks has been floated since the 1980s. It is relatively close to the last stops on the L2 and L3 light rail lines.The current planis for Defence to build 62 townhouses on a fraction of the site for defence families and retain it as a defence facility. The development is expected to be assessed by federal authorities this year and is exempt from state and local planning controls.Explore more on these topicsSydneyNew South WalesHousingNew South Wales politicsChris MinnsnewsShareReuse this content"

The council said the project would bring in 100 jobs and millions of dollars to the community.But the protest movement “Trees not Teslas” is determined to fight on.While conservation groups and others were protesting against the Tesla project because of the need to remove trees on the land where the plant would be built, Trees not Teslas also fired people up over Musk himself.Tesla wins council approval for new factory in South Australia despite vocal anti-Musk sentimentRead more“Neon” from Trees not Teslas did not want to use his real name, in part for fear of reprisals and in part because the group considers itself a collective.He said the traction the group got was “wild”, with their website getting thousands of views, but he acknowledged it was impossible to work out how much influence they ultimately had.Neon said the fight will continue, as the state government considers whether to approve the council’s proposal to revoke the site’s status as community land.“We just move that further up. We have to. We move that into actions for the state government,” Neon said.“We spread more awareness. We try to get more people involved. It now becomes not just a council issue but a fundamental state issue.”He said they started the campaign primarily to protect the trees on the site.“Our main focus was the trees … we’re looking to preserve green spaces,” he said.“We’re very pro-electric vehicle and pro-green energy.“But the industry that destroys green spaces is … green in name only.”The council argued that the space had not been publicly accessible since 2016 because of contamination. Neon said trees can help remediate the land.He also echoed comments made by the councillor Sarah Luscombe, who voted against the proposal, that the factory would only recycle or repurpose Tesla batteries, when most people use other brands.While the discussion has centred around electric vehicle batteries, it is possible the site could also recycle and repurpose Powerwall batteries.Guardian Australia has contacted Tesla for comment.Neon said the council voting eight to three to seek state government approval despite the community objections made the public consultation process seem like a box-ticking exercise.The mayor, Kris Hanna, said the project would bring jobs and an income stream into the community, and that Tesla would just set up elsewhere, if not in Marion. Tesla, Hanna said, had pledged to retain most significant trees and replace more trees than it was required to.Neon said the established trees would be replaced with saplings, removing many of their benefits.The state premier, Peter Malinauskas, said earlier this week that major industrial developments were welcome in the state and that while he “violently” disagreed with Musk’s politics, they were “his prerogative”.A state government spokesperson said the government welcomed investment and job creation in SA and would consider the proposal.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaSouth AustraliaAdelaidenewsShareReuse this content"

Pelicot rose to international fame last year for waiving her right to anonymity in the trial of her ex-husband and other defendants. He wassentenced to 20 years in prison.Darian was at the festival to promote her book, I’ll Never Call Him Dad Again. Asked by a male audience member how men can “step up” and be part of breaking cycles of abuse, she said “you need to talk between guys” about pornography, because it is “part of the system” of misogyny and violence.Caroline Darian, daughter of Gisèle Pelicot, speaks: ‘How can you rebuild when your father is the worst sexual predator in decades?’Read moreThe actor and activist Jameela Jamil, who was chairing the event, said that “there are so many men in my life, even, who don’t know all of the facts of this case in the way that women do”.What we “desperately need” men to do “is to check your mates” and challenge their misogynistic comments and behaviour, she said.Darian is a pen name, a combination of her brothers Florian and David’s names, because she wanted to honour the fact that they have been so involved in the process of telling her story.The author spoke with great compassion and admiration about her mother, but explained that they were not currently on speaking terms. In her book, she wrote that they reached a “point of no return” in their relationship after her mother did not believe Darian when she claimed her father had raped her.Darian told the Hay audience that she thinks her mother’s reluctance to support her was a “way for her to protect herself”.It’s “quite difficult” to accept that your child has been abused, she said. “I think my mum is not able to recognise it because otherwise I think she’s going to die.”Dominique Pelicot’s actions have “really impacted the whole family, and everyone from her family had a different position”, she added. “But I just have to be grateful for what [Gisèle Pelicot] did.”Telling her son, who was six at the time, about her father’s actions was particularly hard, Darian said. She felt a responsibility to tell him the truth but “it was a shock” as he had previously had a good relationship with his grandfather and “loved him very much”.Her son saw a psychiatrist for almost four years after finding out the news, and Darian said she was “trying to educate him about what is consent”.Raising a young man in a positive way was “a question of open dialogue”, she said, and “a question of education”.Explore more on these topicsHay festivalFranceGisèle Pelicot rape trialEuropeRape and sexual assaultPornographynewsShareReuse this content"

The Bank of England targets 2% inflation.Bailey warned that simmering geopolitical tensions and the fragmentation of international trade suggested the lengthy, complex manufacturing supply chains of the past were unlikely to return.“The inevitable conclusion is that we cannot assume the supply sides of our economies behave as efficiently as they did before Covid. And this was a substantial cause of the very difficult upsurge in inflation,” he said.“Our jobs are much harder if we face more inflexible and uncertain supply side conditions in our economies, as we appear to do today.”His comments came as figures from the Office for National Statistics showed inflation in March rose at a faster pace for private and social renters than older households who own their homes outright, extending an intergenerational gap that has opened up since September 2023.Graph showing inflation rate for rent and mortgages.Inflation was 3.6% for private renters in the year to March compared with 1.8% for “outright owner-occupiers”, the ONS said in itslatest estimate of household living costs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According togovernment figures, the average age of a private renter is 41, and 53 years in the social rented sector.Mortgage payers, another group that are younger on average than outright owners, had an inflation rate of 2.8% in the year to March.Ben Twomey, chief executive of Generation Rent, said the figures were “a sour reminder” of the high costs renters pay to have a roof over their head.“Homes are the foundations of our lives, but renters across the country are at constant risk of losing their homes and even ending up homeless because of soaring costs that swallow up our earnings.“News of private renters facing the highest household costs is a sour reminder of how much of a raw deal we are getting.”Explore more on these topicsBank of EnglandBrexitAndrew BaileyTrade policyInflationForeign policyEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

When I went to get the ruling from the court I was extremely surprised because I was expecting a knock on the knuckles,” she said.UK and EU reach deal over Brexit reset after fishing rights breakthroughRead moreThe French court only ruled on her right to vote in European elections. Bouilliez first mounted legal action against the disenfranchisement in 2020 with a case going all the way to the European court of justice, which ruled against her in 2022.The court followed theadvice of the advocate general, Anthony Collins, who said the EU treaty had made “nationality of a member state” an “essential condition of a person to be able to acquire and retain the status of citizens of the union and to benefit fully from the rights attaching to that status”.Julien Fouchet, a French lawyer representing Bouilliez, said the court did not determine conclusively what happened to those acquired rights British citizens such as Bouilliez had received when she became a permanent resident of France under the free movement rules that were available to Britons beforeBrexit.The ruling by the Auch tribunal judiciary could be used to restore rights across France for British citizens living in the country before Brexit who did not opt to apply for French citizenship and wanted to win back their right to vote, he said.“The court ruled that Alice had not committed any crime and that to lose her voting rights was a fundamental and disproportionate infringement of her voting rights,” he said. “The right to vote is a common good, it is more than just a right.”Though married to a French citizen, Bouilliez never sought citizenship, partly as she made an oath to the British crown when she worked for the Foreign Office.Before Brexit, British citizens living in France had the right to vote in municipal and European parliamentary elections but not legislative elections for the national government or presidency.Although Bouilliez and other Britons who did not take French citizenship after Brexit also lost their right to vote in local elections, she says she had not given up on the issue. “I have won the right to vote only in the EU elections,” she said. “The rest is for later I hope.”In a parallel situation, EU citizens including French people living permanently in the UK had the right to vote in local and European elections but not national, with the exception of citizens of Ireland, Cyprus and Malta who can vote in all elections in Britain.The UK had wanted to make reciprocal voting rights part of the Brexit deal but the EU did not agree, leaving Britain to negotiate bilateral treaties.So far just five countries – Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Poland and Luxembourg – have agreed that each other’s citizens can continue to have rights in local elections, but there is no such treaty with France.Fouchet called on the French and British governments to open negotiations to restore citizens’ voting rights. “The French and UK governments should have a bilateral treaty reciprocating the right to vote in municipal elections. I see this judgment as an opportunity, especially in light of the recentUK-EU summit, to get an agreement on this,” he said.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Before the UK’s departure from the EU, the government wrote to all member states signalling our willingness to enter into bilateral agreements.“These would ensure each country’s citizens have mutual local election voting and candidacy rights, and we remain open to further agreements.”This article was amended on 29 May 2025. The court ordered that Alice Bouilliez be restored her right to vote in European elections, but not French local elections as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsBrexitFranceEuropean electionsEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

After landing at the Casement aerodrome, McGovern is expected to be taken under armed guard to the special criminal court to be formally charged.Shawna Coxon, the deputy commissioner of Ireland’s police force, An Garda Síochána, said it was a significant development in international law enforcement. “Transnational organised crime gangs cause misery to communities not only in Ireland but throughout the world. They engage in murder, human trafficking and drug dealing.”Ireland’s justice minister, Jim O’Callaghan, thanked his Emirati counterpart, Abdullah bin Sultan bin Awad Al Nuaimi, and the Dubai police for their cooperation.The UAE has become a base for Irish criminals and their associates partly because the state has no extradition treaty with the EU. However, a decade of lobbying by Irish officials paved the way for an extradition treaty that became operational on 18 May.It was not retrospective and did not apply to McGovern but authorities in both jurisdictions made a separate, one-off arrangement to transfer the suspect. McGovern was shot in the stomach in 2016 when a rival gang’s hit team stormed a Kinahan-organised boxing weigh-in at a Dublin hotel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forensic testing established the presence of cannabis.“We want to know exactly how it got into the candy and, of course, how the bags ended up in the store,” a police spokesperson, Chantal Westerhoff, said.The sweets are sold in several pack sizes and only those in 1kg bags with a use-by date of January 2026 and a specific product code are affected, Haribo said, adding that a full refund would be paid for all packs returned.Patrick Tax, vice-president of marketing at Haribo, said the recall concerned “a limited number of cases” in the east of the country. “The safety of our consumers is our highest priority and Haribo takes this incident very seriously,” he said.“This is a live issue and we are working closely with the Dutch authorities to support their investigation and establish the facts,” Tax told Agence France-Presse. The NVWA warned people bluntly: “Do not eat these sweets.”In 2023, six children aged between four and 14were taken ill in The Hagueafter eating candy containing THC, one of the active ingredients in cannabis, but the sweets concerned were not regular commercial products.Police said drug smugglers were increasingly using children’s sweets as cover and cited several examples of gangs injecting THC into candy.

The rollout was marred by scenes of chaos on Tuesday after crowds overran one distribution centre managed by GHF and Israeli forces said they had fired “warning shots”. Gaza health officials said at least one civilian had been killed and 48 injured in the incident.Annotated satellite imageThe aid bearing the Rahma logo, which was prominently displayed in a press packet distributed by GHF, suggested to somemediaoutlets that the groups were official partners. That would be an important endorsement asquestions have grown over GHF’s fundingand lack of partners or experience in distributing aid.Israeli jets continued to pound areas ofGazaon Thursday, killing at least 45 people, including 23 in a strike on the Bureij camp in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical workers said.Israeli media reported that the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had told the families of hostages held in the territory that he had accepted a new ceasefire proposal presented by Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. There were no further immediate details. Hamas said earlier that it had received the new proposal from mediators and was studying it.Speculation around a possible ceasefire had been growing after Witkoff said the White House was preparing a draft document that could provide the basis for an agreement.US distances itself from Gaza food delivery group amid questions over its leadership, fundingRead moreThe UN and aid groupshave pushed back against the new system led by GHF. They sayIsraelis trying to use food as a weapon and that a new system will not be effective.In a statement, Rahma said it had previously “secured all necessary permits” for 4,000 food boxes to cross into Gaza but none had entered.Israel has blocked the UN and other aid organisations from moving food into Gaza, where people are starving.Unable to get the food in, Rahma had allowed the containers to be “taken custody” by GHF. Rahma added, however, that it had refused to allow its personnel to take part in the distribution because of GHF’s use of armed security contractors.“We noticed images of our food boxes with logo being distributed without Rahma’s direct involvement,” the group said in a statement. “Rahma did not authorise such distribution, and none of our team was permitted to participate in this process.”MapIn a separate statement, Rahma’s executive director and founder said it had allowed GHF to transport the aid, which had been stuck at the border, due to the “severe need in Gaza” but had demanded a formal explanation for why that aid had been distributed under its name.“We stipulated that the Rahma logo be removed from the aid parcels,” said Dr Shadi Omar Zaza, the head of Rahma. “To our surprise, the organisation’s logo was not removed, and the security company distributed these parcels bearing the Rahma Worldwide logo.”Palestinians described more scenes of chaos on Thursday at a GHF hub as security contractors struggled to control the crowd. People scattered as gunfire rang out, although it was not clear who fired or if there were any casualties.Zaza said GHF’s use of armed security contractors violated Rahma’s operational charter and humanitarian mandate. “We will not accept, and will not be part of, this aid distribution mechanism – because we do not allow armed actors, we do not allow any armed party to interfere in our relief work,” he said.GHF has been approached for comment.Agence France-Presse and Associate Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelAidPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, successive governments have tried to permanently cement Israelicontrol over the land, in part by declaring swathes as “state lands”, which prevents private Palestinian ownership.The motion was said to have been put forward by the far-right defence minister,IsraelKatz, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Kedumim, which is considered illegal under international law.Map of the West Bank showing Israel’s 22 planned settlements.Katz said the settlement decision “strengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria”, using the biblical term for the West Bank, “anchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism”.He added it was also “a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel”.A spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem said: “Israel continues to promote Jewish supremacy through the theft of Palestinian land and the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank. The Israeli government is openly and blatantly working to destroy the Palestinian people, and any chances for a normal future for the people living between the Jordan River and the sea.”The spokesperson added: “The international community is enabling Israel’s crimes by standing aside while millions of Palestinians are subjected to this racist and brutal regime of the Israeli government.”The government intends to use the 22 settlements to bolster Israel’s presence around Route 443, which connects Jerusalem and Tel Aviv via Modiin and was described by Israel Ganz, the head of the Yesha council umbrella group of West Bank Jewish municipalities, as “the most important decision since 1967”.The minister said on X: “We have made a historic decision for the development of settlements: 22 new communities in Judea and Samaria, renewing the settlement of the north of Samaria, and reinforcing the eastern axis of the state of Israel.”Last July Israel approved the largest seizure of land in the occupied West Bank in more than three decades, accordingto a report releasedby Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog.At the time, the Israeli government approved the appropriation of 12.7 sq km (nearly 5 sq miles) of land in the Jordan valley, indicating it was “the largest single appropriation approved since the1993 Oslo accords”, referring to the start of the peace process.In aleaked recording captured by Peace Now last year,Smotrich, during a conference for his National Religious Party-Religious Zionism, disclosed that the land confiscations in 2024 surpassed previous years’ averages by approximately tenfold.He said: “This thing is mega-strategic and we are investing a lot in it. This is something that will change the map dramatically.”In May 2023, Smotrich, who said his “life’s mission is to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state”, instructed Israeli government ministries toprepare for a further 500,000 Israeli settlersto move into the occupied West Bank.On 20 June,the Guardian revealedhow the Israeli military had quietly handed over significant legal powers in the West Bank to pro-settler civil servants working for Smotrich.An order posted by the Israel Defense Forces on its website on May 2024 transfers responsibility for dozens of bylaws at the Civil Administration – the Israeli body governing in the West Bank – from the military to officials led by Smotrich at the defence ministry.In March, astatement issuedby Peace Now said that between 1 January and 19 March, 10,503 housing units were promoted, surpassing the 9,971 units approved throughout the whole of 2024.The approval of new settlements by Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government represents a further implementation of its longstanding goal to annex the occupied Palestinian territory – an objective bolstered by the Trump administration.Mike Huckabee,nominated as Trump’s new ambassador to Israel, signalled his support for Israeli claims on the West Bank in an interview last year. He said: “When people use the term ‘occupied’, I say: ‘Yes, Israel is occupying the land, but it’s the occupation of a land that God gave them 3,500 years ago. It is their land.’”Rightwing settlers have described top officials in Trump’s new administration, which rescinded sanctions imposed on violent Israeli settler groups, as a “dream team” that would offer a“special opportunity”to permanently end any prospect of a Palestinian state.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

If the new system for distributing supplies in Gaza is supposed to be an adequate replacement for the major aid organisations that were previously in place,it has got off to an inauspicious start.On Tuesday, after the first food point run by the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – a non-government organisation (NGO) with Israeli support that uses US-based contractors – opened in Rafah, Israeli forces stationed at the perimeter opened fire. Panicked civilians fled the scene, most without the food they came for; dozens of people were injured, and at least one died.Even before the disaster of its initial operation, the GHF’s executive director resigned, warning that it could not be an independent, impartial provider of aid. Meanwhile, urgent warnings continue that children and elderly people are dying of starvation, and hundreds of thousands more are on the brink of famine. Last night, it emerged thatfour people had diedafter the UN’s World Food Programme said “hordes of hungry people” had broken into a food supply warehouse in central Gaza.Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s Middle East correspondentEmma Graham-Harrison, is about what happened in Rafah – and what it suggests about whether the new plan is up to the task, or even intended to attempt it. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesUK news| The housing ombudsman has warned that“simmering anger at poor housing conditionsrisks becoming social disquiet”, as his office records a 474% increase in complaints. Richard Blakeway said it was “neither fanciful nor alarmist” to suggest anger at housing conditions would cause an “irreparable” fracturing of trust, saying the “shock of Grenfell Tower and Awaab Ishak’s death resonate still”.Trump tariffs| A US federal trade court hasblocked Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffson imports under an emergency-powers law. The ruling, which the White House is said to be appealing, would blow a hole in Trump’s strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners.Ukraine| Ukraine and Germany have agreed to future military cooperation in which Berlinwill help finance long-range weapons production on Ukrainian soil. The deal came as Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia had amassed 50,000 troops in the Sumy region bordering Russia.UK news| Prosecutors have confirmed they have authorised21 charges against influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking. The Crown Prosecution Service said that the two men would not be tried in the UK until an investigation into charges they face in Romania is concluded.School meals| Guidance urging schools in England to serve children meat at least three times a week should be overhauled to increase the eating of vegetables,a leading charity has said. The Food Foundation found that 80% of the most commonly eaten meat dishes in schools are either processed or red meat.In depth: ‘Instead of bringing food to people, they are telling people to come to the food’View image in fullscreenPalestinians receive food packages from a US-backed foundation in western Rafah.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesAs word spread on Tuesday that one of the distribution points used by the new body responsible for distributing food, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), had opened, tens of thousands of people headed there. Crowds of desperate people broke through fences around the site, and Israeli forces started shooting. While those were later claimed by Israel to be “warning shots”, at least one civilian died and 48 others were injured, many with gunshot wounds.That outcome points to the very reason that traditional aid operations do not use armed security or work with belligerent forces – and, perhaps, the dangerous inexperience of those behind the new system: it is hard to build networks of trust in communities under attack, and easy to retreat behind guns.“When they say ‘warning shots’, it’s not clear where they aimed that gunfire, but even if they fired into the air over the crowd, those bullets have to come down,” Emma said. “This is what happens when you use a dangerous, untested method at a time of extreme crisis.”Did this sort of thing happenunder the old system?While convoys have been targeted by armed groups, and desperate civilians looting to feed their families, the distribution networks of major aid groups and the UN — which are closely audited and take food into communities rather than concentrating it in a few places — have held up well during the war.“There has never been an incident like this at a UN or humanitarian operation’s distribution position,” Emma said. The worst previous incident, known by Palestinians as the flour massacre, sawat least 112 people killedand 760 injured when desperate crowds gathered as aid trucks arrived in Gaza City; there were conflicting accounts of whether most of the victims were shot by Israeli troops or died in an ensuing stampede.But even that horrifying case was “not about a UN or humanitarian distribution operation degenerating into chaos,” Emma said. “It happened as a convoy arrived, at a time of desperation when northern Gaza was under the most intense siege.”Many of the attacks on convoys have happened as trucks travel out of border areas under Israeli control and cross “no man’s land” before they get to areas where aid groups can operate safely. “Given the Israeli forces have extensive control of Gaza, and have a legal obligation as an occupying power to ensure civilians can get food, you might think they should be able to maintain security to the point of distribution,” Emma noted.Meanwhile, Palestinian attempts to protect aid from attacks have been targeted by Israeli strikes. Israel says that the police force in Gaza are legitimate targets because the force reports to the Hamas government.One such incidentsaw six members of a security team killed last week.How effective is the new system at getting food to Palestinians?The new arrangements appear much less effective at getting supplies to those most desperately in need. One key reason for that is that “instead of bringing food to people, they are telling people to come to the food,” Emma said: supplies are being distributed at static distribution points in boxes weighing up to 20kg that are meant to feed “5.5 people for 3.5 days”. “If someone is on foot and severely malnourished or elderly, how are they supposed to reach the centre or carry a box like that with them?”Israel has repeatedly claimed that this approach is necessary to stop supplies being requisitioned by Hamas. “But once people leave the distribution points, that could just as easily be happening now,” Emma said. In any case, the UN says its closely monitored supply chains are secure, and Israel has never provided any evidence to back up its claims, or even offered statistics on the scale of the alleged problem.Quite apart from the logistical particulars, there is a much more fundamental question: whether the supplies now being allowed in are anything like enough to tackle the hunger crisis. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza – where many people were already living in a state of severe food insecurity – on 2 March; the UN estimates that about 600 trucks are needed each day to begin addressing the problem. Since the total siege was eased earlier this month, Israel says that 1,050 have entered in total.The GHF said on Tuesday that it had distributed 462,000 meals – enough for just over 50,000 people, about 2% of Gaza’s population, for three days. While the operation is now meant to scale up, that is a vanishingly small number against the scale of the need. With those numbers in mind, Emma said, “it is difficult to see this as anything other than performative. It is not even the beginning of a solution.”What other reasons might there be for the change?Benjamin Netanyahuhas insistedthat warnings of famine are merely “the current fad, the current lie” – although Israeli officials are saidto take a different viewin private. Instead, Netanyahu has framed the operation as “a diplomatic issue”.With media and even diplomats kept out of Gaza, and Palestinians treated as unreliable sources in parts of the media, humanitarian workers have often provided compelling eyewitness evidence of the human cost of Israel’s assault on the territory. “There are those who see this operation as a way to remove those independent observers,” Emma said.The darkest fears about the attempt to concentrate food supplies in a few sites — forcing civilians to cluster around them - are connected to the fact that the locations are concentrated in the south, and are likely to mean Palestinians elsewhere will be again displaced in search of food.Some humanitarian organisations see that as a prelude to mass deportation – a step backed by influential Israeli cabinet ministers which, when taken together with the scale of the violence visited upon Palestinians in Gaza since the war began, would strengthen the case that Israel is committing genocide. Earlier this month, the far-right Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrichsaid that“Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to … the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries.”Who is running the programme?When the new system was announced earlier this month, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel,said thatit was “wholly inaccurate” to call it an Israeli plan. Of Tuesday’s operation, Emma said that she had been told that Palestinians were handing out the supplies, and photos showed some stamped with the logo of charities already operating in Gaza.But even when the scheme was announced, there were reports that the Israeli government was heavily involved in its creation. And on Saturday, the New York Times reported that the plan wasfirst conceived in December 2023by an Israeli group with close ties to the government, and that from the beginning it was viewed at least in part as a way to undermine Hamas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Which? said pet owners were often put off making a complaint when there was a problem, and that those who did often had limited options for taking the matter forward or were left feeling their issue had been unfairly dismissed.Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at the consumer body, said: “It is completely unjust that many pet owners feel not only unhappy with the service and treatment received by their vet when their pet is taken ill, but also lack the means to make a complaint that will be properly investigated.”In its survey of more than 1,000 pet owners who had experienced some kind of problem with their vet during the past two years, pricing was the most common issue raised. More than half said the price of care or treatment was excessive, while more than a quarter said the cost was higher than they thought it would be.The third most common issue was quality of care, followed by customer service, not being given the relevant information, being charged the wrong price, and the vet or practice making a mistake.The first port of call when making a complaint is usually the practice itself. Many of the pet owners in the survey who had been put off making a claim said they did not think they would be successful, did not want to fall out with their vet, or did not know how to complain in the first place.“Very few” owners then went on to escalate the complaint, and those who did found that the options available were often inadequate,said Which?.There is the Veterinary Client Mediation Service (VCMS), but this is a voluntary complaints scheme. Meanwhile, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) has the responsibility for investigating all “concerns” raised with it about vets – but Which? claimed it had “very high thresholds” for investigating and progressing a complaint, “leaving pet owners feeling dismissed, or that the process is biased in favour of veterinary professionals”.Steph Drew, from Lincoln, told Which? that the complaints system was “designed to protect vets”. Her dog Daisy was left injured when her vet operated on the wrong leg. Drew complained to the RCVS, but her case was initially dismissed after a year, said the consumer organisation. After appealing against the decision, the case went on for three years, finally ending in a disciplinary hearing. The vet has now been struck off and found by the RCVS to have failed to provide adequate care to 18 animals in total, said Which?.Earlier this monththe UK Competition and Markets Authority – which has been investigating rising costs and other issues in the multibillion-pound sector – said it had “concerns that … firms’ internal complaint handling processes may be inconsistent and operate poorly, and that the external redress mechanism provided by the VCMS is not as effective as it could be”. It also found there were “shortcomings” with the RCVS code of conduct.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We support proposals to enhance consumer protection, and mandatory practice regulation.”It said that under current legislation it could only investigate allegations of serious professional misconduct.

It has already helped hundreds of thousands with advanced prostate cancer to live longer.But some countries, including England, havestopped shortof offering the “spectacular” drug more widely to men whose disease has not spread.Now a team from the US, UK and Switzerland have built an AI test that shows which men would most likely benefit from abiraterone. The “exciting” breakthrough will enable healthcare systems to roll out the drug to more men, and spare others unnecessary treatment.The AI test is being unveiled in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world’s largest cancer conference.Nick James, professor of prostate and bladder cancer research at the Institute ofCancerResearch in London and a consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, co-led the team that built it.“Abiraterone has already hugely improved the outlook for hundreds of thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer,” said James. “We know that for many men with cancer that has not yet spread, it can also have spectacular results.“But it does come with side-effects and requires additional monitoring for potential issues with high blood pressure or liver abnormalities. It can also slightly increase the risk of diabetes and heart attacks, so knowing who is most likely to benefit is very valuable.“This research shows that we can pick out the people who will respond best to abiraterone, and those who will do well from standard treatment alone – hormone therapy and radiotherapy.”The test uses AI to study images of tumours and pick out features invisible to the human eye. The team, funded by Prostate Cancer UK, the Medical Research Council and Artera, trialled the test on biopsy images from more than 1,000 men with high-risk prostate cancer that had not spread.The AI test identified the 25% of men in the group most likely to benefit from the abiraterone – for these men, the drug halves the risk of death.In the trial, patients received a score – biomarker-positive or -negative – which was compared with their outcomes. For those with biomarker-positive tumours, one in four of the men, abiraterone cut their risk of death after five years from 17% to 9%.For those with biomarker-negative tumours, abiraterone cut the risk of death from 7% to 4% – a difference that was not statistically or clinically significant, the team said. These men would benefit from standard therapy alone and be spared unnecessary treatment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it has been available for men with this indication in Scotland and Wales for two years.“Abiraterone costs just £77 per pack, compared with the thousands of pounds that new drugs cost,” said James. “I truly hope that this new research – showing precisely who needs the drug to live well for longer – will lead to NHS England reviewing their decision not to fund abiraterone for high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread.”Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, described the AI test as “exciting”. He added: “We therefore echo the researchers’ urgent call for abiraterone to be made available to those men whose lives it can save – men who, thanks to this research, we can now identify more precisely than ever before.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerArtificial intelligence (AI)Medical researchCancer researchCancerHealthComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

This would cut capital gains tax on cryptoassets from 24% to 10%, turning the UK into a “crypto powerhouse”, he said. Farage added that the crypto legislation that his party had drawn up would include a “bitcoin digital reserve in the Bank of England”.Farage said the bill would make it illegal for banks to debank customers who use and trade in cryptocurrency.On Thursday the Reform website was updated to accept cryptocurrency donations. There was a disclaimer stating that all donations were subject to Electoral Commission rules and that anonymous donations were not permissible.At the conference, Farage called the acceptance of political donations “innovative”, before commending America for being “ahead” with their stance on digital assets.“My message to the British public, and my message particularly to young people, is to help us to help you bring our country properly into the 21st century,” he said. “Let’s recognise that crypto and digital assets are here to stay.”UK government drops plans for NFT made by Royal MintRead moreDuring his talk, Farage criticised the current Labour government and the previous Conservative regime’s lack of action in the cryptocurrency world. He said: “Rishi Sunak, when he was briefly prime minister, made one speech about crypto … and how London used to be a global financial centre. One speech and nothing else. Labour, well we have 25 men and women in cabinet and not a single one of them has worked in private business.”AReform UKspokesperson said cryptocurrency donations would be accepted by the party and details were expected to be announced on Friday.Reform UK is listed on Companies House as a private company majority controlled by the leader, not a members’ association like other parties. The company that owns Reform UK is listed as Reform 2025, a not-for-profit company that has just two members and two directors: Farage andZia Yusuf.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageCryptocurrenciesBitcoinnewsShareReuse this content"

Sources close to the negotiations in the oil-rich region said the deal was now at its final stages and they expected UK agreement imminently.The deal is likely to be particularly beneficial for the car industry and financial services, though estimates suggest that a free trade agreement would be worth less than 0.1% of GDP over the next decade.However, there is likely to be a backlash over a deal on chicken imports, where lower animal welfare standards could significantly undercut British farmers.The TUC is among those who have urged caution over the deal and has raised concerns with ministers, the Guardian understands.Human rights groups have previously said the UK should not finalise a free trade agreement without legal commitments on human rights improvements, especially for migrant workers.They said that the UK and GCC should have strong human rights conditions in any future agreement and the UK should provide its own independent impact assessment transparently on the potential consequences of deepening trade ties.Another source close to the talks suggested that though there were likely to be some language around human rights as part of the commitments, there were no legal obligations involved.A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: “Negotiations on a trade deal with the GCC are ongoing. Our priority is to get the right deal, and we’re not setting a deadline.” A departmental source said there was a possibility a pause would be needed for Eid al-Adha, which begins on 6 June.The UK-GCC trade agreement is also likely to have an impact on the UK’s net zero ambitions, with all six GCC countries ranking in the top 10 per capita for carbon emissions.The TUC’s general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: “The TUC has raised concerns directly with ministers about a trade deal with the Gulf states and we will continue to do so.“Our view on trade deals is consistent – the government should not agree deals with countries that abuse human rights and workers’ rights, and violate international law. It was right for the government to suspend trade talks with Israel.“We will continue to make the case with ministers for a trade agenda with workers at its heart – and to press the issue of labour standards and human rights in the Gulf states and other countries.”Tom Wills, the director of the Trade Justice Movement, said: “The UK-GCC trade deal is a values-free agreement that will offer minimal benefit to the UK economy while signalling that human rights and environmental protections are not a priority in UK trade policy.“The government has chosen to finalise this deal without publishing a human rights impact assessment, securing binding commitments on labour rights or environmental standards, or allowing parliament any meaningful scrutiny. It’s a continuation of a secretive, short-term approach to trade that puts corporate access above public values.”Wills said that warm words around rights in the deal would still mean it fell short of comparable standards. “When we see progressive language in a trade deal – around supporting workers or the environment – we always ask the same question: is it binding? Will there be consequences for failing to uphold standards? If not, these warm words aren’t worth the paper they’re written on,” he said.Ministers are also likely to face a backlash from the National Farmers’ Union over the agricultural aspects of the deal. Industry figures told the Guardian that the deal could include uncapped access for chickens if the imports met hygiene standards.Those standards do not cover welfare, sparking alarm among farmers who have recently had to meet new, higher requirements under British law.Negotiations have been led by trade minister Douglas Alexander, who is set to conclude work started under the Conservatives, which was once seen as a more concrete prospect than the India deal, signed a fortnight ago. Alexander is expected to meet his counterpart for final signoff.The previous trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan had promised in parliament that the deal “will not come at the expense of human rights”.MPs have pointed out that there is precedent for including rights concerns in trade deal, such as the chapter on Indigenous peoples in the New Zealand deal which makes commitments on their part in their nation’s future progress.Nick Thomas-Symonds, who was then shadow trade secretary,said in oppositionthat it was “crucial that human rights, women’s rights and workers’ rights are embedded in UK trade negotiations”.But in the most recent exchanges under the Labour government, Lords trade minister Baroness Jones said that although the UK was a “leading advocate for human rights around the world … this work takes place separately to negotiations on free trade agreements.“While aspects of trade policy can provide the opportunity to address other issues in a bilateral relationship, free trade agreements are not generally the most effective or targeted tool to advance human rights issues,” she told the Lords last year.The UAE trade minister Dr Thani bin Ahmed al-Zeyouditold Politico in 2023that the UK and other western countries must “tone down” standard human and workers’ rights provisions in trade deals “if they want more market access and more business opportunities”.Trade with the bloc is worth about £59bn a year, according to government estimates, as the UK’s seventh-largest export market, with a trade deal expected to increase trade by about 16%. Individual Gulf states could also pursue their own deeper partnerships with the UK and sovereign wealth funds in Gulf nations includingSaudi Arabiaand the UAE have been some of the biggest foreign investors in the UK.The trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and Alexander chose the Gulf for their first joint international visit after the election. Starmer visited Saudi Arabia in December.The UK has previously pledged that the deal will not compromise environmental, public health, animal welfare and food standards, made all the more pressing because of the agrifoods deal the UK hopes to seal with the EU in the coming months. The NHS and health services are excluded from the deal.Technology, innovation and financial services will form a key part of the deal which is also likely to have some work and visa provisions for businesspeople from both the UK and the Gulf states – another area that could provoke attack from the Conservatives and Reform, though most of the deal was negotiated under the Tories.Joey Shea, a Saudi Arabia and UAE researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “Finalising a UK-GCC trade agreement without concrete rights protections would be a grave mistake with grim consequences for migrant workers across the Gulf.”Polling conducted by the Trades Justice Movement in November 2024suggested there was public opposition to the deal, with just 21% of people in favour.The TUC previously submitted evidenceduring the Conservative negotiations over the deal, saying that the“kafala” system– which involvesbinding migrant workers to a specific employer – had entrenched modern slavery and exploited millions of migrant workers.Explore more on these topicsTrade policySaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesQatarBahrainKuwaitOmannewsShareReuse this content"

The launch of the national scheme comes after results from pilots of the test stunned senior doctors and NHS leaders.Prof Peter Johnson, NHS England’s clinical director for cancer, said: “Liquid biopsies are leading us into a new era of personalised cancer care and it’s fantastic that we are now able to expand the use of this revolutionary test on the NHS to help tailor treatment for thousands of patients across the country.“Cutting-edge genomic testing is helping us deliver more targeted and kinder care for patients, enabling some to avoid more intensive treatments such as further chemotherapy, which can have a huge impact. We are already seeing the difference this test can make in lung and breast cancer – and we hope to roll it out for patients with other forms of cancer in the near future.“As research progresses, it’s exciting that this approach has the potential to help us scan the body in a single blood test to see where and how cancer may be developing and target it with speed and precision to help save more lives.”The liquid biopsy can mean patients receive targeted therapy up to two weeks earlier, while helping some to avoid further tests and treatments including chemotherapy.The NHS is the first healthcare system in the world to introduce a “blood test-first” approach to diagnosing lung cancer, with the test to be used before traditional tissue biopsies for the first time.The DNA blood test involves the patient providing a blood sample, which is then processed in NHS genomic labs in Manchester and London. The results come within days, and tell the patient’s doctor what the best targeted therapy is to attack the patient’s particular tumour.After the pilots, at least 15,000 patients with suspected lung cancer are expected to benefit from the test every year. The NHS is also bringing in the testing for advanced breast cancer patients, with four genetic variations now being screened for, and 5,000 women expected to benefit each year.An economic assessment of the pilots showed the test could save the NHS £11m a year in lung cancer care alone. The NHS is also aiming to bring in the liquid biopsy for other forms of the disease, including pancreatic and gallbladder cancer.Prof Dame Sue Hill, the chief scientific officer for England, said: “This represents a real step-change in care for eligible lung and breast cancer patients on the NHS.“The liquid biopsy testing enables genomic mutations in the fragments of cancer that enter the blood stream of these patients to be detected. This testing is transforming care and helping clinicians match patients earlier – especially when cancer tissue may not be available – with potentially life-extending targeted therapies rapidly and with greater precision.“This test is a great example of the NHS harnessing the power of genomic technological advances to enable the latest groundbreaking treatment to be delivered to patients.”The liquid biopsy will be made available to all eligible lung and breast cancer patients in NHS hospitals across England.The blood test looks for circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) to find specific genetic variations of cancer. Pilot data showed that in some cases, patients received the DNA test results 16 days earlier than the standard cancer tissue biopsy approach, a painful and invasive procedure.As well as speeding up access to new treatments, the DNA test also helped patients avoid repeat diagnostic procedures and unnecessary treatment such as standard chemotherapy and its side effects, while also improving their quality of life, the pilots found.Prof Alastair Greystoke, co-clinical lead of the lung cancer pilots and honorary medical oncologist at Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This is the first ever national implementation of a ‘liquid biopsy first’ approach to the diagnosis and treatment of a cancer.“Not only has it led to faster and more precise treatment for patients with lung cancer, but we have also been able to show that this is a cost-effective measure for the NHS and set up the framework to evaluate this in other cancers going forward.”Prof Sanjay Popat, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden and co-clinical lead of the pilots, said: “This is fantastic news and an important step forward for lung and breast cancer patients in England. We have seen first-hand how the implementation of a simple blood-draw and testing in our laboratory has revolutionised treatment.“Earlier access to highly effective targeted medicines allows more patients to avoid delays, start treatment early, and start the best treatment for their type of cancer. I am really pleased that we are now able to roll out this out nationally.”Explore more on these topicsCancerNHSMedical researchEnglandBreast cancerLung cancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music.Sinners composer Ludwig Göransson, actor Miles Caton and others who worked on the film also attended the screening.“Any time that filmmakers take the time out to pay homage to the Delta, especially, because we’re the root of music, the blues culture, that means a lot,” said Brandice Brown Williams, a theater teacher who brought two of her students to the screening.‘A safe haven from racial violence’: Sinners shows the importance of juke jointsRead moreThe film is set in 1930s Clarksdale, Mississippi, but current-day Clarksdale doesn’t have a movie theater, making it difficult for people to see the film about their hometown.

Though he promised efficiency and modernization, Musk leaves behind a trail of uncertainty and reduced functionality.The timing of Musk’s departure lines up with the end of his 130-day term limit as a “special government employee” but also plays a part in an effort by the billionaire to signala wider shift away from Washingtonas he faces backlash from the public and shareholders. Musk has recently made a show of refocusing his efforts on his tech companies in interviews, saying that he has spent too much time focused on politics and plans to reduce his political spending in the future.As Musk moves on, he consigns a mess of half-realized plans and gutted agencies to his acolytes installed in key positions across the federal government. His departure throws Doge’salready chaotic impact on the governmentinto an even grayer limbo, with questions over how much power the nebulous taskforce will have without him and who, if anyone, might rebuild the programs and services it destroyed.Doge’s debrisMusk’s initial pitch for Doge was to save $2tn from the budget by rooting out rampant waste and fraud, as well as to conduct an overhaul of government software that would modernize how federal agencies operate. Doge so far has claimed to cut about $140bn from the budget – although its “wall of receipts” isnotorious for containing errorsthat overestimate its savings. Donald Trump’s new tax bill, though not part of Doge and opposed by Musk, is alsoexpected to add $2.3tn to the deficit, nullifying any savings Doge may have achieved. Its promises of a new, modernized software have frequently been limited to AI chatbots – some of which werealready in the works underthe Biden administration.The greater impact of Doge has instead been its dismantling of government services and humanitarian aid. Doge’s cuts have targeted a swath of agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization, which handles weather and natural disaster forecasting andplunged otherssuch as the Department of Veterans Affairs into crises. Numeroussmaller agencies, such as one thatcoordinates policy on homelessness, have been in effect shut down. Doge has brought several bureaus to their knees, with no clear plan of whether the staff Musk leaves behind will try to update or maintain their services or simply shut them off.Elon Musk announces exit from US government role after breaking with Trump on tax billRead moreIn one early example of its cuts and the holes in government they have created, Doge targeted the government tech group that partnered with federal agencies to provide tech solutions,known as 18F.When Doge staffers entered the General Services Administration agency that housed the 18F Office, former employees have said they appeared to fundamentally misunderstand how the government operates and the challenges of creating public services.Former 18F director Lindsay Young, who is now part of a legal appeal that contends the firing of 18F violated legal requirements, is concerned that Doge’s cuts will have long-lasting effects on government functions.“In government, it’s just so much easier to tear things down than it is to build things up,” Young said.Themass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Servicesrepresented a similar loss of institutional knowledge that Doge does not seem intent on replacing.Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who has been tracking Doge’s cuts, used the agency’s tobacco unit as an example, which was severely affected by the cuts. “The loss of so much expertise, especially in the healthcare area will mean that more Americans will become sick or die earlier than they might have,” he said. “It also may take many years and great expenditure of resources to restore that experience and expertise.”Musk’s gutting of USAid, formerly the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, is one of the starkest examples of the disarray and harm that Doge’s cuts have caused. TheUS canceled approximately 83%of USAid programs, imperiling services around the world aimed at humanitarian assistance and disease prevention. Onepioneering program under USAid, Pepfar, whichcoordinates the US HIV/Aids response, has seen its services reduced worldwide and its staff left in confusion over what they can still do for people who relied on their organization. Doge’s cuts to the program have likewise threatened the rollout ofa new anti-HIV drugthat researchers have hailed as a “miracle” for its effectiveness.As Musk returns to Tesla and SpaceX, the agencies he laid waste to are left to pick up the pieces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the largest questions about what Doge’s future looks like is whether these staffers, some of whom gained near unfettered access to the government’s most sensitive data, will retain the same powers they enjoyed under Musk.Doge staffers, such as billionaire investor and Musk ally Antonio Gracias, have embedded themselves at key agencies such as the Social Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration. They have worked as a sort of parallel government task force, operating with a lack of transparency as their attempts to access databases and migrate data hascaused disarrayand technical problems. Whether Trump and agency heads allow them to continue on with carte blanche remains unseen.Already at least two prominent Doge staffers have followed Musk to the exit. The billionaire’s longtime top lieutenant Steve Davis, who was running the day-to-day operations of Doge, left his role on Thursday. Spokesperson Katie Miller, wife of Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, also left the White House to work full-time for Musk,according to CNN.Musk is pivoting from DC and Doge’s failures – and wants investors to knowRead moreSome of Musk’s dictates have already been rolled back since he left Washington earlier this month, including a much-derided mandate that required federal employees to send a list of five things that they accomplished each week. The weekly email, which was initially introduced with the threat of being fired for non-compliance, was largely ignored and viewed by many as pointless busywork. On Wednesday, the Pentagonformally announcedthat it would halt the practice.Doge is not being left leaderless, however. Taking over for Musk, accordingto the Wall Street Journal, is Christian nationalist and key figure in the rightwing Project 2025 manifesto Russ Vought. A longtime believer that the president should have sweeping executive powers, Vought has said that he wants federal employees to beleft “in trauma”and to slash federal funding.Musk has praised Doge’s work and pledged that it will continue without him, and as recently as this week is stillremoving veteran officialsit disagrees with from federal agencies. Even at reduced numbers, Musk’s allies also still have access to immense amounts of sensitive and confidential data they arereportedly intending to useto surveil immigrants.What seems farther away than ever in the chaos, however, is Musk’s promise to make the government more efficient and better serve the public.“You don’t need that many people to decide to just cut things,” 18F’s Young said. “But if you actually want to build things, that takes thought. It takes effort.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationUSAIDUS immigrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

ERO is in charge of immigration enforcement, including arrests, detention and deportation, while HSI typically focuses on investigating transnational crime, such as drug trafficking, human smuggling and the spread of online child abuse.The 21 May meeting in Washington DC is the latest example of the increasing pressure being placed on officials nationwide toincrease the number of arrestsof immigrants, as the administration doubles down on its anti-immigration agenda.The latest phase of the crackdown includes new tactics, such as mandating federal law enforcement agents outside Ice to assist in arrests and transports, more deputizing of compliant state and local law enforcement agencies, and arresting people at locations that were once protected, like courthouses.Trump officials increasingly recruit local police for immigration enforcement despite ‘red flags’Read more“ This administration came into office with the illusion that they had been given a broad mandate to effectuate an aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, and they are doubling down now on that agenda,” said Nayna Gupta, the policy director for the American Immigration Council. “ Public polling is showing decreasing support for Trump’s immigration agenda, as Americans wake up to the reality that mass deportation means arrests of our neighbors and friends, masked agents in our communities and people afraid to go to work and show up to school, in ways that undermine our local economies.”Helter-skelter action has led tocitizens caught upin the dragnet, Iceskirting due process– tothe chagrinof thesupreme courtandlowercourts –over-crowdingin detention centers, arrests basedon ideologyand officialsdeportingpeople to thirdcountries.“The sweeping Ice raids and arrests are hitting families, longtime residents, children and communities in a way never seen before,” said Jesse Franzblau, the associate director of policy for the National Immigrant Justice Center.As the number ofpeople crossingthe border into the US without authorization hasplummetedevenfurther thanafter the final Bidencrackdown, operations in the US interior have increased.“Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump’s and the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe,” Tricia McLaughlin, the homeland security assistant secretary, said in a statement.But even if the new target is fulfilled, it’s a far cry from Trump’s election campaignpledges to deport15m to 20m people, which itself is more than the estimated 11m undocumented population.Agents with the FBI, HSI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other federal law enforcement agencies have been co-opted from normal priorities to carry out immigration enforcement work. Current and former federal officials told the Guardian there is concern that important non-immigration-related investigations are falling by the wayside as a result.There has also been ahuge escalationby local police and sheriff’s departments assisting, deputized by Ice to perform federal immigration arrests under aprogram called 287(g).Ice has also been targeting unusual places.On Tuesday, Ice and several other federal law enforcement agencies arrested roughly 40 people on theMassachusetts islandsof Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard. The US Coast Guard transported those apprehended,Ice said, angering some residents, local mediareported.The agency has also been arresting people at courthouses throughout the country – a trend that has troubled advocates and policy analysts.“We’re seeing theTrump administrationtake the unprecedented step of arresting non-citizens who are following the government’s rules and procedures, and showing up for their court hearings,” said Gupta. “ They are desperate to reach a certain number of arrests per day. And the only way they can find non-citizens easily and quickly is to go to the courthouses, where they [immigrants] are doing exactly what they’re supposed to do.”On Wednesday, sources told the Guardian that officials had arrested people at two separate immigration courts in New York City. The outletthe City observedseven people arrested in a lower Manhattan court.Internal documentsaccessed by the Washington Postshow Ice officers in more than 20 states have been instructed to arrest people at courthouses immediately after a judge orders them deported or after their criminal cases are dropped and they try to leave.The number of people held in detention by Ice reached 49,000 by 18 May, an increase of more than 10,000 since Trump took office, with the agency using local jails andfederal prisonsto hold immigrants, amid overcrowding.Austin Kocher, an assistant research professor at Syracuse University whoclosely tracksimmigration detention data, said of the 3,000 daily arrest quota: “ The big question for me is: where are they going to put people?”Meanwhile, last month, the Trump administrationordered immigration judgesto quickly dismiss cases by denying asylum seekers a hearing. The directive “has nothing to do with efficiency – it’s about slamming shut the courthouse door on people who have the right to seek asylum and a fair day in court”, Shayna Kessler, the director of the Advancing Universal Representation initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice,said.On Capitol Hill, themajor spending billpassed by the House would balloon spending for immigration enforcement, at theUS-Mexico borderand in the interior, whilecutting everyday services.Trump’s new border wall will threaten wildlife in an area where few people passRead more“The administration is on a reckless spending spree, counting on Congress to bail them out for overspending hundreds of millions of dollars in private prison contractswith tiesto top-level officials,” Franzblau said.He concluded: “It is beyond cruel to superfund Ice’s rampant violations of constitutional protections and expand the deadly immigration detention and enforcement apparatus.”Miller confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday that the White House was setting a goal for Ice to arrest at least 3,000 migrants per day, far above an earlier 1,000 per day arrest quota.Reuters reported later on Thursday that the Trump administration was removing two senior immigration enforcement officials amid demands to step up enforcement, three people familiar with the move said.Top Ice officials Kenneth Genalo and Robert Hammer will be pulled from their posts, the people told the news agency, requesting anonymity to discuss the shift. DHS denied that they were pushed out.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationKristi NoemDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheTrump administrationis expected to take the case to the supreme court if it loses.The ruling by a three-judge panel at the New York-based court of international trade came after several lawsuits argued Trump had exceeded his authority, leaving US trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashing economic chaos around the world.On Thursday, the Trump administrationfiledfor “emergency relief” from the ruling “to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake”.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the judges had “brazenly abused their judicial power to usurp the authority of President Trump” in what she characterised as a pattern of judicial overreach.“Ultimately the supreme court must put an end to this,” she said.Leavitt’s comments came as a second judge, Washington DC district court judge Rudolph Contreras, called the tariffs “unlawful” and ordered a preliminary injunction on the collection of tariffs from a pair of Illinois toy importers, which brought the case.Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress but Trump has so far bypassed that requirement by claiming that the country’s trade deficits amount to a national emergency. This had left him able to apply sweeping tariffs to most countries last month, in a shock move that sent markets reeling.Elon Musk announces exit from US government role after breaking with Trump on tax billRead moreThe court’s ruling stated that Trump’s tariff orders “exceed any authority granted to the president … to regulate importation by means of tariffs”.The judges were keen to state that they were not passing judgment on the “wisdom or likely effectiveness of the president’s use of tariffs as leverage”. Instead, their ruling centred on whether the trade levies had been legally applied in the first place. Their use was “impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because [federal law] does not allow it”, the decision explained.Financial markets cheered the court’s ruling, with the US dollar rallying in its wake, soaring against the euro, yen and Swiss franc. In Europe, the German Dax rallied 0.9%, while France’s Cac 40 rose 1%. The UK’s FTSE 100 blue-chip index ticked up 0.1% at the start of trading. Stocks in Asia also climbed on Thursday, while in the US stock markets all rose marginally.The ruling immediately invalidated all of the tariff orders that were issued through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law meant to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during a national emergency.The judges said Trump must issue new orders reflecting the permanent injunction within 10 days.White House officials have hit out at the court’s authority.The ruling, if it stands, blows a giant hole through Trump’s strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners, draw manufacturing jobs back to US shores and shrink a $1.2tn (£892bn) US goods trade deficit, which were among his key campaign promises.Without the help of the IEEPA, the Trump administration would have to take a slower approach, launching lengthier trade investigations and abiding by other trade laws to back the tariff threats.The decision is also likely to embolden other challenges to Trump’s policy. Last month, California’s governor,Gavin Newsom, filed a lawsuit against the tariffs, arguing they were “illegal, full stop”.The court was not asked to address some industry-specific tariffs Trump has issued on cars, steel and aluminium, using a different statute, so these are likely to remain in place for now.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that there could be other legal avenues for Trump to impose across-the-board and country-specific tariffs, saying: “This ruling represents a setback for the administration’s tariff plans and increases uncertainty but might not change the final outcome for most major US trading partners.”Other options for the president include sections under various trade acts that grant him powers to intervene on trade policy, albeit in an often slower and, in some instances, more limited way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of ‘TRUMP?’ What other reason could it be?” the president asked, without noting that he had appointed one of the judges himself in 2018.Trump’s curiosity as to what could possibly explain the decision did not, apparently, extend to reading any ofthe 49-page explanationwritten by the court, because his post did not deal with any of the legal issues raised in the opinion.At least seven lawsuits have challenged Trump’s border taxes, the centrepiece of Trump’s trade policy.The court made its ruling in response to two cases. One was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, VOS Selections, whose owner said the tariffs were having a major impact and his company may not survive.The other was filed by a dozen US states, led by Oregon.“This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim,” said the Oregon attorney general, Dan Rayfield.Trump allies rail against court ruling blocking wide swath of tariffsRead moreTheplaintiffsin the tariff lawsuit argued that the emergency powers law did not give the president the power to apply tariffs, and even if it had done, the trade deficit did not qualify as an emergency, which is defined as an “unusual and extraordinary threat”.The US has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.Trump also targeted imports from Canada, China and Mexico, claiming his decision was meant to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the US border.His administration pointed to the court’s approval of Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and claimed that only Congress, and not the courts, could determine the “political” question of whether the president’s rationale for declaring an emergency complied with the law.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpTariffsInternational tradeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He personallydirectedCambridge Analytica to focus on the Leave campaign during the UK’s Brexit referendum in 2016 that led to the UK leaving the European Union.For its lawsuit against Trump’s tariffs, the Liberty Justice Center gathered five small businesses, including a wine company and a fish gear and apparel retailer, and argued that Trump overreached his executive authority and needed Congress’s approval to pass such broad tariffs.The other group who sued the Trump administration over its tariffs was a coalition of 12 Democratic state attorney generals who argued that Trump improperly used a trade law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), when enacting his tariffs.In such a polarized time in US history, it may feel odd to see a decision celebrated by liberal and conservatives. But Trump’s tariffs have proven controversial to members of both parties, particularly after Wall Street seemed to be put on edge by the president’s trade war.The US stock market dipped down at least 5% after Trump announced the harshest of his tariff policies. Recovery was quick after Trump paused many of his harshest tariffs until the end of the summer.Stocks started to rally on Thursday morning after the panel’s ruling. The judges said that the law Trump cited when enacting his tariffs, the IEEPA does not “delegate an unbounded tariff authority onto the president”.

The White House is appealing the ruling, which means the case could go up to the US supreme court, should the high court decide to take on the case.Members of both groups who sued the Trump administration celebrated the ruling. Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel for the Liberty Justice Center, said in astatementthat it “affirms that the president must act within the bounds of the law, and it protects American businesses and consumers from the destabilizing effects of volatile, unilaterally imposed tariffs”. Oregon’s Democratic attorney general, Dan Rayfield, who helped the states’ lawsuit, said that it “reaffirms that our laws matter”.In a statement, Victor Schwartz, the founder of VOS Selections, a wine company that was represented by the Liberty Justice Center in the suit, said that the ruling is a “win” for his business.“This is a win for my small business along with small businesses across America – and the world for that matter,” he said. “We are aware of the appeal already filed and we firmly believe in our lawsuit and will see it all the way through the United States Supreme Court.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpUS small businessLaw (US)US politicsUS CongressInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

But over the last few months, Trump has tried to publicly pressure Powell to lower interest rates, as the Fed did last year, though officials say that the economy – thrown into a tailspin from Trump’s trade war – has become too unstable to continue lowering rates.After Trump’s “liberation day” in early April, when he announced a slate of tariffs that ended upcrashing US stock markets, Trump wrote on social media: “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always ‘late,’ but he could now change his image, and quickly.”Powell, who was appointed during Trump’s first term in 2018, has resisted the pressure from Trump and has warned that high tariffs could lead to inflation and, earlier in May, said that officials are “in no hurry” to cut interest rates – all statements that seem to have put Trump on edge.“‘Too Late’Jerome Powellis a FOOL, who doesn’t have a clue,” Trump wrote after the Fed’s meeting.Trump had previouslythreatenedto fire Powell, though it’s unclear whether the president has the power to do so. Last week, the supreme court allowed Trump to follow through on his dismissal of officials on the National Labor Relations Board, the panel that oversees labor disputes, but judgesnotedthat the Federal Reserve is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” – implying that it likely won’t be so easy for Trump to get rid of Powell.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyDonald TrumpJerome PowellEconomicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As its international price sets successive record highs above $3,000 (£2,220) an ounce, criminal gangs, illegal miners and established mining companies battle over the metal.The conflict is not fought out in the open but in a maze of tunnels that stretch for miles inside the mountains of Pataz, a gold-rich Andean province about 130 miles (200km) inland from Peru’s third city, Trujillo. In early May, the bodies of13 security workers were found shot dead, their hands bound and some showing signs of torture, in one of the tunnels belonging to an artisanal miner linked to the province’s largestmining company, Poderosa.View image in fullscreenThe Poderosa mine sits in the gold-rich Andean province of Pataz.Photograph: Dan Collyns/GuardianAfter the gruesome discovery, the government imposed a month-long ban on goldmining for all but the company andsent hundreds of soldiers and police officersto enforce a state of emergency and a nightly curfew in the province.It’s all for gold. Pataz has wealth, which generates violence, so they hire usMine guardYet, the massacre of the security contractors, who had been hired to expel intruders, was just the most visible example of the brutal violence which, locals say, has left countless dead, many of them forcibly “disappeared” under rocks and rubble in a labyrinth of 450 subterranean tunnels.Five hundred metres inside one mineshaft, three men armed with military-grade guns emerge from the gloom to speak to the Guardian.“We are living moments of terror,” says the group’s leader. “Many confrontations; manycompañeros[comrades] gone,” he admits when asked about how many gun battles he had fought as the violence surged in recent years.View image in fullscreen‘We are living moments of terror,’ says one mine guard. Despite the risk, many are drawn to the pay, which is far higher than a miner’s.Photograph: Dan Collyns/GuardianThe armed gang’s job is to steal mines from small miners or recover mines stolen from their employer and wrest back control, he says. Underground gunfights are inevitable and attacks can come from all sides as armed men known asparquerossteal ore – the gold-bearing rock – by tunnelling in from connecting shafts or invading the mine from other entrances. The gangs burn tyres and pump smoke into the tunnels to drive out miners. Or they attack the security guards, as when the 13 men were killed.One guard, his face masked by a green mining helmet pulled low over his head, rests his right hand rests on an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. “We’re a family,” he says, nodding at his companions in rubber boots and bulletproof vests as water drips from the rocky roof of the tunnel.View image in fullscreenMiners take a break to smoke or chew coca leaves, an age-old practice that helps boost energy and reduce hunger.Photograph: Dan Collyns/GuardianHe does not know much about the international gold price but, as a former soldier, he knows he earns more as a gunman than as a miner – and much more than if he worked back in Trujillo. “We have the training,” he says.“I do get scared,” he admits, but the monthly wage means he can support his five young children. “It’s all for gold. Pataz has wealth, which generates violence, so they hire us.”“Your life is worth more than gold,” reads one placard. “Without artisanal mining, many families don’t eat,” reads another. They are being displayed by families in a well-organised protest against the government’s suspension of all but Poderosa’s mining in Pataz.For more than four decades, Poderosa has leased a mining concession from the government that encompasses much of the province.Geologically, Pataz is shot through with gold-rich veins of quartz and pyrite in abruptly steep mountains, peppered with hundreds of mineshafts.View image in fullscreenFamilies in Pataz protest against the mining ban. The signs read: ‘We are not criminals, we want to work’ and ‘Ceasefire! No more deaths in Pataz’.Photograph: Dan Collyns/Guardian“It’s a blessing,” shouts José Torrealva, president of Pataz’s artisanal mining association, in a fiery, crowd-stirring speech to the hundreds of families assembled on the town’s football pitch. “Where you scratch the earth, there’s gold!”Torrealva, whom prosecutors are investigating for allegedly mining illegally, is a firebrand advocate of what he calls “artisanal” mining. “Who drives the economy in Pataz? We, the small miners, do,” he cries to cheers from the townsfolk.View image in fullscreenJosé Torrealva, head of the Artisanal Miners’ Association of Pataz, speaks at the rally.Photograph: Dan Collyns/Guardian“They are taking away our fundamental right to work. They are making laws to ‘disappear’ the artisanal miner,” says Torrealva, who owns companies that provide explosives and truck hundreds of tonnes of ore out of Pataz to refineries on the coast.Only those on a register of informal miners purportedly in the process of formalisation – known by its acronym Reinfo – can sell gold to Poderosa.In more than a decade, only2% of more than 84,000 miners registeringhave completed the formalisation process, which requires them to pay tax and employ clean mining techniques.Earlier this month, the government removed1,425 miners in Pataz from the Reinfo registry, meaning they can no longer sell their ore to Poderosa nor operate legally.She keeps asking: ‘Where is Daddy?’Paty CarranzaStill, mining without a state permit is common. Many miners, such as Brandon Saldaña, 29, resent that his employer is not considered fully legal, even though he pays a team of miners.“Everybody criminalises us, saying we’re illegal, but it’s not like that. They put everybody in the same bag,” he says as he sits with his fellow miners inside a shaft, smoking and chewing coca leaves laced with lime from a gourd. “Sometimes the informal miner lacks just one document to become formal.”View image in fullscreenInformal miners dig for a vein of gold ore in a mine in Pataz.Photograph: Dan Collyns/GuardianThe bureaucratic process is slow and frustrating.

His company sold ore to Poderosa, which buys from about 280 registered artisanal miners in the province, processes the gold on site and sells it to Canada, Japan and Switzerland.Cueva told the local pressthat Libmar spent 80,000to 100,000 soles (£16,000-£20,000) a month on security. He also said his company was providing support to the victims’ families.View image in fullscreenPataz was once a typical Andean village, but the soaring price of gold has brought outsiders and violence.Photograph: Dan Collyns/The GuardianSince the incident, Poderosa has hired 1,200 security guards, according to Pablo de la Flor, the company’s corporate affairs manager. “That is two security guards for every miner,” he says. “Despite that, it has been impossible to control this spate of violence.”The organised crime networks behind the gangs ofparqueros, who steal the ore, have impressive resources, says De la Flor. It’s a “risky investment” requiring heavy machinery, geologists, mining engineers, hitmen and inside information.“In some cases, they drill tunnels that are 2km long, costing $2,000 to $2,800 a metre, so somebody is financing that operation.”Hundreds more miners who do not sell to Poderosa fuel a multibillion-dollar illicit trade in gold ore. In the last four years,33,708 trucks loaded with 674,160 tons of ore, worth $3.5bn, left Pataz and passed police checkpoints to any one of four dozen crushing plants in a maze of industrial lots in Trujillo, according to the mining company’s data.View image in fullscreenPolice special forces search vehicles at a checkpoint near Chagual Bridge, which spans the Marañon River on the main route to Pataz from Trujillo.Photograph: Dan Collyns/GuardianOnce crushed, lorries transport it to refineries near Lima. The ingots are then shipped principally to India and the United Arab Emirates – importers with laxer standards of due diligence compared with Canada and Switzerland.In a statement to the Guardian, Poderosa expressed “sincere condolences to the families” and said to be “in permanent communication with Libmar so that the affected families receive the necessary support”.But Paty Carranza, 23, the widow of Frank Monzón, one of the 13 murdered men, says she has received nothing from Poderosa. She has been receiving anonymous threatening phone calls urging her to remain silent.View image in fullscreenPaty Carranza, 23, with a picture of her partner, Frank Monzón, who was just 24 when he was killed by an armed group in a mine tunnel.Photograph: Dan Collyns/GuardianHer three-year-old daughter still does not know her father is never coming home.“I haven’t found the courage to tell her,” Carranza says. “She keeps asking: ‘Where is Daddy? When is he taking us to the beach?”Carranza is on the second floor of a half-built breeze-block home in El Porvenir, a tough neighbourhood in Trujillo. Monzón was earning a little more than $1,000 a month, more than he could dream of making in the city, and the money paid for their home to be built. “‘Your hubby has money. You’ll want for nothing,’ he used to joke,” Carranza recalls.View image in fullscreenMiguel Antonio Rodriguez Diaz, aka ‘Cuchillo’, after his arrest in Colombia.Photograph: Colombian Police/AFP/Getty ImagesIn May, the suspected leader of the attackers, Miguel Antonio Rodríguez Díaz, alias“Cuchillo”, was captured in Colombia.

Her partner’s body was intact save for a gunshot in the back of the neck, but other bodies at the morgue showed signs of torture: broken jawbones, chests opened up, missing arms, legs, some with a head or testicles missing.“Many people are dead inside those mines; they go inside and are never seen again,” she says. “They sacrifice people for what?

Many expressed “anti-Tesla and anti-Elon Musk sentiment”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailFor decency, the local council redacted the language in some submissions to describe Musk and Tesla.“We should not support and put money in the pockets of a [redacted] who openly [redacted] salutes, is [redacted] human,” said one.The world’s richest man has announced he will leave his role in the department of government efficiency, which has slashed jobs and funding for US government agencies with often chaotic and devastating effects. Heis pivotingback to his businesses, including Tesla, amid slumping sales.Meanwhile in Adelaide, the Marion city council overrode community objections andapproved the factory projectto proceed to the next stage, which will need state government approval. The council said the project would bring in 100 jobs and millions of dollars to the community.But the protest movement “Trees not Teslas” is determined to fight on.While conservation groups and others were protesting against the Tesla project because of the need to remove trees on the land where the plant would be built, Trees not Teslas also fired people up over Musk himself.Tesla wins council approval for new factory in South Australia despite vocal anti-Musk sentimentRead more“Neon” from Trees not Teslas did not want to use his real name, in part for fear of reprisals and in part because the group considers itself a collective.He said the traction the group got was “wild”, with their website getting thousands of views, but he acknowledged it was impossible to work out how much influence they ultimately had.Neon said the fight will continue, as the state government considers whether to approve the council’s proposal to revoke the site’s status as community land.“We just move that further up. We have to. We move that into actions for the state government,” Neon said.“We spread more awareness. We try to get more people involved. It now becomes not just a council issue but a fundamental state issue.”He said they started the campaign primarily to protect the trees on the site.“Our main focus was the trees … we’re looking to preserve green spaces,” he said.“We’re very pro-electric vehicle and pro-green energy.“But the industry that destroys green spaces is … green in name only.”The council argued that the space had not been publicly accessible since 2016 because of contamination. Neon said trees can help remediate the land.He also echoed comments made by the councillor Sarah Luscombe, who voted against the proposal, that the factory would only recycle or repurpose Tesla batteries, when most people use other brands.While the discussion has centred around electric vehicle batteries, it is possible the site could also recycle and repurpose Powerwall batteries.Guardian Australia has contacted Tesla for comment.Neon said the council voting eight to three to seek state government approval despite the community objections made the public consultation process seem like a box-ticking exercise.The mayor, Kris Hanna, said the project would bring jobs and an income stream into the community, and that Tesla would just set up elsewhere, if not in Marion. Tesla, Hanna said, had pledged to retain most significant trees and replace more trees than it was required to.Neon said the established trees would be replaced with saplings, removing many of their benefits.The state premier, Peter Malinauskas, said earlier this week that major industrial developments were welcome in the state and that while he “violently” disagreed with Musk’s politics, they were “his prerogative”.A state government spokesperson said the government welcomed investment and job creation in SA and would consider the proposal.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaSouth AustraliaAdelaidenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s a wrap. At first glance it might be tempting to see the 2025Champions Leaguefinal as one of the more obviously high-European occasions in recent football history.Twenty thousand Parisians and Milanese will trace out a thousand mile right-angle this weekend, north from Lombardy, east across Alsace and the Rhineland, there to spend a long weekend wandering the white stone streets of Munich, with its reassuringly terrifying gothic cathedral, its pounded-meatcuisine de terroir, itsaltstadtboutiques selling wristwatches priced at roughly the same the cost as the average human arm, and finally on to the lighted dome of the Allianz Arena, dumped down in the green fringes to the north like a giant alien doughnut.For the first time in five years there isn’t a single English person involved asParis Saint-Germainand Inter meet in the capital of Bavaria. Premier League, Club World Cup. Look upon our Euro splendour and tremble. This is heartlands stuff, a moment of pure Schengen-ball.A different kind of Champions League final is something to be cherished | Philipp LahmRead moreExcept, of course, it is something else entirely too, an opportunity to complete a brilliantly enacted subversion of that old order from within.PSG have been the best team in Europe this year. In Munich they will kick off as favourites to take the trophy to France for the first time since 1993. But victory would also represent something much more significant, the moment Qatar basically completes football – and in a way that feels far less brittle, far more permanently entrenched than might have seemed possible a few years ago.Every drama needs a ticking clock. This one came bonging into existence in November 2010 with the staging of the most iconic lunch in modern football history. Summoned to the French president’s Élysée Palace by Nicolas Sarkozy (thepre ankle-tagversion), Uefa’s Michel Platini found a surprise guest at the table. This was Tamim al-Thani, crown prince of Qatar and a footballing nobody at this point, but the same Thani who would, as the emir, hand the World Cup to Lionel Messi in Qatar 12 years later.It is important to state that Platini denies this interaction had any bearing on his vote, 11 days later, for the 2022 World Cup hosts. Sarkozy has also denied influencing or even appearing to influence the Uefa president’s choice.Qatar did gain the decisive Platini backing all the same. Coincidentally, Qatar’s state broadcaster almost immediately bought up the unsold TV rights to Ligue 1. In another unrelated act, six months later Qatar Sports Investments bought PSG, who were at that time in financial difficulties. A year later France sold 50 Airbus planes to Qatar Airways, a key step in a process that has led, 15 years on, to Qatar standing elbows-deep in French infrastructure funding.Fast forward to Saturday and the emir may well be present again as the jewel in his sporting outreach arm completes a key stage towards overhauling Real Madrid as the most commercially successful club in the world. Make no mistake, this will be a coronation even in defeat. We all wear thebishtnow.View image in fullscreenTamim al-Thani puts a bisht on Lionel Messi after Argentina’s World Cup triumph in Qatar in 2022.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt is worth being clear on how that final phase has played out, a wonderful example of football’s instant amnesia. Until six months ago PSG were still struggling to free themselves from the idea that this was some kind of debauched celebrity waxwork museum, defined by a mental image of Neymar breakdancing on crutches at his own gala birthday party dressed only in a chinchilla fur thong and solid gold bowler hat, before driving off into the night in a special car made entirely from cheese.Fast forward through one tactical rejig and a key jettisoning of stars and the talk in France is of how this team has “seduced the French people” with its youth and verve, transformed now into a kind of kitten collective, not just the good guys, but the best guys. This is the new PSG. Soulfulness, graft, sweat, doing woodwork in a shed. It turns out humility might actually be a good way to win after all. So we will buy the greatest humility available to mankind. Kneel before our self-effacing collectivism.There was always a gulf between the keep-ball style of successive PSG coaches and the desire to stack the squad with strolling superstars. So the new sense of grit is present in the tactical patterns too, a team that take to the pitch wound up into a kind of tackle fever, whose superpower is not being more famous than you, but counterpress and rapid team transitions. It is a brilliantly drilled, brilliantly obedient group, like watching a kind of cubism-ball in action, a world of rigorous geometric patterns,nature morte, all squares, angles, order, clean lines.The basic material here is young, high quality and ego-free. So instead of Neymar we have the anti-Neymar Désiré Doué, acme of the orderly modern prodigy, a football obsessive who takes timed daytime naps to improve his energies. The midfield is defined by Vitinha, who loves the ball and nothing else, who looks as though the only time he would cancel training is when he wants to do even more training, triple training (he will also do your training first, and at twice the speed).View image in fullscreenPSG’s all-action Vitinha tackles Arsenal’s Kai Havertz during a Champions League group game in October.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut it would also be entirely wrong at this point to imagine the current success springs from the rejection of the superstar era. In fact the opposite is true. One hand washes the other. All parts are connected. For all the occasional moments of on-field farce, it was the Neymar-Messi-Mbappé era that gave PSG the current fully realised team.All clubs like to talk about the Brand. Paris really, really like doing this, the current boilerplate boasts running to “a cultural icon … at the intersection of sport, fashion, and entertainment… a globally recognized lifestyle brand …The Club of the New Generation … shaping the future of sport and society.”The most astonishing part of this encomium is that it’s actually true. The Hollywood stuff, the bolt-on fame, the army of likes and follows: this wasn’t simply naivety or cash thrown into an empty pit. Qatar worked out early on that money buys you success, but it can also buy you the stuff everyone else’s success is based on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bought for €70m (£59m) in 2011, PSG is valued between €3.5bn and €4.2bn. The real killer is commercial revenues, once a third of Manchester United’s annual haul but now leaving them in the dust for the foreseeable future.There have been three phases. The first was the frontier age of blunt state sponsor-led investment. Reeling in Zlatan. Changing the logo (previously: club badge) to Paris, firing up the chain of loss-leading global boutiques. The Nike Jordan deal in 2018 was an act of marketing prescience, positioning PSG as NBA-adjacent, fashion runway-curious.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé (right) in his Nike Jordan-produced PSG kit after scoring against Liverpool.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAPhase two was 2017-2021 and the basking superstars team: no good at enforcing a high press, but hugely successful in ramping up the cashflow. Commercial deals have flooded in, high-end stuff rather than noodle partners by numbers. Matchday revenues are unexpectedly big, fruits of a one-big-club city that loves glitz and spectacle. That star project worked. The club are closer than ever to becoming an independent mega-brand. Messi may have hated being in Paris. But he gave a lot more than he might have realised.It obviously helps that none of this was ever really a gamble. For a club with bottomless owners of last resort there are no hard consequences to shedding a slew of duff star players. Manchester United may have spent years unable to pay off a bloated and sullen squad, but this is a lesson in the power of a truly nation-state owner. Slash and burn. Swallow the losses. You don’t have to be backed by one of the world’s largest gas producers to build a champion team without fear of the end cost. But it does help.As will the £300m spent on what is, again without bluster, “the best training centre in the world”, Campus PSG at Poissy, with its pristine acreages, its market garden, its chauffeurs’ ping-pong room, its hypoxic oxygen chamber, luxury living quarters and hairdressing salon, the panic room in case of terrorist attack.It helps also that the real genius of Qatar has been building power rather than simply working in its shadow. This month the club president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, was seen meeting Jeff Bezos at the Cannes film festival to work out a possible collaboration, the kind of thing that seems logical now for a man who is also president of BeIn Sports, a minister in the Qatari government, head of the European Club Association (ECA), a Uefa executive committee member and even an unexpected face at the recent Gaza peace talks at the Élysée Palace (not the kind of thing Ken Bates, for example, was ever likely to get an invite to).Now or never? Inter ready to seize moment in Champions League final | Nicky BandiniRead moreSome people are said to have a finger or two in the pie. Khelaifi has both fists jammed in there so deep it’s hard to know where the pie starts and finishes. Heisthe pie.It has been a nontypical rise for the son of a pearl fisherman, born outside power, but expert in the macro-hustle.Al-Khelaifiused the Super League chaos brilliantly, standing with Aleksander Ceferin just when European football needed someone with no fear of consequences. This led to his current role at the ECA, which has become the real power behind the power, and a key driver of the new Champions League. Yeah, don’t do the super league. Do this instead with me in charge.It is worth remembering as PSG present themselves in Munich as a vision of hopeful young talents beaming in sport-couture kit, that this is still nation-state power finding a way. It is also an entity that doesn’t need to say please any more.One notable absence from the club’s invited guests in Munich is the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, whose tenure has been bruised by the refusal to sell the publicly owned Parc des Princes to QSI. It feels like a fitting bookend to that formative lunch at the palace. We don’t actually need to sit with you now. We are the entire buffet these days. Win or lose on Saturday, that table is set.Explore more on these topicsParis Saint-GermainChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Same with other places I play, like Australia. I definitely think there is opportunity to improve that in the future with this tournament.”Amelie Mauresmo, the tournament director, is expected to address the issue at a press conference on Friday morning.Gauff headlined a fleet of 14 players from the United States to reach the second round of the women’s singles at this year’s French Open, the most since 14 also did so in 1987.The 22 total Americans to make the second round – 14 women and eight men – was the most by the US contingent in more than three decades, since 24 made it in 1994.Five of them have already punched their tickets to round three after Thursday wins, including third-seeded Jessica Pegula, seventh-seeded Madison Keys, 31st-seeded Sofia Kenin and Hailey Baptiste.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffFrench Open 2025French OpenTennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But Minnesota have come far, and can still push onClaire de LuneThu 29 May 2025 08.24 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 12.59 EDTShareThe definition of success is subjective, ephemeral. But in today’s sports zeitgeist, it’s becoming less so: “rings culture” dominates all, serving as the wall into which any nuanced conversation inevitably crashes: “But did theywin?”Of course, eachNBAteam enters the season every year with the same goal: to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy. But only one team can every year, so does that make the other 29 failures?The Minnesota Timberwolves present an interesting counterpoint: their fanbase is, no doubt, deeply disappointed this morning aftera harrowing blowout loss in Oklahoma City, which means the team came up short of the NBA finals in devastating, decisive fashionfor the second year in a row. On the other hand, they’ve made back to back Western Conference finals for the first time in team history, gone from league laughing stock to bona fide perennial contender, and have one of the most exciting young stars in basketball, 23-year-old Anthony Edwards.Would the NBA’s transatlantic expansion strip the soul of European basketball?Read moreEdwards has fallen victim to a classic conundrum for a young, fast rising star athlete: disappointing people by not quickly enough becoming a thing he never asked to be. In his case, that’s “face of the league,” an idea foisted upon him almost instantaneously by an NBA public wooed by the guard who plays a bit like one Michael Jeffrey Jordan. Edwards’s popularity grew rapidly, due to his Jordan-esque explosiveness, propensity for highlight dunks, and sparkling charisma. The devil-may-care Edwardshas spoken on the record, several times, about not being particularly interested in being the “face” of the NBA, a plight LeBron James (whose team Edwardsrecently sent packingfor the season) says heempathizes with. “I understand,” James, who has served as the face of the NBA for two decades, told the Los Angeles Times recently. “I completely understand. There’s this weird energy when it comes to that.”Charles Barkley recentlymade some somewhat controversial commentson the subject. “Don’t try and make Anthony Edwards the face of the NBA,” Barkley said. “You can’t give [the title of face of the NBA] to people. They have to take it.” It certainly seemed, in moments throughout the postseason, like Edwards was doing exactly that, wrestling the title from his elders inadvertently or otherwise. His dismantling of a Los Angeles Lakers team spearheaded by James and Luka Dončić, whosent Edwards and the Timberwolves home last season, was decisive and damned impressive, showcasing his newfound basketball maturity and growth as a playmaker. And while his team lucked out when the Warriors’ Stephen Curry was ruled out of the Western Conference semi-finals with a hamstring injury, you can only play the team in front of you, and Edwards & Co made quick work of Golden State, too.The Timberwolves had lost a cumulative two games through two series until they ran into the freight train that is theOklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder’s historically great defense brutally exposed Minnesota’s flaws, and they were the first team to make Edwards look every bit of what he really is: 23 years old. It’s easy to forget when young stars come into the league after a single-year in college that, even five seasons into their NBA tenure, they’re still so very young. But Edwardsisyoung, and while it was another whimper of an ending to his playoffs, the fact that he already has two conference finals runs and marked improvement as a player under his belt should serve as encouragement. He showed flashes of his newfound maturity, and flashes of the years of work left to reach his sky-high potential, in this playoff run. Edwards’s time will come. But it’s not here yet.The Thunder are a young team, and they will probably stand between Minnesota and a place in the NBA finals for some time to come. But it would be wrong to place the blame for the Timberwolves’ playoff exit at Edwards’s feet. The team has a lot of existential (and financial) questions to answer this summer. For starters, there’s Julius Randle, the player Minnesota took a gamble on when they traded Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks last October. Randle, who has a checkered playoff résumé to say the least, had a rocky start in Minnesota, but rounded into form after the All-Star break and had a scintillating star turn in the first two rounds of the postseason. The conference finals, where he scored fewer than seven points in two games and looked lost for much of three of them, were a different story. Randle is on an expiring contractwith a player option this summer, and the Wolves will have to take another gamble in guessing which version of Randle is to come, and if there’s a place for him moving forward.Naz Reid, a beloved fan-favorite and former sixth man of the year, may have cost himself a pretty penny with his disappointing showing throughout the playoffs, but he’s still expected to forgo his bargain $15m player option and enter free agency this summer, another tough call for the Timberwolves to make. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (who, as ESPN is quick to remind us, is MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s cousin) is also a free agent this summer, and has likely earned himself a bit of a pay bump over the course of his stint in Minnesota. Then there’s Rudy Gobert,whose albatross of a contractwould most likely be difficult to move, even with his multi-time Defensive Player of the Year bona fides. But he’s been a clunky fit with Edwards, is a general liability offensively, and was mostly played off the floor by Thunder. Tim Connelly, the president of basketball operations the ‘Wolves wooed away from Denver, has done a mostly bang-up job to this point in Minnesota. But if he wants to steward Edwards’s potential, he has difficult decisions this offseason.No one wants to see their favorite team outclassed in the manner the Timberwolves were in Oklahoma City on Wednesday evening. And the summer ahead is a murky one for the direction of the franchise and its roster. But to go from the butt of every NBA joke, whose claim to fame, for many fans, was either alienating Kevin Garnett or passing,twice, on Stephen Curry in the draft, to a perennial championship contender with a budding homegrown superstar, is a win. Or, one might say, a success.Explore more on these topicsMinnesota TimberwolvesOklahoma City ThunderNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her conduct caused harm both to the prosecution and to the defence.”Judge in trial of Maradona’s medical team steps down over TV show roleRead moreHe lamented: “The trial was being properly conducted by everyone, except for one person.”His colleague, Judge Verónica Di Tommaso, added: “There was one person who made a mistake and will have to keep giving explanations, but that person is not the justice system. Justice cannot be stained.”Two of Maradona’s daughters who were in court for the hearing, Dalma and Gianinna, began to cry,according to Argentine newspaper La Nación. Another daughter, Jana, was also present, along with the mother of Maradona’s youngest son and the seven defendants.Maradonadied in November 2020, at the age of 60, days after undergoing surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain.His medical team – four doctors, two nurses and a psychologist – is beingcharged with simple homicide with possible intent, for having allowed him to recover at home.According to prosecutors, the medical attention Maradona received during his home care was “reckless, deficient” and “unprecedented”.After Makintach’s involvement in the documentary series was revealed, prosecutors, defence attorneys and members of Maradona’s family called for the trial to be annulled. The case had already gone through 21 sessions since it began in March.Now, the Chamber of Appeals and Guarantees in Criminal Matters of San Isidro, in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, is expected to hold a new draw to appoint a fresh panel of judges who will conduct the trial from the beginning.The turning point in the case came a few days ago, when allegations emerged that Makintach was involved in covert filming of the legal proceedings.The trial was suspended for a week so that prosecutors could investigate the claims, and last Tuesday, they presented their findings in court – including aone-minute-50-second trailerthat showed the judge being filmed from several angles as she arrived at and walked around the courthouse.In the video, she is described as “the judge behind D10S”, a reference to Maradona’s “divine” nickname – a play on the Spanish word for God (Dios) and the iconic number 10 jersey worn by one of the greatest players of all time. The name of the series was “Divine Justice”.Diego Maradona medics go on trial accused of criminal negligenceRead moreBesides giving an interview for the miniseries, the judge allegedly allowed the film crew unauthorised access the courthouse on a Sunday, two days before the trial began, according to prosecutors.Footage was also reportedly taken during the trial sessions, which is not permitted.Faced with the revelations and criticism from all sides, the judge agreed to step down. The following day, the supreme court of the province of Buenos Airessuspended Makintach for 90 days, describing her conduct as “incompatible with decorum and prudence”.The outcome is being widely treated inArgentinaas an “international embarrassment” for the country’s judiciary.One of Maradona’s daughters, Jana,told reportersas she left the courthouse that she felt angry and “hates” the justice system after the trial was annulled. Her sister Dalma said: “The only thing we want is for the process to continue.”Explore more on these topicsDiego MaradonaArgentinanewsShareReuse this content"

Their strategy of targeting the best young talent in the world is starting to bear fruit and there is no desire to put undue pressure on Maresca or his maturing squad.Chelsea, who have given their squad 10 days off before focus switches to participating in the expanded Club World Cup next month, will try to be clinical in the transfer market this summer. Signing at least one new forward is the priority and the club have a provisional agreement with Delap, who has also been targeted by Everton, Manchester United and Newcastle.The 22-year-old favours a move to Chelsea after hearing their pitch. Delap wants to play in Europe and he already knows Maresca from his time in Manchester City’s academy. Ipswich have signalled a desire to take Marc Guiu on loan during their talks with Chelsea but the 19-year-old forward is yet to be convinced.It remains to be seen if the club restrict themselves to signing one forward. Bringing in two would raise questions over the future of Nicolas Jackson, who scored his side’s second goal against Betis. Chelsea are monitoring Hugo Ekitike but feel Eintracht Frankfurt’s £84m valuation is too steep.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson scores Chelsea’s second goal against Real Betis – but signing Liam Delap could cast doubts over his future.Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/ReutersThere is also admiration for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, who is on Arsenal’s radar, but he is much more expensive than Delap. Chelsea have held talks with their partner club, Strasbourg, over a pre-agreement for the Dutch striker Emanuel Emegha to join in 2026.Chelsea’s budget has been boosted by their qualification for the Champions League for the first time under Boehly and Clearlake, the private equity fund run by Behdad Eghbali and José E Feliciano. There is recognition that Maresca’s system thrives on width. Chelsea are seeking to add a right-footed left-winger to their squad. There are indications they will opt against taking up their £25m option to turn Jadon Sancho’s loan from Manchester United into a permanent deal.Chelsea will have to pay a £5m penalty clause if Sancho, who came off the bench to score against Betis, is sent back to Old Trafford. Maresca likes the former Borussia Dortmund winger but must consider whether the 25-year-old has been consistent enough. Chelsea have tracked Dortmund’s Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and are monitoring developments around Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams. It is felt that Williams, who is wanted by Arsenal and Real Madrid, could be too expensive. Madrid could move for the winger if they sell Rodrygo, who has interest from City.There is a possibility of Chelsea bolstering their defence. Ajax’s Jorrel Hato, who can operate as a left-back or in the middle, is on their shortlist. A consideration for Maresca is Wesley Fofana’s unreliable fitness record, while there is a possibility of Chelsea raising funds by selling Benoît Badiashile, Trevoh Chalobah and Axel Disasi. It is unclear if they will sign a new goalkeeper or keep faith with Robert Sánchez and Filip Jörgensen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Portuguese Dário Essugo, 20, will add cover in midfield. The Brazilian Willian Estêvão and Ecuador’s Kendry Páez, two of the best attacking talents in South America, are moving to England this summer. Estêvão and Páez will need time to adapt. A deal has been agreed for the Sporting Lisbon winger Geovany Quenda, 17, to join Chelsea in 2026. Andrey Santos, a 20-year-old Brazilian midfielder, is returning from a productive loan at Strasbourg.The influx of young talent explains why Chelsea are not getting carried away after finishing this season in fourth. They will be patient with Maresca, who has battled to convince supporters of his worth since replacing Mauricio Pochettino last summer. The aim for next season is to go far in the Champions League, challenge for the domestic cups and push on in the league. The sense is that Chelsea are two years away from being ready to win the title.Delap has been included in England’s Under-21 squad for the European Championship but could pull out of the tournament because of Chelsea’s involvement in the Club World Cup. It will be up to the club and player to decide on the best course of action.

Ratcliffe has ­previously said hesaw United’s men’s teamas “the main issue” and “what moves the needle” at the club.He was not at WembleywhenManchester United lost to Chelseain the Women’s FA Cup final two weeks ago, nor whenthey won last year’s finalagainst Tottenham.Williamson ‘devastated’ by Earps’ England exit but Wiegman quiet on talksRead more“If I was a woman working in United and heard the language Ratcliffe uses, he’s sending a signal to me about what he thinks about women not just the women’s game,” she said. “I’m not sure people recognise how powerful that language is in a negative way. It’s so disappointing.”Simmons was speaking at the Fair Game conference in London, where financial sustainability and issues around equality and inclusion within football were discussed. Simmons oversaw the professionalisation of the Women’s Super League a decade ago and argued the further growth of women’s football was being stymied by a lack of investment at club level.“We are not there as a sustainable sport,” Simmons said, likening the current situation to that during the half-century when the Football Association banned women from playing the game in England between 1921 and 1970. “This is a second ban where clubs are treating the women’s teams as a community endeavour, not treating it as a startup, not investing in it.“Absolutely nothing is locked in for women’s football. We’re not in the conversation for funding flows. If you are going to scrutinise clubs to see that finances are robust, then you need to look at the women’s game because you know where the money is going to be cut from first; it’s the women’s team.”View image in fullscreenKelly Simmons, during her time at the FA.Photograph: The Fa/ShutterstockSimmons said there was growing interest from private equity groups in investing in the women’s game and that she welcomed the prospect. “A number of clubs in this country and on the continent and Europe are in discussions with private equity,” she said. “It will bring in a mindset of treating women’s football like a business and that is much needed.”While Ratcliffe was not present for the FA Cup final, where United lost 3-0 to Chelsea, the club did send a senior delegation that included co-chair Avram Glazer, as well as representatives from Ineos, Ratcliffe’s conglomerate. The United chief executive, Omar Berrada, meanwhile, has made public remarks saying the club are “very proud” of the women’s team and arguing: “It’s really incumbent on us to be there to help them.”Ratcliffe has also spoken of his desire to see the women’s team succeed. “The women’s team wear the Manchester United brand and the Manchester United logo, so in that sense they’re every bit as important as the men’s team and frankly they’re doing better than the men’s team,” he said.Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenJim RatcliffeWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The £30.8msigning of Savinho and the return of Ilkay Gündogan were the only major incoming deals last summer, while forward Julián Alvarez was among those to depart.City’s underwhelming start to the season led to extensive January spending, with Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Nico González brought in for a combined cost of more than £172m. Speaking in his annual end-of-season interview, Khaldoon confirmed that spending on new players will continue this summer.“This year is another year where I think when I look back, last summer, we probably should have been more aggressive in some of the changes we needed to do,” Khaldoon told the club’s official website. “We didn’t do that and that ended up costing us this year.”“We already started that rebuild of this team in January. Normally we like to do our business in the summer and, only in case of emergency, a special need that comes up, do we actually go and do business in January,” he added. “That’s been our MO at least for the last seven or eight years - but this January we had to act.”View image in fullscreenKhaldoon al-Mubarak hugs manager Pep Guardiola after Manchester City’s FA Cup final defeat.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“That’s four players in January, and that gives you an idea of what’s coming this summer because we will continue,” Khaldoon, who will be working with a new director of football in Hugo Viana, continued.“We have clearly identified who exactly are the targets, in what positions, and we have our clear number one option, our clear number two option.

Not only has she discovered some of the best form of her career, but she has sneaked into the White House correspondents’ dinner as a guest and adopted a kitten called Biscuit.Morgan will now be hoping to enjoy the sweet taste of success with England and the Washington Spirit defender believes the American NWSL’s summer calendar can help her arrive at July’s European Championship in Switzerland in peak fitness because of the schedule, compared to going to a major tournament during what is – for Europe-based participants – the off-season.“The calendar running from March to November was something that I looked at as a real positive of coming to this league, in terms of setting you up for being able to sort of peak for international tournaments,” Morgan says. “I think that’s part of the reason the US have historically had so much success in the international windows because a lot of the European teams, the majority of their players, are obviously either at the end of a very long season or really at the start of pre-season so that can be quite difficult. So I feel like it’s a really positive thing that – if selected – myself and other players playing over here would be in the midst of playing high-level, competitive football and in that rhythm and hopefully feeling really sharp.”View image in fullscreenEsme Morgan trains with England at St George’s Park this week.Photograph: Jacob King/PAMorgan is preparing for England’s Women’s Nations League meeting with Portugal at Wembley on Friday but, speaking after Washington Spirit’s 3-2 win at Chicago Stars and before their 2-1 away victory against Seattle Reign, adds: “I feel in really good form, to be honest. Coming back in to pre-season, I felt fit and strong. I’d worked hard over Christmas back in the UK to kind of get into good shape, so I just felt really sharp and confident. And like a lot of the things that I worked on last season while I was still adjusting to the league and the types of opposition we play, over the off-season, I’ve kind of been able to consolidate and heavily focus each training session on specific things that I want to work on.”Morgan’s side – who were runners-up in the NWSL playoffs last November, five months after her switch from Manchester City – are enjoying a strong start in 2025, sitting fourth in the table after 10 games, eight of which Morgan has started. She says: “I feel comfortable and confident on the pitch now that I know all my teammates a lot better and the style of playing the league, I feel like you’ve got a lot less time on the ball here than you do at home and the strikers are slightly different in terms of the threats that they offer, so getting used to that and the challenges that they pose and working on the things that I wanted to I feel has helped me this season.”View image in fullscreenEsme Morgan on life in the NWSL: ‘I feel like you’ve got a lot less time on the ball here than you do at home.’Photograph: Hannah Foslien/NWSL/Getty ImagesThe 24-year-old from Sheffield hails her new coach, the former Barcelona coach Jonatan Giráldez, as “super detailed”, and also describes the NWSL as “super intense and competitive”. Morgan says: “Really, the gap between the teams at the top and those at the bottom is minuscule. Any one on any given day can take points off another team. Everyone here is so fast and athletic and it is more transitional than the WSL. When I played at City often when we’d play teams who’d just kind of low block and sit back and hope to just frustrate and then hit on the counter attack – whereas here it’s very rare that teams low block, which is probably why you see some of the crazy scorelines and endings to games that you do.”Morgan starred in one such game at the start of May, a dramatic 4-3 loss at home to Angel City in which she scored twice, her first competitive goals in four years. What spurred on such rare attacking prowess? Biscuit. The match was designated as Washington Spirit’s ‘Pitchside Pups’ game, where the club encourage the adoption of animals by raising awareness for a local shelter. Fans were also allowed to bring their dogs and cats to the match.“I just fell in love with this little kitten,” Morgan says with adoring eyes. “She’s so cute. She was at the game before the Angel City game, so I got to see her and cuddle her. And people keep saying that’s why I scored two goals, because I had the power of Biscuit with me!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She met several ambassadors and diplomats, including a counsel from the British Consulate General in New York, and recalls: “My brother and I kept just looking at each other like what on Earth are we doing here with all these amazing people? It was just so much fun to be able to pick people’s brains and understand more about such a different industry.”This week, it’s back to more familiar surroundings with England, but when she flies home after Tuesday’s meeting with Spain her kitten will be ready to move in with her.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

There has been no approach to Liverpool byAl-Nassrso far but Saudi interest in the 28-year-old is longstanding and, with Cristiano Ronaldo a possible departure before the Club World Cup, the club are likely to be in the market for another big name.The winger, who was also used effectively in a central role by Arne Slot this past season, is coming off a productive campaign for thePremier League championsof 13 goals and five assists.Darwin Núñez is another potential target for theSaudi Pro League, with Al-Hilal linked, and Liverpool would be more open to selling the Uruguay striker than Díaz in what is likely to be a big spending summer.Liverpool remain intalks with Bayer Leverkusenover a club record deal for Florian Wirtz, are close to confirming the £30m transfer of Wirtz’s teammate Jeremie Frimpong, and are interested in the Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez, who is valued at £45m.

We had a great time in Malaysia with good people.”The club told the BBC that the gesture was in response to “serious personal abuse” the Ivorian had suffered. It was another unwanted distraction for the Manchester United manager, Ruben Amorim, who is preparing his team to face Hong Kong’s representative side .Speaking to media in Hong Kong before the friendly, Amorim admitted he was ready to “turn the page” after a dismal season which saw United finish 15th in the table and lose theEuropa League final to Tottenham.“We’ve had the season that we had and it’s not easy to face the fans around the world, so it’s a moment that is hard for us and we want to finish the season,” Amorim said. “But at the same time we want to give something to the fans. We are travelling, we don’t have time to adapt, we don’t have so much time to have contact with the fans.“If there is one thing that is really important in this club, it’s that we need to face our fans in this moment and give something to our fans around the world. We want to give something to the fans, but it’s hard in this moment. We just want to turn the page and improve next season.”Amorim claimed his team of first-teamers and youngsters was “not really focused” in Wednesday’s defeat in Malaysia, and that he could understand fans venting their anger. “I understand the fans [booing],” he said.With heavy rain lashing the 40,000-capacity Hong Kong Stadium on the eve of the game, Amorim is again expected to heavily rotate his squad. “If we are professional and we focus on the game it is the best way to protect our players from injuries,” the 40-year-old said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He found himself playing a few too many drop shots, bailing out of points instead of slamming the door shut. His first serve had vacated the premises.These things often happen in Gaël Monfils’ lair, Court Philippe-Chatrier, where his magnetic personality draws his home crowd into a frenzy and his singular style plays tricks with an opponent’s mind. Despite being pushed to his limits and standing on the verge of an uncertain fifth set, Draper gave another demonstration of his mental durability by finding his way through to the third round of theFrench Openwith a 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 win.Brits rise and fall at French Open as Boulter bows out and Norrie battles onRead more“No offence taken,” Draper told the crowd afterwards. “This is why I play tennis, to play in front of big crowds, whether they are with me or against me. That’s the entertainment of tennis, so this is why I play.”In the short time that Roland Garros has held night sessions, Monfils, 38, has become their most reliable headliner and over the years he has found himself embroiled in many battles on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Two nights earlier, Monfils had orchestrated another magical evening after recovering from two sets down to defeat Hugo Dellien. It remained to be seen how he would recover after such a tough match.Although Draper, the fifth seed, worked through a dominant opening set, dictating comfortably with his serve and forehand, it soon became clear that Monfils was up to the challenge. Every time Draper committed an error, the crowd tried to force itself into the conversation. Eventually, it had its way. First Draper began to lose control of his forehand, unforced errors piling up as Monfils’ defence made him to overplay. Then came some magic from Monfils, who had the ball on a string as he continually turned points around from impossible positions with his athleticism, hand skills and timing. He quickly levelled the match at one set all.As Monfils’ focus waned and Draper re-established his forehand dominance, it seemed for a while that the Briton would ease away. After closing out the third set, he generated four break points in Monfils’ opening service game of the fourth. Somehow, Monfils survived with a hold and then he put together a remarkable series of games, veering between drawing errors from Draper, chasing down every last ball and stepping inside the baseline to obliterate forehands. As Draper tried to figure Monfils out, he lost control.View image in fullscreenGaël Monfils left to a standing ovation from the crowd in what could turn out to be his last match at Roland Garros.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPA“My brain was fried out here,” said Draper. “I’m not sure if I’m gonna go to sleep tonight, my brain is just all over the place with what he’s doing out there. That’s why he’s had such a successful career. That’s why he is loved by all the fans. The players love to watch him play as well, but not to play against him.”Monfils established a 5-2 lead in the fourth set, and then he later generated double set point on Draper’s serve at 5-4. But every time he truly needed to, on the most important points of the match, Draper played focused attacking tennis and the 23-year-old was much fresher physically than his veteran opponent. Draper reeled off five consecutive games, closing out a victory that will only strengthen his rapidly growing self-belief.At the end of an unforgettable night at Roland Garros, the two players finished their tussle with a long hug and before Monfils departed, he enthusiastically encouraged his victorious opponent. After being subjected to the notorious French crowd’s scorn for more than three hours, Draper finally received their congratulations.“I think I have to acknowledge Gaël,” said Draper. “It is the first time on the court but what a battle, what an experience against someone I admire as a tennis player, but off the court the guy’s incredibly nice. Such a joker, he’s a magician. He does everything. Huge respect to him and I hope he is able to play here one more time again.”Another great challenge awaits Draper in round three as he will next face the 18-year-old Brazilian wonderkid João Fonseca, whom he beat on his way to the title in Indian Wells earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenJack DraperTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

But there have always been breakthrough moments that have opened the door for a bigger future and asLuke Humphrieslifted the Premier League Darts trophy aloft inside a sold-out O2, it was not unreasonable to assume where this game heads next.In the 1980s, it was Eric Bristow’s pomp and circumstance while dominating in the slightly more low-key venues of Stoke’s Jollees Cabaret Club and the Lakeside. Then it was Phil Taylor who dominated the PDC’s formative years and, yes, while he had the odd rival along the way, it is a fair argument that the 16-time world champion single-handedly broke down barriers for the sport.But any good sport thrives on elite rivalries. Federer versus Nadal. Frazier versus Ali. Darts’ newest boom has undoubtedly been supercharged by the arrival ofLuke Littlerbut it takes two players to make a great rivalry and goodness, Littler and Humphries underlined how they are the dominant pair in this sport by some distance.In the end, it was Humphries, who became only the fourth man in history after Taylor, Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson to win darts’ triple crown of the world title, the World Matchplay and the Premier League, who would claim the £275,000 cheque and the title.But what makes this rivalry special is that it is so unpredictable. This was their 23rd meeting – it is 13-10 in Littler’s favour – and in barely 18 months they have contested two world finals and won one each, and now met in the last two Premier League finals, withLittler winning last yearand Humphries here.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler takes aim as Luke Humphries walks away from the oche during the latest close match in their rivalry.Photograph: John Walton/PANeither were quite at their brilliant best in the semi-finals, Littler defeating Gerwyn Price before Humphries knocked out Nathan Aspinall, but it almost felt like an inevitability that the two Lukes would meet in the final here. Littler, who plays with such an assurance that you could almost imagine him playing Taylor in the smoke-filled Circus Tavern in the 90s, started magnificently.He went into a 3-0 lead but just as they do every time they meet, Humphries responded to level the scores before the pair went tit-for-tat for 15 engrossing minutes. Whoever blinked first would be struck a fatal blow given the quality this duo possess and here, it was Littler who did that. Humphries made no mistake to win 11-8.“That one means the world to me – it’s the one I was missing,” said Humphries, who has had Taylor in his corner in recent weeks offering him advice. “If I don’t win another title that’s fine because I’ve won the three hardest ones to win. He wasn’t at his best tonight and nor was I, but I managed to get one over on him. I’ll get these wins in early before he trounces everyone.”Humphries, despite all of the hype that engulfs Littler, brings the best out of his rival and that can only be good for the game. They will do this on many more occasions – and who knows how much the venues and the interest can grow with this pair driving it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That wait may have to go on for a while yet, but this rivalry will keep delivering for years to come.Darts’ powerbrokers have struck gold not only with Littler, but with this epic pairing. These two will keep meeting in finals and keep sharing titles.

A day after Emma Raducanu learned this during herheavy defeat by the defending champion Iga Swiatek, Katie Boulter endured a similarly miserable experience as she was comprehensively beaten 6-1, 6-3 by theAustralian Open champion Madison Keysin the second round of the French Open.Raducanu accepts French Open defeat by Swiatek shows gap to leading playersRead moreLanding in the path of a recent grand slam champion is rarely good news but there were reasons for Boulter, the British No 1, to be hopeful before her match with Keys. Rather than potentially facing a tricky, cunning clay specialist who could make her extremely uncomfortable, the tactics were at least simple for both: attack first.Although both players attempt to play an uncompromising first-strike game, dictating opponents with their serve and forehands, Keys is simply a better player. Boulter’s relative deficiencies were particularly clear on serve. The American has long established herself as one of the best servers in the world, her precise, destructive first delivery complemented by her tricky, consistent top-spin second effort. The British player is far more temperamental. On a good day, when she finds rhythm and is striking her ground strokes cleanly, Boulter can certainly perform at a high level and she possesses enough weapons to trouble the best players in the world.It was a poor day with ball in hand for Boulter, however, and it did not take long for her second serve to crumble under the pressure inflicted by Keys, who hunted it down without hesitation. The British No 1, ranked 38th in the world, struck nine double faults, including three times on break point to give away the first three breaks of the match. Her serving did not give her a realistic chance.View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie beat Federico Agustin Gomez 7-6 (7), 6-2, 6-1Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/APAlthough the surface will always be a significant challenge for Boulter, her second clay court season has still represented a positive step forward. She won her first clay court title at any level in the WTA 125 event in Paris just before the French Open and heropening round win against Carole Monnetwas her first main draw victory at the French Open. She will now head to the grass, her favourite surface, with higher expectations and greater opportunities.French Open: Djokovic in action, Boulter out, Sinner and Norrie through – liveRead moreSonay Kartal, the British No 3, fell 6-1, 6-4 to Marie Bouzkova in the second round after an extremely physical, arduous battle. Having won her firstFrench Openmatch on her debut, the 23-year-old from London continues to make positive, steady progress and she could break into the world’s top 50 for the first time in her career after the tournament, depending on other results.In the men’s draw, Cameron Norrie continued to gain momentum as he followed up hisspectacular first-round win over Daniil Medvedev, the 11th seed, with an efficient 7-6 (7), 6-2, 6-1 victory over Federico Agustin Gomez of Argentina. After a tough opening set against Gomez, a lucky loser with a searing forehand who was competing in a grand slam tournament for the first time in his career, Norrie relaxed and cruised to victory:“I played a very steady kind of 6, 7 out of 10 for the whole time,” the world No 81 said. “It showed in the score. I was very happy with the way I handled it. I felt I didn’t play amazing, didn’t play that badly. Didn’t give him much. So it was a good day.”Norrie will next face a fellow British player in the third round after Jacob Fearnley advanced at the expense of 22nd seed Ugo Humbert, after the Frenchman retired with an injury.Fearnley won the first set 6-4 with the second level at 4-4 when the match was cut short.Arthur Fils, the 20-year-old French No 1, finally made his mark at his home grand slam tournament as he fought through injury to complete an incredible comeback victory against Jaume Munar of Spain, winning 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 2-6, 0-6, 6-4 after four hours and 25 minutes. The French youngster led by two sets but began to struggle with both a back injury and cramps, quickly losing the third and fourth.From a break down in the final set, at the urging of a deafening Court Suzanne-Lenglen crowd, he pulled off a spectacular recovery to reach the third round at Roland Garros for the first time. “This is my best match of all time,” said Fils. “I have had big matches before, but I have never had a match like this in five sets before.”Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenKatie BoulterTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Like everyone does in relationships but we work through them. We’re both in it together. We both want to win a championship together. We’re both working towards lifting the team up.”Afterthe race in Monacothe Ferrari team principal, Fred Vasseur, similarly dismissed it as the pair learning to work with one another, combined with some radio issues specific to Monte Carlo.Hamilton finished fifth, well behind his teammate Charles Leclerc who was second. During the race there was some terse communication between the British driver and Adami, with Hamilton believing he was not receiving enough information from his race engineer about the gaps on track.It followed Hamilton’s ratherdismissive query to the team, suggesting they were having a tea break rather than making strategic decisions at the Miami round.Expectations were enormously high when Hamilton joinedFerraribut their car is not up to scratch and every aspect of his relationship with the team has come under scrutiny. He has been clear he expects himself and theScuderiato do better but was unequivocal his relationship with Adami was not an issue and the focus on it was an irrelevance.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton struggled with the pace at Monaco.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/Reuters“It’s just all noise and we don’t really pay any attention to it,” Hamilton said. “It can continue if you want but it doesn’t make any difference to the job that we’re trying to do.“Our relationship is great. And there are no problems. We are constantly learning more and more about each other and adapting the way we want to work. He has worked with lots of different drivers before.

Losing Jai Hindley early then the whole team, staff included, was fully committed to help Primoz Roglic win the Giro. We spent two months in altitude for that,” Denz said.“I was three months away from home to prepare for the Giro. A dream was lost when we lost Primoz. We’ve thought all this hard work was for nothing. Luckily things turned around.”Denz, now a three-time stage winner at the Giro, moved with a group of 35 in the opening stages and held his spot as the breakaway thinned to 11. With just over 10km still to go, the 31-year-old made his move and found nobody able to match him.Mirco Maestri, representing Polti-VisitMalta, won the battle for second around a minute further back and Edward Planckaert came in third for Alpecin-Deceuninck.The GC riders in the peloton crossed almost 10 minutes after Denz stopped the clock, leaving Isaac Del Toro in possession of the pink jersey on behalf of UAE Team Emirates. The Mexican retained a 41-second lead over Richard Carapaz of EF Education-EasyPost and Simon Yates of Visma-Lease a Bike is 51 seconds behind with three stages to go.Del Toro’s teammate Juan Ayuso was forced to abandon his own bid after a nasty bee sting around his eye added to existing knee problems, leaving him unable to race on.The race now moves on to the climbs of the 166km Biella-Champoluc stage.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s debatable what else he isRead more“An email was sent from an individual with the corporate sales department that mistakenly alluded to next year being Alex Ovechkin’s final year,” the team posted on X.Ovechkin, who turns 40 in September, said after the Capitals were eliminated from the playoffs earlier this month that he would be back for his 21st NHL season.

The 895th goal of his career passed the great Wayne Gretzkyfor most in NHL history.“I’m looking forward for next year,” Ovechkin said after the Capitals were eliminated. “I’m going to try to do my best to play, and my team is going to help me too … I just want to come back next year and see the team who’s capable of winning the Stanley Cup.”A 13-time All-Star and three-time Hart Trophy winner as the NHL’s most valuable player, Ovechkin enters the 2025-26 season ranked 11th all-time in points (1,623).

They said that they were collaborative. They were actually very secretive.”Hao spent the next five years following the growth of OpenAI, as it shifted to pursue – in her words – a growth-at-all-costs model. On the one hand, it has been spectacularly successful, with OpenAI now one of the largest companies in the world. On the other, she argues, it has come at a severe cost – to the people whose labour it relies on to operate, and to the planet.In fact, as she describes in her new book, Empire of AI: Inside the reckless race for total domination, it makes sense to think of OpenAI not as a company, but more akin to empires of old.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Today in FocusSam Altman"

Many expressed “anti-Tesla and anti-Elon Musk sentiment”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailFor decency, the local council redacted the language in some submissions to describe Musk and Tesla.“We should not support and put money in the pockets of a [redacted] who openly [redacted] salutes, is [redacted] human,” said one.The world’s richest man has announced he will leave his role in the department of government efficiency, which has slashed jobs and funding for US government agencies with often chaotic and devastating effects. Heis pivotingback to his businesses, including Tesla, amid slumping sales.Meanwhile in Adelaide, the Marion city council overrode community objections andapproved the factory projectto proceed to the next stage, which will need state government approval. The council said the project would bring in 100 jobs and millions of dollars to the community.But the protest movement “Trees not Teslas” is determined to fight on.While conservation groups and others were protesting against the Tesla project because of the need to remove trees on the land where the plant would be built, Trees not Teslas also fired people up over Musk himself.Tesla wins council approval for new factory in South Australia despite vocal anti-Musk sentimentRead more“Neon” from Trees not Teslas did not want to use his real name, in part for fear of reprisals and in part because the group considers itself a collective.He said the traction the group got was “wild”, with their website getting thousands of views, but he acknowledged it was impossible to work out how much influence they ultimately had.Neon said the fight will continue, as the state government considers whether to approve the council’s proposal to revoke the site’s status as community land.“We just move that further up. We have to. We move that into actions for the state government,” Neon said.“We spread more awareness. We try to get more people involved. It now becomes not just a council issue but a fundamental state issue.”He said they started the campaign primarily to protect the trees on the site.“Our main focus was the trees … we’re looking to preserve green spaces,” he said.“We’re very pro-electric vehicle and pro-green energy.“But the industry that destroys green spaces is … green in name only.”The council argued that the space had not been publicly accessible since 2016 because of contamination. Neon said trees can help remediate the land.He also echoed comments made by the councillor Sarah Luscombe, who voted against the proposal, that the factory would only recycle or repurpose Tesla batteries, when most people use other brands.While the discussion has centred around electric vehicle batteries, it is possible the site could also recycle and repurpose Powerwall batteries.Guardian Australia has contacted Tesla for comment.Neon said the council voting eight to three to seek state government approval despite the community objections made the public consultation process seem like a box-ticking exercise.The mayor, Kris Hanna, said the project would bring jobs and an income stream into the community, and that Tesla would just set up elsewhere, if not in Marion. Tesla, Hanna said, had pledged to retain most significant trees and replace more trees than it was required to.Neon said the established trees would be replaced with saplings, removing many of their benefits.The state premier, Peter Malinauskas, said earlier this week that major industrial developments were welcome in the state and that while he “violently” disagreed with Musk’s politics, they were “his prerogative”.A state government spokesperson said the government welcomed investment and job creation in SA and would consider the proposal.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaSouth AustraliaAdelaidenewsShareReuse this content"

The company also said it expected deals in the Middle East to start to fill a gap left by the loss of Chinese business.In April the US president, Donald Trump, said he was restricting AI chip exports toChina, in effect barring Nvidia from selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese companies and blocking a major source of its revenue.View image in fullscreenJensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, warns that Chinese competitiors ‘have evolved’.Photograph: Jeppe Gustafsson/RexNvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, warned thatChinese rivals were benefiting from the void left by US firmsforced to abandon the market due to US trade restrictions. “The Chinese competitors have evolved,”Huang told Bloomberg Television. He added that Huawei, which had been blacklisted by the US government, had become “quite formidable”. “Like everybody else, they are doubling, quadrupling capabilities every year,” Huang said. “And the volume is increasing substantially.”While the US government policy is meant to keep AI technologies out of the hands of Chinese actors, Huang said local companies are simply finding other options. “You cannot underestimate the importance of the China market,” Huang said. “This is the home of the world’s largest population of AI researchers.”Nvidia said it expects to miss out on $8bn in revenue in the second quarter as a result of Trump’s trade restrictions.Tech investors were also optimistic after a US trade court ruledagainst Trump’s sweeping tariffs regime, in a move that could ultimately block the president’s sweeping trade levies. But there is further uncertainty ahead, with the White House having already filed an appeal against the decision, issued by judges from the New York-based court of international trade.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has upended global trade and international relations, wiping billions off the stock market in the process, by imposingtariffsthat he claims are a necessary response to an emergency. Yet that emergency does not really exist, except in the manner that Mr Trump himself has created it.The president claimed,on 2 April, that a lack of reciprocity in US overseas trade arrangements was “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States”. He claimed that this justified him in declaring an emergency and governing by executive decree under the 1977International Emergency Economic Powers Act(IEEPA). Congress, which normally has the responsibility to decide US trade policy, was thus wholly ignored. Statutory consultative arrangements, traditionally an essential preliminary, went out of the window too. Mr Trump was effectively exercising an executive power grab.Now, afterthis week’s rulingby a US federal trade court, most of Mr Trump’s tariffs have been blocked. In a case brought by a coalition of businesses and US states, the court of international tradefoundthat most of the tariffs “exceed any authority granted” to the president under the 1977 law. The White House will appeal. Meanwhile, trade talks aimed at creating so-called deals between the US and nation-state victims of the Trump policies are likely to be paused, while existing deals, including thatwith the UK, may be affected too.There will be a worldwide sense of relief for as long as it lasts. But the higher courts now face an important political responsibility as well as a judicial one. The ruling has left nations and businesses hanging. Some tariffs will remain, such as those on steel, aluminium and cars. Many others are suspended.Marketshate uncertainty.The issues at stake are very large. They are immediate, because the ruling suspends many but not all tariffs, and also strategic, because it challenges Mr Trump’s wide-ranging attempts to rule by executive order. Both are extremely important. Global trade and economic recovery, in Britain among many other countries, rest on the outcome. But so does Mr Trump’s strategy, which dates back to his first term, of using IEEPA powers to rule by decree, not merely on trade issues but, for example, in sanctioning officials from theinternational criminal court.The good news is that the president’s plans to impose tariffs on almost every country on the planet will now be subjected to something approaching the legal and constitutional scrutiny that they should have had in the first place. The rule of law, thankfully, has struck back, at least for now.The bad news is that Congress still shows no sign of reining Mr Trump in, as it should. Ironically, the IEEPA was originally a Jimmy Carter-era legislative attempt to boost congressional oversight of presidential emergency powers. Under Mr Trump, that role has been trashed. The worst of all outcomes would be for Congress to now give Mr Trump the powers to which he has laid claim. That is a real danger. The best outcome would be for Congress to give the IEEPA a fresh set of teeth. These would ensure that emergency powers are properly defined and applied, and never again abused by this or any other overmighty president.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But don’t expect it to stickZoe WilliamsElon Musk is tapping out, and a court has stepped in on tariffs. But the wheels coming off doesn’t mean the bus is stoppingThu 29 May 2025 10.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 14.41 EDTShareNothing is going according to plan for the Trump administration. Thebig, beautiful bill, originally vaunted to save the US taxpayerat least $2tn, so far, according to projections, delivers savingsin the region of $9.4bn. Elon Musk has exited government, saying he wasn’t in favour of the bill, which could be big, or beautiful, but in this case, not both. Musk’s government contract ran for only 120 days, so it would have been up at the end of this week anyway.Just to try to lasso those words back to an observable reality where they might mean something, the bill isn’t all that big; there are some very vindictive moves around Medicaid entitlement, intended to fund tax cuts elsewhere, that will have seismically bad outcomes for vulnerableindividuals without necessarily burning a hole in anyone else’s pocket. Tips and overtime are exempted from tax, but probably the only thing that’s legitimately big, or if you like, huge, is the increase of the debt ceiling by $4tn. So it gives with one hand, takes away with the other, promise-wise – those tax exemptions were mentioned often on the campaign trail, but a government that causes havoc trying to shrink the state while simultaneously increasing the amount it can borrow isn’t going to please anyone in either party but sycophants.As for “beautiful” – thesupplemental nutrition assistance program(Snap) will see reforms that throw more costs on to each state. Forty-two million low-income Americans are on Snap, and there would be more requirements upon those who are childless. Centring cuts on those who are already hungry has a cruelty that glisters in an age of necropolitics, but it lacks the scale, the granite finality, that “beauty” would connote to these people.“We have to get a lot of votes, we can’t be cutting – we need to get a lot of support,” Trump said, in response to Musk’s criticism, which seems to have enlivened in the president some fresh appreciation of how democracy works, though whether it will last until lunchtime is anyone’s guess. The worry about Musk’s departure is not that Doge will be lost without him, but that his criticism will embolden the hawks in Congress, who didn’t want to vote for the bill in the first place. Then it really will be a puddle of words without meaning.Meanwhile, aUS federal court struck downalmost all Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, in the classic judicial way, by deeming them an overreach of his powers. The ruling is purely on legislative grounds (Trump didn’t wait for the approval of Congress) rather than on any economic grounds (that they would make everything much more expensive for the US public, obliterating the impact of any big or beautiful tax cuts with a single big-ticket purchase, particularly if any part thereof was made in China, which means almost everything). The justice department has filed an appeal.The observer could file all this under “government: harder than it looks”. Moving fast and breaking things doesn’t work. Borrowing and spending while slashing and burning in a formless, ad hoc fashion doesn’t work. Billionaires with fragile egos, trying to cooperate while reserving the right to say whatever they like about each other, well, this has never worked.It would be the gravest imaginable mistake, though, to think that just because the wheels are coming off it this bus is losing its destructive power. One of the global indignities of the US spectacle is having to lose hours analysing the hidden meanings and augurs of the acts of men who don’t, themselves, give one second’s thought to anything. Did Trump mean to humiliate Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and if he didn’t, what came over him, and if he did, what could we predict of the future of Europe?Did Musk mean to Sieg Heil, and if he didn’t, has he lost his mind, and if he did, has he lost his mind? Did they mean to fall out, will they get back together, is this a pantomime, will one chase the other further from reality or back towards it?These questions fundamentally debase us, at the same time as giving the false sense of security that, once these guys step away from public life, singly or together, sense will be restored. The dangerous thing about them is the thing that makes them infinitely replaceable: there will always be another richest guy in the world; there will always be another high net-worth individual who has become separated from social values, not by the wealth itself but by the single-minded solipsism of its accretion. Trump and Musk could get to a place of such enmity that they eschewed the offices of state to spend the days mud-wrestling, and there would be no comfort to take from it, just a new double-act, with new peccadilloes that would be strikingly like the last.The federal court’s decision is another matter, and can be mutedly celebrated until it fails to act on some other gross constitutional transgression.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskTrump tariffsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Last week, in a troubling sign of escalating repression, Salvadorian policedetained Ruth López Alfaro, a prominent Salvadorian human rights lawyer atCristosal, an organization fighting for human rights in Central America.Last year, theBBC recognizedLópez Alfaro as one of the 100 most inspiring and influential women in the world, describing her as “an outspoken critic of the country’s government and institutions” who “conducted a broad social media campaign to promote political transparency and public accountability overseen by the citizens themselves”. This year, on 18 May, Salvadorian security forces detained her at her residence on embezzlement charges and held her incommunicado from her family and legal representativesfor more than 40 hours. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rightshas expressed “deep concern”over reports of her enforced disappearance, and numerous human rights organizations havecalled for her releaseand protection of her safety and due process rights.López Alfaro’s detention comes at the crest of a repressive wave sweeping the country over the past month. In the week immediately preceding her arrest, 14bus company owners were detainedfor allegedly disobeying Bukele’s order on X that bus service be free for a week in response to the chaos caused by the collapse of one of the president’s signature public works projects. The crackdown continued when the military policebroke up a peaceful demonstrationnear the president’s private residence by members of an agricultural cooperative called “el Bosque” pleading for his help to protect their homes and land against an eviction notice.Several people were arrested, including an evangelical pastor, Jose Perez, and the next day, the group’s lawyer, Alejandro Henriquez. (Earlier this year, Henriquez hadfiled a case with López Alfaro before the Salvadorian supreme courtchallenging the Bukele regime’s repeal of a seven-year ban on gold mining in El Salvador, despite the repeal’s risk of causing severe environmental damage.)Two days after López Alfaro’s detention, El Salvador’s legislature, controlled by Bukele’s New Ideas party,passed a Russian-style “foreign agent” lawrequiring anyone who receives foreign funding to register with the government and pay a 30% tax on such funding or else face sanctions. Bukele had previously announced the legislation as a reprisal for civil society organizations’ support of el Bosque’s pleas to keep their land. The law, which aims to crush independent journalism and civil society organizations that have constituted the last remaining vestiges of democracy in El Salvador, wasenacted in an hour and 24 minuteswithout debate by Bukele’s legislature.This campaign of repression has been bolstered by Trump’s agreement to pay Bukele millions of dollars to confine up to 300 US deportees – mostly Venezuelans – in El Salvador’s maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot). (López Alfaro was leading the legal team supporting families of the Venezuelan detainees to document their cases and present habeas corpus claims to the Salvadorian courts.)The United States does not lack detention facilities to hold immigration detainees. But Bukele’s detention facilities offer a zone unconstrained by US court orders, the rule of law or even the most basic of human rights protections. These are powers Bukele has accumulated at alarming speed, by dismantling institutional checks, purging courts, eviscerating due process protections and weaponizing pretrial detention.In May 2021, Bukele’s party used its legislative super-majority tofire all five justices of the constitutional chamber of the supreme courtas well as the attorney general, thereby dismantling constraints on his power. Then, using the same fast-track procedure, alegislative decree forcedevery judge older than 60 or with more than 30 years’ service – about a third of the bench – into retirement. Later that year, the reconstituted constitutional chamber foundBukele eligible for re-electiondespite seven articles in the Salvadorian constitution that clearly prohibit presidential re-election.The following year, El Salvador’s Congress imposed a state of exception to counter gang violence. The state of exception suspended constitutional due process rights and granted extraordinary powers to security forces to detain citizens at their discretion. Although it was initially introduced for 30 days, it has continuously been renewed and remains in place.While the murder rate did fall significantly, the human rights violations caused by the state of exception have been staggering. Since March of 2022, more than 85,500 people have beenarbitrarily detained in mass round-ups, leading to thehighest incarceration rate in the world. Torture and abuse of prisoners is rampant, and have led, according to Cristosal’s investigations, to the deaths of 387 people – including four infants – in custody.Many prisoners have been held for years without trial and without their families even knowing whether they are alive. A 2023 procedural overhaul allows unnamed “faceless judges” to conductmass trials of up to 900 defendantsat a time – a clear violation of their right to a defense and the presumption of innocence. Many of these lawless procedures are now being used to persecute López Alfaro and others who have stood up to the Bukele regime.The agreement between the US and El Salvador is not only itself unlawful; it enables and rewards lawlessness. It violates the US’s obligation to ensure due process and to comply with its “non-refoulement” obligation that prohibits sending any person to a place where there is a substantial risk of torture and/or cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment.The agreement also appears to aid Bukele’s cover-up of a secret deal he allegedly struck with the MS-13 gang to boost his popularity at home. A 2022US justice department indictment of MS-13 gang membersdescribes in detail how Bukele agreed to protect the gang in exchange for it engaging in fewer public murders and supporting his party during the 2021 legislative elections. US deportations of MS-13 gang leaders facing criminal prosecution in the US was reportedlya priority for Bukele, apparently to prevent them from disclosing details of thatsecret dealin US courts. Bukele has denied the deal, but seems intent on suppressing the facts. Several journalists from the leading independent news outlet el Faro were forced to flee the country after learning that his regime was preparing to arrest them for publishing interviews with MS-13 gang members describing the deal.Trump and Bukele peddle a brand of punitive populism that offers security at the expense of democracy and human rights – a seductive promise for electorates anxious about public safety. But this false bargain serves as a pretext to expand their own power, exploit public office and diplomacy for personal gain, and institutionalize cruelty in public policy.The people of the United States and El Salvador deserve better. The lawless collaboration that led to the disappearance of hundreds of men – transferred from the US without due process into indefinite detention at Bukele’s Cecot – has forged a common cause. It unites Americans who fear the loss of their democracy with Salvadorians like Ruth López Alfaro and countless others who have already lost their freedom to autocracy. The futures of democracy in both nations are now inextricably linked through the mutually reinforcing tyranny of their leaders.Noah Bullock is the executive director of Cristosal, a human rights organization based in El Salvador.

At face value, this order promises a commitment to federally funded research that is “transparent, rigorous, and impactful” and policy that is informed by “the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available”. But hidden beneath the scientific rhetoric is a plan that would destroy scientific independence in the US by giving political appointees the latitude to dismiss entire bodies of research and punish researchers who fail to fall in line with the current administration’s objectives. In other words: this is Fool’s-Gold Standard Science.According to the order, “Gold Standard Science means science conducted in a manner that is:(i) reproducible;(ii) transparent;(iii) communicative of error and uncertainty;(iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary;(v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions;(vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses;(vii) subject to unbiased peer review;(viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and(ix) without conflicts of interest.”The order mimics the language of an active reform movement in science to increase rigor and transparency of research – a movement commonly called the open science movement, to which some of us are contributors. Science is, by nature, a continuous work in progress, constantly self-scrutinized and always looking for opportunities to improve. We should all be able to celebrate any administration’s investment in improving the openness, integrity and reproducibility of research.But, with this executive order, we cannot.Instead of being about open science, it grants administration-aligned political appointees the power to designate any research as scientific misconduct based on their own “judgment” and includes the power to punish the scientists involved accordingly; this wouldweaponize governmentcounter to the public interest.The consequences of state-dictated science can be catastrophic. When Trofim Lysenko, a researcher who denied the reality of genetic inheritance and natural selection, won favor with Joseph Stalin and took control of agriculture in the Soviet Union, thousands of scientists who disagreed with him were fired, imprisoned or killed. His disastrous agricultural prescriptions ultimately led to famines that killed millions in the USSR and in China.Science does not proceed by sequentially establishing unassailable conclusions, but rather by steadily accumulating numerous lines of evidence, scrutinizing weaknesses, and pursuing additional evidence. Almost any study, any source of evidence, any conclusion, falls short of meeting every aspect of the White House’s list of best practices. This has nothing to do with laziness, let alone misconduct by individual scientists; it’s simply a consequence of the fact that science is difficult. Scientists constantly grapple with uncertainty, and nevertheless can ultimately arrive at robust, valid conclusions, such as the fact that vaccines do not cause autism, and that the burning of fossil fuels is warming the planet andwreaking havoc on our climate.Under the terms of the executive order, political appointees loyal to the president can willfully find justification to labelanyresearch finding as scientific misconduct, and then penalize the researchers involved accordingly.This administration hasalreadyappropriated the language of open science to assert control over anddeal heavy blowsto the scientific ecosystem of the United States – includingcancelling thousands of active research grantsinclimate science,misinformation and disinformation,vaccines,mental health,women’s health,LGBTQ+ healthandstem education. Calls to “revisit” decades of work that establish vaccine safety beyond a shadow of a doubt “because the only way you can get good science is through replication”, and demands forunethical vaccine clinical trial practicesand additional data, further echo the bad-faith adoption of open science language.Trump has also advanced a congressional budget calling formassive cuts to federal spending on research and developmentand leviedsignificant retaliationagainst universities that have not fallen in line with his demands. He has gone so far as topropose a rule change by the office of personnel managementthat would install policy police at all levels of federal agencies, converting thousands of employees into presidential appointees who can be summarily fired without due process for any arbitrary political reason. This new executive order raises the concern that many of ourbest scientistswould be targeted in Lysenkoist purges. Meanwhile, the threat of such actions is already having a chilling effect on all scientists.Science is the most important long-term investment for humanity. Interference in the scientific process by political arbiters stifles scientists’ freedom of speech and thought. Science depends on unfettered speech – free and continuous discussion of data and ideas. We, like the rest of the scientific community, aspire to achieve greater openness, integrity and reproducibility of research to accelerate discovery, advance treatments and foster solutions to meet society’s greatest challenges. Meeting that objective will not occur by centralizing power over science and scientists according to the whims of any political administration. We see this executive order for what it is: an attempt to sell the US’s future for pyrite.Colette Delawallais a PhD candidate at Emory University and executive director of Stand Up for Science.Victor Ambrosis a 2024 Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine at the Chan Medical School, University of Massachusetts.Carl Bergstromis professor of biology at the University of Washington.Carol Greideris a 2009 Nobel laureate in medicine and distinguished professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.Michael Mannis the presidential distinguished professor of earth and environmental science and director of the Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media at the University of Pennsylvania.Brian Nosekis executive director of the Center for Open Science and professor of psychology at the University of VirginiaExplore more on these topicsScienceOpinionClimate crisisTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But what if the public moves further to the right?Thu 29 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 08.39 EDTShareIt requires an effort to keep reminding yourself of the sheer historical oddity of monarchy’s healthy survival into the modern democratic age. Yet so rooted is the monarchy in the mental furniture of Britain that most people in our politics barely think about it. This week, however, the modern British monarchy has stood up and demanded to be counted, doing something new and perhaps genuinely consequential.Judged by any yardstick,Charles III’s visit to Canadawas an audaciously disjunctive event. The idea that a vibrant democracy such as Canada, with a highly sophisticated sense of its own complex identity, might summon an elderly hereditary monarch from across the ocean to provide a focal point for itsresistance to Donald Trump’s existential threattakes some believing. Yet that was exactly what played out this week, when the king travelled to Ottawa to open the new Canadian parliament.No monarch had bothered to make this trip for nearly 50 years. During that time, however, Canada has transformed itself into a major global power and has decisively slipped its old colonial bonds. Yet Trump’s threat to Canada is such that the country’s prime minister,Mark Carney, judged a summons to Buckingham Palace would send a useful newsworthy signal about its national sovereignty that would help bind the nation while sending a shot across the US president’s bows.At least as significantly, when seen from Britain, King Charles was happy to oblige. Just as with the speech he delivers at Westminster at the start of a parliamentary session, Tuesday’s in Ottawa will have been scripted by the elected government. Butthe Ottawa speechhad a far looser and more personal format than the Westminster version. This allowed the king to speak words that clearly mattered to him, and by which he will be judged.Trump was not mentioned by name. Even so, he permeated the speech. The king endorsed Canadian national pride and said democracy, law, pluralism and global trade were on the line. He said Canada’s relationships with Europe would be strengthened and, speaking in French, he saidCanadafaces challenges unprecedented in the postwar era. He was proud that Canada was “an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good”, and he ended, quoting from the Canadian national anthem, by saying “the true north is indeed strong and free”.All this is an unmistakable rebuke to Trump’s rudeness, aggression and greed. The words are not neutral but committed. Whether the kingsought approvalfrom Keir Starmer for his visit and speech is not clear. His main adviser concerning the visit will have been Carney, who may have liaised with Downing Street. Starmer, committed to engaging with Trump, will have been content to keep his distance. The larger point, however, is that this was a willed act by the king. Charles did not have to travel and did not have to make the speech. But he did both, even while continuing to be treated for cancer.The contrast with his mother is impossible to miss. Elizabeth II’s hallmark throughout her 70-year reign was a studied neutrality on public affairs. She was much praised for it during her lifetime, leading some commentators to assume that neutrality was now a precondition for monarchy’s survival, and others into infantile speculations about the symbolic messages that may, or may not, have been implied by what the queen was wearing. Even when Elizabeth didlet slip a view– as in her “think very carefully about the future” comment during the 2014 Scottish referendum – the words could be as gnomic as they were rare.1:38King Charles tells Canadian parliament that country will stay 'strong and free' – videoDuring his long years as heir to the throne, however, Charles became a controversialist. He expressed views about a wide range of issues, from architecture to farming and the climate crisis. He lobbied ministers in handwritten“black spider” memosabout them. This habit led some to predict that, when he succeeded to the throne, Charles would continue to be a protagonist on causes that mattered to him. In Mike Bartlett’s 2014 play King Charles III, the future monarch even abdicates rather than give his assent to a government bill restricting the freedom of the press.In nearly three years as king, however, Charles has proved many doubters wrong.Monarchywatchers who suspected he would not change his ways now concede he has not overstepped any significant constitutional lines. Yet he has done the job his own way, not his mother’s. As the palace itself acknowledges, the king is walking a tightrope.Charles’s visits and speeches push the boundaries. Ottawa is now the most dramatic example, but it is not the only one. At home, Charles has championed the UK union against national separatists. He took Starmer and Angela Rayner tovisit a housing projectin Cornwall. He has made visits to EU capitals,most recently to Rome, which harmonise with Starmer’s attempt to improve relations with Europe. Hevery publicly hostedPresident Zelenskyy only days after Trump’s savage assault on the Ukraine leader in the Oval Office. His most recent Christmas messagefocused on praising health workers.So far, Charles has gotten away with it. Public concern for his own health, and for that of his family, has probably helped him. So has public sympathy over the behaviour of the Sussexes. To criticise Trump is also popular rather than risky. Amid all this, the public has cut Charles enough slack to be more himself. Those who warned that his more committed approach to public affairs could threaten the monarchy and boost republicanism have, at least at this stage, been proved wrong.Canadians are happy to cling to King Charles – as long as he keeps us safe from Trump | Jen GersonRead moreBut this benign circle may not continue indefinitely. Monarchy is still an oddity. The tightrope is still there. Charles is still balanced on it. His approach to the job has won him approval, including grudging acknowledgment from some who previously disapproved of him. But these things are not static. Charles’s role carries risks which, when faced with a less patient public mood or different circumstances, could cause trouble for him and for the monarchy.Assuming that Charles remains in good health for years to come, how might he handle a change of government? If the current feeding frenzy about a Nigel Farage prime ministership really came to pass in 2028-29, Charles could be faced with a government that might embrace a Maga president in Washington, abandon European alliances, dismiss the net zero agenda, and go out of its way to antagonise Scotland and Wales.That would present Charles or the future King William with a very different Britain from the one with which they appear in sympathy. Yet it is a Britain that may be only three or four years distant. According to most evidence and most received wisdom, a generally well-disposed public is content to stick with the monarchy. Yet when so much else about the British state is struggling to adapt, and when monarchy remains historically improbable, why would the monarchy itself not struggle too?Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIOpinionMonarchyCanadaMark CarneyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

The conspirators arepied-noirs, the term used to describe Frenchmen born in Algeria during the colonial occupation there. They grieve De Gaulle’s exit from north Africa, which they regard as a betrayal. Unable to remain in the former colony, they return home – dejected and emasculated – and murderous. In many ways, thepied-noirsregard themselves as being more French than the French.The novel derives some of its appeal from the fact that it’s rooted in history – revanchist Frenchmen made at least six attempts to assassinate De Gaulle in the 1960s. Yigal Amir, the Israeli settler who assassinated Yitzhak Rabin in 1994, reportedlydevouredthe book, and drew inspiration from it.I began to reflect on the novel after reading about the recent Hamas-US prisoner deal. Edan Alexander, the American Israeli soldier who was held captive by Hamas for a year and a half, “grew up in New Jersey and moved to Israel after high school to join the military”, asreportedby the New York Times. When I read that line I wondered what drove his radicalization – what leads an American teenager to travel to a foreign country to join an army whose primary occupation is apartheid?The question is meaningful in its particulars, but it also highlights a broader phenomenon: Alexander’s path is not remotely unique. The Washington Postreportedin February 2024 that “an estimated 23,380 American citizens currently serve in Israeli ranks”. But they have traveled a trail worn and bloodied by others. Baruch Goldstein, an American Zionist who murdered 29 Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron in 1994, was from Brooklyn.The Post story, which profiles the families of Americans who died serving in the Israeli army, describes their “fierce commitment to the Jewish state”. Two of the three families have lived or volunteered in settlements – the apartheid infrastructureIsraelhas built in the West Bank. One mother describes her son, who died while perpetrating a genocide in Gaza, as “more Israeli than the Israelis”. A father describes his family’s journey from America by saying: “We came for Zionism.”The story goes on to describe the elaborate social apparatus through which young Americans are radicalized. One soldier who was killed inGaza“worked each year at a Zionist summer camp in Pennsylvania”. Reading the article, I got a strong sense of the brainwashing, the in-group dynamic at work. The families seem to regard their choices, and those of their children, as being normal – valiant, even.To be sure, the phenomenon of Americans joining foreign armies is not unique to Zionists or Israel. NPRreportsthat hundreds of Americans are fighting alongside Ukrainians in their war against the Russian occupation. But hundreds is not the same as tens of thousands, and fighting occupation is the opposite of investing in and propagating it.Now, with the genocide in Palestine, we’re faced with a reality in which tens of thousands of Americans are actively involved in war crimes. They are part of an army responsible for the murder of more than 20,000 children in Gaza, wherethe Economist estimatesthat Israeli soldiers have killed between 77,000 and 109,000 people, or 4-5% of the territory’s population in 2023.The radicalization of young Zionist men and women does not receive the attention it deserves by the FBI and law enforcement – as contrasted with the experience of Muslims, which is described by the writer Arun Kundnani in his book,The Muslims are Coming.The reason for theirhesitation goes first to the history of antisemitism in the west, where Jewish people have been accused of harboring dual loyalties for hundreds of years. TheDreyfus Affairin France – in which a Jewish officer was falsely accused of treason – acts as exemplar here. And in Germany, Jewish veterans of the first world war found that they were Jewish before they were German. Berthold Guthmann, for example, received the Iron Cross for bravery in the first world war. He was murdered at Auschwitz in 1944 by his former colleagues.Good people do not want to be accused of antisemitism. And if talking about a headache makes it worse, it’s better not to talk at all.But more than antisemitism, there’s the fact of America’s establishment affinity for Israel – which recalls the French sympathy for thepied-noirsin the 1950s. In Congress, Brian Mast has been known towear the uniformof the Israeli military while performing official duties. He also volunteered for the Israeli army. The affinity is similar among Democrats, where Chuck Schumer told a New York Timescolumnist“My job … is to keep the left pro-Israel.”What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe tendency to regard Israel as an extension of the United States exists within media as well. In an interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates, a CBS anchor described the author’s work on Palestine as resembling “extremist” writings. The network laterdistanceditself from the anchor’s statements and behavior.A more recent example took place in May. In a tenseinterview on MSNBC, the Pulitzer prize-winning poet Mosab Abu Taha highlighted the fact that Israeli soldiers – men and women – are perpetrating mass murder in Gaza. Abu Taha went on to recount the stories of his own family who have been killed by Israeli pilots. He described how some of their bodies are irrecoverable – they have lain under the rubble of their bombed homes for more than 500 days.Abu Taha, through his clear description of the depredations of Israeli troops – and his unrelenting focus on their victims – offers a path. One can hope that American mothers and fathers may watch his interview, andotherslike it, and say: “No, I do not want my son to be radicalized, to participate in an atrocity.”Surely, their love for their children demands it.Ahmed Moor is a writer and fellow at the Foundation for Middle East PeaceExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

If that was the reality then, imagine what it looks like nowThu 29 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 10.14 EDTShareApicture says a thousand words. And the imagery slowly seeping out of Gaza tells a story that many politicians and media figures are still doing their best to ignore or obfuscate.Satellite imageryon Google Maps showing the devastated region as of October and November 2023, drone shots of dystopian aid checkpoints, and military maps of so-called “safe zones” make it increasingly hard to argue that Israel’s military “operation” (to use a sanitizing word the media are incredibly fond of) is about eradicating Hamas. This isn’t an operation – it’s a cremation: one with the ultimate goal of eradicating not just Palestinian life in Gaza, but Palestinian identity altogether.First, though, I want to stress that there still isn’t a lot of imagery coming out of Gaza. This is by design – and something I wish more of my colleagues in the western media were outraged about. Israel has not allowed foreign journalists into the territory since the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, save for carefully curated tours by the Israeli army. It is systematicallyslaughtering Palestinian journalistson the ground. And it is placing heavy restrictions on foreign aid workers who are let into Gaza.The Israeli government, meanwhile, is trying to control the narrative with its own visual materials. A picture says a thousand words, but pictures can obviously be manipulated or misrepresented. And there are numerous instances where Israel has been found to have misrepresented imagery. Last year, for example,Forensic Architecture, a research agency that investigates human rights violations, analyzed visual material presented by Israel’s defence team in hearings at the international court of justice (ICJ).Forensic Architecture’s report states that they found “eight instances where the Israeli legal team misrepresented the visual evidence they cited, through a combination of incorrect annotations and labelling, and misleading verbal descriptions” – a very long way of saying: “They lied.” One example of these misleading verbal descriptions: Israel’s team presented the ICJ with what they described as “evidence of a rocket launched from next to Gaza’s water desalination facility”. Forensic Architecture noted that “the highlighted feature is more likely a crater caused by an airdrop munition from an Israeli strike”.More recently,a Sky News analysisof video footage taken from one of the many hospitals in Gaza that have been bombed contradicted Israel’s claim that it was targeting a Hamas “command and control centre” underneath a hospital. Israel published a video taken from an aerial surveillance aircraft with a highlighted building marked as “European Hospital”. Sky News, however, showed that the building was actually a school and the “command center” appeared to be a drainage ditch.I point all this out because great pains have been taken by US politicians and some people in the media to insist that Israel can always be trusted to tell the truth, while Palestinians are frauds who shouldn’t be listened to. Palestinians and pro-Palestinian voices are over-exaggerating the severity of the situation, we keep being told by “reasonable” centrist voices in the media, who seem keen to ignore thegrowing consensusby genocide scholars (including Israeli scholars) that this is not a “conflict”, it is a genocide.The US government (both this administration and the Biden-Harris administration) has been instrumental in this atrocity denial. In late October 2023, Joe Biden, whospread liesabout Hamas beheading babies,said he had“no notion if Palestinians are telling the truth” about the number of casualties in Gaza. Ever since then, certain parts of the media have repeatedly tried to suggest that the official death toll in Gaza (which is a severeundercount, if anything) has been inflated by those devious Palestinians.Whenever horrific videos come out of Gaza –one of the latestshows a child filmed trying to escape a fire caused by an Israeli strike on a school housing displaced people – some of Israel’s worst apologists will rush to spread misinformation about “Pallywood”. The dead babies are just dolls! The fire is CGI! Turns out Gaza has a better special effects department than Hollywood! Anything remotely inconvenient to Israel’s assertion that they have “the most moral army in the world” is dismissed as fake news.If you don’t trust Palestinians, then perhaps you will trust Google Maps. We still don’t have the full picture of what Gaza looks like right now, but updates are slowly coming through and updated satellite imagery of the devastation is beingshared widely on social media. Most of the updated imagery is from the weeks and months after 7 October 2023 – still very early in the carnage.Even still, the scale of the devastation makes clear that this is not a targeted “operation”, it is a scorched-earth campaign. Eerily, at leastthree places inGaza on Google Maps have also now been marked as “haunted houses”. It’s not clear why this is, but some people have expressed suspicion that Israeli soldiershave changed the namefor fun.Some Israeli soldiers have, after all, posted photos of themselvesplaying with underwearfrom the homes of women who have been displaced. “The dehumanization from the top is very much sinking down to the soldiers,” a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem has said in reference tovisual evidence of Israeli soldiersacting maliciously.Don’t just look at Google Maps – look at the maps that Israel is putting out and the changing “safe zones”. Last December, a small strip of land in southGazawas marked on a map as a “humanitarian zone”. Last month, however, theGuardian reported that“Israel has quietly stopped designating areas of Gaza as humanitarian zones” after breaking the ceasefire. Nowhere in Gazacan be considered safe now. People have been trapped inside akilling field.Look at therecent shocking drone shotspublished by Israeli media of the “aid” checkpoints set up by Israel. Look at the starving caged Palestinians surrounded by people who seem to be American military contractors and Israeli soldiers, waiting to receive “aid” via a dystopian scheme that has horrifiedthe UN and humanitarians. This is not aid. It is occupation.Look at these pictures. Really look at them. If you still believe that all this is justifiable, that you are not bearing witness to crimes against humanity, then look at yourself. Ask yourself what you have become.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

This is no answer to our sufferingThu 29 May 2025 12.52 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 14.40 EDTShareTwo days ago, Israeli soldiers fired on a massive crowd of starving Palestinians who just wanted to eat. Some of them had walked more than 10km to reach what was then the only aid distribution point in Gaza. They were looking for help from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a newly formed Israeli-backed logistics group that had set up a distribution centre in Rafah. Israel and GHFlost control of the crowd; Palestinians were shot and killed for seeking food, and dozens were injured.What the GHF is doing is nothing more than a public relations campaign: it is promoting the illusion that aid has begun entering the Strip in a meaningful way. What we have learned is that GHF only distributed eight trucks’ worth of food on Wednesday. Moreover, a US charity, Rahma Worldwide, which had food parcels that it couldn’t get into Gaza and so allowed them to be “taken custody” by GHF, has accused the organisation ofusing its logo without permissionin the aid distribution. (Rahma said it’s opposed to working alongside GHF because of its use of armed security contractors.)Ultimately, there are tens of thousands of people across the Gaza Strip who will not be able to reach the newly created centres. Even if they function, they will not meet the ever-growing daily needs of the population here.As an aid worker, I heard the news this week in despair. This is not sustainable. It is no answer to the total siege thatIsraelhas placed upon us. The unconditional entry of aid overseen by UN agencies is the only solution.Nineteen months ago, the catastrophe that we are experiencing would have been unimaginable. The scale of suffering and pain is beyond comprehension. People here walk the streets without food or drinkable water, and the standard of living has hit its lowest point in recent history, with crippling inflation and empty shelves.For more than 600 days, aid workers like myself have dedicated ourselves to caring for the people of Gaza under Israel’s brutal occupation and bombardment. Israeli government ministers havedeclared their intentionto ethnically cleanse all the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. With the comprehensive ban on all types of humanitarian and medical aid – and the only humanitarian crossing, Kerem Shalom in the south, closed since March – aid distribution has faced innumerable challenges.Our local aid distribution committee has been working in partnership with local and international entities to try to ease the suffering of civilians, especially children, amid the waves of displacement. Nineteen months of evacuation orders, where people are forced to flee with barely any notice, often under bombardment and in fear, has left everyone in a state of panic. People are unsure of where to go or what essential items – like food, water or blankets – to take with them.During the first waves of displacement, relief agencies set up dozens of camps in every region and established temporary infrastructure for water drainage and drinking water supply, depending on our ability to provide wells or coordinate with the remaining local municipalities in different areas of the Strip.But as the bombing and military operations intensified, our humanitarian efforts were constantly threatened. Despite repeated setbacks, we remained determined to continue reaching children, the injured and displaced people – many of whom have been forcibly displaced, an average of five times a family.1:19Palestinians return to Rafah food centre where Israeli troops opened fire – videoGaza has been under fire for almost 20 months, but the most horrifying chapter has unfolded over the past 90 days, with rockets and famine ravaging the bodies of children. I personally know many people who have been killed or injured. Aid organisations have continued our work amid this incomprehensible complexity, but at this stage, even the most basic proposals are unrealistic – trying to feed and care for thousands who can barely find daily sustenance.The turning point that wasn’t: the way the world talks about Israel’s war has changed. Nothing else has | Nesrine MalikRead moreAs the director of the UN World Food Programme (WPF) stated: the aid trucks that have entered are “a drop in the ocean”. We cannot carry out our work unless the international community applies genuine pressure on Israel. Even the roads are closed and buildings are reduced to rubble, making aid delivery impossible. It cannot be clearer: we need unconditional access for food aid to avoid a more devastating catastrophe.Gazaneeds at least 500 to 600 trucksevery day to meet its humanitarian needs. A handful of centres operating in the south of the Strip is no replacement for the hundreds of distribution centres linked to UN programmes and institutions that have been forced to stop operations by the blockade. What must be said clearly is that there is an urgent need to stop the genocide and allow the unconditional entry of aid. It is only through distribution by UN agencies and the international community – not Israel – that we will begin to alleviate this crisis.Eyad Amawi is a coordinator for local NGOs.

Looking through photos and various paraphernalia to make the perfect post about him that he almost certainly wouldn’t see, I found a note I had written to him as a child. In it, using language that would now be considered “toxic” and “victim- blaming”, I apologise for yelling at him for picking his nose (while also pointing out how disgusting I found it).Not to try and excuse my behaviour which I would describe medically as “being a little shit”, but occasionally in life we can look back at our child selves and understand something we didn’t know at the time. This is one of those instances. To me, I can see the little shittery, but I can also see something else that probably caused this behaviour towards my dad, a condition outside my control:misophonia. Now that ADHD has had its moment in the sun, I am here to push formycause.View image in fullscreenThe handwritten note Bec Shaw penned to her father when she was a childMisophonia: how ‘sound rage’ destroys relationships and forces people to move homeRead moreI have explained misophonia before, but essentially it is a disorder where specific sounds or movements from people around you act as triggers, causing extreme disgust, distress or even hatred. It’s not the feeling you get when you’re a bit annoyed at someone’s open-mouth chewing; it’s more like your entire body suddenly overflows with rage and sometimes vomit.The small amount of research into misophonia (it was onlynamedin 2001) indicates it starts in childhood and may initially be focused on one particular family member. Hence, yelling at my dad for picking his nose. Which is disgusting by the way. My misophonic focus soon expanded to the rest of humanity, and since then barely a day has passed in which I haven’t experienced some form of trigger.A few days ago I was watching a new Netflix show where one of the main characters was upset by a colleague eating an apple (very familiar) and she said he probably has misophonia, and then explained what it was. I was really surprised by what I felt when she explained it so matter-of-factly, and had it taken into consideration. It was the same feeling I get when I talk to someone else who has this condition, a relief that someone else understands and can give you appropriate support. The feeling that it has been taken seriously as a real thing. Because I know it sounds weird, and probably a bit made up.It’s embarrassing to admit that a sound someone is making without even thinking about it has turned your insides into one of those primary school science fair volcanoes with vinegar and baking soda. That you can’t listen to a conversation because someone is scraping a bowl. That you can’t go to a movie with a friend who slurps their drink too loud.Even though I’ve written about misophonia, I still find it hard to talk about in real life. I find it hard to admit to a new friend and I find it very difficult to ask anyone to adjust their normal behaviours for me. I don’t want to be a nuisance, or burden them. I’d rather put myself through the unpleasantness than ask them to change. But to feel able to ask for these things is a huge relief.Misophonia has clearly been with me forever, but as an adult I’ve also had the fun addition of some new mental health struggles. I have had a couple of depressive episodes in recent years, one right now as it happens (yes I am a hero), which is another thing I have found it very difficult to talk to people about. I still find it hard to be depressed around other people, even those who love me and will take my company in whatever state it’s in. I am on a slow journey with it, but I have found that being open about my mental health with people – employers, colleagues, housemates, etc – has only been helpful.Ordinary noises fill me with rage – then I got a neighbour so loud they can only be a fancy horse | Rebecca ShawRead moreMisophonia feels like a different thing, but it’s still related to my mental health – they sort of egg each other on. I am also on the slow journey with talking about it. I want to be more open about it – for most of my life I have gritted my teeth and blocked my ears, only letting the closest people in my life into my unusual reality.It’s something that has heavily affected my day-to-day and I have been too embarrassed to tell most people about it. But alongside society’s growing awareness around neurodiversity and mental illness, I am getting better at knowing it is OK to ask people for adjustments to their behaviour, or more care, or a different way of doing things, if it will help.Whether it’s depression or misophonia, having it taken seriously by other people is so important. So I am here to start the conversation. I am willing to become the face of misophonia. The face is scrunched up angrily at the sound of someone stirring their tea, but it’s out there.In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14 and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

In Slovakia,more than 60% of Roma children attend schools where they are in the majority. Worse still: segregation is being rebranded, not removed.In nearly a quarter of all primary schools, Roma children are separated into “Roma schools” or “Roma classes” – often in overcrowded buildings, with lower academic expectations, higher drop-out and grade repetition rates, and with little or no clear path to equal participation in life. Furthermore, Roma pupils areoften placedin schools and classes for children with mental disabilities.As activists, we are told it’s about language. Or behaviour. Or parental choice. Or mental disability. Or because Roma often live in spatially segregated neighbourhoods. We are told it’s temporary. However, as the years (and decades) go by, the situation remains the same.Roma inSlovakia, like elsewhere in Europe, have been pushed to the margins of society. As a result of centuries of antigypsyism (the specific form of racism towards Romany people), Roma have long been treated with suspicion and hatred. This has resulted in Europe’s largest ethnic minority group also arguably being the most discriminated against. In Slovakia, there are many Romany communities living in such poor conditions (often without access to even running water or electricity) as to be unrecognisable to most Europeans as places to live.The level of discrimination at every level of society is sometimes overwhelming. But among the many barriers to Roma in this informal apartheid, education can offer a small chance for new generations to escape. It is a cornerstone of equality – the place where inclusion begins. Yet in Slovakia, school remains one of the many institutions where they are systematically separated from the rest of society. As the US supreme court ruled in 1954 in theBrown v Board of Educationcase: “Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”Despite legal guarantees at national and EU level, decades of pressure from civil society and international human rights bodies, judgments issued by courts and evenproceedings initiated against Slovakia by the European Commission, segregation continues to define the educational experience of tens of thousands.For several years, the Slovak government denied discriminatory treatment of Roma pupils. They justified the overrepresentation of Roma children in the special education system by stating that Roma in Slovakia have ahigher occurrence of genetically determined disordersbecause of “the highest coefficient of interbreeding” in Europe. It was only in 2020 that the Slovakian governmentfinally openly acknowledged the existence of the segregationand undertook steps to eradicate it.Several reforms have been introduced. A legal definition of segregation has been added to the School Act. Legally binding standards on desegregation have been published. Legal entitlement to kindergarten has been expanded. Introductory grades were introduced in place of the previously criticised “zero grade classes” (catchup school years to allegedly bring students to the mainstream level), which were attended largely by Roma pupils. A pilot project branded as a “Roma national school” was announced that would rebrand segregated schooling under the guise of minority rights to learn in your own language and cultural environment, while in effect changing nothing about the segregated schools.Taken in isolation, and without context, some of these measures may appear constructive. But implemented without clear safeguards, oversight and coordination, they often reinforce the very segregation they claim to address. The new desegregation standards focus primarily on classroom-level inclusion within segregated schools, rather than addressing school-level segregation. Similarly, the creation of Roma national schools could lead to institutionalised segregation at the school-level under the pretext of minority rights.The shift in name from “zero grade classes” to “introductory grades” is another example. Though meant to improve school readiness, these classes often replicate the same segregated logic – delaying Roma children’s access to mainstream education and streaming them into separate pathways.Slovakia must stop managing segregation and start ending it. We already know what works: diverse classrooms, mixed environments, early and emphatic support. These are not radical ideas.Responsibility lies not only with Slovakia. The persistent segregation of Roma children constitutes a longstanding violation of the race equality directive and the EUcharter of fundamental rights. Meanwhile, European Commission targets ofreducing segregation of Roma in primary schoolsbyonly50% by 2030 not only give a free pass to segregationists across the bloc, but undermine the illegality of segregation in the first place. The EU cannot afford to look away. Allowing segregation by repacking it undermines the credibility of its commitment to equality and human rights. Segregation, by any other name, remains segregation. The EU must respond to this systemic failure now, before yet further generations of Romany children are denied a future.Kamila Gunišová is a researcher at Amnesty International Slovakia and Michal Zálešák is a legal consultant for the European Roma Rights Centre and attorney-in-law working in SlovakiaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That would be exhausting!’ Cosey Fanni Tutti on radical art, gardening and Kneecap’s ‘power and strength’The Throbbing Gristle musician and writer answers your questions on everything from squat life to societal outrage and the best music for stripteaseAs told toLaura SnapesThu 29 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 29 May 2025 12.29 EDTShareYour ultra-radical art projects during theCOUM Transmissionsera [in the 1970s] shattered every conceivable boundary – from the ethical to the bodily. Even now, viewed through the lens of history, it feels as though you broke through everything that could be broken, before crossing over into pop culture. Has society become any freer? Has art become any less commodified?Dmitry_SI think it has become more commodified. Nothing comes to my attention that would make me think that art has become anything other than a business. That’s down to people wanting a career. I can understand that in today’s economic climate, as opposed to in the 70s, where there was nothing – you could squat or get very low rent, so you just did what you wanted. You don’t have those opportunities now. But I think about art being about self-expression before thinking:can I sell it? That’s whywhat Kneecap are doing is uncomfortablefor people. There’s such power behind them because the motivation is true and honest. That’s the difference. If your art or music is true and honest, it does hold a power and strength that some people might find uncomfortable, and therefore it gets hit.I sometimes get the impression that there were times when you just wanted to do normal stuff and not be transgressive 24/7. Is this the case?ArthurCatRIPI think it would be exhausting to be transgressive 24/7. How do you go from A to B?! We used to go back to Beck Road [squat in Hackney, London] and have hot chocolate. People have lives to live. I don’t remember thinking: I’m going to push some boundaries now. That’s not the way I look at it. Everything I do is just about following my own intuition and my own interests.You were at the cutting edge of an artistry that was confrontational and transgressive, but guided by a considered and intelligent concept.Kanye Westis publishing work steeped in fascist iconographywithout any philosophy other than “pay attention to me”. Do you think that sort of work a continuation of your legacy or a corruption?EdsaykayIt’s definitely not a continuation. And I don’t think it’s a corruption either, because I don’t think it relates to what we did. In my opinion, it’s dangerous and cruel, and I don’t consider anything we did as dangerous and cruel. It was transgressive, and that made people open things up to discussion. Conversely, Kanye West shuts discussion down. I can’t even get my head around that kind of mentality.Heartbeat [the 1981 debut album by Chris & Cosey, AKA Tutti and Chris Carter] was seismic. Every track was prescient andinfluential on so much emerging music for the next 20 years. How do you look at that album now?1leon1Heartbeat was the beginning of our musical career and our relationship. I have a very special affection for Heartbeat, maybe because I was pregnant during the time. It was a crossover album, anyway, because we recorded some of it when we were doing the lastThrobbing Gristlegigs. So in that respect, it’s quite important: bringing a new life, literally for me and Chris, but also a new life into our music having left TG. I went into labour when we were signing off the TG contract with the publishers in Denmark Street: all right, we’ve signed off, now I’m signing on and the baby’s coming. It was a great time and a very confusing time, with relationships and one era ending and another beginning. It was very positive.View image in fullscreenTutti performing as one half of Chris & Cosey at Click festival in Denmark, 2014.Photograph: Gonzales Photo/AlamyWhat do you like about living in Norfolk?Does it inspire your art in any way?RobShepWhere we live is really quiet. When you think about TG and everything else we do, it’s kind of a contradiction. But I need that peace. Living in Norfolk is wonderful because we have huge skies, so sunrise and sunset are really fabulous. Living in a small village really does suit me. We like to go to the beach: Heacham is very Zen. Or we go up to Hunstanton, with the sand dunes. I swim a mile four times a week, but I won’t go in the sea any more. I once had a holiday in Yugoslavia and I got a Portuguese man o’ war sting on my arm.View image in fullscreen‘I’m not going to be sitting on the sidelines’ ... Tutti at Throbbing Gristle’s studios in 1980.Photograph: Courtesy Cosey Fanni TuttiAs someone who used to talk about sexuality so much in your art, what do you think of the fact we lose so much of it as we get older?IdontmindSexuality, sex and lust is on an up-and-down anyway, whether to do with age or not. I think the main consideration as you get older is that you’re physically restricted in certain ways, so you’re not quite as gymnastic in your sexual activities. But if you’re inventive you find ways around it.I used to follow youon Xand enjoyed your updates about your cat, Dexter. I recall that he passed a few years ago, and wonder if you have other cats in your life now?ScraggsDexter [first] turned up in the garden. We tend to adopt cats from cat sanctuaries, and orphans that turn up in our garden for some reason, but we’re glad they do. Spook is our new cat. He was very tiny when he came. I think he was savaged by a dog on his back leg. He was going to be called Hiss and Spit, because that’s all he did when we first went near him, but then he decided he would stay. He’s the most affectionate cat we’ve had. He’s a sweet little thing, the opposite of Dexter, who was named after the series. Dexter was a serial killer with mice. I think he’d been ill-treated, because he didn’t like legs much. He’d been kicked a lot.I get the impression that early COUM was quite whimsical andhippy-ish. Over the years the direction became darker and more transgressive as it went in a more body art direction.By the time of early Throbbing Gristle you have songs likeVery FriendlyandSlug Bait, whichdeal with the darkest of subject matter. It must take its toll inhabiting those worlds;how did you and the others deal with that psychic load?Marko_I think the only toll it took was with me from the ICA [the COUM exhibition there in 1976, Prostitution, caused outrage and was condemned in British parliament]. My parents disowned me. Nobody else had that happen to them. The guys got away with it, but the girl didn’t. I was the one judged, not them. How do you deal with it? You have to get on and think: that side of my life is over with now. Maybe I’ll come back to it later, or maybe not, but I’m not going to be sitting on the sidelines, waiting and begging.View image in fullscreenIndustrial might and magic ... Throbbing Gristle in 1979. From left: Peter Christopherson, Genesis P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti and Chris Carter.Photograph: Throbbing Gristle Industrial RecordsWhich of your works do you feel has been most misunderstood by audiences or critics?mrstoreyI don’t think it’s the work so much as people misunderstanding me and the ideas behind it. We’d have to go back to 1976 and the [adult] magazine work. [Critics] weren’t even interested in finding out what it was about; they were just outraged over whatever. It completely surprised me.What I was going through then is still happening now. That’s the saddest part – things haven’t moved forward so much. But it doesn’t mean that you stop being who you are, making sure your presence is felt and seen and heard. I think that’s important.Re-Sisters by Cosey Fanni Tutti review – take three outsider womenRead moreWhen we did castings for who was going to play me in the first version [of the adaptation] of my memoir Art Sex Music , it blew my mind because I had the first inkling of how much my work had influenced people. Two hundred people came forward to play me. They had to write a thing about why they wanted to play me. I was in tears at some of them. It was really touching.In your book you mention dancing in the strip club toCandi Staton’s Nights on Broadway, then recently you posted thatPatti Smith’s Because the Nightwas a regular in your striptease routine. What other songs do you remember dancing to?SophiepenroseI’ve got all the singles still, about 140 of them. The thing with records for stripping is that the guys had to be able to relate to it. So the records shifted over time – whatever was popular or suggestive: Diana Ross’s Muscles. Hot Legs by Rod Stewart. I did Alternative TV’s Love Lies Limp as an ironic nod to the guys in the audience. Hard Workin’ Man [by Captain Beefheart and Jack Nitzsche] was for the Dagenham Ford workers – it had percussion like hammers. I used to love dancing to that. I used to dance to Abba’s Dancing Queen because Chris bought me that single, and just have a jolly time thinking about him. I used to forget to take my top off at times if I was really enjoying the record.You have been a great influence on techno;did you ever go raving?francoisPNo, and I regretted that so much. I wasn’t in a position to do that. I remember driving home one day past an illegal rave and thinking, God: I wish I could go. What was stopping me? Life and my heart condition. When you suddenly get ill, that your choices get more limited. But there you go.View image in fullscreen‘I regret not going raving’ … Tutti in the studio, 2015.Photograph: Chris CarterWhat’s your favourite thing to grow in your garden?deejaygeejaygeeMy dad used to make me do the gardening when I was young, and I hated it! But I’m glad he did, because it taught me quite a lot. I grew broad beans at Beck Road. Then I didn’t have a garden until Chris and I moved to Tottenham. Then we moved here, into an old school. We had the paved playground smashed up and taken away to form a garden.At this time of year the asparagus is really great. So at the moment, my favourite is asparagus, because we can have some every day and it’s absolutely delicious. The strawberries are going to be nice because all the flowers are out. But also, the flowers have been amazing – the aquilegias and forget-me-nots. I’ve got a pathway of lavender down one side of the driveway, and that’s just coming through. As you come through the gates and go to the front door, you can smell it already, and it’s not even come out in flower. It’s beautiful.Cosey Fanni Tutti’s new album 2t2 is released 13 June on Conspiracy InternationalThis article was amended on 29 May 2025. An earlier version referred to the song Hard Workin’ Man by Brooks & Dunn; however, the intended reference was to the song of the same name by Captain Beefheart and Jack Nitzsche.Explore more on these topicsCosey Fanni TuttiFilm & Music reader interviewThrobbing GristlePerformance artExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019)Wielding a Belarusian accent like a weapon, Huston joins the Wickiverse as The Director, head of the Ruska Roma syndicate, who is forced to help Wick when every assassin in Manhattan is trying to kill him. She can also be seen bullying a dancer, a taste of things to come since The Director will be back very soon, in Ballerina, the new Wick spin-off starring Ana de Armas (out on 6 June).9. Enemies, A Love Story (1989)In 1949 New York, a Polish refugee finds himself married to three women. Paul Mazursky’s adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer’s tragicomedy is like straight-faced Woody Allen, and Huston nabbed her second Academy Award nomination for playing Tamara, a cynical yet sensitive concentration camp survivor. A pity the film doesn’t revolve around her instead of her less compelling husband.8. Ever After (1998)View image in fullscreenWicked stepmother … Huston as Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, in Ever After.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarDrew Barrymore makes an adorable proto-feminist heroine in this daft but charming revisionist Cinderella. Meanwhile, Huston’s eyebrows are working overtime, but she still imbues her wicked stepmother with more nuance than we usually see in a panto villain. If only Disney had taken this as the model for their live-action fairytale remakes.7. Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989)In Woody Allen’s darkest film, Huston plays Dolores, a flight attendant whose lover (Martin Landau) takes drastic action when she threatens to ruin his marriage. Allen himself stars in a lighter parallel thread, but it’s the Dostoevskian half that packs the punch here, helped by Huston’s fearlessly uningratiating performance as a woman at the end of her tether.6. The Grifters (1990)View image in fullscreenSmall-time scammers … with John Cusack in The Grifters.Photograph: Palace Films/AllstarStephen Frears’ film of Jim Thompson’s novel about a trio of small-time scammers in Los Angeles is powered by Huston’s Oscar-nominated performance as a bleached-blond con artist whose feelings towards her adult son (John Cusack) may be more than just maternal. It’s scrappy, lowlife Greek tragedy, capped by Huston’s gut-wrenching howl of despair.5. The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)View image in fullscreenWacky … Ben Stiller, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow and Anjelica Huston in The Royal Tenenbaums.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIn the first of her five films for Wes Anderson, Huston plays Etheline, wife of a neglectful patriarch (Gene Hackman), and holds her own amid the wacky characters and directorial quirks by playing it low-key, almost naturalistic. No wonder her accountant (Danny Glover) is smitten.4. The Addams Family (1991)Was there ever such a delightfully romantic couple as Huston and Raul Julia as Morticia and Gomez Addams? Barry Sonnenfeld’s directing debut is little more than a procession of deliciously morbid sight gags and punchlines ripped straight from the original New Yorker cartoons, but who cares when Huston is giving a masterclass in deadpan delivery, and looking fabulous with it? “Don’t torture yourself, Gomez. That’s my job.”3. Prizzi’s Honor (1985)On the set of John Huston’s black comedy, Anjelicaoverheardsomeone saying, “Her father is the director, her boyfriend’s the star, and she has no talent.” She duly silenced any whispers of nepotism by stealing every scene she was in, as Maerose, a scheming mafia princess trying to win back her ex (Jack Nicholson, with whom she had a long-term relationship). She was the third generation of Hustons to bag an Academy Award.2. The Witches (1990)View image in fullscreenFormidable … revealing herself to be the Grand High Witch, in The Witches.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIn a perfect world, Huston would have won another Oscar for her formidable German-accented turn as the Grand High Witch in Nicolas Roeg’s film of Roald Dahl’s kiddie horror-comedy. Roeg insisted she wear a “sexy” dress, and before she removes her wig to reveal her true witchy self in all its Jim Henson Creature Shop hideousness, she does indeed look splendid, as well as terrifying.1. The Dead (1987)Huston, who grew up in her father’s house in Galway, fits right in with the Irish ensemble cast of the director’s small but perfectly formed final film, adapted (by her brother Tony) from a story by James Joyce, set during and after a party in snowy Dublin, 1904. She is deeply affecting as a woman whose melancholy reminiscence of a long-lost love triggers a bittersweet epiphany in her husband. “One by one, we are all becoming shades,” he reflects. Sublime.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedAnjelica HustonJohn HustonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(The first time was summer 2023, on the strength ofBarbenheimer.) To be clear, this wouldn’t guarantee an all-time summer record; the numbers would need to get a lot closer to $5bn for that to happen. But something in the $4bn range would be closer to pre-pandemic business as usual, in line with most of the 2010s.Is it curtains up on a new generation on Broadway?Read moreGiven the struggles so many movie theaters and studios have faced while hoping to find their way back to that old sense of normal, it’s surprising to learn that a different and far pricier style of box office record was just shattered. The 2024-2025 Broadway season is ending up as thehighest-grossing in history, its $1.89bn surpassing the 2018-2019 season’s $1.82bn. Given the specialized nature of Broadway productions – they’re less accessible, more expensive, and frankly less physically comfortable than going to the movies, even just within New York City – this seems like a spectacular triumph. What happened?Some of that boost can probably be attributed to the proliferation ofstarry, limited productions with sky-high prices. But unlike cinemas, which can usually add more showtimes to meet any outsized demand, there are ultimately limits on how much a handful of shows can contribute to the total. George Clooney’s Broadway debut inGood Night, and Good Luckrecently set an individual weeklong record and has raked in a ton of money. Yetgrossesfor the final week of the season reflect a far deeper bench than just Clooney, Denzel, and the boys ofGlengarry Glen Ross. Other shows playing right around 100% capacity over the holiday weekend include fixtures such as Wicked, Hamilton, and The Lion King; relative newcomers to the musical game such asBuena Vista Social Club,Just in Time,Death Becomes Her, andMaybe Happy Ending; and straight plays – traditionally considered a less tourist-friendly proposition – such asOh, Mary!,Purpose, andJohn Proctor Is the Villain.None of those rely on movie stars; relatively few are even based on movies or past productions, in contrast to the heavy dose of IP regurgitation and uninspired revivals that dottedBroadwayin years past. (In fact, the splashy and effects-packed Stranger Things companion play seems to be doing less overall business than the original drama starring that show’s Sadie Sink.)View image in fullscreenSadie Sink at the John Proctor Is the Villain opening night.Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/REX/ShutterstockSo is it as simple as Broadway offering an unusual number of good and often original shows – or at least balancing out its revivals with major stars while taking chances on crowd-pleasing originals? Yes and no – specifically, “no” to the simple part. Some of the record is probably that lucky break of an unusually strong slate, though that doesn’t necessarily explain an uptick for a production like The Lion King, which has been on the boards for nearly 30 years at this point. For that matter, anyone with a Disney+ subscription can watch the original cast of Hamilton. Maybe this means scarcity, while powerful in supporting high ticket prices, is less important than it seems. In other words, the movies might have helped, in a roundabout way – not just by donating big-screen star power but with the smash success of Wicked over the 2024 holidays, which may have served to remind less dedicated theatergoers (or out-of-towners who don’t have as many chances at a Broadway show) how thrilling it can feel to be in on a cultural phenomenon that isn’t a direct remake or a part eight.That’s what might hold Hollywood off from a record summer, even if 2025 shapes up to be the strongest one in a while. Lilo, Stitch, and Ethan Hunt have proven that remakes and sequels can still sell, but can they sell on a weekly basis for the next three months? The next summer weekend that’s not powered by a sequel or reboot of some sort is ... 22 August. There are certainly more eclectic or original choices available before then: Wes Anderson’s The Phoenician Scheme, Celine Song’s Materialists, and Pixar’s Elio in June alone. The 2024-25 Broadway line-up more closely resembles that kind of eclecticism, rather than the metronomic appearance of supposed sure things. There’s a kind of trust that the audience can sit for a culturally specific, long and frankly kind of messy play likePurpose.That doesn’t always pay off; plenty of great plays don’t do gangbusters business, especially without crucial Tony support. But in its specialized and half-accidental way, Broadway is currently doing a great job of offering material for a variety of demographics. Theater and film will always be an apples-to-oranges comparison – in price, presentation, time commitment and a host of other elements. But both can be, at their best, habit-forming. Right now, Broadway has the big stars, variety of material, and reliable spectacle that used to keep multiplexes full.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayUS theaterTheatreNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does it?Comprising 10 productions and four world premieres, itdoescontain all the signature-marks of Goold’s tenure: a smattering of star names (including Josh O’Connor and Romala Garai, the former the American classic, Golden Boy, the latter in a version of A Doll’s House by Anya Reiss); a big-ambition project with Jack Holden’s adaptation of Alan Hollinghurst’s Booker prize winning novel, The Line of Beauty, about 1980s gay life (how do you turn Hollinghurst’s glorious prose into glorious theatre? We’ll see this autumn, I suppose); and a revival of the musical thrillerAmerican Psycho, based on Bret Easton Ellis’s book, which featured in Goold’s first programme at the Almeida in 2013, and brings a nice circularity to this last one. A play about masculine psychopathy, it is in the mould of previous musicals that combined hard-edged subject matter with song, fromSpring Awakening, featuring teen depression, rape and suicide, to the rise and fall of a TV evangelist,Tammy Faye(both of which Goold directed).There is also another production by Rebecca Frecknall – a revival of Sarah Kane’s searing play, Cleansed. Frecknall, a star director whom Goold has long championed, is joining Goold at the Old Vic as associate director when he takes over as its artistic director, so this does not mark the end of their impressive collaboration.View image in fullscreenA giant swimming pool? No problem! … Rupert GooldPhotograph: Marc BrennerFew could dispute that Goold has made this little but mighty theatre, nestling in the heart of leafy north London, all the mightier. Openings there have become unmissable events and many have transferred to the West End, including American Psycho (then to Broadway, in fact).For good or bad, Goold is also one of the leading industry figures to have brought screen talent closer to the stage. In fairness, most of his power celebrity castings have been well judged, alongside causing a stir – fromSaoirse Ronan’s Lady Macbethto Daisy Edgar-Jonesas Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roofand Paul Mescal as Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire, as well as musical collaborations with Elton John and Jake Shears for Tammy Faye.But what I see as Goold’s greatest accomplishment is his collaborations with the most exciting writers and directors of our time. It is this that has made this programming so formidable. He has a long track record with Robert Icke, each play ever more sensational, from his monumentalOresteiatoThe Doctor,which transferred to the West End, and Hamletstarring Andrew Scott.View image in fullscreenWell-judged … James McArdle and Saoirse Ronan in The Tragedy of Lady Macbeth.Photograph: Marc BrennerThere have been several plays by Mike Bartlett (the biggest highlight wasKing Charles III), as well as the supremely talented Omar Elerian and Beth Steel. These are rich associations, alongside those with Frecknall. I look forward to Alice Birch’s Romans: A Novel, opening in September.Like Goold, Birch has shuttled between TV and stage work, having recently written television versions of Sally Rooney’s Normal People and Conversations With Friends. She will make her Almeida debut with this examination of masculinity across two centuries.Some of my personal highlights have been the more high-wire moments in Goold’s tenure:Elerian’s exquisite revivalof Eugene Ionesco’s The Chairs, a production of Jeremy O Harris’sDaddy: A Melodrama, featuring a giant swimming pool across the span of the stage. And, of course,The Years, which is one of the best plays I have seen in the past five years – and in which Garai also featured. So several circularities – and the promise of a very strong swansong indeed.Explore more on these topicsTheatreRupert GooldAlmeida theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emerging from woodlands on the Goodwood Estate in West Sussex, you see a massive concrete cast of a staircase in a lush green field – a spectacular, surreal collision of urban grit and English pastoral. This is Rachel Whiteread’s Down and Up, a brutal intruder in the landscape.Leafy woods and glorious views – I contemplated Down and Up through a veil of rain but was assured you can see down to the sea on a sunny day – create a dramatic setting for her stark sepulchres. In a forest clearing stands another work, Untitled (Pair) – two bone-white rectangular slabs that look like death. That’s no accident, for their shallow concave tops were cast from mortuary tables. Alone with this monument, the tall trees standing guard around me, I don’t so much ponder mortality as silently scream.House, the famous, lost masterpiece that won Whiteread the 1993 Turner prize, also once stood in the open air, as ungainly and insistent against an east London sky as these remorseless objects look in a much more tranquil context. It wasdemolished in a culture warthat’s forgotten now, but Whiteread is no sensationalist. Her art hits you for a moment with harsh modernism, but then – unless you refuse to look and feel, as the local council did – its sombre poetry creeps up on you.Down and Up is cast from an old staircase in a synagogue in Bethnal Green, east London. You can see why these stairs fascinate her: they are curiously narrow and sloped, as if pushed out of shape by multitudes of long-gone feet. Odd, baffling details like this give her art warmth and passion, while the blank masses of cast material, in this case grey concrete, fill it with silence and terror. You can’t care about life, her art suggests, without recognising death. She sees ghosts everywhere.View image in fullscreenDetached II by Whiteread at Goodwood Art Foundation.Photograph: Lucy Dawkins/Courtesy of the Goodwood Art FoundationHer exhibition launches the GoodwoodArtFoundation. In its low-slung, partly glass-walled gallery, Whiteread’s eye for decay and loss infects a new series of brightly coloured but emotionally serious photographs. Wherever she goes, in Essex or Italy, Whiteread in these pictures sees the crack in the teacup, the rusty stain on the mosaic floor. She notices bin bags like shrouds, a rotting community centre that refuses to be picturesque.Sometimes their foreboding is a bit false, even descending into bathos. We can all be spooked by crows gathering on a telephone wire and sometimes an abandoned child’s toy is just that, however wretched it looks on the doorstep.Yet this is how Whiteread’s imagination works: she sees a continuum between everyday melancholia and collective grief. In 2023, she had a show in Bergamo, Italy – which was severely hit by Covid – creating tombstone-like sculptures to mourn the lost. Some are here. Based on casts of the spaces under chairs – a favourite Whiteread motif – they are marked by recesses where legs and struts once were.View image in fullscreenPhotos of Carmarthenshire, Wales.Photograph: © Rachel Whiteread. Courtesy the artist and Gagosian/© The artistShe aspires to public monuments yet also flees into secret recesses of introspection and memory – which is why a pastoral landscape is such a resonant setting for her art. Two photographs in the gallery show rotting, abandoned places, a shed and a caravan, in each of which someone seems to have lived a hermitic existence, but these shelters rust and rot away, surrendering to weeds. In front of them she recreates this spectacle of solitude and dissolution in her sculpture Doppelgänger, a reconstruction of a smashed, forgotten shack, its broken walls pierced by fallen branches, painted in white emulsion, a ghostly covering that with brilliant simplicity makes reality metamorphosise into art.Outside in the woods, at the end of a long, narrow vista, she has placed a concrete cast of a sealed shed, its windows opaque, its door closed for ever. You feel more and more alone walking around it, trying to find the way in. It is called Detached II. This is a poem to solitude and here in the garden, surrounded by unruly spring growth, it feels as eccentric and lost as the rotting caravan and shack in her photographs. Dissolution and decay are part of nature. They are also part of our lives and time’s arrow only points one way. Thoughts like these are not consoling but they feel as if they belong in the woods, like intoxicating mushrooms of melancholy.Whiteread is a great modern artist and her sculptures blight this pastoral, beautifully.Rachel Whiteread’s exhibitionis at Goodwood Art Foundation from 31 May to 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsSculptureRachel WhitereadArtMuseumsreviewsShareReuse this content"

She was born in Ethiopia, but also lived in Yemen, Cyprus, Canada and, for a short time, England. There was a spell in Sunderland for about eight months when she was six: “My mother was dating a guy from the UK,” she says. “I have very distinct memories of England. I went to school briefly, but I didn’t really speak any English. I remember the cold and the grey skies.”More than 40 years later, Muluneh returns to the UK, invited by Impressions Gallery to make new work across Bradford, Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow for this year’s UK City of Culture programme. Comprising 22 images, The Necessity of Seeing was made over a month-long road trip. She crammed all her equipment into two cars and a minivan, along with a mobile studio, painted backdrops and clothing brought over from Africa, and five core crew members. “It was basically like getting a crash course in UK history and contemporary life,” says Muluneh.The resulting images explore themes such as gender, labour, religion and diaspora. Incorporating pieces of each city’s architectural landmarks – from cathedrals and mosques to cotton mills and war memorials – Muluneh connects historic wounds with contemporary struggles. The decline of industry, the history of labour union movements, women’s rights, and the exploitation of immigrants: in these images, as in reality, everything is connected.The artist shining a light on water poverty in Ethiopia – in picturesRead moreThis work is now part of a touring exhibition, Nationhood: Memory and Hope,shown alongside A Portrait of Us, 15 black-and-white portraits of “unsung heroes” in each city, made by Muluneh, as well as a presentation of seven emerging British photographers.Muluneh’s journey around the UK required a lot of planning, as well as learning, talking and translating her reflections into art. “Being prepared allows me to tap into another part of my mind,” she says. “Along the way, I’d find other things I hadn’t expected, just from simple conversations.”These conversations, as well as each city’s unique social and urban fabric, make up all the layers of meaning in Muluneh’s work. “I’m creating my own universe within an existing reality and reshaping it to reflect how I was feeling at the time,” she says. The title, The Necessity of Seeing, is emblematic of the deep political awareness driving Muluneh’s work. “Growing up displaced has given me a kind of anger that fuels my work,” she says. “I’ve always been drawn to communities dealing with division and cultural identity. My aim wasn’t to come here and try to reflect something I don’t fully understand. I can only reflect my experiences of trying to understand the complexity of the UK – what I saw, witnessed and felt.”What she felt most of all, Muluneh says, was division. “But within that, everyone is facing the same challenges,” she says. “I was looking at what women and children went through in the Industrial Revolution, while also thinking about slavery and colonial history. What I realised is that these shared histories have the potential to connect people, rather than divide them.”Location finder: four works by Aïda MulunehThe Handmaid of Hunger, 2024 (main picture above)“For many of us in Africa, it’s hard to imagine that a country like the UK has people going hungry.

She said her daughter felt really comfortable wearing a hijab, because no one stared at her.

Their lawyers said that “as low-wage workers in vulnerable positions, they lacked the resources and options necessary to protect themselves from sexual assaults”.They also accused Robinson and his wife, Frances, of labour violations, including failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, submitting inaccurate wage statements and creating a hostile work environment.Havingdenied the women’s claimsfrom the outset, Robinson and Frances are now accusing them of fabricating their accounts to extort money from him. In legal documents obtained by the Guardian, the couple stated that the alleged victims spent years working with them, accepted financial help from the couple and took vacations and celebrated holidays with them.The Robinsons’ case claims that “the depths of plaintiffs’ avarice and greed knows no bounds”, accusing them of “concocting an extortionate plan to take everything from the Robinsons (everything over and above what they were freely given) and wrongfully destroy the Robinsons’ well-built reputations”.Robinsonfaces criminal investigation in Los Angelesover the allegations. He initially said he welcomed the investigation “because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing”. His lawyers claim that the women should not have been permitted anonymity and filed a motion to have their case dismissed.All of Hispanic origin, the women said they had only now made their allegations public owing to fear about their reputations and – in some cases – their immigration status. They seek £50m (£37m) in damages and a jury trial.The women also accused Frances of using “ethnically pejorative words and language” and being aware of her husband’s alleged conduct.“We believe she was aware of the misconduct by her husband … and that she used their status as well as our clients’ reliance on their living wage in order to keep them in check,” said lawyer Herbert Hayden.Robinson was one of the first stars of Motown, with hits to his name such as The Tears of a Clown, with his group the Miracles – and as a songwriter for the likes of Marvin Gaye and the Temptations. He released his most recent album, What the World Needs Now, this year.Explore more on these topicsSmokey RobinsonnewsShareReuse this content"

It seems unlikely, to say the least, thatJohn Legendknew this when choosing Glasgow to open his Get Lifted 20th Anniversary world tour. Still, his appearance is appropriately arresting, strolling on stage in the sort of dazzling white suit that looked so fine on Marvin Gaye and Al Green. “Can I be sexy tonight?” he asks – the very definition of a rhetorical question – ahead of She Don’t Have to Know, a breezy ode to cheating.The tour is a celebration of his classic debut, an album that announced Legend as a soul man who could, it seemed, be spoken of in the same breath as giants of the genre. In his 20s when Get Lifted was released, he’s now 46: a middle-aged star playing the songs of a hungry – and horny – young musician; a husband and father singing of infidelity and reconciliation.Perhaps because he no longer feels the words he wrote back then, there’s something bloodless about much of the performance. He is a wonderful singer and his nine-piece band skilled, but the set is drilled to the point of being dull. Legend is a former management consultant – as he mentioned during one of the interminable “my musical journey” talky bits – and one suspects that somewhere backstage is a PowerPoint plotting every priapic strut and yelp. His between-song chat is so cheesy that when he asks us to “Make some noise for Philadelphia!” it isn’t clear whether we are being urged to cheer the city or the spread.View image in fullscreen‘His playing is expressive’ … John Legend and band on stage in Glasgow.Photograph: Gaëlle BeriHis playing is expressive enough; no need for all that commentary. The ballads Ordinary People and All of Me, solo at the piano, are beautiful songs beautifully performed. Take My Hand, Precious Lord shows off his gospel roots. There is even a curveball Beatles cover, I Want You (She’s So Heavy), stitched seamlessly to the end of his own I Can Change.Those are highlights, but the show as a whole drags.

He faces up to life in prison if convicted on all counts.Mia said that Combs’s conduct towards her was “the most shameful thing of my life” when challenged by his defense about why she hadn’t reported him, adding that having to talk about it now was a traumatic experience but that being scared into silence would not help others.Judge denies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs lawyers’ bid for mistrialRead moreSometimes he treated her like a best friend, and sometimes he was terrifying and humiliated her in front of others, making her feel like “a worthless piece of crap”, she told the jury in New York.She also described feeling trapped in the situation, finding that in previous interactions with police the officers were simply awed to be dealing with the famous artist Diddy, and also being terrified of him.“I didn’t want to die or get hurt,” she said. She had assumed she would take her secret to her grave, but now had felt able to take the stand.“I couldn’t tell him ‘no’, like, about a sandwich. I couldn’t tell him ‘no’ about anything. There’s no way I could tell him ‘no’,” Mia said, adding that if she had left or been fired she feared that Combs would “ruin my future”.Testimony in the closely watched trial in Manhattan federal court is in its third week. Prosecutors say Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, coerced women over two decades to take part in days-long, drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers known as “freak-offs”.Mia’s testimony was not about sex parties but about allegedly being raped in private, at his home when she was assisting him, such as in packing for a trip. He made her feel “like trash”, she said.Mia told jurors Combs climbed on top of her while she was sleeping and raped her while she lay frozen with fear. In another incident, she testified that Combs grabbed her head and put his penis in her mouth, while she did not fight back. As she testified on Thursday, she fought back tears and often looked down at her lap, speaking about his alleged assaults in barely a whisper at times.Combs’s lawyers have acknowledged he was at times abusive in domestic relationships but said any sex was consensual.They have also said that women who participated in the so-called “freak-offs” did so consensually.Over four days of emotional testimony during the first week of trial, Combs’s ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura told jurors Combs physically and emotionallyabused herthroughout their tumultuous 11-year relationship.Ventura, a rhythm-and-blues singer known as Cassie, said she participated in the “freak-offs” because she feared Combs would release sex tapes of her if she didn’t, but also because she loved him.Mia told the court on Thursday that she had more than once witnessed Combs physically assaulting Ventura, her friend.In one instance, she said, while on a trip to Turks and Caicos, Ventura ran to Mia’s room to wake her up, screaming: “You gotta help me” and saying of Combs, “he’s gonna kill me.”Friends and associates of Combs and Ventura have also testified about Combs’salleged abuse, describing Combs as a domineering figure who relied on bodyguards and associates to enable his alleged crimes and keep victims in line.Dawn Richard, a former member of the pop group Danity Kane,testified last weekthat she felt threatened when Combs told her to keep quiet about what she saw.Richard faced a sharp cross-examination by one of Combs’s lawyers, who sought to point to inconsistencies between her testimony and what she said during interviews with prosecutors.Last week, Scott Mescudi – the rapper known as Kid Cudi –testified that his car was set on firein 2012, shortly after Combs learned that Mescudi had a romantic relationship with Ventura.Former employee testifies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs said ‘we’re going to kill’ Kid CudiRead moreProsecutors say the alleged arson of Mescudi’s car was one of several violent or illegal acts that Combs or his associates undertook to prevent women from leaving his orbit and keep his abuse quiet.The trial has drawn intense media coverage due to Combs’s cultural influence and role in taking hip-hop mainstream through legendary artists such as the Notorious BIG.Combs was arrested in Manhattan last September and is being held at a federal prison in Brooklyn when not in court.The trial will resume on Friday and is expected to last several more weeks.Reuters contributed reportingInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

I’d never heard of Manawatu so the book arrived as blank as a newborn – and yetAuēread as if reincarnated for countless lives. It was an assured and flawless family drama exploring violence and redemption. It scooped the prize. In my notes I said the writing was “like acid on the skin”. Manawatu has just released her second novel, Kataraina.Where Auē burnt, Kataraina heals; a soothing, rinsing, complex novel.Kataraina follows the eponymous character who is whāngai (aunty) to orphan Ārama, known as Ari and one of the narrators in Auē. This book acts as both sequel and prequel; one needn’t read Auē to enjoy Kataraina, though their stories orbit each other in a tight dance.Kataraina, like Auē, is about family and violence, secrets and terrible inheritances. There is an incident involving “the girl who shot the man” at the centre of the story to decipher, though crimes and their perpetrators in Kataraina are many and run deep. The plot is withheld for much of the novel; instead, this is a heart-touching portrait of Kataraina, from child to adult; the whenua (land) where she lives – the swamp, the river; and the ancestors that haunt them.‘Literary scandal’, ‘joke-a-minute’, ‘captivating’: the best Australian books out in MayRead moreKataraina is told from a first-person plural point of view of the whānau (family), a collective perspective that spans centuries: “It’s an old story, and we can see it all as if we are there.” The story is nonlinear, and revealed in beautiful vignettes that weave together like the braided rivers of Kaikōura. The novel is as much about place – the braided rivers and the endangered kanakana (lamprey) – as it is about relationships between characters.Propelling the story forward is a secret – the identity of a murderer– that lingers as if “once a dog barking somewhere distant, was now a shrill bird busting its head bloody against the glass pane of her heart”.Violence shimmers on the edge of the frame in Kataraina. It’s the uneasy feeling of observation, of tiptoeing on eggshells before another character stomps over them. Words are powerful matter and Manawatu wields language like an axe against a stump, splintering across the page:We are dragons and demons and sluts and maggots and we cook a mean mutton chop and we roll a mean joint and write a mean essay and make a mean cuppa and can lend a mean ear and will let our patience be tested for love. It’s all for love. We are mean Māori, mean. We’re too much.As in Auē, Manawatu’s descriptions are beautiful – the water’s surface moves “like a hand rubbing a dog’s coat the wrong way”. There is so much mouthfeel in the writing – the “soft fat water” of the ocean, the “hot chips wrapped in creamy paper”, in sumptuous, powerful passages like: “The shamer is a beast, and it doesn’t eat apples and eggs and creamed corn or pain. It slurps up hope and the people you might have been. Gorges on her brilliance.”Manawatu’s writing style is reminiscent of Melissa Lucashenko,Toni MorrisonandKeri Hulme– insofar as the author seems to be communing with these powerful characters on the altar of the page, and we, the readers, are opportune witnesses.Like Hulme, Manawatu is of Kāi Tahu (Ngāi Tahu) whakapapa (ancestry). Kāi Tahu has its own storytelling tradition, and it sits here within the New Zealand gothic like a glove, the past informing the present andall time.Her words are a balm; woven into the text is the guttural language of te reoMāori, using Kāi Tahu dialect. I felt my tongue change while reading Kataraina,and the experience felt tapu (sacred) as the language tumbled down the back of my throat to the guts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What I found genius about this thread was how it expanded my understanding of the observer and the observed through agricultural and botanical colonialism of the mahinga kai (food gathering places) of the Waiau-toa (Clarence River) and surrounds, while also adding depth and nuance to Kataraina’s relationships, by examining them through historical changes and metaphors drawn from the landscape, past and present always conversing.The novel acts as a sort of river water; the swamp is the tipuna (ancestors), and we, the readers, are thekanakana swimming among them. Perhaps Manawatu, the storyteller, the whakahekenga (descendant), is scooping us up from the story of her ancestors, and walking us up the braided rivers, up, up, to Te Au nui (Mataura Falls) to learn, to be moved, to be changed. Whatever her intention, it is a wonder to read: Kataraina is a generous, expansive, masterful novel that drenches up and fills in at once.Kataraina is out through Scribe in Australia (A$35) and Mākaro Press in New Zealand (NZ$37)Explore more on these topicsFictionAustralian book reviewsAustralian booksMāorireviewsShareReuse this content"

They are certainly ambitious works with which to launch a recording career on Supraphon, but Tomáš Vrána is undoubtedly dauntless; his performances are full of confidence, verve and faultless technical accomplishment. At times, though, they do seem rather sluggish; Vrána’s tempi are often on the slow side, but the textures from the Janáček Philharmonic tend to be rather muddy too, though there is plenty of neat, alert solo playing from its wind and brass. For all his keyboard agility, Vrána seems to be at most imaginative in the concertos’ slow movements, especially the central Adagio of the second, one of the most atmospheric examples of Bartók’s “night music”, to which he adds wonderful colour and subtlety. The excellent sleeve notes are also written by Vrána himself.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Gibbons, who was born in Oxford in 1583, was one of the last significant English madrigalists, and is often viewed as a transitional figure between Renaissance music and the baroque, though historically he has been overshadowed by the more prolificWilliam Byrd, with whom he may have studied.View image in fullscreenMy Days: Orlando Gibbons and Nico Muhly.As well as vocal works, Gibbons wrote a wealth of string chamber music, and Fretwork’s selection includes Fantasias in two, three, four, five and six parts, as well as a Pavan and Galliard for six viols. Placed at the centre of the sequence isNico Muhly’sMy Days,originally commissioned for Fretwork and the Hilliard Ensemble; it’s a setting for four male voices and viols of Psalm 39, with an extract from a report on the autopsy that was performed on Gibbons; Muhly describes the result as “a ritualised memory piece about Orlando Gibbons”.Muhly’s composition, with its urgent string figures, contrasts beautifully with the flowing imitations of Gibbons’ fantasias, around it. Its vocal lines are built out of a single falling melodic figure, with the quartet of counter tenor, two tenors and baritone moving in luminous rhythmic unison through the psalm, before the autopsy is delivered as a series of Gibbons-like responses, until a final section with the voices surrounded by plucked strings before settling on the words “my days”, with the viols fluttering around them. It sets off the string pieces around it, perfectly.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Two sisters, Kamaljit (Kiran Landa) and Surinder (Anoushka Deshmukh), first come together to share dreams and intimacies and then head in opposing directions, into estrangement, after their father (Jaz Singh Deol) dies and their mother (Avita Jay) begins organising their arranged marriages.It is charming in its essence, bubbling with spirited performances and smart period costumes (1970s era cardi-and-trouser combos with shalwar kameez) set alongside an elegant stage design by Good Teeth – the Bains’ home folds out from flatness and then turns into their shop in a few deft steps.But flatness remains elsewhere, while the story sprawls. The many meaty themes here feel unwieldy and too briefly touched on while the narrative unity of the original story is lost in an exuberant but untethered adaptation by Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti. The production ranges widely and loosely, not finding its emotional fulcrum, with characters who seem cut from generic 70s sitcom cloth.Dialogue is beached by exposition and short scenes that telegraph plot above all else. Mr Bains talks about his dreams of being a Somebody in Britain; “What about my life?” says Surinder, who wants to be more than the wife of a Somebody, and her teacher reminds us that the Vikings were immigrants too. It is all too baldy stated in primary colours, with comedy that does not land hard or sharply enough.The first act is emotionally brisk so we do not connect enough with characters to feel their jolts, from the daily indignities of racism to untimely death and family woes. The second is strangely plodding, although it brings more emotion, certainly in the meeting between the sisters after estrangement.Time and perspective changes between the first and second halves of the play leave you more unmoored around its focus. Is it a drama about the limits placed on the women of this community or an exploration of cross-generational assimilation? Surinder’s relationship with a controlling white British man is interesting but underexplored. Arjan’s mixed race relationship feels tacked on, with passing reflections on what sounds like theTebbit cricket testby Kamaljit’s husband Tanvir.Its spirit of levity is reminiscent ofEast is East, whose fabulous stage incarnation was directed by Iqbal Khan, who directs here too, as well as, to some degree, Emma Rice’s adaptation of Hanif KureishiThe Buddha of Suburbia. But it feels like Kureishi lite, paler for the comparison.It does exude a warm energy in its more successful first act and there is lovely evocation of time and place through music, from the dhols of Arjan’s grandparents’ generation to period pop (Sugar, Honey, Honey, etc). This cannot make up for the holes in its drama, which skates too lightly across all the surfaces and never quite forms a centre.At theLyric, Hammersmith, until 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreLyric HammersmithBritish identity and societyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the composer’s own springy numbers are the best reason to catch this rarely seen musical based on ancient Greek satire.Aristophanes, writing at the fag end of a protracted war, conjures demigod Dionysos, accompanied by Xanthias, his slave (“though I prefer ‘intern’”). He braves the underworld to reclaim a dead genius, picking Aeschylus over Euripides. The musical’s Dionysos considers George Bernard Shaw, but eventually plumps for Shakespeare.Originally staged at Yale in 1974 (Sondheim: “One of the few deeply unpleasant professional experiences I’ve had”), it was expanded for Broadway in 2004 (Sondheim: “It suffered from inflation”). The extended version takes a jape too far.We open with the best number: a fanfare plus jaunty injunctions to the audience (“Please – don’t fart. / There’s very little air and this is art”). Dan Buckley’s droll Dionysos and Kevin McHale’s Xanthias, all wriggle and snicker, begin their quest, though Burt Shevelove’s book makes scenes feel more like skits. Herakles (Joaquin Pedro Valdes) is a himbo totting up his abs, the boatman Charon (Carl Patrick) a lugubrious stoner and Pluto, lord of the underworld, has a breathy cabaret number delivered by regal guest star Victoria Scone in a brushed steel bouffant.View image in fullscreenOn a quest … The Frogs at Southwark Playhouse.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe musical never develops Dionysos’ daddy issues or frog phobia, or nails its notion that the ribbiting amphibians represent stick-in-the-mud grouches impervious to change. The frogs get a waddling ballet, in goggles, bobble toes and spangly waistcoats – choreographer Matt Nicholson devises nifty, wide-legged moves. But Shaw’s battle with Shakespeare, trading smug aphorism and voluptuous word-painting, is an awful slog, unleavened by Georgie Rankcom’s heavy-footed production.“You can stop rhyming right there,” snaps Dionysos, but it would take more than a testy god to halt Sondheim, for whom rhyme was reason. “Hippy-dippy insurrectionists” meet “hasty pasty-faced perfectionists,” while a song to Shaw moves from animosity through pomposity to verbosity. Melancholy songs also slide between the shtick (Sondheim has a bittersweet tooth). The god’s final call to arms can’t give gravity to this show – but however stodgy the setting, the songs still shine.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsStephen SondheimTheatreSouthwark PlayhouseAristophanesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The real-life ritual, which transpired at a nunnery in Iowa, was overseen by elderly German Capuchin priest Father Theophilus Riesinger (Al Pacino) and local cleric Father Joseph Steiger (Dan Stevens) and written up as a pamphlet (“Begone Satan!”) that went on to shape the public understanding of exorcisms.All that historical detail is transfused into a weak tea of a script, credited to the film’s director David Midell and Enrico Natale. They have generated a work that is a little more interested in background and context instead of sweary pyrotechnics and supernatural fireworks often found in demonic-possession-themed features, the most notably The Exorcist from 1973. But we still get bits of levitation here and there, and moments when poor possessed Emma seems to free-solo the walls of the dank basement room she’s locked in. At other points, she inexplicably vomits what look like tobacco leaves and speaks in a variety of exotic tongues. The men of the cloth stoically soldier on while an assortment of nuns stand by looking petrified and aghast.It’s perhaps unfair to ask that a film be an entirely different creature than the one the film-makers intended to produce. But in this case, it feels a bit disappointing that the cast and crew worked so hard on the historical roots and verisimilitude stuff, and then insisted on sticking with the idea that Emma was literally possessed, instead of exploring how she might have a mental illness, coupled with childhood trauma.At least Pacino doesn’t seem to be taking any of it seriously as he phones in an uncharacteristically low-volume performance whose most distinguishing feature is the Mitteleuropean accent that makes him sound as if he’s reprising his performance as Shylock from The Merchant of Venice. Stevens, for his part, just looks as if he’s waiting for all this to be over (not unlike the character he plays) so he can go back to working on the sort of kooky, craft-stretching roles he’s been having so much fun with lately, such as his mad scientist in Cuckoo or his German-speaking android in I’m Your Man. Even so, his presence somewhat improves this schlock.The Ritual is in UK and Irish cinemas from 30 May, and Australian cinemas from 5 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsAl PacinoDan StevensPeriod and historical filmsChristianityreviewsShareReuse this content"

But John Schlesinger’s winsome adventure from 1965 still has verve and ambition, a romantic satire of swinging London now on rerelease for its 60th anniversary.Julie Christie plays Diana Scott, a model and actor who enjoys an insouciantly upward rake’s progress in smart-set London: an innocent, almost childlike Becky Sharp-type character, for all her dissolute encounters, and abortion and divorce are notably presented without sorrowing dismay and disapproval. The wry, Oscar-winning screenplay from Frederic Raphael imports and anglicises the influence of Godard, Resnais, Varda and the French New Wave; fashion models and advertising are vitally important; there is a media interview with a writer (English author and don Hugo Dyson has a cameo as a supposed author of provincial decency and integrity); and we get the occasional gloomy brooding about the bomb. Interestingly, however, the scenes set in Paris where Diana witnesses a live sex show, are a rather saucer-eyed English view of the naughty French, and would never pass muster in an actual French film. Having said which, Schlesinger manages freeze-frame images quite as well as the continentals.Christie’s ingenue is a girl from a good English family, who got married too young to a decent but boring chap. Soon she is caught between two lovers played by two acting thoroughbreds whose faces have an amazing and sometimes near-gargoyle expression of worldliness: Dirk Bogarde and Laurence Harvey. Bogarde is Robert Gold, who fronts an earnest TV show about culture called Art and You. We see him conducting interviews in the street about what passersby think is most shaming in modern British society. Schlesinger gives us what looks like hilarious, genuine voxpop footage in which people declare that Britain’s most shaming things are, variously, traffic problems and the prevalence of homosexuality.One of Robert’s interviewees is Diana who soon finds herself in an extramarital entanglement with him. When they go to a hotel room, Robert has to pretend they are a married couple by buying a suitcase and making it feel respectably heavy for the bellboy by covertly filling it with copies of the old London Evening News – the headline of which is an irresistible madeleine for non-swinging Britain: MINERS – ALL HOPE VANISHES.Without any great agonising, Robert leaves his homely wife and children to move in with Diana in her swinging London flat (she is thrilled by the “gorgeous negroes” upstairs, a very 1965 script moment) and Robert introduces her to an elegant new stratum of society where she meets oleaginous smoothie Miles Brand, an adman played by Harvey; he gets her on his books and his German clients love Diana’s “Aryan” look. Diana also befriends a gay fashion photographer Malcolm (played by actor turned author Roland Curram) who accompanies her on holiday.The film is full of incidental detail that will grip all fans of bygone Britain. Uptight Robert drives an Austin 1100 (like the one beloved of Basil Fawlty) whereas Miles drives a groovy Volvo sports car – the kind that Roger Moore had playing Simon Templar in The Saint. But the parade of ironies continues. Miles gets Diana promotional work at a grotesque charity event where people donate to famine relief while gorging themselves on food and wine, and even secures her a walk-on role in a sub-Hammer movie. She also plays the role of a Renaissance principessa in a silly TV ad for chocolate, filmed at the palazzo of a suave and recently widowed Italian nobleman who is entranced by Diana – and she reaches the Grace Kelly moment in her career.Christie is always in danger of being upstaged by Bogarde and Harvey, pouting male divas both, and her performance is in fact a model of restraint and self-effacement compared with these preening exquisites. Bogarde shows us a flash of something spiteful and even sinister in the way he treats Diana at the very end, and also in his spasm of jealous rage when he realises she has been cheating on him, dragging her down an escalator in the London underground and bellowing the word “whore” in that refined voice. The bland, amiable, noncommittal Diana certainly doesn’t deserve that label. It’s directed with terrific punch with Schlesinger, who – as in Midnight Cowboy and Far from the Madding Crowd – has a flair for showing us innocents who wish to survive.Darling is in UK cinemas from 30 May and on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from 16 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsComedy filmsJulie ChristieJohn SchlesingerComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

To my left, laid out on a table, are a gold Versace bag and a pair of daintily embroidered blue silk shoes dating from the 1720s. To my right, a Vivienne Westwood corset and a Balenciaga pink taffeta evening dress from the 1950s. It’s a fashion lover’s fever dream and it’s all here, at my fingertips.I’m at theV&A East Storehousein east London, a radical new museum experience that allows anyone to order up any item from the V&A’s vast collection – for free – and to examine it at close quarters. Housed in the former Olympics Media Centre, on the edge of theQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park, this lofty warehouse space gives unprecedented access to more than 250,000 objects, from an 11m wide stage cloth designed by Picasso to a cross-section of a maisonette from theRobin Hood Gardenscouncil estate in Poplar. Gone are the glass cases, white walls and carefully curated exhibits of a traditional museum space. Instead, visitors are invited to look behind the scenes of a working museum, to wander among open shelves stacked high with deliriously eclectic objects and to peer into the workshops where conservators are at work. The effect is part Ikea showroom, part Victorian cabinet of curiosities. It’s bold, slightly bonkers and I love it.View image in fullscreenThe Weston Collections Hall at V&A East Storehouse.Photograph: © Hufton+CrowThe opening of this new V&A outpost marks the latest chapter in the reinvention of the Olympic Park as a “new cultural quarter” for London. At the time of the London 2012 games, I lived in Bow, on the edge of the Olympic Park. On the night of the opening ceremony we watched from the window of my flat as fireworks lit up the sky above the stadium. It was the culmination of one of the most ambitious regeneration projects that London had ever seen and we had a ringside seat as this brave new world rose up from a 560-acre brownfield site.As well as providing a deprived area of east London with world-class sporting facilities, part of the Olympic legacy was the promise to build a new creative hub, somewhere that would inspire locals and visitors alike. We moved out of the area shortly after the games finished, so I was curious to see for myself whether that promise had been fulfilled.The V&A East Storehouse is part Ikea showroom, part cabinet of curiosities. It’s bold, bonkers and I love itOn a bright spring morning the park is quietly humming with activity. Teenagers glide along wide boulevards on roller skates and toddlers play in the water fountains in front of the London Stadium. On the canal, families drift by in pedalos in the shape of white swans, watched over by Zaha Hadid’s imposingAquatic Centrewhich carves a graceful arc in the blue sky.My daughter and I make a beeline for a cluster of new buildings which are lined up along the canal. TheEast Bankproject represents the largest single investment in culture by a London mayor since the Great Exhibition of 1851. The first phase launched in 2023 with the opening of cutting-edge new campuses for University College London (UCL) and the London College of Fashion. Both sites have been designed to be open and accessible to the public. So you can wander into the reception of UCL East and see public art installations – on our visit Luke Jerram’s “Gaia”, an inflatable replica of the Earth, was floating serenely above the atrium – or head to the cafe where your coffee will be delivered to you by a robot waiter.View image in fullscreenA postgraduate show at the London College of Fashion, East Bank.Photograph: Ana BlumenkronAt the London College of Fashion, the public areas host regular showcases of student work. We stroll around the lobby, all bare concrete and curving staircases, and admire a display of outlandish undergraduate creations – although my daughter is far more interested in what the fashion students themselves are wearing.Next door isSadler’s Wells East, a new outpost of the dance theatre which opened in February. The open-plan foyer is home to a light-filled bar, cafe and dance space – when we drop in for a coffee there’s a community dance class in mid-flow. The 550-seat auditorium will provide a home for visiting dance companies of every genre, from ballet to hip-hop. We have booked tickets for that evening’s show, a family-friendly performance of Snow White by theballetLorent.I corkscrew down the metal tube at terrifying speed, emerging 40 seconds later feeling like I’ve been flushed down the S-bendOur next stop is theArcelorMittal Orbit, the twisted red steel sculpture that towers over the Olympic Park. We take the lift up to the viewing platform, a dizzying 80m above the ground. Far below us the London Stadium, now home to West Ham football club, is laid out like a Subbuteo pitch. As a general rule of thumb, I try to avoid any activity that involves having to don an Australian Rules Football helmet and elbow protectors. And yet here I am, joining the queue of teenagers waiting to launch themselves feet first down the Helix, the high-speed helter skelter that snakes around the outside of Anish Kapoor’s look-at-me landmark. My teenage daughter takes one look at the foam helmet and refuses to go any further. “It’s just a big slide!” I tell her. “Come on, it’ll be fun!”View image in fullscreenThe Helix slide on the ArcelorMittal Orbit at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.Photograph: Mark Mercer/AlamyThese words – and others that cannot be published here – ring in my ears as I corkscrew down the metal tube at terrifying speed, emerging 40 seconds later feeling like I’ve been flushed down the S-bend.

We’ve booked a table atHera, one of the park’s newest openings, which has been winning accolades for its authentic Greek food.It does not disappoint. From the basket of homemade bread and dip of smoked aubergine with thyme, honey and balsamic vinegar, to the elegant sea bass carpaccio and charcoal-grilled chicken skewers, everything is sensational. But the standout dish is the feta saganaki – feta cheese, wrapped in angel hair, deep-fried and drizzled with lemon honey. My daughter and I are still dreaming about it weeks later.View image in fullscreenSwan pedalos in the Olympic Park.Photograph: Queen Elizabeth Olympic ParkIt’s the kind of lunch that needs to be followed by a long walk, so we trace the course of the canal, fringed with head-high whispering grasses, into the northern half of the park, eventually reaching the iconic Olympic rings – which have found a permanent home on a raised mound overlooking the Lee Valley VeloPark.A group of women dressed head to toe in sequins shimmer past in the late afternoon sunshine, on their way toAbba Voyage. The virtual concert experience has attracted more than two million visitors since opening in a purpose-built arena on the edge of the Olympic Park in 2022. In September, they will be joined by an army of David Bowie fans when the V&A Storehouse becomes the new home of the David Bowie archive, comprising stage costumes, song lyrics, instruments, makeup charts and sketches. And there’s more to come. Next year will see the relocation of the BBC Music Studios from Maida Vale to Stratford and the opening of the V&A East museum in a striking new building inspired, apparently, by an X-ray of a Balenciaga dress.I’ve enjoyed being a tourist on my old home turf. It may not have the gravitas of South Kensington, the architectural cohesion of the South Bank Centre or the neoclassical elegance of Covent Garden, but East Bank is an invigorating and inspiring addition to London’s cultural scene. And it’s fun. Where else can you slide down Britain’s tallest sculpture, handle vintage haute couture, or dance in front of an Abba avatar, all in one day?The V&A East Storehouse opens to the public on 31 May.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Now that the third season (OK, discourse treadmill) ofThe White Lotusis sinking into the horizon, and its many fans flock to Thailand in the hope of catching a whiff of Walton Goggins (who I’m in no doubt smells absolutely lovely), I’m grateful that Sicily, the location of season two, might finally be a little less busy. Not least because of its wines.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Wine has been made on Sicily for thousands of years, and the island’s been colonised by just about every ancient civilisation before the Italians took over in the late 1800s. Mass emigration to the US coupled with the two world wars meant that the local wine industry suffered for much of the 20th century, and it’s only been in the past 30 years that it has moved away from an association with bulk cooperative production to prioritising excellence (a story shared with many wine regions internationally).To understand Sicilian wine, you need to get to grips with a handful of native grape varieties that are unique, and vital, to the region. Nero d’avola is the most widely planted red variety, and it produces an inky, dark-fruited wine with suggestions of something herbal such as liquorice and toasted tobacco. Its ready-to-drink iterations are endlessly reliable, but some of the best require time in the bottle. Nerello mascalese and frappato, meanwhile, which I would say are the next two most popular red grape varieties, are sprightly and aromatic in comparison. Often used in blends, they also produce elegant, pretty and perfumed wines in their own right.In terms of whites, cataratto takes the title of the most-planted grape. Of the others, saline and mineral carricante and crisp, savoury grillo are both used to make marsala, the island’s famous fortified wine that hails from the coastal town of the same name. There are 22 other DOCs on Sicily, Marsala being probably the most famous, but there is also Faro out east, which is known for its supple, oak-aged reds made from nerello mascalese and nerello cappuccio. Then there’s Etna with a terroir defined by millefeuille layers of soil and rock from centuries of volcanic eruptions, which create fertile and mineral-rich wines that brim with tension and excitement.Etna wine, in particular, has become much more coveted in recent years. Why? Because ofThe White Lotus, of course. “Apparently, the wine has, like, a bunch of volcanic minerals in it,” swoons Daphne in episode five of season two. “So, we can get drunk, and then tomorrow our skin and our hair and our nails will be glowing.” Unfortunately, I am contractually obliged to inform you that drinking Sicilian wine is very unlikely to have this effect – you’re far more likely to wake up with sallow skin and several missing acrylic nails.Four Sicilian wines to get excited aboutPaolini Grillo BioTerre Siciliane2022£12.50 Good Wine Good People, 12%.

Unlike the rest of the unmarked boxes with identical sky-blue lids and opaque sides, I knew exactly what this was: a mix of parsley, garlic and lemon zest (otherwise known asgremolataorgremolada) made last June to go with braised chicken, but not finished, so the leftovers were put in the freezer. I exchanged messages with Carla all the time and, knowing how much she loved freezer-talk, I consulted her as to how long she thought the mix would keep in there. She gave two replies: an official one of three to six months, and an unofficial one of a year, which must have sunk into my unconscious like a preset alarm because, almost a year later (and 10 months since she passed away), I find myself in front of my chaotic freezer, holding a tub of finely minced things and thinking, “There you are!” and, “Thanks, Carla!”Gremolata is a typically Milanese mix, and the name means to reduce into grains. And that is precisely what you do to a clove of garlic, a handful of parsley and the zest of a large unwaxed lemon in order to make a fine and fragrant rubble, which can be made by hand or in a food processor. While gremolata is closely associated and served with braisedosso bucoandrisotto alla Milanese, it is a fantastically versatile addition to all kinds of other dishes. Even though it can be used raw, the best of gremolata is brought out by heat, which wakes up the garlic (and softens its pungency, too) and the natural oils in the lemon zest. Also in my freezer were some peeled prawns; not a year old, but nearing freezer burn.It is still asparagus time, so the addition of a few spears cut into strips are an option here. However, new season courgettes, especially pale or striped varieties with dense, creamy flesh, work particularly well with prawns and gremolata. While the strips of courgette don’t have to be as slim as strings of pasta, they should be of similar proportions, so they mix well with the spaghetti (if you have one, a wired puntarelle cutter or electric spiraliser would be helpful here, otherwise just stick to a good sharp knife).As ever, the pasta cooking water that clings to the strings of spaghetti (which are also full of starch) is a helpful ingredient, because it combines with the oil to give the sauce a creamy consistency and brings everything together. I find two forked or wooden spoons are the best tools to toss thoroughly, or simply jolt the pan – remember, you are waking up the garlic, parsley and lemon zest, too, so the tossing should be energetic. Make sure the prawns and courgettes are evenly distributed, then serve with more olive oil on top.Spaghetti with prawns, courgettes and gremolataServes4600g courgettes1 smallgarlic clove, peeledHandfulflat-leaf parsleyFinely grated zest of1 large unwaxed lemonSalt1 onion, peeled and finely diced4-6 tbspolive oil,plus extra for serving300–400g small peeled prawns(cooked or uncooked)400-500g spaghettiTop and tail the courgettes, then cut them into long, thin strips. Prepare the gremolata by very finely mincing the garlic with the parsley, then mix in the lemon zest.Bring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta. Working in a large frying pan, fry the onion and a pinch of salt in the olive oil until the onion starts to soften. Add the courgettes and fry until both are soft and floppy.Meanwhile, salt the boiling water, drop in the spaghetti, then set a timer. Keep a close eye on the timings; a minute before the pasta is ready to come out, add the prawns and gremolada to the courgettes (if the prawns are cooked, they will need just seconds; if they are raw, they will need a minute or so).Lift the spaghetti directly into the courgette pan with a little of its cooking water clinging to the strands, then toss thoroughly. Serve with little more olive oil on top.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkSeafoodShellfishPastaVegetablesSpring food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
