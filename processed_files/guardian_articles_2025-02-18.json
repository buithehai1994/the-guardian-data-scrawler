No Ukrainian or European officials were present at the meeting.Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump dismissed Ukrainian concerns about being excluded from the talks and, astonishingly, seemed to imply that Kyiv was to blame for the war.He said: “Today I heard, ‘Oh, we weren’t invited’. Well, you’ve been there for three years. You should have ended it three years [ago] – you should have never started it. You could have made a deal.”The president complained that he had seen no accounting of how US military aid is being spent and conspicuously avoided voicing support for Zelenskyy.“I think I have the power to end this war,” he said.After the talks at Diriyah Palace in Riyadh, the most extensive negotiations between the two countries in three years, the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, said agreement had been made to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks and to explore “opportunities which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine”.It marked a dramatic break with the Biden administration’s efforts to isolate Moscow. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Putin’s chief foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, were photographed sitting across from Rubio, who attended the talks alongside the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East.Rubio said an end to the Ukraine conflict must be acceptable to all involved, including Ukraine, Europe and Russia, and that Washington’s European allies had been consulted.Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, tweeted a message to Rubio: “Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps. By working together with the US, we can achieve a just and lasting peace – on Ukraine’s terms.”The talks in the Saudi capital, however, underscored the rapid pace of US efforts to halt the conflict, raising alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, where officials met on Monday to discuss the possibility of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine.Lavrov rejected the prospect of such a move on Tuesday. He said the deployment of Nato member troops in Ukraine, even if they were operating under a different flag, was unacceptable to Moscow. Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of western boots in Ukraine.Trump and Vance have smashed the old order – how should Europe respond? | Nathalie Tocci, Yanis Varoufakis and othersRead more“We explained to our colleagues today what President Putin has repeatedly stressed: that the expansion of Nato, the absorption of Ukraine by the North Atlantic alliance, is a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation, a direct threat to our sovereignty,” Lavrov said.He also rejected a US proposal that Russia and Ukraine halt strikes on each other’s energy infrastructure, falsely claiming that Russia had never endangered Ukraine’s civilian energy supply system.Shortly after the meeting, Ushakov said the talks had gone well, with both sides agreeing that negotiators would discuss Ukraine. He said a potential Putin-Trump summit had been discussed, but that it was unlikely to happen next week.Ukrainian officials were not invited to the talks. During a visit to Ankara, where he held talks with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid his country would not accept the results of talks on how to end the war with Russia that were held “behind Ukraine’s back”.The Ukrainian president told reporters no decision could be made without Kyiv on how to end the war, and that he would always reject Putin’s “ultimatums”.View image in fullscreenRecep Tayyip Erdoğan (right) welcomes Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the presidential complex in Ankara.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe discussions in Riyadh mark the first high-level attempt to negotiate an end to Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since the war’s early days, when talks collapsed over the Russian president’s demands.Despite the flurry of diplomacy, little is known about Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine or Russia’s willingness to engage, and Tuesday’s meeting offered few new clues.Both sides issued carefully worded statements when the talks concluded. Rubio said the meeting was “the first step of a long and difficult journey”, adding: “An end to the Ukraine conflict must be acceptable to all involved, including Ukraine, Europe and Russia.”Waltz said: “This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end as we’ve seen in the past.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even before the meeting began, the US made several significant concessions to Putin, indicating that Ukraine would have to abandon its Nato ambitions and accept territorial losses.Putin has not commented publicly on the Saudi talks but told Trump last week during a phone call that Russia wanted to “settle the reasons for the conflict”. Some observers believe this suggests Russia may not limit its focus to Ukraine and may instead seek to reshape European security more broadly.Moscow’s demands could resemble those it issued on the eve of its full-scale invasion in 2022: that Ukraine adopt a neutral status and that Nato halts the deployment of weapons to member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began expanding to include former communist nations. This would affect much of eastern Europe including Poland and the Baltic states – Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.After the talks, Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, issued what appeared to be new conditions for peace, saying Russia was demanding “not just a pledge to deny Ukraine Nato membership but the annulment of the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration which promised Kyiv eventual membership without a specific timeline”.Putin has previously insisted that Ukraine drastically reduce its military forces, which many in Ukraine fear would leave it vulnerable to future Russian attacks.In Riyadh, Russia was also expected to leverage discussions on a potential Ukraine settlement to push for relief from western sanctions, which have placed significant strain on its economy.A diagram annotating politicians from the US, Saudi Arabia and RussiaLeading Moscow’s economic negotiations is Dmitriev, the 49-year-old head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and a close friend of Putin’s daughter. A former investment banker, Dmitriev has played a key role in Russia’s outreach to international investors.“US oil majors have done very well in Russia,” Dmitriev said in a brief interview on Tuesday before the talks began, suggesting that American companies could come back to Russia. “We believe that at some point they will return – why would they pass up the opportunities Russia has provided for access to its natural resources?”Tuesday’s talks in Riyadh offered Saudi Arabia and its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, an opportunity to assert themselves on the world stage.Once labelled a pariah by Biden over the 2018 killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi leader has emerged as a key intermediary in discussions between Russia and the US.The latest US diplomatic push has left Kyiv and key allies scrambling to secure a seat at the table, fearing Washington and Moscow could move forward with a deal that sidelined their interests. In response, France convened an emergency meeting of EU nations and the UK on Monday to coordinate a response.Emmanuel Macron announced after the meeting that he had spoken to Trump and Zelenskyy. “We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” Macron wrote on X.Still, the security talks in Paris yielded no concrete measures, as European leaders struggled to present a united front amid divisions over the deployment of troops to Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyRussiaMarco RubioTrump administrationVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Experts are blaming this on an alarming mix of poor diet, mass inactivity and soaring obesity.The average annual growth in life expectancy across the continent fell from 0.23 years between 1990 and 2011 to 0.15 years between 2011 and 2019, according to researchpublished in the Lancet Public Health journal. Of the 20 countries studied, every one apart from Norway saw life expectancy growth fall.England suffered the largest decline in life expectancy improvement, with a fall in average annual improvement of 0.18 years, from 0.25 between 1990 and 2011 to 0.07 between 2011 and 2019.The second slowdown of life expectancy growth in Europe was in Northern Ireland (reducing by 0.16 years), followed by Wales and Scotland (both falling by 0.15 years).Sarah Price,NHSEngland’s director of public health, said:“This important study reinforces that prevention is the cornerstone of a healthier society, and is exactly why it will be such a key part of the 10-year health plan which we are working with [the] government on.“The slowdown in life expectancy improvements, particularly due to cardiovascular disease and cancer, highlights the urgent need for stronger action on the root causes – poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity.”The NHS helped hundreds of thousands of people lose weight through its12-week digital weight management programme, Price said. “However, more action is needed across society because we cannot treat our way out of the obesity crisis, and we need to stem it at source.”The study, led by the University of East Anglia, examined changes in life expectancy in 20 European countries from 1990 to 2021.During the Covid pandemic between 2019 and 2021, all countries except Ireland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Belgium experienced a decline in life expectancy, with Greece and England experiencing the largest falls.Life expectancy growth from 1990 to 2011 were attributable to improvements in countries tackling the risk factors for heart disease and cancer.However, deaths due to heart disease were a key driver of the slowdown in life expectancy growth from 2011 to 2019, coinciding with increasing BMI levels and high exposure to poor diets and low physical activity.The countries that best maintained gains in life expectancy after 2011, namely Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and Belgium, maintained or boosted life expectancy even during the pandemic.Researchers said that the countries which “best maintained” improvements in life expectancy had fewer heart disease and cancer deaths.They said the findings highlighted the need for stronger government policies to tackle obesity and increase physical activity levels.Lead researcher Prof Nicholas Steel, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School, said: “Advances in public health and medicine in the 20th century meant that life expectancy in Europe improved year after year, but this is no longer the case.“We found that deaths from cardiovascular diseases were the primary driver of the reduction in life expectancy improvements between 2011-19. Unsurprisingly, the Covid pandemic was responsible for decreases in life expectancy seen between 2019-21.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These trends are decades long – there isn’t a quick fix.“This is about the big, long-term population protections from risk – so engaging with the food industry to improve our national diet to make it easier for people to eat healthier food and make it easier for people to move a little bit in our day-to-day lives.”However, Steel said Europe had “not yet reached a natural longevity ceiling”.“Life expectancy for older people in many countries is still improving, showing that we have not yet reached a natural longevity ceiling. Life expectancy mainly reflects mortality at younger ages, where we have lots of scope for reducing harmful risks and preventing early deaths.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care said it had inherited a broken NHS, with underfunded, under-resourced public health services, but added that it was committed “to ensuring people live well for longer”.Its upcoming 10-year health plan would “shift the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention”, a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsNHSEuropeHealthUniversitiesObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

By Tuesday afternoon, it had grown to at least 20 metres, which led to water supplies being cut off and a garden being swallowed up.Surrey county council has declared a major incident and local people have been urged to avoid the area while repair work is being carried out.Police evacuated a number of properties and a 100-metre cordon was put in place.The force advised people living in William Way, Godstone, “to get out as quickly as possible” early on Tuesday morning because of fears that exposed cables might cause an explosion.Residents described the evacuation scenes as “terrifying”, with one person who moved in less than a week ago saying that he had been forced to sleep in his car.“I don’t know what’s to come from here, no one can give me any info. They said it could be up to a week before we’re back in. I don’t think they know what state the mains gas and electric’s in, so it was a risk of explosion, fire, collapse,” Josh Neametoldthe BBC.View image in fullscreenThe scene in Godstone after a sinkhole appeared on Monday night.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA“My life’s still in boxes, I hadn’t even unpacked from the house move.

They were shocked when they returned to find the back garden of their property had been swallowed by the sinkhole.“We’re just terrified. We have to figure out where to live now. Next week school is going back and we have to find somewhere close by,” he said.Police confirmed that a few buildings had been evacuated as a precaution, stating that road works were likely to remain in place for a while.Nicola and Damian Styles, 46 and 44, said they were woken up by police knocking on their door at about half-past midnight on Tuesday, who told them to evacuate their home because there was a risk of a gas explosion.The couple came back to their home at about midday to pick up some items but later decided to stay at their address.Asked whether they believe they will have to evacuate again, Styles said: “This is the thing now: we don’t know. And we’re kind of playing it by chance at the moment.“They said that they’re trying their best but this thing is still eroding away because it’s getting bigger, so …”SES Water saidits engineers were working to fix a burst main water pipe caused by the sinkhole and were distributing bottled water to residents.A spokesperson for Surrey Highways advised people to avoid the area.Explore more on these topicsSurreySinkholesnewsShareReuse this content"

If this law was broken, the candidate would be subject to investigation by the police and prosecution by an electoral court.The issue is seen as particularly urgent in Wales becausechanges to the voting system at next year’s Senedd electionsand an increased size of parliament are likely to make the campaign particularly febrile, with Reform UK having a good chance of winning seats.Hannah Blythyn, the chair of the committee, said toughening rules for Senedd members and candidates was critical at a time when public trust in institutions was low.She said: “People should be able to trust those who represent them. Our report is putting forward recommendations to radically enhance our rules and make it clear to anyone who wants to hold public office that deliberately deceiving is not acceptable.”Sam Fowles, the director of theInstitute for Constitutional and Democratic Research, said: “This report is a rejection of the counsels of doom which say that demanding politicians are honest is just too difficult.“We have professional regulations which require other professions to act honestly. We need to hold politicians to the same professional standards we expect from others.”Jennifer Nadel, a co-director of the thinktank Compassion in Politics, said: “This report puts Wales firmly at the forefront of the battle against political deception. However, the report falls short of calling for serving members to be subject to criminal sanction, instead relying on beefing up existing standards mechanisms. We would like to see it go further in this respect. The Senedd is acting and we now call on Westminster to follow suit.”A Welsh government spokesperson said it would consider the findings and recommendations before responding formally.Explore more on these topicsWelsh politicsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The once-obscure devices experienced a surge in popularity in Europe after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring.“The very strong growth that appeared in 2022 and 2023 – war-related and gas price-related – didn’t have a foundation in robust policy,” said Paul Kenny, director general of the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA).He added: “One would think in Europe – with the enemy at the gates, and energy security and energy sovereignty so important in political minds – our policymakers would take the sort of actions that society needs.”Graph showing how heat pump sales fell in almost all of Europe in 2024The EHPA said the fall in sales in 2024 was driven by political uncertainty and changes to support schemes in a handful of key markets, as well as a sluggish economy leading to an overall drop in heating installations.Analysts said the shift could be a rebound effect after two unusually good years for the industry but struggled to explain the scale of the drop. Two million heat pumps were sold in 2024 – the same as in 2021 – despite high gas prices and security fears continuing to plague Europe.“It’s just surprising given that the gas crisis isn’t over,” said Jess Ralston from theEnergyand Climate Intelligence Unit, a thinktank. “It’s really uncertain times, and a slowdown in heat pumps isn’t going to do any good for energy security.”She added: “Unless we start to move to heat pumps, we’re just going to see more volatility – in household bills as well as wholesale gas prices.”Heat pumps cost more upfront than gas boilers but are usually cheaper to run, and result in fewer societal costs from dirty air and violent weather. The International Energy Agency’sroadmapto greening the economy as fast as world leaders have promised shows the share of heat pumps in global sales of heating equipment soaring from 10% in 2022 to 50% in 2026.In markets such asGermanyand theUK, the devices have also been the focus of intense disinformation campaigns that authorities are only starting to challenge.The slump has also hit manufacturers. The EHPA said the heat pump sector has invested billions in additional capacity since the start of the war but “much of this capacity now lies idle”. It estimated at least 4,000 jobs have been cut, and a further 6,000 workers face reduced hours or other impacts.It called on the European Commission and national governments to put heat pumps at the centre of the clean industrial deal next week, which seeks to align the EU’s climate, competitiveness and geopolitics goals.Kenny said the fall in sales was a “lost opportunity” for Europe. “Without the heat pump, we don’t get away from Russian gas, or American gas, or anyone else’s gas.”Explore more on these topicsHeat pumpsEnergyEnergy efficiencyEthical and green livingUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His general audience on Wednesday has also been cancelled.Francis had part of his lung removed in his early 20s while training to be a priest in his native Argentina.Despite his hospitalisation, the pope has maintained his nightly routine since 9 October 2023 of telephone calls to the Holy Family church in Gaza.“He was tired but had a clear voice,” Father Gabriel Romanelli told the Italian press after Monday night’s call. “He asked how we were and thanked us with prayers. At the end of the call he gave us his blessing.”The pope, who has suffered ill health in recent years, was also admitted to hospital in March 2023 for what was initially said to be bronchitis but later diagnosed as pneumonia. He was readmitted to the Gemelli for health checks in June that year and again in February 2024 after suffering from what he said was “a bit of a cold”.He also underwent a colon operation in June 2021.The pope has often been seen in a wheelchair or with a walking stick as a result of a sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisHealthVaticanCatholicismItalyChristianityEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The X owner also latercalled her a “rape genocide apologist”.The prime minister suggested thata line has been crossedand that Musk’s comments had led to threats against the minister.Sentencing Bennett to 28 weeks in prison, District Judge Smith said the email had caused Phillips “great distress”.He said: “[She] was concerned for your potential to escalate or to encourage others for violence against her, having in her mind the murder of her colleague Jo Cox.”Bennett also sent racist and offensive emails to SirSadiq Khan, the mayor of London, in February 2024 and Matt Twist, an assistant commissioner at the Met police, in April 2024.The court heard that Bennett’s messages had started after he became “caught up” in online rightwing propaganda during the pandemic.The judge said the email to Khan “purposely sought to disparage, insult and offend him based on his ethnicity and Asian heritage”.He added: “The contents of your communications to all three was utterly deplorable, foul and abusive. Saturated in hate and intolerance and shamelessly racist and offensive.“Your angry, poisonous and hateful rhetoric discloses the real disdain you held for ethnic minorities, targeting especially Muslims and immigrants in your abusive tirades.”For Bennett, Caroline Salvatore said her client had no previous convictions and he presented as being neurodivergent and “largely socially isolated”.She said: “During Covid, he became exposed to rightwing propaganda and became caught up in it. He was encouraged to become incensed at various issues and he found their phrases became part of his vocabulary.”She said he had not acted until after his father died in 2023, which was a “triggering event”, with his mother, who he lives with, coming to rely on him. “He became even more withdrawn and started to live his life online, one website led to another, and things got worse and worse for him.”She added that he had been “genuinely motivated by the perceived incompetence of the people he sent emails [to]” but he accepted he was trying to be offensive and did “realise how he was wrong”.Bennett pleaded guilty to four counts of sending malicious communications and one of using a public communication network to send offensive emails.Appearing for Phillips, Hannah Cotton said the emails featured “serious racist abuse towards politicians” while the language used in the emails to Twist was “highly offensive”, with Bennett calling him a “rat willing to engage in strong-arm tactics against white English patriots”.She asked for restraining orders to be put in place for five years, which was granted by the judge.Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseJess PhillipsCrimeDevonMetropolitan policeSadiq KhanElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

I’m thinking back to us all rehearsing in my bedroom in Stanley Road, Woking.“To all the pubs and clubs we played at as kids, to eventually making a record. What a journey. We went far beyond our dreams and what we made stands the test of time. My deepest sympathy to all family and friends.”Buckler featured on The Jam’s six studio albums, including In the City (1977), All Mod Cons (1978) and Sound Affects (1980).View image in fullscreenThe Jam perform on stage at the Royal College of Art in London in 1977.Photograph: Erica Echenberg/RedfernsThe Jam achieved four UK number one singles and one UK number one album.The band split in 1982 and never fully reunited, but Foxton and Buckler subsequently played together on a number of occasions as From The Jam while Weller continued his career with the Style Council and as a solo artist.Foxton wrote on social media: “I was shocked and devastated to hear the very sad news today. Rick was a good guy and a great drummer whose innovative drum patterns helped shape our songs.“I’m glad we had the chance to work together as much as we did. My thoughts are with Leslie and his family at this very difficult time.”Buckler was due to embark on a Q&A tour of the UK later this year entitled A Night of Memories and Music, which was recently postponed due to his health.The drummer lived with his wife, with whom he had two children, Jason and Holly.Following his time in The Jam, he wrote a number of books and went into the furniture design and restoration industry.His books included a number on the history of The Jam and his autobiography, That’s Entertainment: My Life in The Jam, which was published in 2015.Explore more on these topicsCulturePaul WellerSurreynewsShareReuse this content"

Entire families gathered outside, hoping for a spot on an airlift, and more than 180 people in the crowd were killed in an Islamic State-led suicide attack.An aid worker, Zemari Ahmadi,was later erroneously struck by an American dronetwo miles away, killing him and nine others – including seven children, one only two years old.But as all this unfurled, email inboxes in Whitehall were clogged with a separate issue: dogs and cats.The extent of this fixation can be revealed for the first time after hundreds of emails were released as part of an employment tribunal case brought by Josie Stewart, following her dismissal from the Foreign Office (FCDO) after she blew the whistle on a catalogue of failures about the Kabul withdrawal.View image in fullscreenJosie Stewart claimed she spoke to the BBC in the public interest to corroborate another FCDO whistleblower’s account of the chaotic withdrawal.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAs part of her successful case against unfair dismissal, which on Tuesday was upheld by a panel of three judges, hundreds of secret and sensitive documents were disclosed during the hearing.It was no surprise that government lawyers tried to hold the case behind closed doors, as it lifted the lid on questionable Whitehall decision-making.Government emails about the animal charity Nowzad and its media-savvy founder,Pen Farthing, a former marine, ran to more than 250 pages.Stewart, who worked in the Afghanistan crisis team, lost her job after her security clearance was removed when a BBC journalist mistakenly revealed she was the source of leaked emails.Stewart claimed she spoke to the BBC in the public interest to corroborate another FCDO whistleblower’s account of the chaotic withdrawal after his version of events was challenged by politicians and senior civil servants. She said she leaked emails, which suggestedBoris Johnsonwas involved in fast-tracking Nowzad for evacuation, to show the government’s priorities were warped after the then prime minister dismissed the claim as “total nonsense”.Emails disclosed in Stewart’s case raise fresh doubts about Johnson’s assertion. They also reveal there was opposition across Whitehall to giving any special treatment to Farthing’s animals and staff.An email from a senior environment official on 23 August 2021 referenced press reporting of “the prime minister’s decision to grant visas to Nowzad staff”, without correction. It also noted the decision came with a “significant risk of critical comparison with the government’s approach to allowing Afghans to seek refuge in the UK”.On the same day a No 10 email urged the Ministry of Defence to shut down press reports that the department was blocking Nowzad from charting a private flight from Kabul.At 1.33am on 25 August the then defence secretary, Ben Wallace, tweeted thatFarthing’s staff had been cleared for evacuation, and that “if he arrives with his animals we will seek a slot for his plane”, but that “no one has the right in this humanitarian crisis to jump the queue”.Hours later at 9.18am, Helen Bower-Easton, the then FCDO communications director, said Wallace’s tweets had caused a flap in Downing Street. Under the subject line “URGENT – Pen Farthing & dogs” she wrote: “Major No 10 comms concerns about Def Sec commitment overnight that we will get the Nowzad dogs out – don’t want to look like we are prioritising animals over people.”View image in fullscreenPen Farthing, the founder of Nowzad. He managed to leave Kabul with the animals onboard a flight, and the charity’s staff later fled Afghanistan by road.Photograph: Omar Sobhani/ReutersThis sparked a long email chain. At 9.25am Lesley Craig, the then head of the Pakistan and Afghanistan department at the FCDO, replied saying: “Hopefully we’re not looking to prioritise animals over people at risk from the Taliban.”An official from the MoD emailed at 10.21am saying of Farthing “If he turns up with the dogs then the dogs are not coming.”Philip Hall, who was in charge of the FCDO’s evacuation crisis centre, said Nowzad staff were not considered vulnerable enough to qualify for evacuation. At 10.28am he emailed: “As SRO [senior responsible officer] for the LOTR [Leave outside the rules] scheme I consider they are not with the agreed priority cohorts, including extreme vulnerability.”But at 11.22am Hall added: “It is open to the PM to instruct that Nowzad should now be called forward, despite not being within the criteria.”At this point there is confirmation that No 10 was asked to make a decision on Nowzad by the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the then national security adviser, Stephen Lovegrove.After speaking to her boss, Rachel King, who was Raab’s deputy principal private secretary, said: “Nowzad are in the cohorts approved by ministers as candidates for LOTR.”Nigel Casey, who was the government’s special representative on Afghanistan, then intervened to confirm Downing Street had been asked to decide on prioritising Nowzad.Casey would later tell a committee of MPs that the idea Johnson was involved in the decision was based on a faulty assumption by a senior official. He also claimed he had searched his emails and foundnothing of relevance on the Nowzad issue.View image in fullscreenAfghans struggle to reach the foreign forces to show their credentials to flee the country outside Kabul airport in August 2021.Photograph: Akhter Gulfam/EPABut there was a relevant email. At 11.15am he messaged King to say Lovegrove was asked to “seek clear guidance for us from No10 asap on what they would like us to do. Stephen agreed to pursue this urgently.”Shortly after, Lovegrove informed colleagues that Nowzad’s staff would be given priority after all, according to a 11.50am email from Thomas Drew, the FCDO’s then director general of defence and security.Hall, now, overruled, replied: “We’ll action this. There are 68 Afghan national in the Pen Farthing/Nowzad group. We shall security clear them with UKVI/Home Office, then issue Calls Forward.”At 12.09pm the FCDO crisis team was told: “The prime minister has approved the Nowzad staff to be called forward.”Later that day a sceptical Hall sought clarification on whether animals would be allowed on the flight: He wrote: “I am not SRO for animals … you must ask MOD whether they can carry animals, and if so, whether they would be putting animals’ lives over people’s lives. Tom Drew may then need to liaise with Stephen Lovegrove to establish the scope of the PM’s decision. (There’s a common sense answer, of course.)”It was not until 28 August that Farthing confirmed to the FCDO officials that a flight with animals had safely left Kabul, but the staff who had been cleared for evacuation did not make the flight. They arrived later in the UK after fleeing Afghanistan by road.Explore more on these topicsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeForeign policyCivil serviceAfghanistanBoris JohnsonEmployment tribunalsSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for the owner of Nina’s House, which is covered with unusual and striking cork insulation panels, it is not only a common occurrence but is welcomed.The conversations may start with curiosity but much of the time lead to lengthy, passionate discussions on how to make homes more energy efficient, says the house’s owner, Nina Woodcroft. “We are new to the neighbourhood and it has been a really nice way to engage with our new community. A lot of delivery drivers will be like: ‘What’s this?’, and we’ll have a chat for 10 minutes about cork, you know, instead of just like this transactional, thank you, bye.”Woodcroft and her family moved into their home in south Tottenham, London, at the end of 2023 and it has now been nominated for a number of awards includingDon’t Move, ImproveandRIBA London. The house was a “leaky” 1970s property built originally as a clergy house. Woodcroft, who runs the design company Nina+Co, decided that instead of an extension they would design a renovation, with the help of architects ROAR, to transform it into an energy-efficient, fossil fuel-free, cosy family home.View image in fullscreenTo maximise the pump’s efficiency the radiators downstairs were stripped out and replaced with underfloor heating.Photograph: French+Tye“Our architect was saying that it was unusual the way we’ve decided to spend our budget. That most clients would be like, well let’s do a loft conversion, let’s add another floor or let’s do a side return, but the motivator for us was to make what we have already future proof and really efficient,” says Woodcroft.View image in fullscreenNina Woodcroft hopes her renovation will inspire others to be more conscious of the types of materials used in property design.Photograph: French+TyeAfter removing the gas supply entirely, Woodcroft and her team installed an air source heat pump in the front garden. To maximise the pump’s efficiency the radiators downstairs were stripped out and replaced with underfloor heating. Sheep wool, wood fibre and a recycled plastic fleece, with cork granules, were used to insulate the home internally. The annual energy bill is about £1,088, significantly belowthe national average, with only electricity used.They chose dark expanded cork, an increasinglypopular building material, to cover the exterior of the house because of its insulating properties, sustainability as a material, and aesthetic appeal.“The way that it’s manufactured is cork granules, bits of the bark of the cork oak tree are heated and pressed into a panel at the same time. Something is released called suberin, a natural substance as it’s heated, which is what sticks those cork granules together. So there is no added binder. And that’s what makes that product really natural,” says Woodcroft.The inside of the property, designed with running children in mind, is as thought through as the property’s exterior, with joinery made from local and reclaimed timbers, kitchen countertops constructed from recycled plastic and a kitchen island formed from aLondonplane tree that was felled in Soho Square by Westminster council.“I feel grounded and connected in this house because of the natural materials I think. It’s warm underfoot, which my feet really appreciate. The house feels enveloping and calming, like a little retreat from the busy world outside,” says Woodcroft.The design company was born out of Woodcroft’s frustration with the lack of care for the environmental impact of materials used in the design industry. Nina’s House is the latest in a string of projects by Nina+Co to transform property interiors into sensual, textured spaces with a minimal environmental impact, such as the interiors for the restaurant Silo in Hackney Wick, east London, the world’s first zero-waste restaurant and winner of a Michelin green star. The Silo design used offcuts of timber, foraged seaweed, mycelium (a biodegradable fungal material), and crushed glass bottles.View image in fullscreen‘A lot of delivery drivers will be like: “What’s this?”, and we’ll have a chat for 10 minutes about cork,’ says Woodcroft.Photograph: French+TyeWoodcroft says: “I am kind of always thinking about what life this [material] is going to have next: a restaurant, a shop, a home … it will have a certain lifespan that’s actually not very long in the grand scheme of things of the planet. And so I’m always trying to think what’s the next life of this and how to retain longevity and value in something.”She hopes her renovation will inspire others to be more conscious of the types of materials used in property design and take small steps to make their homes more sustainable and energy efficient.“I’m really up for sharing knowledge with people … Not everyone will have the financial resources to do a project like this, or the time and the energy because they’re busy with work and just need to pick a floor … but if it can inspire just doing one little thing, swap out one material, that would be amazing.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy efficiencyHousingLondonEthical and green livingEnergyCommunitiesArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whether they will be given a seat at the table before lines are drawn is far from clear. For now, they must wonder if they are among the “irritants” in US-Russia relations referred to by the US state department.The US national security adviser, Michael Waltz, insisted the Ukrainians and Europeans had been – and would be – regularly consulted in their absence. The secretary of state,Marco Rubio, said any agreement about Ukraine would have to be acceptable to “everyone involved”.Rubio is the most traditional foreign policy Republican in the Trump team, and he seemed anxious throughout. Notably, the former Florida senator did not repeat pledges he had madetwo days earlier in Jerusalem, that Ukraine and Europe would have to be at the table for any substantive talks, and that a settlement would respect Ukrainian sovereignty.When asked in Riyadh on Tuesday about Kyiv and Europe’s sense of being sidelined, the secretary of state retorted that “the world should be thanking President Trump” for getting the peace process this far.In a press briefing after the meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Rubio and Waltz repeated the same mantra eight times between them, that President Trump was the only person capable of leading the way to a peace deal.Altogether, they invoked Trump’s name 18 times, fearful perhaps that they might end up on the White House television in a clip in which the president was not mentioned.Rubio insisted that any enduring peace deal would have to be acceptable to the warring sides, but Trump’s rhetoric thus far raises questions over whether he shares that outlook. He has raised the prospect that ultimately, once everything has been said and done, Ukraine could end up being Russian.The culmination of the Riyadh process, the US delegation made clear, will be a summit encounter between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, two leaders who share an imperial bent that leans towards great power spheres of influence.It will not be the first time superpowers meet in the Middle East to divide a European state. The Tehran Conference in 1943 put a line right through eastern Europe. In Riyadh, Trump will take the Roosevelt role and Putin will play Stalin. It is long past the time when there was a place for a Churchill. Britain has joined the anxious European voices a long way offstage.To the Ukrainians, and many Europeans, this does not feel like Tehran. They fear a new Munich, with the gilded chambers and acres of polished marble of the Diriyah Palace auditioning for the role of a latter-day Führerbau, the venue in September 1938 for the betrayal and carve-up of Czechoslovakia.In Munich, the Czechoslovak delegation were kept in an adjoining room to await details of when and how they would surrender the Sudetenland to Hitler. On Tuesday, the Ukrainians were not even in the same country. Volodymyr Zelenskyy was nervously waiting for news in Turkey. He is due inSaudi Arabianext month to be briefed by the royal court and make his feelings clear.As the chairs were being put away and the floors mopped in the Diriyah Palace, a new paradigm seemed to be coming into focus, one that was familiar from the 19th century and the cold war: great powers will make the decisions, while lesser states will anxiously wait for the big boys’ meetings to finish, and then call Riyadh to find out what has been decided.In this back-to-the-future world, Russia is fully restored to the top table, its status assured by the size of its nuclear arsenal. Lavrov was delighted with the outcome of Tuesday’s meeting, noting the two sides “did not just listen to each other, but heard each other”. He predicted that follow-on talks would begin “as soon as possible”.All involved had fulsome thanks for the hosts. Riyadh’s advantage as a venue is the zero risk of protests. The Diriyah Palace is close to the Ritz Carlton, where many of the kingdom’s princes and other potential rivals weredetained and beatenwhen Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seized a monopoly of power in 2017.As a broker to the Ukraine and Israel-Palestinian talks, the prince has come a long way from his spell as a pariah after the 2018 murder and dismemberment of the dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul – a murderUS intelligence concludedwas approved by the crown prince.Bin Salman emerged on Tuesday as the consigliere and hotelier to the mighty, there as a facilitator rather than dealmaker, but very much on the inside, unlike Europe. In the age of Trump, the Gulf monarchy takes precedence above Washington’s old democratic allies, even in European matters.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsSaudi ArabiaEuropean UnionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Later, during the lovelorn belter The Greatest, Eilish soars on a pedestal far into the air: a glorious new-age leader exorcising her heartache – and ours – to the firmament.View image in fullscreen‘The macabre streak which underscored much of her debut record snakes through the show.’Photograph: Henry HwuThe sheer rapture feels new for an artist who has often spoken about the tolls of performing. “I didn’t realise that I could make touring enjoyable,” Eilish said in aVogue profilelast year. “I just was very lonely for many years, and I’m not interested in that any more. I want to enjoy the show.”Enjoy she does. Frequently, she breaks into a sprint around her figure eight stage, circling her live band in infinite loops. This is her first tour without her brother and longtime producer, Finneas, though his absence – with apologies – is hardly noticeable. Eilish swerves, vaults and ducks between hyaline screens that partially obscure her figure, resisting the glare of the spotlight. At times she’s a blur of splayed limbs – and then she picks up the camera, her face suddenly gargantuan and duplicated around the stadium.It’s a canny cat-and-mouse game and a nod to the themes she has written about her entire career: the trapdoors of visibility, the futile dream of privacy. And her star has only continued to rise since she was last in Australia in 2022. Her doleful Barbie contribution What Was I Made For? made her the youngest person to win two Oscars (after her first victory for the Bond theme No Time to Die). Then came the blockbuster Birds of a Feather, a song about a self-immolating crush that now has more than 2bn streams on Spotify.View image in fullscreen‘This is a tour that makes room for evolution.’Photograph: Henry HwuAs expected, both those tracks are lodestones on the setlist, rousing a crowd that’s otherwise somewhat subdued – or “polite”, as Eilish puts it euphemistically. (It’s a Tuesday night; they might be forgiven.) Even so, there’s no resisting the bawdy allure of Lunch, Eilish’s sapphic provocation which has the entire audience – hilariously – chanting each come-on at full volume. Equally invigorating is her verse on the Charli xcx collaboration Guess: a lascivious ode to lacy undergarments that turns the arena into a rave worthy of its colossal, squelching bass.Throughout, there are hints of Eilish’s earlier trademarks. The macabre streak which underscored much of her debut record snakes through the show: the flash of a slithering alligator on screen, or the menacing mosquito synths of her early single Bury a Friend, amplified with literal pyrotechnics on stage.But this is a tour that makes room for evolution. Eilish’s delivery on Guess – a seductive deadpan – is a far cry from the gauzy whisper on which she made her name. Elsewhere, on Hit Me Hard and Soft closer Blue, she snarls in a sinister baritone; halfway through L’Amour De Ma Vie, a poison pen letter to a former flame, Eilish stretches her voice through Auto-Tune, elasticated and crackling over a dance breakdown.These tracks feel as stochastic as the weather. They enter noiselessly, then – buoyed by a rapid gust – they shudder and skyrocket. When you’ve already hit the top, you just keep going.Billie Eilish is performing in Brisbane until 22 February, Sydney 24-28 February and Melbourne 4-8 MarchExplore more on these topicsBillie EilishPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

His ease and aptitude on stage is evident here yet he is still a revelation, lighting up this play about a king’s misrule and downfall. As the less performed opening of Shakespeare’s history quartet of “Henriads”, it is an exploration of power, reflecting on the superannuated concept of a king’s divine rule and its unseating after a rebellion by exiled cousin, Henry Bullingbrook.Nicholas Hytner, as director, smooths away most of the play’s creakiness with a pared-down production that has the pace and intrigue of a thriller. It is muscular in its look and Bailey singularly shines, his luminosity putting the others slightly in the shade.He is a whimsical monarch, puffed up and explosive in his tempers, snorting cocaine and, with a shrug, signing over John of Gaunt’s wealth to himself on his uncle’s deathbed. Yet still you feel for him as he speaks of his absolute, divine entitlement, even as Bullingbrook aims his artillery gun at him. In his panicked, deposed state, he is a self-mythologiser – Jesus to Bullingbrook’s Judas.View image in fullscreenRoyal kiss … Olivia Popica as Queen Isabel and Bailey in Richard II.Photograph: Manuel HarlanA play with abundant beauty to its verse (“This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,” sighs the ailing Gaunt, played efficiently by Martin Carroll), its lyricism becomes slightly muted, though never by Bailey, whose words glitter with feeling. Royce Pierreson’s Bullingbrook is a man of action but you do not get beneath his skin. Phoenix Di Sebastiani, as the allegedly traitorous Mowbray, is spirited,while Christopher Osikanlu Colquhoun as the Earl of Northumberland bears gravitas.A modern-dress production, men in suits look like bankers or accountants overseeing a corporate tyranny in Richard’s court, carrying paperwork and strategising in the bar.There is potent physicality at the start, amid the soulless bureaucracy. Richard squares up to others, nose to nose (you wonder if Bailey will go in for a kiss, likeDavid Tennant’s Richard in 2013) but there are only swaggering face-offs.Bob Crowley’s set design has a gestural opulence, with dangling chandeliers, but it stays minimal, with a single element such as a bed or table arrangement rising from below. The scene in which Richard is forced to renounce the throne is turned into a legal inquiry, he the defendant in a modern courtroom. Bruno Poet’s lighting creates much of the effects, such as the blasts of battle and the shadow of Richard’s prison bars at Pomfret Castle.View image in fullscreenAmanda Root as Duchess of York and Vinnie Heaven as the Duke of Aumerle in Richard II.Photograph: Manuel HarlanIf the grip of the first half of the production slightly loosens by the second, it remains engaging. The background music, coming on to heighten moments, has the generic sound of a film score, and the near empty stage now leaves the drama slightly more unmoored.The final image of Richard in a body bag is stark and powerful, setting the scene for the violence to come, with the crowned Henry swearing repentance.

Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianCancer rates have soared in Casalnuovo di Napoli, Italy, where burying or burning of waste has poisoned water and landByAngela Giuffridain Casalnuovo di NapoliTue 18 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTShareSoon after her son, Antonio, was born, Marzia Caccioppoli moved to Casalnuovo di Napoli, a town surrounded by countryside on the outskirts of Naples, to get away from the chaos and pollution of the sprawling southern Italian city.“Antonio was a strong and healthy boy, but I wanted him to grow up in a place where he could breathe clean air,” she said.The decision, however, proved to be fatal. It was 2003 and Caccioppoli had unwittingly moved to the so-called “triangle of death”, a vast area to the north-east of Naples where the mafia had established the lucrative business of burying, dumping and burning toxic waste, in turn poisoning swathes of farmland and drinking water.Rather than living the long and wholesome life his mother had dreamed of for him, Antonio was dead by the time he was 10.View image in fullscreenMarzia Caccioppoli: ‘Antonio was a strong and healthy boy, but I wanted him to grow up in a place where he could breathe clean air.’Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianThe illegal waste dumping, often carried out in cahoots with local police and politicians, was made public by a mafia turncoat in the late 1990s, around the time the early signs of its effects started to appear: first the farm animals born with deformities, then the anomalous rise in cancer cases, especially rare forms of the disease among children.But the deeply rooted racket, which over time has had devastating repercussions on health, the environment and livelihoods, has never been adequately dealt with, whether by local, regional or national authorities.That could be about to change. Caccioppoli was among the 41 plaintiffs who took a case against the Italian state to the European court of human rights, where judges recently ruled that despite long being aware of the issue, successive governments had failed in their duty to tackle the crisis. As a result, residents in the affected area, comprising 90 municipalities with a population of almost 3 million, had been denied their “right to life”.The Strasbourg-based court has givenItalytwo years to compile a strategy to resolve the issue, including setting up an independent monitoring mechanism and a public information platform.Caccioppoli got an inkling that something was amiss in Casalnuovo when she noticed more death announcements appearing on walls in the town.“They were people in their 30s or 40s,” she said. “Then there was the funeral of a child, who I later found out had cancer. I started to hear of more and more people getting cancer.”Antonio was nine when she noticed a spasm in his leg, and after visiting several medics, he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive brain cancer that most commonly affects older adults. He died in June 2013.Later that year the government enacted its first decree to address the matter. Called “the land of fires”, this was a plan to map and decontaminate the affected land.While some progress was made, toxic waste continued to be buried or burned. As cancer cases rose, some government ministers blamed it on the way of life of those living in the area.The link between the higher cancer rates and pollution was finally confirmed by Italy’s higher health institute (ISS) in 2021. An ISS report in 2023 showed the death rate in the area was 9% higher than in the rest of the Campania region, with people facing a much greater risk of dying from malignant tumours and respiratory diseases.Giorgia Meloni’s government is yet to officially respond to the ECHR ruling, but during a meeting with parliament’s eco-mafia committee last week, the environment minister, Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, acknowledged the state’s shortcomings in dealing with the issue while broaching the prospect of appointing a commissioner.There has been no official response from authorities in the Campania region either, although one councillor claimed the toxic waste dumps were “a thing of the past”.“The silence stinks more than the rubbish,” said Alessandro Cannavacciuolo, an environmental activist who was the first plaintiff to sign the complaint presented to the ECHR. “Half of my family has been decimated by cancer. I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone. The ruling is a strong development, but now we don’t want press releases, we want facts. We can’t afford to wait another 20 years.”View image in fullscreenAlessandro Cannavacciuolo: ‘We can’t afford to wait another 20 years.’Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianIt only takes a visit to the area to witness the scale of the problem.Mounds of rubbish line the roads on the outskirts of nearby Acerra, containing everything from construction waste, including asbestos, and plastic used in car production to electrical cables, clothes and general municipal waste. The stench of recently burned piles lingers.Antonietta Moccia, whose daughter, Miriam, 18, lives with a rare brain cancer diagnosed at the age of five, regularly monitors the situation. “Politicians say it’s being cleaned up, but it’s clearly not true,” she said. “If the environment is sick, then we are sick. Here, they truly profit from our blood.”View image in fullscreenAntonietta Moccia: ‘If the environment is sick, then we are sick.’Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianThe business is thought to have begun in the 1980s, when companies in the industrial north, or even Germany, would pay the Camorra mafia to dump their hazardous waste at a fraction of what it would have cost them to dispose of it legally.TheMafiaturncoat Carmine Schiavone revealed the illicit enterprise to the journalist Marilena Natale in 1997. “It continues to happen today, all they’ve done is change the route,” said Natale, who has had police protection since 2017 because of threats from the mafia. “For example, the waste is now being transported to Tunisia. It’s a vicious cycle.”View image in fullscreenMiriam Moccia, Antonietta’s daughter.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianValentina Centonze, Armando Corsini and Ambrogio Vallo were among the team of lawyers who came together for the case, working for free on behalf of the plaintiffs.All their families have been touched by cancer, while Vallo takes a barrage of medication each day for a brain tumour.Centonze said: “The state not only failed to resolve the problem, but also omitted to provide knowledge and information [to the public] about the phenomenon – this is another important fact of the ruling.”The issue is not confined to Campania. Centonze said: “This ruling sets a precedent that can be applied in all the other places in Italy where there is a problem with waste dumping and the inertia of administrations to deal with it.”View image in fullscreenMarilena Natale: ‘We can sue the government but it won’t give us back our dead children.’Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianNatale, who fostered a child with cancer, believes the ruling has come too late, and that the problem is too big to resolve. “It’s a mockery,” she said. “So we can sue the government but it won’t give us back our dead children.”The Santobono Pausilipon paediatric hospital in Naples sits on the Posillipo hill, with views overlooking Mount Vesuvius. Over the past 20 years, it has become the last port of hope for children with cancer and their families from across Campania. The hospital treated 108 new cancer patients in 2024, eight of whom have died since the beginning of the year.“Most come from the affected area,” said Anita Antignano, a cardiologist at the hospital who was also diagnosed with cancer in 2021. “Two patients arrived recently in quite a serious condition, which demonstrates the extent of the problem. While they try to clean up the land, the hospital needs to be reinforced with more staff, more equipment, and more funds. We need to be better equipped to save lives, but also to help those who survive and have to live with the consequences, and to work on prevention.”Explore more on these topicsItalyMafiaPollutionCancerHealthEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

You don’t watch it so much as immerse yourself in itRebecca NicholsonTue 18 Feb 2025 18.15 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareIn 2020, Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw releasedThe Truffle Hunters, a surprisingly affecting documentary about old men, their dogs and the search for truffles in the forests of Piedmont. Their new film, Gaucho Gaucho: Argentina’s Last Ranchers, is also about a traditional way of life that is in decline. Here, the subject is Argentinian gauchos – cowboys and cowgirls – who ride and tame horses, herd cattle and wear handmade traditional clothing. They have a relationship to the land that was forged in a different age and now exists in friction with much of the modern world. The film took two years to make – and it is mesmerising.A handful of characters run through the documentary, which is part ofthe BBC’s Storyville strand. Guada is a teenage girl in training to become a gaucho, like her father. We first meet her at school, where she is being punished for not sticking to the regulation clothing. The teacher tells her she must respect the school uniform; rules are rules. “I only feel comfortable in gaucho clothes,” she replies. It is a nice way to frame the tension between the old and new worlds. She is an outsider in both. Female gauchos are rare and the support from her father and her community is contagious. By the end, you are willing her to achieve her dreams.Mostly, the film offers no direct commentary, but instead respect and admiration for the way of life that is being observed. The Andean condor is another central character. (This is the sort of film in which a bird of prey can be a main character, but that is not nearly as insufferable as it sounds.) The condor is considered a vulnerable species itself, which makes its presence here as a predator more complex. The gauchos talk of condors attacking and killing calves. The older men are resigned to this ecosystem of predator and prey; the young condors are struggling to find food. It is just a shame, the men say, that they are the ones who must provide it.The sense of reckoning with life cycles is a recurring motif. The older gauchos remember devastating droughts – and the relief when the rain came. Most of the younger generations have left this way of life, tired of trying to live off what can be desolate land. We see a father teach his son how to sharpen knives on rocks. An old man, Lelo, talks to a priest and a shaman about his life and vitality and tells compelling stories along the way. The priest asks a local radio presenter and musician called Santito how he would like to be remembered, but Santito wriggles free of any restrictive labels: he would like to be remembered, he says, as Santito.We see dead cattle, prayed over by men, holding their hats to their hearts. Scenes of ceremony and ritual linger, painting-like, almost static, except for the breeze blowing through. Two boys, Lucas and Pancho, ride off on horseback, their adventures intertwined with the other stories. They race their mares, camp out and set fire to dead cacti to send a smoke signal back home, to let their families know that they are safe. They make a game of reconstructing the bones of a dead animal. The winner is the first to make it look like a complete skeleton.Many of these vignettes take place out in the wild, as horses gallop across great plains, or around tables, where crucial conversations take place with a gentle casualness. They debate how best to tame a horse, or banter about how many women they have slept with. These conversations seem intimate and spontaneous, but they are shot from strange angles and highly stylised, so it feels as if we have dropped in on an old western movie. On occasion, it may come across as overly focused on the visual; as a result, it can feel as if we don’t learn enough about people’s inner lives. Guada, for example, is warned off the rodeo and told it may make it more difficult to have children. But, she says, she doesn’t want children. This is intriguing, but the film-makers are polite and do not linger or push further.To say that Gaucho Gaucho is very BBC Four is like saying Love Island is a bit ITV2. It is almost comically arthouse. It is black and white, theatrical and cinematic. It is visually and audibly astonishing. You don’t so much watch it as immerse yourself in it. It is abstract, but gripping. Settle in, adjust to its tone and you will be richly rewarded.Gaucho Gaucho: Argentina’s Last Ranchers aired on BBC Four and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewHorsesFarmingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tickets for the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC) conference at the ExCeL Centre in London cost a discounted £450. A bargain said the organisers, as the original price was £1,500. Maybe they had a point. All 4,000 tickets were sold long before the event began. Even access to a live stream set you back £150. A meta-event where only the global elite are welcome to watch a global elite take on the global elite.This was “alt-right” heaven. A gathering of some of the biggest names on the circuit. Douglas Murray.Jordan Peterson. Nigel Farage. Niall Ferguson. An echo chamber of self-referential congratulation. A place where people come to have their ideas confirmed, not challenged.Time and again you heard speakers insist they were saying the unsayable. That their free speech was under attack. And yet no one is stopping them saying or doing anything. They are not under attack from the police or the government. This is not a clandestine meeting. The ExCeL Centre was rented on commercial terms. The only person being excluded from the conference is me. I emailed and texted four different ARC contacts asking for access. No one got back to me. Maybe it’s me who is saying the unsayable. In the end I coughed up for the livestream.Over the years, I’ve watched some batshit events. This one was right up there. Men and women fighting imaginary battles against an establishment of which they are part. Fighting diversity, inclusion, equality. Anyone who looks and thinks differently to them. All the while, there is literally a war going on in Ukraine. Men and women are dying defending their democratic rights, while the US and Russia meet in Saudi Arabia to carve up the mineral rights of their country without any input from the Ukrainian government. The dictators are taking over the world.And what did we get in London? An appearance from Katalin Novák, a former president of Hungary, congratulating members of the audience for having had three children or more.It was everyone’s moral duty to have children to save what was left of our civilisation. Needless to say, Novák omitted to say she had beenforced to resign after granting a presidential pardon to the deputy governor of an orphanage who had been imprisoned for his part in covering up a paedophile ring. I guess some children are more equal than others.The morning had begun with a fanfare from a chamber orchestra and then out stepped Murray. No one has a bigger regard for Dougie these days than Dougie. He has done very well out of the rightwing speaking circuit and now believes himself to be the Divine. He seems to regard other people with mild irritation for not matching his own perfection. His sense of humour replaced by the certainty of his own resurrection. His speech pattern has become more of an extended sneer.Dougie opened with a complaint about east London. It was too ugly for him. He would have been happier talking somewhere much grander. Still, needs must. There were bills to be paid. He then moved on. We were at a tipping point. The west was in crisis.Only a return to Christian values could save us. It was time to return to the Bible as the central building block of our civilisation. God would have approved of Elon Musk cutting USAid, he said. Now to get on with slashing the budgets of the US education department. It was only turning out illiterates.“Ours is the greatest civilisation of all time,” Dougie declared. And it wasn’t too late to protect it. We just had to stop allowing so many foreigners into our country. He was a heartbeat away from saying that people like Kemi Badenoch could never truly be as British as someone who was born white. There again, Kemi has drunk so much of the culture war Kool-Aid, she might even agree.Next up was career charlatan Jordan Peterson interviewingNigel Farage. At least that was the way it was billed. In practice, it turned out to be Jordan interviewing Jordan. Peterson is even more of a narcissist than Nige and automatically assumes he is the most important person in any room. You dread to think what would happen if you put Jordan and Dougie together. An ego death match. It’s not often Nige is the sanest person in the building. Very low bar and all that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unsurprisingly, it turned out that Jordan considered himself an expert in climate science by virtue of having no expert knowledge. It was all a myth. We should use as much oil and gas as we could. When he finally got a word in, Farage admitted he had no scientific knowledge either but didn’t consider that a drawback either. He also wanted small nuclear reactors, which he forgot to mention is a Labour policy.Then Jordan moved on to his favourite subject. What the world needed was more heterosexual couples to get married. Homosexuality was a deviation. There was too much abortion and divorce in the world. You’d be hard pushed to hear a more unpleasant rant all year. It was too much even for Nige, who confessed he had been divorced twice. He looked nervously at Jordan before ending by sayingthere would be more children under Reform. Trying to win over the audience. Still, at least no one asked him about his admiration of Putin. I’ve never seen Nige more pleased to leave the stage.It was hard to top that weirdness. ButAyaan Hirsi Alihad a good go. Her call was for more nationalism. People were wrong to say that the second world war had been caused by German nationalists. There were good nationalists and bad nationalists. Good Nazis and bad Nazis. We needed more Maga, less globalism. Donald Trump was merely the embodiment of the Christian message as written in Genesis, Leviticus and Romans.The morning ended with the historianNiall Ferguson, husband of Ali, declaring he was sorry to have missed a good war. Change only happened through armed conflict and he couldn’t wait for the next one to see off anyone who didn’t read the Bible. Or the Torah. In neo-con world, the Israelis are honorary Christians. Most incredibly of all, Niall seemed to think that SAS Rogue Heroes was a documentary series.I think I need to lie down in a darkened room for a while.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe politics sketchJordan PetersonNiall FergusonAyaan Hirsi AlinewsShareReuse this content"

Fortunately, it can also be fun.Date yourself firstIn order to find what you’re looking for, you need to understand who’s looking.“A lot of people jump intorelationshipshoping the other person will help them explore who they are,” says Lamont White, a dating coach. But that’s not a partner’s responsibility, he says.How to feel the spark (and keep it alive) – from first date to 50th anniversaryRead moreBefore swan-diving into the dating pool, establish your own values and priorities. Is family important to you? Staying active? Travel? How do you feel about all of the things you’re not supposed to discuss at dinner parties – sex, politics, spirituality?You can explore these questions within platonic relationships. “Spending time with friends really helps you figure out what your interests are and how you connect with other people,” White says, adding that working with a therapist or dating coach is also helpful.It’s also useful to know your patterns, says Bela Gandhi, dating coach at the SmartDatingAcademy and host of the Smart Dating Academy podcast. Once you have an idea of what you’re looking for, ask yourself why. Do you have destructive patterns from previous relationships? Reflect on how your family of origin has had an impact on your partner choices, and whether the qualities you want in a partner will make you happy.The apps are your friendMany feeldisillusionedwithdatingapps. But experts say they’re still a great way to meet potential partners.There are three main pipelines for meeting people, says Gandhi: online dating, in real life and gettingset up by friends or family. Of those, online dating is the easiest way to meet the greatest number of people.“How many people want to be going to five events a week? How many have friends that are willing to set them up at a high velocity?” Gandhi says. “Dating is a numbers game, and you want to play the numbers smart.”Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pink pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’There are dozens of app options, but start with just one so you don’t get overwhelmed, says Erika Ettin, dating coach and founder of A Little Nudge. “It’s better to do one or two well and proactively than seven in a scattered way.”Make a strong profileOnce you have an account, take time to write a thoughtful profile. “A lot of people rush through the most important part, which is selling yourself,” says Ettin.With her clients, Ettin does an exercise called “Name your five”: five nouns that, when put together, could only describe you. For example, Ettin says her own are: puns, crosswords, whiskey, dating coach and dogs. Identifying your five is a good way to identify what you want to include in your profile so potential matches can get an idea of you as a person.“The key is to be unique,” says Ettin. “Too many people try to cast a wide net. I’d rather you cast a smaller net by being who you actually are.”A good profile needs good pictures. Experts recommend at least six current pictures that are a mix of face and body shots that illustrate your interests and how you spend your time.“If you like bike riding, I need to see pictures of you on a bike,” says White.Chat, but not for too longTo meet people on the apps, you have to actually talk to people on the apps. Reach out to people and respond to those who reach out to you. This doesn’t have to be a second full-time job. Ettin suggests logging in 15 minutes earlier in the day and 15 minutes later in the day. “That way, you’re always getting back to people within 24 hours, but you’re not obsessed with it.”Don’t waste your time chatting with people who aren’t engaged. “If somebody’s just answering your questions and not asking a question back, drop that,” says Gandhi.If someone is engaged, Ettin suggests setting up a date within a week of matching. “Otherwise it’s too much texting, and no one has time for that,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It just takes commitment, says White.“You have to leave the house,” he says.Go places where it’s easy to interact with others, like a coffee shop or a local park with a walking or jogging trail. Ettin suggests going to three events a month: one dating event, such as speed dating or a singles night, and two events that allow you to get out of your comfort zone. “Maybe it’s a comedy show, maybe it’s a new fitness class. Make it something where you’re going to see people you don’t usually see,” she says.Once you’re out and about, approach people. This can feel daunting, but it doesn’t have to be complicated. White recommends a three-step approach: “Say hello, give a compliment, and ask a question.”On a walking trail, for example, you might say: “Hi, I love those sneakers you’re wearing. Where did you get them?” If they seem receptive, keep chatting. If they don’t, walk on.Skip the dinner dateYou’ve scheduled a first date with someone. Great! Now what?Don’t do dinner, experts say – it’s too much of a time commitment. Start with something simple, like drinks or coffee.“There’s something really lovely about walking with somebody,” Gandhi says. “Conversations tend to be more vulnerable.”A walk also gives you more flexibility. If a date is going poorly, you can cut it short, but if it’s going well, you can suggest stopping somewhere for a drink or a bite.Pay attention!People tend to put too much pressure on the first date. You don’t need their whole life story, nor do you need to know whether they’re your future life partner.“I would rather you learn nothing, but remember how you felt about yourself with them,” Ettin says. Did you feel good? Attractive? Did you feel like the person was listening and engaged? Were they kind?Flirt, reflect, delete: seven tips to tackle dating app fatigueRead moreToo often, experts say, people get distracted by a date’s looks or their qualities on paper, and don’t notice whether the person’s values align with their own.“If family is one of your core values and something that’s important in the type of relationship you want, pay attention to how often you hear the other person talking about interacting, calling and engaging with their family members,” White says.And if someone’s rude to a server? Pass. “It’s five minutes before that anger’s directed at you,” says Gandhi.Date a lotYou’re not exclusive until you’re exclusive. Experts encourage dating multiple people at once as a way of keeping your options open and not slipping into a scarcity mindset that leads you to ignore red flags.“When we have multiple options, we feel more powerful,” says Gandhi. “You want to feel like you’re at the steering wheel of your dating life.”Take a break if you need oneEven with the most thoughtful, strategic approach, dating can be exhausting. If you’re feeling burned out, take a break.“If you feel like you’re showing up to dates jaded, don’t do that,” says Ettin.When you hit a wall, White recommends taking a 30-day break. That way, “you can refocus, and your body can start to long for a romantic interest again”.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startDatingRelationshipsOnline datingTinderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what is really behind this romance gap?Tue 18 Feb 2025 12.14 ESTShareName:I love you.Age:As old as humanity itself.Appearance:Male and hasty.I love you.Finally! It’s only taken us 30-odd years for you to say it.Is that not normal?Not at all. In fact, if you’re a man in a heterosexual relationship, it usually takes significantly less time.How much less time?Well, according tonew research carried out by the Humboldt University of Berlin, men are far more likely to say “I love you” before women. A study in 2011 said that men think about saying it 42 days before women do. What’s more, men are likely to take break-ups worse.Aw, romantic.Indeed, that’s how this researchhas been received in the press. Men are all secret romantics.Well, who could argue with that?I’d like to, please.Pardon?I’d very much much like to argue that, please. Why do you think that women are so much slower to say “I love you”?Because they’re less romantic?Possibly. Or maybe it’s because societal expectations mean that a declaration of love will be followed by a pregnancy at some point. Given that it may result in a person being grown in your body for nine months, usually to the detriment of your career and financial independence, it may require a little more thought for women than when a man says it.Christ,alright.And while we’re on the subject, why do you think that men take break-ups worse than women?Because they fall in love harder?No, it’s because they’re traditionally raised to be unable to look after themselves, as they’re passed seamlessly from mother to wife, so it’s scary when they suddenly find themselves alone. Meanwhile, maybe women are happier after a relationship ends because being single significantly reduces their workload?Well, I mean …And another reason men are unhappy after break-ups is because they’re bad at making friends, which means their partner becomes their entire world, which is a hell of a burden to take on. Iris V Wahring, the lead author of the research, said this herself. If men could find independent emotional support outside relationships, they’d be able to cope better. But oh no, it’s all on women, isn’t it? Just like everything else.So the takeaway isn’t that men are romantic, then?Well, that may be true, but it’s probably more the case that when a man says “I love you”, he’s gaining someone who will wash his pants for him.Right. So when I said“I love you”just now …I’m wise to your game. Try again in another 30 years, and then I’ll give it some thought.Do say:“I love you.”Don’t say:“Now cook my dinner.”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsPass notesLove & FriendshipMenWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The frequency of her voice is piercing my brain. I am managing a queue of patrons: taking orders, making cocktails, trying to stay sane. I am trapped here for another four hours. Welcome to the world of bar work.Just shy of turning 50, I recently returned to the hospitality grind after a breezy 30-year “sabbatical”. My freelance writing work is temperamental, and while I live the work-from-home dream, tapping at a laptop from my lounge can also be lonely. Even as a misanthrope, I need contact with my fellow species. Due to crippling social anxiety, I prefer having a role to play at any social function. I’m great at small talk when also pouring a drink. Standing idly with a drink and talking? Not so much.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailSome shifts, the work drives me to despair: repetitious, arduous, thankless. But more often than not, the hours provide a humbling experience, a welcome respite from a million and one other woes. There’s something deeply honest about a hard day’s labour, the all-consuming physicality of it. For between 5 and 8 hours at a time, there’s simply no room for pondering my more existential concerns – someone needs a drink, andpronto!At one with my chore, I am at peace.In the yoga tradition, there’s a practice called karma yoga – a spiritual discipline of “selfless action performed for the benefit of others”. Any seeker feeling lost and looking for guidance will have collided with the suggestion tobusy themselves in service to others.Whether volunteering or community work, the act of giving is the remedy. While I’m paid to be here, I take joy in the job as an act of service. It’s not social work, but we do hear stories of rough days or difficult nights. A happy customer can make it all worthwhile.I’ve always been a messy person. The situation was grim – but could I really change?Read moreMiddle-aged workers in hospitality help to challenge ageist attitudes and outdated assumptions. We’re precocious enough to wield a snarl as required, but know how to spend it wisely. In theory, we help displace notions that the work is simple and only for penny-strapped students. The majority of people I know who have returned to the trade have arts practices, children or otherwise complicated lives. One assumption that works in my favour is customers mistaking my maturity for authority, meaning they’re more likely to treat me with respect.By my age, I’m rather accomplished at surfing life’s grievances and disappointments. Some might say I’ve mastered the art, having clocked my10,000 hours of dedicated practice. Years under the (expanding) belt have a way of putting the small stuff in perspective. So, when it comes to the downsides of hospitality most of it rolls off my back. I’m also less quick to judge – it’s a long, hard life after all.I felt a strange mix of emotionsduring a recent ruck with a customer. It was an interaction where the stress at having her card declined, mixed with a hint of shame, spilled out in an unhinged way. It’s the kind of behaviour you’d only allow yourself to do in front of a complete stranger. It was so raw, so human, that I couldn’t help but feel a strange tenderness in bearing witness to it.I’m not one to wade into generational culture wars, but I have to say the most difficult customers, generally speaking, aren’t the barflies or the drunk men that call me “sweetheart” – more often that not, it’sboomers. Some of them exude a belief that they know your job better than you do. Thehuffing and the puffing when things don’t go exactly as they think they should, paired with a complete lack of awareness about why certain processes exist – like waiting to be seated – can be galling.This demographic – and I’m generalising here – are often the quickest to judge, the fastest to outrage and the most likely to feel dissatisfied with an experience they’ve had a hand in creating. My job is to make you feel welcome and look after your needs, but your job is to recognise that hospitality workers aren’t vending machines. It’s a human interaction, an intersection of people who all share a planet. We’re not inconsequential strangers.When customers fail to acknowledge the humanity of the person serving them, the net result is a surly workforce and unhappy clientele. But ask any satisfied customer what made their experience good, enjoyable even, and it always comes back to the hospitality they received. The magic ingredient? The exchange isn’t purely transactional – it’s a relationship. Like all successful relationships, the more you put into it, the more you’ll get out of it.Beth Knights is a freelance screenwriter and writer in scripted television, digital media and printExplore more on these topicsHospitality industryOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The super-rich will flee to their bunkers – the rest of us will have to fend for ourselvesTue 18 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 07.05 ESTShareThough we might find it hard to imagine, we cannot now rule it out: the possibility of systemic collapse in the United States.The degradation of federal governmentby Donald Trump and Elon Musk could trigger a series of converging and compounding crises, leading to social, financial and industrial failure.There are several possible mechanisms. Let’s start with an obvious one: their assault on financial regulation. Trump’s appointee to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Russell Vought, hassuspended all the agency’s activity, slashed its budget and could be pursuing Musk’s ambition to “delete” the bureau. The CFPB was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis, to protect people from the predatory activity that helped trigger the crash. The signal to the financial sector could not be clearer: “Fill your boots, boys.” A financial crisis in the US would immediately become a global crisis.But the hazards extend much further. Musk, calling for a “wholesale removal of regulations”,sends his child soldiersto attack government departments stabilising the entire US system. Regulations, though endlessly maligned by corporate and oligarchic propaganda, are all that protect us from multiple disasters. In its initial impacts, deregulation is class war, hitting the poorest and the middle classes at the behest of the rich. As the effects proliferate, it becomes an assault on everyone’s wellbeing.To give a couple of examples, the fires in Los Angeles this year are expected to cost, on various estimates,between $28bn and $75bnin insured losses alone. Estimates of total losses range from $160bn to $275bn. These immense costs are likely to be dwarfed by future climate disasters. As Trumprips down environmental protectionsandtrashes federal responsiveness, the impacts will spiral. They could include non-linear shocks to eitherthe insurance sectoror homeowners, escalating into US-wide economic and social crisis.Trump and Musk have launched a new class war. In the UK, we must prepare to defend ourselves | George MonbiotRead moreIf (or when) another pandemic strikes, which could involve a pathogen more transmissible and even more deadly than Covid-19 (whichhas so far killed 1.2 millionpeople in the US), it will hit a nation whosedefences have been stood down. Basic public health measures, such as vaccination and quarantine, might be inaccessible to most. A pandemic in these circumstances could end millions of lives and cause spontaneous economic shutdown.Because there is little public understanding of how complex systems operate, collapse tends to take almost everyone by surprise. Complex systems (such as economies and human societies) have characteristics that make them eitherresilient or fragile. A system that loses its diversity, redundancy, modularity (the degree of compartmentalisation), its “circuit breakers” (such as government regulations) and backup strategies (alternative means of achieving a goal) is less resilient than one which retains these features. So is a system whose processes become synchronised. In a fragile system, shocks can amplify more rapidly and become more transmissible: a disruption in one placeproliferates into disaster everywhere. This, as Andy Haldane, former chief economist at the Bank of England,has deftly explained, iswhat happened to the financial systemin 2008.A consistent feature of globalised capitalism isan unintentional assault on systemic resilience. As corporations pursue similar profit-making strategies, and financialisation and digitisation permeate every enterprise, the economic system loses its diversity and starts to synchronise. As they consolidate, and the biggest conglomerates become hubs to which many other enterprises are connected (think of Amazon or the food and farming giant Cargill), major failures could cascade at astonishing speed.As every enterprise seeks efficiencies, the system loses its redundancy. As trading rules and physical infrastructure are standardised (think of those identical container terminals, shipping and trucking networks), the system loses both modularity and backup strategies. When a system has lost its resilience, a small external shock can trigger cascading collapse.Paradoxically, with his trade wars and assault on global standards, Trump could help to desynchronise the system and reintroduce some modularity. But, as he simultaneously rips down circuit breakers, undermines preparedness and treats Earth systems as an enemy to be crushed, the net effect is likely to makehuman systemsmore prone to collapse.At least in the short term, the far right tends to benefit from chaos and disruption: this is another of the feedback loops that can turn a crisis into a catastrophe. Trump presents himself as the hero who will save the nation from the ruptures he has caused, while deflecting the blame on to scapegoats.Alternatively, if collapse appears imminent, Trump and his team might not wish to respond. Like many of the ultra-rich, key figures in or around the administration entertain the kind of psychopathic fantasies indulged by Ayn Rand in her novels Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, in which plutocrats leave the proles to die in the inferno they’ve created, while they migrate to their New Zealand bunkers, Mars orthe ocean floor(forgetting, as they always do, that their wealth, power and survival is entirely dependent on other people). Or they yearn for a different apocalypse, in which the rest of us roast whilethey party with Jesusin his restored kingdom.Every government should hope for the best and prepare for the worst. But, as they do withclimate and ecological breakdown,freshwater depletion, the possibility offood system collapse,antibiotic resistanceandnuclear proliferation, most governments, including the UK’s, now seem to hope for the best and leave it there. So, though there is no substitute for effective government, we must seek to create our own backup systems.Start with this principle: don’t face your fears alone. Make friends, meet your neighbours, set up support networks, help those who are struggling. Since the dawn of humankind, those with robust social networks have been more resilient than those without.Discuss what we confront, explore the means by which we might respond. Through neighbourhood networks, start building a deliberative, participatory democracy, to resolve at least some of the issues that can be fixed at the local level. If you can, secure local resources for the community (in England this will be made easier with the forthcomingcommunity right to buy, like Scotland’s).From democratised neighbourhoods, we might seek to develop a new politics, along the lines proposed byMurray Bookchin, in which decisions are passed upwards, not downwards, with the aim of creating a political system not only more democratic than those we currently suffer, but which also permits more diversity, redundancy and modularity.Yes, we also – and urgently – need national and global action, brokered by governments. But it’s beginning to look as if no one has our backs.

There is a bold, progressive way to think again about our defence and investment, social spending and foreign policyClive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich SouthTue 18 Feb 2025 08.02 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 10.07 ESTShareLittle more than a year ago, Keir Starmer could be described as what Napoleon called a “lucky general”. But now, six months after a landslide election victory, “lucky” is an adjective unlikely to be found anywhere near a prime minister more usually described as having made missteps and unforced errors. And yet, perhaps, amid this tumult – a shifting geopolitical landscape, an authoritarian to the west of us conceding to the imperial ambitions of another to the east – Starmer’s luck holds. For the situation offers him an unparalleled strategic opening through which my government can find and define its purpose.The prime minister himself has called this a “once-in-a-generation opportunity”. The paradigm has shifted. It will not return to “normal”. Most significantly, the shibboleth of atlanticism – that unshakeable belief that the US-UK relationship is always right and always in our interest – has released its grip on our political imagination. We are free to define defence and security on our terms. And – as an increasingly anxious public pushes defence up the league table of concerns – we must do so.But first we need to be clear with ourselves that thinking deeply and clearly about defence is a moral and political imperative. For many progressives it is something we would rather not talk about. War, andpreparations for it, feel, by definition, regressive: an irrational capitulation to the worst instincts of humanity, proof that power corrupts and a diversion of much needed resources for construction to the cause of destruction. We didn’t go into politics to end lives or to relight the fires of Britain’s imperial past.But at issue is not expeditionary wars in distant lands. This is about national defence. Russia has clear imperial ambitions. So too does Trump. He has repeatedly stated his ambition toextend US territory. We cannot avoid asking the hard questions, even if they upset people.Post Trump, will atlanticism ever again be a rational policy for a UK government? Will Europe itself be a stable partner? And what of Trident? With the US pursuing its self interests without hesitation, does it make sense for the UK to rely on a nuclear capability dependent upon it? What use is a weapon system that could be switched off, repurposed or used as leverage by an American administration with its own agenda?View image in fullscreenJD Vance speaking at the 61st Munich Security Conference, 14 February 2025.Photograph: Johannes Simon/Getty ImagesThat question isn’t ideological – it is strategic. And alongside it are even bigger long-term questions about the security threats caused by climate breakdown, resource shortages and the threat to cybersecurity from AI. The Americans are thinking about these things. That’s why they are trying toforce Ukraineto provide them with critical minerals. We in the UK cannot rely on the US to give these questions answers that take account of our interests.So, this is a moment. We need to be on a new, more urgent footing. We cannot afford to be cautious and risk averse. The risks are too great for that. The temptation – as is already clear – will be to increase defence spending at the expense of wider public investment. This would benefit only Reform UK with its narrative of “out of touch elites”, and would not bring us the security we need.Defence – against military, cyber and ecological threats – must be integrated with industrial strategy. Defence has long driven innovation and technological advancement. For that to continue we cannot rely on the usualMinistry of Defence procurementchannels that leach away profits and public benefits. Instead, the state should take a controlling stake to ensure the public sector reaps and redistributes the gains.Investment must be tied to greater economic democracy in the defence sector, enabling coproduction with unionised workforces. And defence industries must prioritise national security in its broadest sense, contributing to essential infrastructure projects such as those that make us resilient in the face of energy shocks caused by economic warfare: retrofitting homes to reduce waste, increasing and protecting renewable sources, safeguarding the steelmaking facilities we will need, ensuring that water and other key resources aremanaged for the publicand not run down by private investors with their primary interests overseas.There are many ways Trump could trigger a global collapse. Here’s how to survive if that happens | George MonbiotRead moreThis must be bottom up, not top down – giving every citizen a stake in securing our future. Divided countries always fall. The UK and Europe must build social cohesion, investing in people to ensure that if sacrifices are needed they fall on the broadest shoulders. The poorest must not be expected to bear the brunt of change alone – they must be given a stake in the state’s transformation.And it cannot be an isolationist project. The UK’s response to Gaza has damaged western credibility in the eyes of the global south andthe Brics economies(Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and it has done so to a degree domestic commentators refuse to admit. As the world becomes fragmented and multipolar, we should seek to promote a renaissance in multilateralism, using our diplomatic capacity, and investing in rather than cutting our soft power to ensure that as global power structures evolve Britain is not isolated.We are living through a once-in-a-generation moment of geopolitical upheaval. The threats are many and deep. But the opportunity is wide; to rebuild the economy in a fundamentally different way and to reset our foreign and security policies for ourselves, freed from a restrictive paradigm.Britain needs a progressive vision of security, integrated with economic transformation, social resilience and international stability. Starmer has the chance not just to navigate this new world, but to shape it by redrawing Britain according to progressive values. If he takes this opportunity he will become a leader who changed Britain. And that won’t be down to luck: he will deserve it.Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich SouthDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The key culprit, in my opinion? Screen time.On a child’s first day at school, it’s normal to expect a few nerves. But they should be able to move around confidently, pick up stationery, make new friends, build a relationship with their teacher and start to feel part of a wider community. Instead, a recentsurvey reportedthat some children in England and Wales are unable to sit up or hold a pencil. I have seen kids racked with separation anxiety and unable to form bonds. Upset and confused, they miss instructions and hold back or lash out. To a busy teacher this looks like a lack of ability, or a disruptive child to be managed.Children are simply being set up to fail.For a while, it seemed as if the pandemic might have been the culprit for delayed development. Lockdowns undeniablyhad an impacton the development of children raised during that periodas they were unable to play outside and interact with others, but five years on, it would seem that this was a short-term issue masking a much longer-term trend.Lockdowns compounded habits that had already begun with the introduction of the first touch-screen phones. More and more parents relied on smartphones to work, organise their lives, shop, and keep in touch with friends and family. Burnt-out and distracted, they spent less time actively parenting. In turn, they handed their kids a device to keep them entertained. The result has been children growing up with less physical activity and face-to-face social interaction.Imagine spending a year immobilised in a cast – your muscles would weaken and your movements would become awkward. Now, think about children missing foundational years of muscle development, when practice should be natural and constant, because, instead of moving, children have been incentivised to sit quietly with a device.Children need opportunities to run, play, climb and explore. They need obstacles to move their bodies around, tunnels to crawl through, beams to balance over, and hula hoops to jump between. Every muscle and joint should be used as they develop balance and posture. This helps to forge the deep brain-body connections required for coordination and spatial awareness.Cognitively, children are struggling because they are not having quality interactive time with their caregivers. Acohort studyof Australian children aged 12 to 36 months found a negative association between screen time and parent-child talk. With fewer adult words spoken, there was a reduction in child vocalisations and the back-and-forth conversations crucial for language development and social skills. Devices are also having a behavioural impact, withstudies showinga link between excessive screen time and emotional reactivity, aggression and externalising behaviours in children.Labour gave us Sure Start to tackle child poverty. Now it should hike tax to keep it | Polly ToynbeeRead moreEven more worryingly, these outcomes are not being distributed equally among children; they affect those who already face significant disadvantages due to economic and racial inequality.Research revealedthat Dutch children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have higher screen time and astudy from the USexamining sociodemographic factors found that Black children reported higher levels of various screen time activities compared with their peers. Interestingly, the researchers behind the US study made an association between limited access to safe recreational spaces and increased screen time. Our environments shape us, and it is clear that children need access to safe play spaces where they can experience socially interactive and physical play.Some children are simply more vulnerable when starting school than others. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, children and families, especially those with other disadvantages, would benefit from targeted parenting programmes and support. The main lesson I would give to parents is this: when screen time is used it should be interactive, with engaging discussions about the content to enhance learning and connect on-screen lessons to real-life situations, promoting a child’s cognitive and social development. We cannot turn back the tide of technology, but we can use it more mindfully.Kathryn Peckham is an early childhood consultant, researcher, author and founder of Nurturing ChildhoodsExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionEarly years educationChildren's healthChildren's techMobile phonesChildren's rightsChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

As recently as inauguration day, the conventional wisdom on Elon Musk’s role in the administration was that he’d been given a meaningless post at a powerless agency whose name itself was a joke. From the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, it was said, Musk would issue easily ignored recommendations the gullible would take as evidence that Trump was streamlining the federal bureaucracy – a promise reliably made and broken by countless presidents. Instead, in a turn of events magazine cover artists have delighted in, Musk as a “special government employee” has seemingly taken the reins of the executive branch ⁠– a de facto co-president or perhaps a vice, while JD Vance busies himself with his duties delivering social media clapbacks and jeremiads about wokeness to European leaders.For weeks now, the Doge’s fleas have been hopping from agency to agency,gaining accessto key administrative and financial systems, including databases filled withsensitive informationon ordinary Americans andinfrastructureat the treasury that disburses trillions in payments across the federal government. One member of the team Musk installed there, Marko Elez,resignedafter it was revealed he had written posts supporting, in his words, “Indian hate” and a “eugenic immigration policy” as recently as December. Afterdefensesfrom Vance and Trump, he wasreinstated. Meanwhile,firedleaders across the government are now seeking employment; about75,000 federal workershave accepted a buyout from the administration. USAid has been gutted, putting thehealth and sustenanceof countless vulnerable people around the world in immediate jeopardy, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education are now under assault. Words and whole areas of inquiry are beingbannedfor researchers; government-wide, anything that smacks even vaguely ofdiversity and equityrecruitment and training isn’t long for this world. What’s more, all of this comes on the heels of Trump’s extraordinaryfreezeon federal loans and grants ⁠– justified as a step towardsrooting out“Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies” in government ⁠– which threatened programs like Medicaid, Head Start and even Meals on Wheels before it was blocked in court.There and elsewhere, those hoping to put the brakes on the administration’s moves are relying on lawfare to restore order. But this blitzkrieg is working anyway ⁠– the federal government has been weakened and all Trump and Musk have left standing is being remade in their image. Meanwhile, outside DC, Trump’s deportation campaign has begun with alarming departures even from the barbarism of Trump’s first term, like theprovisionsbeing made to house migrants at Guantánamo Bay and to send detainees, perhaps including American citizens, to prison inEl Salvador.It’s on tariffs, though, that Trump’s ambitions seem to have been significantly impeded. When Canada and Mexico struck border security deals to pause the administration’s threatened levies for a month, the White House was quick to frame them as victories for its trade agenda.But anyone who’s bothered to examine the Canadian and Mexican concessions closely knows that Trump delivered next to nothing ⁠– his ploywona Canadian border plan that had already been announced and a reshuffling of Mexican troops to bolster the 10,000 already stationed at that border to little effect as far as the flow of fentanyl is concerned. Even the 10% tariffon Chinanow in effect is much lower than the 60% levy Trump promised during the campaign.It will take some time before all the dust settles and the rest of the Trump domestic agenda shapes up. But these early days have given us enough of a glimpse at what will matter most to the administration that we can finally close the book on what Trumpism is all about. Nearly 10 years have been spent parsing Trump’s policies and rhetoric to identify points of departure from the Republican party of old. In columns and essays, academic symposiums and cable news bull sessions, it’s been argued that Trumpism has less to do with conservatism as we’ve known it than with other more interesting -isms ⁠– post-liberalism, post-neoliberalism, populism and, yes, fascism. It ought to be clearer to us now ⁠that the reality is much simpler. Donald Trump, a Republican president backed by Republican voters and the Republican party as an institution, is using extralegal means to enact longstanding parts of the Republican agenda and the conservative project ⁠– including, chiefly, the crippling of the federal government. The most significant standing policy accomplishment of his first term in office was a large tax cut Republicans are hoping toextend. This Trump administration promises to be more innovative to the same ends. The tasks of deregulation and privatization are themselves being deregulated and privatized ⁠– turned over substantially to Musk, who seems willing to shrink and weaken government in ways Republican politicians and bureaucrats in administrations past were unwilling to try themselves, a crusadelegal scholarsandgovernment officialsare calling illegal.As Musk and conservative movement veterans like office of management and budget director,Russell Vought, work away at all this, Trump’s tariff agenda ⁠– long scoffed at by Republican business leaders and donors ⁠– is faltering. And on immigration, it bears repeating that Trump’s supposedly distinctive nativism has precedents in Republican politics. The more immigration-friendly George W Bush-era that the Trump years are often unfavorably compared with were preceded by a period in the 1990s when the right, includingestablishment figureslike William F Buckley Jr, strongly backed restrictionism. They were followed, in the years just before Trump fully entered the picture, by a period when candidates like the now-saintedMitt Romneyleaned into restricting immigration so strongly that Republican leadersopenly fearedthey would be permanently uncompetitive with Latino voters.That never came to pass for reasons the 2024 election underscored clearly ⁠– many Americans, of all ethnicities, are plainly through with politics as usual. Decades of rhetoric from mainstream politicians about how Washington is broken and in need of candidates willing to bust things up and Get Stuff Done, whatever the Stuff may be, have culminated in the re-election, by a genuine plurality, of a candidate willing to abrogate the constitution to that end ⁠– one who has also promised to finally deliver on another standard bit of political pablum, the idea of “running the government like a business”. This is essentially what Musk has been brought on to do. The move-fast-and-break-things ethos of Silicon Valley is breaking the federal infrastructure; whether they recognize it or not, workers across many industries have faced the very same situation federal workers do now, with their agency and very livelihoods being sacrificed on the altar of supposed efficiency.The Democrats who have been roused to action on their behalf ⁠– feebly and belatedly, per usual ⁠– have centered the argument that Trump’s and Musk’s rampage through the federal government is unlawful and unconstitutional. “What Trump and Musk have done is not only wrong, it’s illegal,” the Virginia congressman Don Beyersaidat a rally outside USAid’s offices earlier this month.The very mechanisms the founders crafted to protect the republic are now an existential threat to it“USAid was established by an act of Congress, and it can only be disbanded by an act of Congress. Stopping this will require action by the courts and for Republicans to show up and show courage and stand up for our country.” Republicans, wouldn’t you know it, have gotten rather blase about the whole constitution thing in response. Last week, John Kennedy, the Oxford-educated senator from Louisiana who does a mean Foghorn Leghorn impression for his constituents and the press, defended the constitutionality of Musk’s activities immediately before dismissing the idea that their constitutionality mattered at all. “[T]he issue, anyway, is not process,” hesaid. “The issue is substance. Did they find wasteful spending, or not?” The North Carolina senator Thom Tillis was more direct ⁠– while Musk’s attack on Congress-approved spending “runs afoul of the constitution in the strictest sense”, he said, “nobody should bellyache about that.”Just how much bellyaching about the constitution should Democrats actually be doing? All that’s happening now is happening in large part because the men who wrote the constitution more than two centuries ago failed to anticipate anything like contemporary political parties, much less parties that would adopt the ironic disposition towards the document thatRepublicansnow have. Its checks and balances simply weren’t designed to withstand the skulduggery of organized political factions willing to sacralize the document instrumentally and disregard it as necessary. It should never be forgotten that Trump was brought to power by an ugly mutant of the founders’ electoral college to begin with. The longstanding Republican structural advantage in the Senate and constitution’s supermajoritarian threshold for an impeachment conviction allowed Republicans to defend him from the consequences of his actions twice ⁠– the second time despite a simple majority of senators voting to convict in the wake of his scheme to steal the 2020 election and the resulting attack on Congress.In November, voters either enthralled by his seeming invincibility or resigned to it sent him back to the White House. And the major legal challenges to all he’s done and will do this time around will inevitably wind their way to a supreme court dominated by conservatives Trump himself and the Republican party successfully installed, in full keeping with the constitution’s rules, to give themselves their best possible odds of winning their policy fights and hobbling Democratic governance. Topping it all off, Musk’s seat at the heart of the federal government has been handed to him as a reward for themore than $250m⁠– a mere sliver of his wealth ⁠– that he contributed to Trump’s re-election effort, a sum only made possible by the supreme court’sCitizens Unitedruling in 2010, which allowed donors, corporations and interest groups to raise and spend unlimited amounts on elections through Super Pacs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The very mechanisms the founders crafted to protect the republic are now an existential threat to it; in their greed and determination to implement the conservative agenda, Trump, Musk and Republicans empowered by those mechanisms are happily ignoring or working to override the parts of the constitution that don’t advantage them or suit their ends. As a matter of substance, this is a system that needs to be dramatically reformed or reimagined rather than rescued; as a matter of politics, one of the central lessons of this past election is that critical constituencies Democrats need to improve with in order to stay competitive federally care far less about protecting our sickly institutions than they care about a great many other things that they hoped Donald Trump would accomplish. As of now, even amid the mess in Washington, voters aren’t giving him marks that are all that terrible – a recent CBSpollfound solid majorities of Americans describing his leadership so far as “tough”, “energetic”, “focused” and “effective”.The legal fights against the administration being waged on constitutional grounds should obviously continue; like Republicans, liberal lawyers seeking liberal ends should avail themselves of whatever arguments stand the best chance of prevailing in the courts. Politically though, Democrats need to refocus. If appeals to our norms and constitution were politically potent enough on their own to work against Trump, he wouldn’t be in the Oval Office waging war against the administrative state today. Put more simply, no one watches a game for the referees.Democrats should be positioning themselves not as the guardians of America’s institutions but as the defenders of the American people’s concrete interests ⁠– showing and telling voters about all the federal government does for them every day and how the conservative agenda Trump, Musk and the Republican party are pursuing threatens and has always threatened them. The perversity of a man getting to rework their government purely because he happens to be the wealthiest person in the world and financially backed Trump’s campaign should, of course, also be underscored.The especially ambitious might even try arguing to the American people that all the goings-on in Washington illustrate the danger of having so much wealth accumulate in the hands of a few in the first place.Elon Muskis gliding towards becoming the planet’s very first trillionaire. His access to the levers and gears of the federal government now could help him along in myriad ways. Even an improved political system would struggle to constrain the amount of power he possessed as a private citizen and has now leveraged into a public office; democratic republican governance will never be secured in America without turning our attention to the structure of our economic system as well. Dismantling the federal government to prevent that from happening was a key object of the conservative project before Trump. It has remained so with him at the head of the Republican party and will remain so whenever his time is up. Right now, that project is succeeding.Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionElon MuskDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The pessimists worried about the decline of multilateralism giving way to a “multi-order world” in which like-minded autocracieswould start to cluster,making the search for global peace and prosperity ever harder.The reality looks much worse. Donald Trump’s US is now subverting the very idea of liberal democracy in order to undermine it, both in the US and, as has become painfully obvious, in Europe too.At the Munich security conference, the US vice-president, JD Vance, accused Europe ofabandoning the values of democracyby erecting firewalls to exclude the far right from government; of fearing its peoples, and of restricting free speech. This was to a mainly European audience eagerly expecting Vance to address the big security questions of our time, from Ukraine and Russia to China and the Middle East. His assault on European democracy left the room dumbfounded and seething. His chilling suggestion that the waging war against disinformation amounts to war on democracyfelt like a genuinely shocking moment.Vance’s extraordinary assault, and his electoral interference on behalf of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland in Germany just days out from a general election (he had earlier met the AfD’s co-leader Alice Weidel) have little to do with democracy. Rather he was outlining the Mega (Make Europe Great Again) project in support of the far right across Europe. The strategic goal is clear: a Europe in which the nationalist far right is empowered is a divided Europe, far easier to subjugate by imperial powers, be that the US, Russia or China.If Trump’s goal is the neo-Nazification of Germany, then that ties in with the Russification of Ukraine, the first under the banner of “free speech” and the second as an invocation of “common sense”. Trump and Putin share an imperial vision of the world, which includes an imperial “peace” for Ukraine. It is imperial because it will be decided – just as at Yalta in 1945 – by empires; the US and Russia, perhaps with China’s help, but without Ukraine. It is also imperial because it concedes to Russia’s imperial ambitions for a sphere of influence, which Trump shares, as made clear by his approach to Canada, Mexico, Panama, Greenland, and, in fact, Europe as a whole.What we are also learning is that rather than a reformed multilateral order, or even a more chaotic multi-order world, we are moving into a phase in which there is no order at all. It is a world in whichinternational courts are sanctioned, international institutions thrown under the bus, international law systematically violated andinternational aid eviscerated. China will try to step into the void by talking up multilateralism, cooperation, predictability and free trade, as the Chinese minister of foreign affairs, Wang Yi, did in Munich. But China is most likely to be motivated to capture the spoils from a disaffected Europe betrayed by the US.During a panel discussion at Munich with the Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, I referred to the dangers of a world devoid of any rules of the road. He rebutted this by saying that India quite liked the transactionalism baked into this survival-of-the-fittest scenario. He had travelled to Munich after having accompanied the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, in what was, for them, a successful visit to Washington, in which Modi and Trump agreed on gas, weapons and more.There is a certain (perhaps understandable) glee among many in the global south, who see Vance’s election interference in Germany as Europe getting a dose of the medicine that it has shoved down the throats of many countries in the global south, having lectured them for decades on democracy and rights. And yet no nation, large or small, whether in the global north or south, will thrive in a world without international institutions and internationally agreed norms, even if those rules have been violated for years. A fractured Europe will only be poorer, more insecure and less free in a world devoid of meaningful laws and institutions.In response to Trump’s gratuitous gifts to Putin, Emmanuel Macron convened Monday’s emergency summit of Europe’s defence powers. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, warned that the choice for European leaders was between Brussels and Moscow: the time had come for a European army.This is all welcome, but every decision from now on should be premised on the awareness that what is at stake is not “just” a repeat of Munich 1938, in which Ukraine is sold out to Russia, just as France and Britain did to Czechoslovakia to appease Nazi Germany. The ominous spectre, after Vance, is that of Poland in 1939, squeezed and then attacked by Stalin’s Soviet Union and Hitler’s Germany, both intent on imperial expansion. Europe as a whole this time (starting with Ukraine) is under attack militarily by Putin’s Russia and politically by Trump’s America. China is waiting in the wings to partake in the feast.The sense of urgency and the call to action should not be about merely pleading pathetically for a seat at the negotiating table on the war in Ukraine. Only Ukraine and Russia should be at that table. Neither should European governments bend over backwards to reassure Washington they are ready to pick up the bill on whatever the US and Russia agree. Nor should Europe’s focus be on how to retain US interest by increasing spending on US weapons or gas.What Europeans (Ukraine included) must agree fast among themselves is what they want, what their red lines are, and what actions they are ready to take collectively for Ukraine regardless of what the US and Russia stitch up. Sanctions, military support for Ukraine, the use of Russian frozen assets, accelerated EU membership and a European deterrence force in the event of a truce are all options. More broadly, Europe will need to make itself more capable and less dependent on the US for defence. Temporarily exempting defence investments from EU fiscal rules, establishing new EU borrowing for defence, increasing European investment bank lending for defence or setting up a defence bank among the willing and able European governments will have to be considered.Europe should neither pick fights with the Americans nor focus on pleasing them. But European governments must now act on the assumption that they are alone in a world dominated by malign imperial powers. A Europe in which the far right takes power, as Trump and Putin would like to see, is one in which European integration would cease to exist. After years of discussing how the transatlantic partnership against threats from Russia could be strengthened, we find ourselves in a world in which we are not just abandoned by the US to defend ourselves, but attacked by it.Are our leaders brave enough to out-Trump Trump?Yanis VaroufakisEconomist, politician and authorJD Vance, the US vice-president,hastold Europeansthat their values are no longer America’s values. Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, added that Europeans “can’t make an assumption that America’s presence will last for ever”. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has confirmed that Europe will not have a seat at the table when the end of the Ukraine war is negotiated.Shellshocked, European leaders are stuck at the first stage of grief – denial. They will remain adrift as long as they stay there, and fail to grasp that Donald Trump has a rational economic-cum-geostrategic plan (albeit one that is detrimental to Europe’s interests).Starting with his economic weaponry, Europeans need to realise that Trump does not naively believe that his tariffs will, magically, eliminate the US trade deficit. He knows that in the short run the dollar will rise. His tariffs are a negotiating tool to get foreigners to revalue their currencies, to swap their holdings of short-term for long-term US debt, and to magnetise European chemical and mechanical engineering conglomerates (eg BASF and Volkswagen) from a stagnating Europe to a boisterous United States.Moving on to Ukraine, Trump’s team has made two things clear. First, they see Russia as a diminishing power that could never threaten Nato countries but which was given a temporary kiss of life by the transition to a war economy, triggered in turn by Nato’s planned expansion right up to the Russian border (through Russian-speaking areas in Georgia and eastern Ukraine). Second, they reviled how enthusiastically Europe helped push Russia into China’s embrace.In this light, it is easier to understand why the Trump administration is cutting Europe out. And why it adds the ideological veneer of taking Europe to task for betraying its own values, for example the right to free speech and the cancellation of Romania’s elections on, admittedly, shaky grounds.And now? One option Europe has is to carry on alone, attempting to arm and fund Ukraine’s attempt to push Putin back. It would bankrupt an already insolvent Europe, it would not help Ukraine and it would inevitably force a humiliated Europe back under the US’s thumb.A second option is to out-Trump Trump: to undermine Washington by rejecting any deal that gifts Ukraine’s resources to the US, meanwhile signalling to Moscow Europe’s openness to a new security architecture that involves a sovereign Ukraine in a role similar to Austria’s during the cold war. That would be tantamount to turning a dismal crisis into an opportunity for Europe to liberate and to re-energise itself. Alas, I cannot see our present crop of leaders seizing it.This was a declaration of alliance with the European far rightRokhaya DialloFrench journalist, writer, film-maker and activistJD Vance’s speech in Munich took Europe by surprise, but nothing in its content is new. His words were loaded with references that resonate with rightwing populist movements across Europe.Concerns about so-called censorship and threats from within mirror the rhetoric of the main nationalist European figures: from Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán,accusing an enemyof “hiding” itself, to Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,suggestingthat media outletsintentionally misrepresenther political choices – or Marine Le Pen, the head of the French far right, warning againstinternal threatsto French identity, particularly from immigration.These words being said on European soil by a US official also represent the institutionalisation of what was a central part of Trump's first term. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is alongtime advocateof forging a transatlantic rightwing nationalist alliance, forcing together US rightwing populism with European nationalist movements to create a common front against globalism, liberal elites, and multiculturalism. One of Bannon’skey strategieswas to use “free speech” as a rallying cry against what he calls the “liberal totalitarianism” of the EU and US Democrats.Invited by several key European figures, he was aguest speakerin France at the 2018 congress of Le Pen’s National Front (now National Rally). Facing the crowd he presented anti-racist critiques of the far right as an attack on freedom of speech, telling them: “Let them call you racists, let them call you xenophobes, let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honour.”Vance’s explicit support for Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) not only marks a significant shift in traditional US diplomatic stances, but also validates a party whose prominent memberstook part in a clandestine meetingwith neo-Nazis and other extremists where they discussed a plan for implementing remigration. That plan entailed the forceddeportation of millions, targeting not only asylum seekers and foreign residents but also German non-white citizens.Vance’s “threat from within” are those whose identities defy his image of Europe and those who are determined to push hate speech outside of the public sphere. That should frighten anyone who cares about human rights.Progressives must call out this inversion of realityShada IslamBrussels-based commentator on EU affairsJD Vance’s warm embrace of Europe’s far right should finally put paid to EU policymakers’ tedious talk of shared transatlantic values, and shatter complacency about the subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which the EU has been drifting ever more to the right on immigration, free speech and political exclusion.Vance is right in pointing out that European democracies face internal risks, but he is wrong in his analysis. The dangers we face come from Vance’s xenophobic far-right friends and allies and their toxic messages of hate and division, not from progressives. In fact, European progressives should speak out more loudly, clearly and forcefully about building inclusive societies and against the hate-mongers. Perhaps being insulted by Vance will spur them to do so.Europe’s reality is the opposite of the one outlined by Vance. Far from the far right being ostracised and silenced, mainstream parties’ “firewall” against partnering with it is crumbling.Meanwhile, whether they are in power in EU states such as Hungary, the Netherlands and Italy or providing backing to ruling centrists in countries like Sweden, hard-right parties are setting the EU agenda. In too many cases, European governments have been moving further away from their internal and external commitments to human rights – although they still talk about “European values” to countries in the global south. This has not surprisingly prompted charges of double standards and led to a loss of EU credibility.Vance portrayed European migration policies as weak. The charge is laughable. The reality is that the EU has been shifting steadily toward tougher migration controls, including through theEuropean pact on migration and asylum, passed in 2024, which strengthens border security and speeds up deportations. Once-taboo policies such as the establishment of “return hubs” for refugees and asylum seekers, unlawfulpushbacks by Frontexand the weaponising of Islamist-linked terrorist attacks for political gain are now mainstream in the EU. Building an ever-strong “Fortress Europe” has not, however, stopped the rise of far-right parties, which continue to spout anti-Muslim hatred and gain traction by calling for even stricter measures.True, there are valiant but ultimately ineffective EU attempts to curb hate speech on social platforms and in European media. Sadly, here too, while free speech is often defended in principle, there are also governmental crackdowns on pro-Palestine demonstrations,journalists have lost their jobsover their criticism of Israel’s destruction of Gaza after the October 7 Hamas attack and Germany has shut down cultural events and evendeported activistsfor expressing pro-Palestinian views.The EU should respond forcefully to Vance’s criticism by going back to its original commitments to equality, inclusion, human rights and the rule of law. Too much ground has already been ceded to Vance and Donald Trump’s friends and this is no time to retreat.The peril Germany is facing may concentrate mindsJohn KampfnerAuthor of In Search of Berlin, Blair’s Wars and Why the Germans Do It BetterDuring his first term in the White House, Donald Trump reserved a special place in hell for Angela Merkel’s Germany. He loathed everything she, and it, stood for: its energy dependency on Russia, trade dependency on China and military dependency on the US. Most of all, he resented the then-chancellor’s deliberative politics and the popularity they enjoyed at the time. She disdained his visceral vulgarity. Germans were discomfited by him, but believed that once he was gone, they could retreat into their comfortable shell.Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was the first shock to the system. The Munich security conference of this past weekend will go down as an even bigger moment. Germans are now forced to realise that the US will no longer defend it; some are beginning to wonder whether the superpower on which they relied might even have become an adversary.Theelections next Sundaywill go a long way to determining whether Germans have woken up. Will they finally appreciate the need to use hard power to defend the post-1945 settlement that gave their country a moral purpose?All the mainstream candidates expressed fury atthe actions of the Trump team in Munich, both the hostile speeches by the vice-president and others, and the endorsement of the AfD – with Vance meeting the far-right party’s leader,but not the chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democrats and chancellor-in-waiting, accused the Trump team of “interfering quite openly” in the election: “We will decide for ourselves what happens to our democracy.” It was a sobering moment, suggesting he may now understand the folly of his recent parliamentary gambit when he accepted AfD support to try to force through a tough migration bill.The peril Germany is facing – with Trump on one side, Putin on the other – may concentrate minds. Merz’s new government will have three competing priorities: to bring order to the asylum system, radically modernise the economy and beef up defence spending.  The scale of these challenges may strengthen his hand in negotiations to form a new coalition with either the Social Democrats or the Greens, or possibly both. All the parties will have to show a new resolve and sense of common leadership, characteristics that were sorely lacking in the outgoing government.They know that now they have nowhere to hide. If they fail to make progress over the next four or five years, the AfD, aided and abetted by Trump and Elon Musk, will be in pole position for the next elections.The continent is torn between denial and hysterical overreactionLorenzo MarsiliPhilosopher, activist, author and director of the Berggruen Institute EuropeFor years, European countries have behaved as geopolitical ostriches, hiding their heads in the sands of military and diplomatic impotence. Today they tremble as if war had already reached Berlin and Paris. The result is paralysis – a continent torn between denial and hysterical overreaction.What would a balanced response to JD Vance and Donald Trump’s explosive declarations about Europe look like? It would be one fit for objectives and fit for the future. Europe’s objectives are deterrence of foreign aggression – on its soil and on that of partner countries such as Moldova or the western Balkans. These objectives, however, do not include global military projection to drive regime change in other countries. They also do not include preparation for conflict with China, whatever course the US may take: as the US security umbrella shuts over Europe, so does American leverage in determining European policy towards Beijing.Europe’s longer-term interest is to avoid having to scramble for an ad hoc and embarrassingly insufficient response each time a security crisis breaks out – whether this is about meddling, piracy,cyber-attacksor aggression against it, or about supporting the UN in peacekeeping missions internationally.Combining its immediate objectives and its future interests leads to one clear solution: Europe needs a common military force that is effective but of limited size. An effective force is one that is well supplied and trained, that has joint procurement and an industrial production capacity to match. A limited force is one that is sufficient to deter aggression, but insufficient for military adventurism, and that does not imply swapping the welfare state for the military state. A common force, finally, is one that is ready to be deployed without incessant haggling between participating states, as one army and not as a hastily assembled coalition of national jealousies.Who should establish such a force? The pragmatic answer is whoever is willing, without requiring the paralysing unanimity demanded by EU treaties. It should be open to, or at least be in a close relation to, non-EU countries such as the UK and Ukraine. Many of Europe’s most celebrated achievements began as parallel treaties between an avant garde group of nations.It becomes clearer every day that if peace is to emerge in Ukraine then European troops will need to be part of the solution. They should not be deployed merely to guarantee European states a minor seat at the table of the negotiations or because Trump and Vance order so. They should be deployed to form the basis of a common, effective, but limited European army that is fit for objectives and for the future.Ultimately, this is not merely about establishing a European military force, but establishing a European security regime crafted and owned by Europeans, less vulnerable to the whims and tides of US policy.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyEurope's turning pointEuropeUkraineRussiaJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

I suspect the latter ...Tue 18 Feb 2025 10.13 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 10.53 ESTShareWelcome to the White House, where every day seems to be bring-your-kid-to-work-day if you’re Elon Musk. The tech billionaire,fascist-salute-enthusiast, and de facto president of the US hasn’t just moved himself intogovernment digs– he has seemingly moved in a selection of his kids as well. Over the last couple of weeks, mini-Musks have been popping up at high-profile political events, generating a steady stream of memes, headlines and analysis.Three of Musk’s young children were at a meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi last Thursday, for example. Why were Musk and Modi meeting? Good question. EvenTrump doesn’t seem to know, but told reporters he assumed Musk “wants to do business in India”. Which, considering Musk has burrowed his way deep into the US government, sounds ateenybit like a conflict of interest. But let’s not focus on that, eh? Let’s focus on Musk’s parenting instead! Don’t ask any difficult questions, just look at the cute pictures – disseminated widely – ofModi showering Musk’s kids with gifts. Adorbs.Musk’s four-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii (often called “X”), is something of a seasoned statesman now. Just a few days before the Modi meeting, X joined Musk and Trump for apress conference in the Oval Office. While Musk rambled about democracy and walked back a despicable lie about $50 million’s worth of condoms going to Gaza, X looked as if he would rather watch Paw Patrol. At one point heappeared to say– perhaps to Trump – “I want you to shush your mouth”. (Where did he hear that, one wonders?) And, at another point, X (who Musk once described as his “emotional support human”) seemed to pick his nose and then wipe the results on Trump’s desk. The nose-picking is very normal for a little kid. The standing by the president of the US, while your dad, who seems to think he is king of the world, makes outlandish claims? Not so much.Musk’s recent spate of in-your-face parenting has divided public opinion. His acolytes seem to think it’s super-cute and a sign that the billionaire isn’t just the saviour of America and human civilisation, but also the world’s best dad – gallantly putting his pronatalist views into practice. Other people (normal people) seem to think it’s a cynical and exploitative PR strategy designed to humanise Musk and distract from all his meddling in democracy. After all, having a kid on your shoulders makes you seem less like a robber baron with a weird breeding fetish and more like a fun dad.No prizes for guessing which camp I’m in: I don’t think there is anything cute about Musk parading his poor children in front of the cameras. Rather, it feels completely self-serving. Bringing your kids to work so you can spend more time with them amid your busy schedule is one thing. Carrying them around like props for photo opportunities, as Musk seems to be doing, is quite another.To be clear: I’m not saying politicians should always keep their kids hidden away. Having leaders parent in public can send a powerful message. In 2018, for example, the former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern became the first world leader to attend the UN general assembly meetingwith her baby in tow. Ardern was broadly praised for showing people that a woman can be a mother and a leader.What Musk is doing, however, feels very different. Not least because Grimes, who has three children with Musk, including X, has said multiple times that her young son “should not be in public like this” (or variations on the theme). Grimes also claimed she didn’t see one of her kids for five months while she and Musk were engaged in a battle for parenting rights and said her own “Instagram posts and modelling” were weaponised as reasons she shouldn’t have care of her children. Last year, Grimes’s mother similarly accused Musk of withholding her grandchildren’s passports so they couldn’tvisit their dying great-grandmother. There are plenty of phrases that seem to describe what Musk is doing here and “dad of the year” is not one of them.Anyway, I have to wrap this up now because I brought my kid to work today, too. That’s not for PR points, to be clear. It’s because I work in the living room and the child is off school. She hasn’t been wiping her nose on my desk but she has put Play-Doh in my socks.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskChildrenUS politicsParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, underscored that when hesaidthe two sides would create a team, not only to support Ukraine peace talks but also to explore the “incredible opportunities” to partner with Moscow geopolitically “and, frankly, economically” that might result.Kyiv and other European capitals are still reeling at the full extent of Donald Trump’s cynicism when it comes to world affairs, and callous disregard for the people caught up in them. But it should be no surprise that business dealings were high on the agenda. Vladimir Putin would dearly love to end his country’s economic isolation. Russia ismaking the casethat American energy firms and others could profit handsomely by doing business with it again.For Mr Trump, his two key interests – money and power – are not only interrelated but fungible, just as US goals and his personal interests oftenappear indistinguishableto him. (This is a man wholaunched his own cryptocurrencytoken days before returning to the White House, and as he sought to ease regulation of the industry).When he talks of the future of Ukraine or Gaza, he speaks not of human rights and security, lives and homes, but of laying US hands on$500bn of mineralsand a “big real-estate site” respectively. He believes in cutting deals, not making peace. At the heart of his foreign policy team is Steve Witkoff, not a diplomat but a billionaire real-estate developer and golf buddy. Mr Witkoff was first appointed as Middle East envoy and then dispatched to negotiate with Moscow. The head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, was also in Riyadh – while Ukraine and European allies have been denied a seat.Mr Trump’s merging of wealth and strength were obvious even before he took office the first time. He suggested he could use Taiwanas leverage with Chinaon issues including trade. John Bolton, who became his national security adviser, latersaid(though Mr Trump denied it) that the president pleaded with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, to ensure he would win the next election, “stress[ing] the importance of … increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome”.Mr Trump’s Middle East policy is not only pleasing to his evangelical Christian supporters. His repugnant proposal to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza, allowing the construction of an American-owned “Riviera”, is shocking but in many ways builds uponideas long held bybusinessman friends as well as Israeli settlers. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a former real-estate developer charged with overseeing Middle East policy in Mr Trump’s first term, suggested last year thatGaza’s “waterfront property”could be “very valuable”. (Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, incidentally, becamea major investor in Mr Kushner’s private equity firmafter he left the administration.)Volodymyr Zelenskyy tried to capitalise on Mr Trump’s economic transactionalism by offering access to Ukraine’s resources, notablyminerals, in exchange for security. He got Mr Trump’s attention – but the terms of the resulting USdemandmake it look less like diplomacy than extortion. The US president prices up everything and knows the value of nothing. Others must now endeavour to show him that his plans will not come as cheaply as he believes.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet in subsequent decades, governments of all stripes have focused overwhelmingly on the first clause, and treated the second as an optional extra.The disastrous result is a criminal justice system on the brink of collapse, as the former Conservative justice secretary, David Gauke, hasoutlinedin his interim report on the sentencing system in England and Wales. Cumulative Westminster pressure for longer prison terms has led to a doubling of the incarcerated population in 30 years. More draconian sentencing and greater recall of released offenders who break parole have left the prison estate bursting at the seams and necessitated ad hoc early release schemes. Labour’splansto deliver 14,000 extra prison places by 2031 – at a cost of £10bn – will not be enough to keep pace with rising numbers.Systemic overreliance on custodial punishment is not only ruinously expensive and unsustainable. It is also, as thereportmakes clear, dysfunctional and counterproductive. Our scandalously overcrowded prisons are dangerous and despairing places, which struggle to adequately recruit and retain overstretched prison officers. Resources to facilitate rehabilitative work for inmates are shamefully threadbare, and the cost of banging so many people up has diverted money from services dedicated to reducing the possibility of their reoffending. A vicious cycle of recidivism is the dismal and inevitable outcome.A proper national debate on a broken system is needed. This government-commissioned review will hopefully be the catalyst for one. Final recommendations will be made in the spring, but it is already clear that they will call for a renewed focus on prevention alongside punishment, and a more liberal approach to sentencing. As Mr Gauke rightly points out: “Punishment will always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, but it is not the only aim; and prison is not the only form of punishment.”A far less kneejerk approach to custodial sentencing, particularly inrelationto more minor offences, would ease the intolerable pressure on the prison estate. It would also free up much-needed resources to invest in probation, rehabilitation, psychiatric services and addiction counselling. The public would be better protected as a result.After 30 years of performative “tough on crime” politics, making and winning this argument will not be easy. FromKen Clarketo Rory Stewart and Mr Gauke himself, successive Conservative ministers attempted in the 2010s to address the damaging explosion in the prison population. All fell foul of a hostile rightwing media, and their governments’ unwillingness to abandon a simplistically conceived “law and order” agenda.As they contend with the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, Sir Keir Starmer and his justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, will also face considerable political headwinds. But the case for reform is overwhelming. Sir Keir’s prisons minister, James Timpson – a former chair of the Prison Reform Trust – is a vocal advocate of lowering the rate of incarceration and improving conditions. When Mr Gauke’s final report is published later this year,Labourshould have the courage of its convictions and act on it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromSimon RewTue 18 Feb 2025 12.25 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 12.27 ESTShareI look with horror and outrage not only at the patronising and hypocritical words of JD Vance in Munich (JD Vance stuns Munich conference with blistering attack on Europe’s leaders, 14 February) but also at the apparent attempt by Donald Trump to effect peace between Ukraine and Russia without including either Ukraine or Europe more generally (Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire, 12 February).A peace that prevents any more bloodshed can only be a good thing, but it cannot be a carve-up in whichVladimir Putinachieves the victory that Ukrainians have so gallantly deprived him of on the battlefield. Or in which Ukraine is impoverished and emasculated by a greedy US and irredentist Russia.Moreover, if Europe and, by extension, the UK, are to be excluded from negotiations on the future ofUkraineand the continent, under no circumstances should British or other European troops be used in a peacekeeping role.The idea that Trump thinks he can cut a deal with Putin, rob Ukraine of her mineral wealth and then leaveEuropeto pick up the pieces is disgraceful beyond belief. We should not fall for it.It is unacceptable that British lives be risked for the knavery of Trump and his acolytes. If the US wants European troops on the ground, we get a place at the negotiating table. No ifs, no buts. No taxation without representation: is that not a founding principle of US democracy?William SeafordNewportIfDonald Trumpis determined to upend post-1945 international structures, as seems likely given his vice-president’s speech, then both sides of the Atlantic need to contemplate the full meaning of a transactional approach to security. Maybe British politicians will stop kidding themselves about the so-called special relationship, which has only ever been special to the Americans when it suited them. At the same time, perhaps someone can inform Trump that it is a mistake to evaluate defence alliances like real-estate deals.Should the president pay a visit to the UK, as Keir Starmer seems to hope, I suggest he be taken to visit the Iraq and Afghanistan memorial in Victoria Embankment Gardens, London, where he’ll be reminded of the626 UK military personnelwho died in furtherance of American wars in those countries between 2001 and 2014. Given the popular reverence for veterans in the US, the Maga movement might find our military sacrifice is one of the few aspects of the North Atlantic alliance it can’t easily dismiss.If Trump then still ditches Europe in favour of deals with Putin, it needs to be made clear that self-interest works on both sides. The US won’t be able to expect its former allies to fall in line behind it in the same way it has commanded since the end of the second world war.Mark CottleMaesygwartha, MonmouthshireAs Simon Tisdallpointed outa year ago in the Observer, the UK cannot maintain its Trident nuclear deterrent without the active support of the United States. There now appears a high risk that the US will want to be able to veto the use of Trident by the UK and/or to extract a high price for any continued support. Isn’t it time to think about mothballing Trident and redirecting that funding to conventional defence capacity in Europe?Simon RewLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Not only would this be incorrect as a matter of fact, but it would also undermine our system of justice, under which the case for each side is fully and objectively presented before a decision is made by an impartial and independent tribunal.Against this background, it is sad indeed to see the deeply personal and indeed venomous attacks which have recently been launched against the attorney general and other lawyers – whether they have been advising or representing government, or others, or advancing a case in opposition to government.Those who state or imply that, in doing this, the lawyers are advancing their own personal opinions, are doing immense and untold damage, not only to our legal system but to society as a whole. They are undermining the rule of law and opening a path towards a society in which the public no longer trust the legal system or the individuals who participate in it.The fact that such developments are becoming more widespread around the world makes it all the more crucial that we should uphold the rule of law in our own country.Stephen Hockman KC and Sam Townend KCFormer chairs, Bar CouncilChristina Blacklaws and I Stephanie BoyceFormer presidents, Law SocietyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

To Celtic, all the plaudits following a heroic showing in Bavaria.ThisCelticperformance ranks among the finest by a Scottish team away from home in Europe in living memory. Extra-time felt the least they deserved after taking a second‑half lead. They were denied by a horrible, scrappy goal claimed by Alphonso Davies after a Cameron Carter-Vickers clearance flew back off him from all of two yards. Just 30 seconds of stoppage time remained. Celtic have grown in this Champions League. In Munich, they came of age. This outcome was so cruel on them.Bayern Munich 1-1 Celtic (agg: 3-2): Champions League playoff round, second leg – liveRead moreBayern supposedly have redemption on their mind after the penalty shootout defeat by Chelsea when European club football’s showpiece occasion was last held at the Allianz Arena, 13 years ago. Vincent Kompany watched with increasing anxiety as even a last-16 spot looked in serious doubt. Celtic can reflect so positively on that when the dust settles. But in the short term, aggregate defeat by the odd goal in five stung so much.Celtic’s scepticism over the prospect of Harry Kane missing this game proved justified. The England captain sat out training on Monday to assist his recovery from a facial injury sustained in the weekend draw with Bayer Leverkusen. Within 10 minutes he had already tested Kasper Schmeichel with a deflected effort. The teams had traded opportunities by that point; Serge Gnabry headed wide from a Michael Olise cross, with the Celtic captain, Callum McGregor, wasting a shot after a driving run from midfield.With a controlled, composed start to proceedings Celtic should have taken the lead. Instead, three wonderful chances were passed up within two minutes. Fine play on the left flank by Jota preceded the Portuguese attacker picking out Nicolas Kühn. Manuel Neuer was beaten by Kühn’s attempt but Raphaël Guerreiro was on hand to clear from the goalline.Next came a teasing Arne Engels cross that narrowly evaded the outstretched Daizen Maeda. Brendan Rodgers was still cursing those moments when Dayot Upamecano shanked a clearance straight to the feet of Engels. The Belgian fed Maeda, who had more time than he realised for a shot that sailed over Neuer’s crossbar.View image in fullscreenNicolas Kühn puts Celtic in front on the night against his former club.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAA quarter of the way through the match, Bayern were unquestionably spooked by the ferocity of Celtic’s press. Beyond that, Celtic looked admirably assured in possession.Joshua Kimmich missed the target as Bayern tried to settle an unconvinced crowd. For a team holding an overall lead, added to course and distance specialism, Bayern’s untidiness was curious. Gnabry had Leon Goretzka bearing down on goal, five minutes before the break, and he somehow passed straight into the hands of Schmeichel.We had a cup tie, in which one of European football’s powerhouses were being made to look hilariously ordinary. Kane almost broke the mould, handing Bayern what would have been a totally undeserved half-time lead, but struck the bar from Josip Stanisic’s cut-back. It was the visiting support who roared their side off at the break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Celtic midfielder waited far too long to shoot from close range, allowing Bayern to clear. This time, the home team did respond appropriately as Schmeichel was forced into a smart block from Goretzka. Rodgers introduced Adam Idah for Jota on the hour, due to the latter’s fitness rather than performance. By this time Bayern were dominating the ball without particularly troubling Schmeichel. Olise summed that up, his tame strike comfortably held by the Danish goalkeeper.Celtic’s moment was imminent. Maeda won possession on the left, his pass to Kühn initially cut out by Kim Min-jae. The defender’s attempted block was unconvincing, though, and allowed Kühn to collect possession. The 25-year-old made no mistake with only Neuer to beat. Celtic’s euphoria contrasted with boos from the Bayern following. Kompany removed Gnabry – who had been hopeless – and Guerreiro. Leroy Sané and Davies had the task of shaking life into Bayern.Maeda headed at Neuer as Celtic glanced at dreamland. In Sané’s first involvement a glorious pass found no takers in the six-yard box. Goretzka headed a Kimmich cross wide, moments after Olise appealed in vain for a penalty following a challenge from Jeffrey Schlupp. This was a sign of Bayern’s desperation. As Schmeichel batted away a deflected Kimmich cross, that sentiment grew.A series of Bayern corners stepped up the pressure on Celtic’s defence before Schmeichel denied Goretzka from open play. Carter-Vickers pounced on the loose ball, only to see it ricochet back off Davies. The Celtic players slumped en masse to their knees. Only those with rocks for hearts would offer no sympathy.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

However, he conceded that the situation is still not ideal and his team will need an “almost perfect” performance at the Santiago Bernabéu to progress. “At the least,” the City manager said, “we have to give them a fright”.Asked aboutJude Bellingham’s sending-offon Saturday, the mana­ger revealed that after eight years in England “I still haven’t worked out the difference between fuck off and fuck you – but what ­matters is the intention, not the insult [itself]”.Real Madrid’s referee conspiracies overshadow Manchester City’s visitRead moreThe Bernabéu was a place, Guardiola said, where he had good memories and he was quick to insist that while the pressure would be intense and there would be moments of “suffering”, the same was true when his side travelled to Barcelona, Anfield or Arsenal, and he would not have it any other way.“Against teams of that level, no matter what the stage, the pressure is there but it is more than welcome,” he said. “You cannot perform well without pressure. It is what it is and it is not the first time; it will depend on how we handle it. What I have learnt [from previous visits] is that you have to play with courage, you have to be yourself. You have to have that mentality, you have to play to win, otherwise … you can lose [still], but you must be yourself.”As a coach here, Guardiola’s Barcelona team defeated Real Madridin the 2011 Champions League semi-finalandput six past themin their most resonant victory in La Liga. However, having lost the first leg 3-2 at home last week, none of the results he has secured here as City manager would be sufficient to see them through and after the first leg he said they had only a 1% chance. Carlo Ancelotti said he did not buy that, dismissing suggestions that Madrid’s chances stood at 99%, and claiming he would ask Guardiola if he really believed that his hopes were so small.Now, seven days on, it seems Guardiola does not, even if he did admit: “We have to change a lot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Verstappen fell foul of the rules last season when he was given a community service punishmentfor swearing in a press conference.Max Verstappen threatens to quit F1 after ‘silly’ punishment for swearingRead moreAsked if he believed the FIA agenda was misjudged, the world champion’s answer was clear. “Everyone has that feeling,” Verstappen said, and he was equally emphatic over whether it was failing to focus on matters that are important to drivers. “To drivers, teams. Improvement of the sport in general.”Verstappen was speaking at the F175 event held at London’s O2 Arena, where all 10 teams had gathered for the first time to unveil their liveries for the new season which marks the 75th anniversary ofFormula One.The 27-year-old was determined that the FIA should open a dialogue on the issue of swearing, which it has so far refused to do. “I am not going to tell you how you should behave in life,” he said. “It’s important we have a discussion about this but we need help from others, teams, promoters. We can have a proper discussion about this.”While teams met the press in London, the FIA dropped its own bombshell announcing that it was considering imposing a mandatory number of pit stops at the Monaco Grand Prix, with “the aim of promoting better racing”.At a meeting of the Formula One Commission on Tuesday it was agreed to consider a minimum number of stops at Monaco. The proposal will now be discussed in the next few weeks by F1’s sporting advisory committee, which will include representatives from the teams.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton steps out in Ferrari red at the O2 Arena.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesMonaco held its first grand prix in 1929 but has come increasingly under fire in recent years, with the width and weight of modern cars making overtaking all but impossible on the narrow streets.The Mercedes driver George Russell, meanwhile, said he would maintain his robust approach to battling Verstappen on track this year after the pair endured a very public and bitter spat at the end of last season. Russell claimed Verstappen had threatened to put his “fucking head in the wall” and responded by accusing the Dutchman of being a bully who wasincapable of dealing with adversity. The pair have not spoken since the finale in Abu Dhabi last season.“I haven’t spoken [to him],” Russell said. “Things got out of line at the end of last year, and I made it pretty clear that I’m not going to take it. Now it’s 2025 and I’m focused on the job and the job is to win. So I’m not going to change my approach, fighting him, or fighting any other drivers.”Lewis Hamilton, making his first public appearance outside Italy as a Ferrari driver, said he felt “invigorated” by the challenge of joining a new team. “I feel so full of life and so much energy because everything is new,” Hamilton told fans. “I’m so proud to be part of the team, something new and exciting.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenGeorge RussellMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Someone said you were dead!”Although did anyone seriously think the Champions Trophy was toast? They say cockroaches and microbes would survive a nuclear apocalypse but there is every chance international cricket’s 50‑overtournoiwould also spring up in the wasteland, glowing with radiation but still ready to stick its presumably mutated winners in those Miami Vice-style white blazers and deliver that sweet, sweet broadcast money.Champions Trophy cricket: team-by-team guide to the tournamentRead moreThat might be a bit harsh. The Champions Trophy has always been a fun, punchy affair, its eight editions to date throwing up seven different winners since it first appeared in 1998. Even South Africa have won one, although England, somehow, have not. And while the full‑scale 50-over World Cup has become a seven-week test of endurance, little brother does not muck about. Starting in Karachi on Wednesday, the hosts taking on New Zealand, this one features 15 matches in just 19 days. Ideal.It is just that in the T20 era – ie, the two World Cups era – the Champions Trophy has been hard to take as seriously given its diminished status and repeat resurrections. Neither edition from 2013 and 2017 in England were the original plan, rather fallback positions when thoughts of creating a World Test Championship with semi-finals were aborted. With a WTC now in the calendar, this latest return is solely about servicing a £3bn television deal that apparentlymusthave at least one men’s event a year.But then the Champions Trophy has always been about the money, its very genesis being as a device to bridge the revenue gap between 50‑over World Cups. Australia, New Zealand and West Indies have never hosted, you will note, their time zones not juicy enough for TV. It was also supposed to take the sport to emerging territories, the debut in pre-Test status Bangladesh and then Kenya in 2000, only for the full members to take over. Associate nations have not even appeared at one since 2004.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Special Security Unit stand guard outside the National Bank Stadium, which hosts the opening match of the tournament.Photograph: Akhtar Soomro/ReutersThis latest Champions Trophy, which is televised on Sky Sports, features the top eight from the 2023 World Cup group stage, qualifying criteria that became public knowledge only halfway through it. The InternationalCricketCouncil and the broadcaster Star even pondered converting it into a T20 at one stage, only to be swayed by concerns this would reopen a four‑year gap between 50-over World Cups and possibly hasten the one-day format’s demise.And yet for all of its baseline confection – the tournament is the ICC in microcosm, one could argue – this Champions Trophy is also a hugely significant moment for the sport. Pakistan is hosting its first global men’s event for 28 years, the latest milestone on the long road out of security-dictated isolation that was first paved by the creation of the Pakistan Super League and the slow return of bilateral tours to the country.Pakistan are also defending champions, even if there are just two survivors – Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman – from that giddy 180-run walloping of India at the Oval in 2017.According to the board president, Mohsin Naqvi, the country is just desperate to show off its warm hospitality and has poured an estimated £16m into refurbishing the stadiums in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. ICC deadlines for the upgrades were beaten like an Indiana Jones hat-swipe.View image in fullscreenPakistan are the defending champions having won the last edition of the tournament eight years ago.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/ReutersThe only catch? As widely expected when Pakistan were awarded the tournament in late 2021, India are not setting foot in the country after citing their own security concerns. This means thesuperclasicoagainst Pakistan, the biggest money spinner, will take place in Dubai, likewise India’s other Group A games against New Zealand and Bangladesh. Even the final will be moved from Lahore to the desert should Rohit Sharma’s men get that far. Like the T20 World Cup last year, when India were down to play the Guyana semi-final regardless, things are worked out around cricket’s superpower.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Australia,South AfricaandEngland are all feeling squeamishabout having to play Afghanistan, given the Taliban’s grim regime of female oppression back home. The sport has already muddled through three men’s World Cups with Afghanistan since the fall of Kabul in 2021, however, and individual boycotts appear unlikely. Full member rights trump human rights, it seems.As for the contenders, India begin as favourites, ready to unite the Champions Trophy with the T20 World Cup thatSharma and Jay Shah lifted in Barbados last year. Having thrashed England 7-1 across eight white‑ball internationals these past few weeks, they are in ominous touch too. It could even become a golden farewell for two 50-over greats, with Sharma, 37, and Virat Kohli, 36, having already called time on T20 internationals.India’s decision not to play in Pakistan also brings a tactical advantage. While every other team had to select 15-man squads that considered conditions across multiple venues – including that hop to the United Arab Emirates – India’s planning can focus on one ground and one surface. A phalanx of spinners has been duly selected, though sadly Jasprit Bumrah’s whip-crack wizardry will be missing to rest a sore back.View image in fullscreenIndia enter the tournament as favourites having won the 2024 T20 World Cup but will play all their games in the United Arab Emirates.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAAs the reigning 50-over world champions, Australia should be the top seeds but have lost Pat Cummins (ankle), Josh Hazlewood (hip) and Mitchell Starc (personal reasons) – their first men’s global tournament without any of the trio since 2011. They will probably go far. Even if slightly eroded, home advantage should assist Mohammad Rizwan’s Pakistan, the world’s third-ranked ODI side, while South Africa, runners-up in the T20 World Cup last year, look a value bet. Who knows, perhaps the form-bereft England will spring into life on the flatter surfaces.It all starts on Wednesday and ends on Sunday 9 March, location TBC. One thing we can be sure of is that the Champions Trophy will return again after this one, with India already slated to host in 2029. Because this thing is utterly indestructible.Explore more on these topicsICC Champions TrophyPakistan cricket teamIndia cricket teamAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That awkward away assignment is followed by a visit to Manchester City on Sunday. Arsenal took four points from their trips to Villa Park and the Etihad Stadium and Slot believes Liverpool’s position will be even stronger if they equal or better that return. Failing that, the head coach will take consolation in the Anfield factor, with seven of his team’s final 11 league games at home.‘Buckle up and enjoy the ride’: Van Dijk backs Liverpool to handle title pressureRead moreSlot said: “As a manager you never think: ‘After 25 games how many points will we be clear or behind?’ You only think about winning as many games as you can and implementing a certain playing style to get as many wins as you can. You never know how other teams will do and the fixture list also decides how things will work out.“These two games we are going to play now have already been played byArsenal– Villa away and City away. Then we can make a difference in the upcoming two games. If not, then we are on equal terms because we have played a lot of similar games and there are still 11 games to go. The positive thing is that, after these two games, we’ve got seven home games and four away. And we all know how much Anfield can help us.”Slot admitted that Liverpool’s performance level had dipped in the past two league outings, against Wolves and Everton. However, he insisted that was a consequence of allowing David Moyes’s team “to play their pattern” inthe Merseyside derbyand the knock-on emotional effect of James Tarkowski’s 98th-minute equaliser. Slot suggested that four points from two below-par displays could prove crucial.Asked whether Liverpool were in a difficult moment, the manager said: “Was it one and a half weeks ago that we completely outplayed Spurs?I don’t count Plymouth. I agree the last two performances were not the same level we had at West Ham away or Tottenham at home but are weTottenham 4-0 win at homeor are we the Everton team? I think we are somewhere in between.“If there’s any experience I’ve learned of winning a league title [with Feyenoord] it is that, if there are 38 games to be played, you don’t expect to play fantastic football 38 times. If you are a very good team and a special team you play 20-25 very good games, a few mediocre ones and you play a few very bad ones.“But it is more about the results in the mediocre or bad ones than the 20-25 because they are ones you will probably win.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marcus Smith missed two straightforward kicks againstLes Bleusin the second half, hooking both left, before Fin Smith took over and kicked crucial conversions in the 71st and 80th minutes.Marcus Smith was also off-target with a conversion against Ireland, again dragging it left, leaving him with a 57.14% success rate in the tournament. Last year Smith revealed he adoptedmilitary breathing techniquesin an effort to improve his goal-kicking after costly misses in the two-Test series defeat by the All Blacks.Fin Smithoffered his namesake his staunch backingas an “unbelievable goal-kicker” last week and revealed the decision to make the change against France came about when the assistant coach Kevin Sinfield came on to the field carrying his tee, saying he and Marcus did not discuss it at the time.View image in fullscreenMarcus Smith missed with this penalty against France and almost missed a conversion but will be back on kicking duty against Scotland.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThat explanation was at odds with Borthwick’s, who said after the match that “the players make the decisions on the grass”, but after sticking with the Smiths in their dual playmaking roles for Saturday’s match, the head coach said it was an easy decision to keep Marcus on duty as England seek to end a four-match losing run against Scotland.“He’s a world-class goal-kicker. We all know that, so it’s very simple,” said Borthwick. “Marcus is a gamechanger. Marcus is a player with incredible ability. Sometimes, the opposition focuses very much on him. Sometimes, that creates space for others. Sometimes, there will be a window for him to find. With Fin Smith and Marcus Smith, we have two ball-players, two people who see space in the frontline and in the backfield, and that’s going to be very important this weekend.”Borthwick has made one change to his side to face Scotland, with Ollie Chessum coming in at lock in place of George Martin. Chessum impressed from the bench against France and will make his first start in 11 months after knee and shoulder injuries ruled him out of the autumn internationals and the summer tour of Japan and New Zealand respectively.Chessum does not bring the same heft as Martin but is a more seasoned lineout operator – an area where England struggled against France in the first half. “He had a very good impact from the bench in the French game, with the way he played in that last 20 or 30 minutes,” added Borthwick of Chessum. “He played really well and he is gradually looking fitter and stronger after having a period of absence through injury. So, it is less about a tactical and technical decision and more the feel that this is just the right game for him to start and George Martin to be on the bench.View image in fullscreenOllie Chessum (centre) replaces George Martin in the second row for England, the one change to the starting XV.Photograph: Julian Finney/RFU/The RFU Collection/Getty Images“He’s grown into a lineout leader and caller which wasn’t something he’d done previously, he’s applying himself diligently to do that. All that points to a guy who wants to improve himself. He has the respect of everybody, he’s had a couple of injury setbacks and worked incredibly diligently to get back. When he walked back into the squad you could see how happy everyone else was. He has a presence and a positivity about him that rubs off on everyone else.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The quest is to find signals that forewarn of the greatest climate catastrophes the climate crisis could trigger. Tipping points occur when global temperature is pushed beyond a threshold, leading to unstoppable changes in the climate system.Theprogramme focuses on two tipping pointsthought to be at very high risk of being triggered: the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, which would lead to a huge rise in sea levels, and the collapse of crucial ocean currents in the north Atlantic, which would cause global changes in rainfall and severely damage food supplies.Scientists have alreadydetected signalsindicating that systems such as theAmazon rainforestand thewest Antarctic ice sheetare becoming less stable. But researchers are unable to make useful forecasts of when a tipping point is likely to be passed.World on brink of five ‘disastrous’ climate tipping points, study findsRead moreEstablishing whether that is even possible is the first task for the five-year Aria programme. Tipping points are inherently complex and depend on many factors. Having a chance of success requires much better ocean and ice data, from today and from the past, and better computer models.“In a similar way to how we use monitoring stations to detect and warn for tsunamis, we’re aiming to establish networks of climate monitoring systems to detect early signs of critical shifts in our climate,” said Gemma Bale and Sarah Bohndiek, the Aria programme directors co-leading the programme. “Through these systems, we can equip decision-makers with the data they need to confront the threat of abrupt climate change head on.”Scientists have identified at least16 dangerous tipping points, from northern permafrost collapse to a shift in the west Africa monsoon, and it is possible that some may already have been passed.The aim of the Aria programme is to create an early warning system that could give a decade-level forecast of tipping points being triggered where possible. Such a warning would be a huge incentive for the world to accelerate climate action, said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter and the leader of one of the Aria teams. Even if the tipping point could not be stopped, a warning would give precious time for society to prepare for the major impacts.Lenton said the £81m in total funding was large in research terms: “But it’s a small amount of money compared to the costs of the consequences of crossing one or both of the tipping points.”The Aria programme targets the Greenland ice sheet and the sub-polar gyre (SPG), which is a component of the globally importantAtlantic meridional overturning circulation. Fleets of small, high-speed, vertical takeoff and landing drones, deployed from robotic hangars, will be developed by one project to collect better data in Greenland. Another team is working onautonomous devicesthat move up and down through the ocean while collecting data on the SPG.The stakes are high, said Dr Bieito Fernández Castro, at the University of Southampton, who is leading the latter project: “The UK and northern Europe could experience much harsher winters, similar to parts of Canada [if the SPG collapses], while the east coast of the US could see dramatic sea level rises.”‘We don’t know where the tipping point is’: climate expert on potential collapse of Atlantic circulationRead morePlankton are the ocean’s pulse, according to another team, and tracking their changes could make them “canaries in the coalmine”. The researchers willattach holographic plankton imaging devices, integrated with artificial intelligence, to container ships, new underwater robots and to filter-feeding ocean giants, such as whales.Dr Clare Ostle, at the Marine Biological Association and part of the team, said: “By blending cutting-edge technology with decades of global-scale plankton monitoring, we’re creating a system that doesn’t just observe change, but predicts critical ocean shifts.”The melting rate of the Greenland ice sheet is critical information, and one team will collect the data by developing hardened cosmic-ray neutron sensors suitable for the harsh environment. Another project will deploy a network of sensitive seismic instruments that can measure runoff by listening to the vibrations caused by flowing water.The project led by Lenton aims to use progress in theory, mathematics and AI to identify the critical measurements needed in the oceans to detect an SPG tipping point, which could then guide the teams in the field. One hypothesis is that a specific three-dimensional pattern of ocean temperature and salinity could be a telltale sign.Anotherproject will develop highly detailed computer simulationstrained on real-world data to test the reliability of potential early warning signals. “We will make use of real-world examples of past tipping points to better understand these events,” said Prof David Thornalley at University College London.More powerful modelswill be developed by another team, aiming to pinpoint when and where climate tipping points might occur.“Forecasting tipping points is a formidable challenge,” said Dr Reinhard Schiemann, at the University of Reading. “But the fantastic range of teams tackling this challenge from different angles, yet working together in a coordinated fashion, makes this programme a unique opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisResearchHigher educationArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Each year, around the world, such farms usemore than 60 millioncleaner fish to eat – or “clean” – parasites off other fish. But the natural habitat of the cleaner fish is the reef.On a reef, each cleaner fish has clients that visit them to have their parasites removed – sometimes much bigger fish or predators such as sharks and rays. I was intrigued to discover the cleaner fish would gently massage these clients with their fins and make sure they were comfortable.View image in fullscreenA ballan wrasse swollen with eggs. The fish is used to remove  sea lice from farmed salmon.Photograph: David Ainsley/Coastal Communities NetworkSome fish seem to feel so pampered by the cleaner fish, they go back again and again for more – one Australian study has found that some will visit a cleaner fish up to144 times a day, on average. There’s no way those fish are doing that just to get rid of parasites, so one can only assume they are also doing it for pleasure.Each cleaner fish can get about 2,000 clients a day. They tend to give the predators the most caressesSometimes, the cleaner fish will nudge their clients as if to say: this is what I want you to do. And then their clients – even huge fish such as the grouper – will happily spread their fins or open their mouths, and the cleaner fish will go inside, which I find extraordinary.Grouper fish will even protect cleaner fish from predators by closing their mouth with the cleaner inside. Then the grouper will open its mouth just enough for the cleaner fish to escape into a hiding place.View image in fullscreenA potato cod grouper with a bluestreak cleaner wrasse cleaning inside its mouth on the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyCleaner fish will occasionally nip their clients, to get mucus from the fish, which we think has nutritional value. But they have to be careful, because they can lose potential clients who witness that behaviour.Even though each cleaner fish can getabout 2,000 clients a day, they are intelligent enough to differentiate between these clients, recognise them and remember their last interaction with them, much like a hairdresser. They tend to be more cooperative with clients near their home range, because they are more likely to encounter them again.‘Heartbreaking’: Iceland’s pioneering female fishing guides fear for wild salmonRead moreIt is as if they are aware of their reputation and know that if they cheat somebody, they won’t come back. They also tend to give the predators more caresses than most clients.Cleaner fish are increasingly sought after by salmon farms because they remove sea lice and are seen as the biological alternative to anti-parasitic chemical treatments. This has led to a rapid rise in their wild capture and subsequent release in salmon farms.I’m campaigning for legal protection for these fish, because no one has done a proper assessment of the impact of removing cleaner fish from Scottish reefs or whether the reef ecology is going to survive if we keep removing them.View image in fullscreenMelanie Watt is concerned at how ‘brave, highly intelligent creatures are being sacrificed’ to supply commercial salmon farms.Photograph: Lynne Kennedy/The GuardianAlso, many farms will kill their cleaner fish after a production cycle in the salmon farm, to stop the spread of infection. I find it upsetting that these brave, highly intelligent creatures, who are very social and do good work on the reef, are being sacrificed to improve the welfare of another fish that is being commercially produced. It’s a very wasteful and inhumane practice – and I hope one day to put a stop to it.Melanie Watt is a campaigner for legal rights to protect cleaner fish and the health of our reefs.

They are being challenged by red states and the fossil fuel industry, which are also fighting against accountability-focused climate lawsuits waged by governments and youth environmentalists.On day one of his second term, the US president affirmed hisloyalty to the oil industrywith a spate of executive actions to roll back environmental protections and a pledge to “drill, baby, drill”. The ferocity of his anti-environment agenda has inspired unprecedented interest in climate accountability, said Jamie Henn, director of the anti-oil and gas non-profit Fossil Free Media.“I think Trump’s election has turbocharged the ‘make polluters pay’ movement,” said Henn, who has been a leader in the campaign for a decade.From showers to tiny fish to windmills, Trump’s climate policies are driven by fixationsRead moreMore state lawmakers are writing legislative proposals to force oil companies to pay for climate disasters, while law firms are helping governments sue the industry. And youth activists are working on a new legal challenge to the Trump administration’s pro-fossil fuel policies.Industry interests, however, are also attempting to kill those accountability efforts – and Trump may embolden them.The state of Vermont in May passed afirst-of-its-kind lawholding fossil fuel firms financially responsible for climate damages and New York passed a similar measure in December.The policies force oil companies to pay for climate impacts to which their emissions have contributed. Known as “climate superfund” bills, they are loosely modeled on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Superfund program.Similar bills are being considered in Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts and now Rhode Island, where a measure was introduced last week. A policy will also soon be introduced in California, where recent deadly wildfires haverevived the callfor the proposal after one was weighed last year.Minnesota and Oregon lawmakers are also considering introducing climate superfund acts. And since inauguration day, activists and officials in a dozen other states have expressed interest in doing the same, said Henn.“I think people are really latching on to this message and this approach right now,” Henn said. “It finally gives people a way to respond to climate disasters, and it’s something that we can do without the federal government.”View image in fullscreenA small tractor clears water from a business as flood waters block a street, in Barre, Vermont, on 12 July 2023.Photograph: Charles Krupa/APProgressives introduced a federal climate superfund act last year. But with Republicans in control of the White House and both branches of Congress, it has a “less than zero chance of passing”, said Michael Gerrard, the faculty director of the Sabin center for climate change law at Columbia University.The state laws are already facing pushback in the courts. This month, 22 red states and two oil trade groups sued to block New York’s climate superfund law.“This bill is an attempt by New York to step into the shoes of the federal government to regulate something that they have absolutely no business regulating,” West Virginia’s attorney general, John B McCuskey, who led the suit and whose state is a top coal producer,toldFox News.In late December, trade groups also filed alawsuitagainst Vermont’s climate superfund act which, if successful, could potentially topple New York’s law.Big oil spent $445m in last election cycle to influence Trump and Congress, report saysRead moreFossil fuel interests were expected to challenge the climate superfund laws even if Kamala Harris was elected president and have been boosted by Trump’s win. “I think [they] feel like they have more of a shot with the executive backing them,” said Cassidy DiPaola, spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign.It “would not be shocking” if Trump’s justice department were to file briefs in support of plaintiffs fighting the laws, said Gerrard, which could tip the scales in their favor.More legal challenges may also be on the way, and if additional states pass similar policies, they are expected to face similar lawsuits. But Henn says he is confident the laws will prevail.“I think Republicans think that they’re going to be able to just scare off local legislators or local attorneys general from pursuing a polluter pays agenda, but I think they’re wrong,” he said. “We have widespread public support for this approach. People don’t like the fossil fuel industry.”Over the last decade, states and municipalities have also broughtmore than 30 lawsuitsagainst fossil fuel interests, accusing them of intentionally covering up the climate risks of their products while seeking damages for climate impacts.As Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies move the US in “precisely the wrong direction” on the climate crisis, they will “surely inspire yet more litigation”, said Gerrard. Michigan hasannounced plansto file a suit in the coming months, and more are likely to be rolled out this year.The cases face a formidable opponent in the fossil fuel industry, which has long attempted to fend off the lawsuits. Since January, courts have dismissed litigation filed byNew Jersey,New Yorkand aMaryland city and county, saying the states lacked jurisdiction to hear the cases.Other decisions have been positive for the plaintiffs. In threedecisions since spring 2023, the supreme court turned down petitions from the fossil fuel industry to move the venue of the lawsuits from the state courts where they were originally filed, to federal courts which are seen as more friendly to the industry.How US states are leading the climate fight – despite Trump’s rollbacksRead moreLast week, a court in Colorado heard argumentsover the same issuein a lawsuit filed by the city of Boulder. The outcome will have major implications for the future of the challenge.Trump haspledgedto put an end to the wave of lawsuits, which he has called “frivolous”. During his first term, his administration filed influential briefs in the casessupportingthe oil companies – something his justice department could do again. “It’s clear where their allegiances are,” said Gerrard. “And if they file briefs that would be good for the defendants.”Alyssa Johl, vice-president and general counsel of the Center for Climate Integrity, which tracks and supports the lawsuits, said: “There is still a long road ahead for these efforts, but the path forward is clear.”“As communities grapple with the increasingly devastating consequences of big oil’s decades-long deception, the need for accountability is greater than ever,” she said.Youth-led litigationAnother climate-focused legal movement that is gaining steam: youth-led challenges against state and federal government agencies, for allegedly violating constitutional rights with pro-fossil fuel policies.Trump’s second term presents an important moment for these lawsuits, said Julia Olson, founder of the law firm Our Children’s Trust, which brought the litigation. While some lawyers will fight each rollback individually, her strategy could “secure systemic change”, she said.View image in fullscreenJulia Olson stands with youth plaintiffs in Eugene, Oregon.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyOn Wednesday, a US judgerejectedan Our Children’s Trust suit filed by California youth against the EPA, saying the challengers failed to show that they had been injured by the federal body. Olson said the judge “misapplied the law”.That same day, the most well-known Our Children’s Trust case, Juliana v United States – in which 21 young people sued the federal government – suffered a blow. In December, the plaintiffs filed a petition with the supreme court to send the case back to trial after it was tossed out. The US solicitor general has now filed a brief opposing their petition; Olson said it “mischaracterized” the case.Our Children’s Trust’s lawsuits have in other instances seen major victories. In December, Montana’s supreme court upheld a landmark climate ruling in favor of young plaintiffs, which said the state was violating youths’ constitutional right to a clean environment by permitting fossil fuel projects with no regard for global warming.That victory in a pro-fossil fuel red state, said Olson, inspires hope that children could win a lawsuit against a conservative, oil and gas-friendly federal government.She is working on another lawsuit against the Trump administration, whose “brazen” anti-environment agenda could bolster the challengers’ arguments, she said.“These policies will kill children … and by making his agenda obvious, I think that he helps us make that clear.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocracy and justiceUS Environmental Protection AgencyMinnesotaOregonVermontDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Labour made a manifesto commitment to halt new North Sea licensing, but Rosebank and some other projects had already been licensed and were awaiting final approval when the party won the general election.Documents seen by the Guardian show the industry group Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) asking for Rosebank and other oilfields’ “scope three emissions” – those caused by the burning of extracted oil and gas – to be treated differently because that was the point of their business.A court caserecently foundthe licence granted to Rosebank by the previous government was unlawful as it failed to take these emissions into account.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, isdecidinghow companies respond to a landmark supreme court ruling which last year decreed oil and gas firms have to account for the scope three emissions caused by the extracted fossil fuels being burned, rather than just the greenhouse gas emissions caused by building the extraction sites.A consultation is being conducted into the guidance these companies will be given on this issue by the government. This will essentially decide whether the fossil fuel licences which were issued by the previous government can go ahead.OEUK’s submission to the government argues that its business is different from others in that the end product – oil and gas – inevitably produces scope three emissions as the end result is almost always the burning of these fossil fuels. It suggests the guidance written by the government should take this into account.The group writes that draft guidance does not take into account the “relatively unusual nature of oil and gas projects; namely, that the very purpose of such a project is to produce hydrocarbons primarily for use, through combustion, as an energy source. This aspect of oil and gas projects should be recognised as relevant when approaching EIA and environmental statements.”The oil and gas industry argues that it is unfair to treat it the same as other companies such as car manufacturers because cars can reduce scope three emissions with more efficient engines, but a barrel of oil or therm of gas cannot have the eventual emissions from its combustion reduced. It argues that as gas will be used for energy for decades to come, it should not be precluded from producing it for scope three emissions reasons.Climate experts have said this should not be a mitigating factor as the point of scope three assessments is to prevent excessive carbon emissions such as those from burning fossil fuels.Patrick Galey, senior fossil fuels investigator at Global Witness, said: “The fossil fuel industry is the main driver of climate breakdown, and scope three emissions make up the vast majority of its planet-warming pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s staggering that it now has the audacity to beg for additional privileges on emissions.“Oil and gas producers are essentially saying: it’s not our fault our products are so polluting, as if they have no role in spending billions each year in producing them. If it really cared about carbon emissions, the industry would undergo arapid and just transitionaway from fossil fuels. Instead, it seems hellbent on bending the rules to keep spewing out climate-wrecking pollution.”Tessa Khan, founder of Uplift, the group which brought the successful court case against Rosebank, said: “As our courts have recognised, it is inevitable that the oil and gas in projects like Rosebank will be burned and that this will create carbon emissions. So it is vital that any credible assessment of the environmental harm caused by new oil and gas fields focuses on the climate impact of burning the oil and gas that they contain. The whole point of those projects is to extract and burn their reserves.”OEUK declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsOil and gas companiesClimate crisisEnergyEd MilibandnewsShareReuse this content"

The tribunal found that it was. The prime minister and foreign secretary were denying things that the claimant believed to be true, based on what she had observed in the course of her work.”The tribunal also backed Stewart’s claim for unfair dismissal. It said: “The tribunal considered that no reasonable employer, acting reasonably, could base a decision to dismiss an employee in the claimant’s position on a process which failed to engage in any way with the case that she was putting forward. This was sufficient to lead the tribunal to conclude that the dismissal was unfair.”But the panel did accept that it was “unavoidable” that she was suspended from her job “while her security clearance was reviewed, as she was required to have such clearance”.Stewart’s solicitors, James and West, a legal firm that specialises in whistleblowing, said the judgment was “groundbreaking”, as it was the first case of its kind to establish that a civil servant was protected for disclosures to the media.Stewart, 44, who had worked at the FCDO office for seven years, said: “My experience of the FCDO crisis centre in August 2021 reflected the worst of our political system. By calling this out, I lost my career. The outcome of this case doesn’t change any of this, but it has achieved what I set out to achieve: it has established that civil servants have the right not to stay silent when systemic failures put lives at risk, as happened during the Afghan evacuation.“We can’t have a system that stays stay silent no matter what you see, and forces dedicated public servants to choose between their conscience and their career.”Cathy James, Stewart’s solicitor, said: “Today, the employment tribunal has vindicated my client’s actions and upheld her rights. This is an important win not just for Ms Stewart but for civil servants, the public interest, and democracy.”Millar said in submissions to the panel that Stewart’s whistleblowing related to “the endangerment of the safety and lives of extremely vulnerable people in danger of retribution from the Taliban at any moment, and a government communications strategy which concealed how badly the UK government let those people down”.An FCDO spokesperson said: “We will review the findings of the tribunal and consider next steps.”Explore more on these topicsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeCivil serviceMilitaryBoris JohnsonAfghanistanBBCForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

We should never be associated with our clients’ opinions or behaviour simply because we represent them. Not only is the cab rank rule the profession’s cornerstone, it also underpins access to justice.”Hermer has been criticised in sections of the media over the people he defended in a court as a barrister, including theIslamist terrorist Abid Naseer, who plotted an attack on a Manchester shopping centre.He has also been condemned for having represented the former Sinn Féin leaderGerry Adamsand over claims he defended thedisgraced lawyer Phil Shinerwhile he was under investigation by the solicitors’ watchdog.Hermer’s allies have pointed out that during his 30-year career he also represented a British soldier killed by IRA terrorists, injured service personnel in the Iraq war, veterans who took part in trials at the government’s Porton Down laboratories as well as victims of the Grenfell Tower tragedy.They said that David Wolfson, the Conservatives’ shadow attorney general, once said “the rule of law means that everyone is entitled to a defence, especially those accused of the worst offences. Don’t judge a surgeon by their patients, a journalist by their interviewees – or a lawyer by their clients.”Hermer has facedaccusations of conflicts of interest, including from the Labour MP Graham Stringer. He has declined to say whether he has recused himself from advising on matters that could affect his former clients, such as the decision to repeal the Legacy Act, whichcould result in Adams and other Irish republicans receiving compensation.The Guardian has seen a letter from the prime minister’s independent ethics adviser, Laurie Magnus, sent last week saying there was no basis for an investigation. Under longstanding convention that successive Conservative attorneys general abided by, government law officers do not disclose what they advise ministers on and areas where they have been recused.Hermer has also resisted pressure to publish details about his earnings beyond what he is required to disclose in the House of Lords register. Previous attorneys general have had to abide by the stricter transparency rules in the Commons.Many of the attacks on Hermer are implicitly grounded in his politics and his argument thatrespect for international law is vital. Critics say he is wrong to place a premium on abiding by international law in a world increasingly dominated by power politics.Maurice Glasman, the Labour peer, called Hermeran “arrogant, progressive fool who thinks that law is a replacement for politics” and called for him to be sacked.The prime minister’s official spokesperson reiterated on Monday thatStarmer had full confidence in his attorney general, but declined to say whether he would be kept in post until the end of the parliament.At prime minister’s questions last week, Starmer defended Hermer, saying: “Everybody’s entitled to legal representation in this country: that means that lawyers don’t necessarily agree with their clients.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsUK criminal justiceKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The UK is seeking the brothers’ extradition after Bedfordshire police weregranted a warrantas part of an investigation into allegations of rape and human trafficking.Andrew Tate is also facing a separate civil action from four women who have alleged rape and coercive control between 2013 and 2016.On Tuesday, the British women, who say they were victims of sexual violence by the controversial social media influencer, expressed deep concern over reports of US government involvement with the case and asked for Romanian and UK authorities to be “left alone to do their jobs”.“We are extremely concerned about reports that figures in Donald Trump’s administration are pressuring the Romanian authorities to relax travel restrictions on Andrew Tate and his brother, which would increase the risk of the Tate brothers evading justice or fleeing from the authorities in Romania and the UK,” the victims said in a statement through their lawyers, McCue Jury & Partners.“We hope that the Romanian and the UK authorities will be left alone to do their jobs,” it added.The brothers’ case was brought up by US officials in a phone call with the Romanian government last week, according to the Financial Times, which said Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, met the Romanian foreign minister at the Munich Security Conference. Both diplomats served as ambassadors to Germany during Trump’s first term.A source told the paper a request was made to return the Tates’ passports to allow them to travel during the ongoing proceedings. The Romanian foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, confirmed the US had raised the Tate brothers’ case.“Richard Grenell told me he is interested in the fate of the Tate brothers,” he told G4Media on Monday. “Later I requested a new meeting to better understand his intentions in relation to Romania, but it never took place.” Grenell said there was “no substantive conversation” with Hurezeanu.In November, Tristan Tate touted the brother’s influence on the US election, posting on X: “Millions of young men inEuropeand the USA have a healthy rightwing approach to politics that they would not have if Andrew Tate had never appeared on their phone screens. His role in this cannot be overlooked.”Matthew Jury, lawyer for the British victims, said Trump was “interfering in due process” not just in Romania, but in the UK also, where the Tates are pending extradition.“It would be embarrassing for the UK government and a complete abdication of its responsibility to the victims if it stands by and lets this continue,” said Jury.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateTrump administrationUS foreign policyRomaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Where the law is not working as we think it should be, the government will take action to tighten up the rules – and that is what we are doing,” they said.Badenoch hit back at the criticism from the lady chief justice, saying it was essential politicians could debate the outcome of such cases. “Parliament is sovereign. Politicians must be able to discuss matters of crucial public importance in parliament,” she said.Theexchange last weekreferenced reports of an appeal by the family against the decision by an immigration tribunal judge in September to dismiss their claim. A further appeal was allowed by upper tribunal judges in January.Carr said she was “deeply troubled to learn of the exchanges” at PMQs and told reporters she had written letters about her concern regarding judicial decisions. “I think it started from a question from the opposition suggesting that the decision in a certain case was wrong, and obviously the prime minister’s response to that. Both question and the answer were unacceptable,” she said.“It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary. Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process.”Carr said she had written to Starmer and to the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood.2:01PMQs: Starmer says ‘loophole’ that gave Gaza family right to live in UK will be closed – videoThe case involved a family with four children whose home in Gaza was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike. They applied for entry to the UK using theUkraineFamily Scheme to join the father’s brother, who has lived in the UK since 2007 and is a British citizen. That application was first refused in May last year after the Home Office concluded the requirements of the scheme had not been met.An upper tribunal judge then allowed the family to come to the UK on the basis of their right to a family life under the European convention on human rights (ECHR).Starmer told the Commons: “I do not agree with the decision. She’s right, it’s the wrong decision.“But, let me be clear, it should be parliament that makes the rules on immigration. It should be the government that makes the policy, that is the principle, and the home secretary is already looking at the legal loophole which we need to close in this particular case.”Badenoch wrote in a post on X that there was nothing wrong with her line of questioning. “This doesn’t compromise the independence of the judiciary. The decision to allow a family from Gaza to come to the UK was outrageous for many reasons,” she wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, also said it was wrong. He said: “The principle of the rule of law is being misused. It needs to be reclaimed. It does not, and never has meant, rule by lawyers.”Carr’s intervention also prompted criticism by some senior legal figures. Richard Ekins KC, who heads the Judicial Power project for the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange, said it was “a very ill-advised intervention”.He said: “There was nothing in the least constitutionally improper in the recent exchange between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. Neither judicial independence nor the rule of law entitle judges to be free from criticism and the lady chief justice is wrong to attempt to suppress criticism.”The former justice secretary Robert Buckland told the Guardian the context of the remarks was the climate of personal attacks in which many judges were operating. “It is certainly not the case that politicians cannot disagree with or criticise judicial decisions, but it has to be done responsibly,” Buckland said.Speaking at her annual press conference, Carr made a wider point about the public safety of the judiciary. Senior judges were often directly criticised by the Conservative administration – particularly the supreme court’s interventions on Brexit – which Starmer and Labour criticised them for in opposition.Carr said: “It is not acceptable for judges to be the subject of personal attacks for doing no more than their jobs. Their job is to find the facts on the evidence before them and apply the law as it stands to those facts.”She said matters had come to a very “dramatic and concerning head” with the attack on Judge Patrick Perusko, who had a radiator thrown at him in 2023.It is understood the government intends to respond to Carr’s letter shortly but has not yet done so. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has been tasked with looking at the application of article 8 of the ECHR in this case.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumIsrael-Gaza warGazaKeir StarmerKemi BadenochUkrainePalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

On the campaign trail last summer he claimed “Judeo-Christian values” were at the root of “everything” in Britain.On Tuesday he was addressing theAlliance for Responsible Citizenship(ARC) conference, a gathering of conservative thinkers, politicians and businesspeople from dozens of countries. Its backers include Paul Marshall, one of the owners of GB News, and Legatum, a private investment company.Reality check: the Reform UK party’s claims on the climate crisis examinedRead moreFarage told the meeting that his party’s platform was “to reindustrialise Britain”. He said: “We’ve closed down our steel industry. We think closing down the steel industry is good because it means our national CO2output is down. All that happens is the plant closes in Redcar, the plant closes in south Wales, it reopens in India under lower environmental standards, and then the steel is shipped back to us. So let’s produce all the stuff we need in this country.”Referring to oil and gas, Farage said: “Our view is that if we’re going to be using them, we may as well produce them ourselves in our own country and genuinely become energy independent”.The Reform UK leader was being interviewed on the ARC stage by Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist and rightwing political commentator. Discussingdeclining birthrates, Farage admitted he “may not necessarily be the best advocate for monogamous heterosexuality or stable marriage, having been divorced twice”.View image in fullscreenJordan Peterson and Nigel Farage at the ARC conference.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAHe said: “Of course, we need higher birthrates, but we’re not going to get higher birthrates in this country until we can get some sense of optimism. And we need a complete 180 shift in attitudes.“I mean, god, doesn’t Rachel Reeves make you want to reach for the cry tissues? It’s all so miserable, it’s all so declinist. Frankly, the Conservatives have been no better. We need a change of attitude in Britain.”He denied that the right in the UK was divided, saying: “The right is not split in this country. The Conservative party is not on the right in any measurable way.”Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader,addressed the conference on Mondayand vowed to bring about “the largest renewal of policy and ideas in a generation”. She argued that western civilisation was under threat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re in ruins, they’re in museums or they’re in history books,” said the author Os Guinness in the video. “At a certain point in the course of their history they lost touch with the inspiration and the dynamism that made them what they were.”In the same video, John Anderson, the former deputy prime minister of Australia, said western civilisation was “at a tipping point” because “the alternative fuels that we’ve tried to put into the great engines of democracy have failed”.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “It’s clear that long-haul is really winning out right now, for lots of different reasons.”However, long-haul flightshave long been criticisedfor their significant environmental impact relating to the amount of carbon emissions they generate.Value for money came through as a common theme for the current popularity, and Vietnam was highlighted as “a good example of somewhere which is leading the way with experience and adventure travel”, with its cities, food, culture and beaches combining to create special trips “at affordable prices”.View image in fullscreenThomas Cook said one of the big ‘winners’ was the US, especially destinations like New York.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesAt Thomas Cook, a spokesperson said that when it came to the summer months in particular, the price of breaks in faraway locations was often “comparable to holidays in the Med, so people are willing to head farther afield and try somewhere new with their holiday spend”.This renewed enthusiasm for travelling farther afield may also be linked totax changes on pensionsannounced in last October’s budget, which led to predictions that some older people were likely to withdraw more of their pension cash and spend it on holidays and other big-ticket items in order to reduce the value of their estate.Thomas Cook said one of the big “winners” was the US, especially New York, Florida and Las Vegas. At the time of writing, the firm was selling seven-night packages to Las Vegas including return flights from London for under £550 a person.The spokesperson added: “Mauritius and Thailand offer great value, especially for families who want to explore a new country.”View image in fullscreenTourists watch jumping whales near Hermanus, South Africa. The country has become one of Kuoni’s most popular long-haul destinations.Photograph: Jeannot Olivet/Getty Images/iStockphotoJulia Lo Bue-Said, the chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, a network of independent travel agents, said so far this year it had seen strong momentum in long-haul travel across its agency partners, with demand accelerating in the last few weeks.“Many families are discovering that long-haul destinations can be more cost-effective during school holidays than European alternatives, particularly in regions like Thailand and the far east, where local costs remain attractive,” she said.The popularity of shows such as The White Lotus, whosecurrent third seasonis set in Thailand, and ITV’s Love Island All Stars, filmed in South Africa, would fuel fresh interest in these destinations for 2025 holidays, she added.It was announced in last October’s budget that unspent money left in a pension plan after an individual’s death will be included in inheritance tax calculations from April 2027. That led to claims in some quarters thatthis “tax grab” could backfire, with Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, quoted as saying that the policy created a “huge incentive” to spend money rather than save it.Explore more on these topicsTravelThomas CookThailandSouth AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Although they have fallen steadily since 2022, vacancies remain above pre-pandemic levels.The figures indicate Britain’s jobs market is healthier than expected after business surveys had suggested employers were responding to Reeves’s October budget bycutting jobsat the fastest pace since the financial crisis in 2009, excluding during the coronavirus crisis.The UK economy has also performed more strongly than forecast, asfigures out last week showedit narrowly avoided recession in the final months of 2024.However, economists said there were signs the jobs market was still cooling, albeit less dramatically than feared. The number of workers on company payrolls fell slightly in December, by 14,000, but has been broadly flat since May 2024Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “Employment has stalled rather than collapsed. That is far from a rosy situation as payroll tax hikes, surging global uncertainty and a half year of weak economic growth take a toll on employment. But employment is holding up better than some dire business surveys.”Company bosses have warned that the chancellor’s planned £25bn increase in employers’ national insurance contributions and 6.7% rise in the minimum wage – both coming in from April – could force them to cut jobs. Employer surveys suggest companies are preparing for thebiggest round of redundancies in a decadeamid collapsing business confidence.The ONS has said that there areissues with the qualityof the UK’s official jobs market statistics. Experts have argued this leaves policymakers “flying blind” with the prospect that decisions are being taken based on flawed data.Earlier this month, the Bank of Englandhalved its growth forecastsfor the UK economy and said households would come under renewed pressure from rising inflation. It cut interest rates from 4.75% to 4.5%.It also forecast that inflation would reach a fresh peak of 3.7% by the autumn – almost twice its 2% target. Figures due on Wednesday are expected to show inflation accelerated from 2.5% in December to 2.8% in January amid a rise in energy prices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Annual growth in real-terms pay, after taking into account inflation, was 3.4%, the highest level since 2021.Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Wages have outpaced inflation again, easing the pressure on budgets and making life a little more comfortable. However, we can’t afford to relax just yet because wage hikes raise the spectre of inflation, which could be lurking around the corner.”Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said: “Since July wages have continued to grow at pace, putting vital money back in people’s pockets as we work to make work pay and improve living standards for all. But these figures also show that too many people are being locked out of work and denied that chance, including those sick and disabled. Instead of writing people off and labelling them, we must step up our support.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsBank of EnglandInterest ratesOffice for National StatisticsPaynewsShareReuse this content"

Cornwall expects the price cap to fall slightly in the summer before rising again in October.About 9 million households that use variable tariffs linked to the price cap will see an immediate impact on their bills from April, while it will be delayed for others on fixed tariffs.The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, will confirm the figure for the energy price cap covering the three months from 1 April on Tuesday 25 February. The regulatorincreased the cap in Januaryby 1.2% to a rate equivalent to £1,738.Adam Scorer, the chief executive of National Energy Action, a fuel poverty charity, said the third consecutive price cap rise would hit households “after three years of abnormally high energy bills”.“There is no getting used to this new normal for the people we try to help. Millions of the most vulnerable households are struggling with debt and severely rationing their heating,” he said.Although a further rise was widely expected, the increase is expected to be steeper than first anticipated aftercold, still weather across Europeforced many countries to rely more heavily on gas power plants as wind power dwindled. As a result gas storage levels dropped across the continent, causing wholesale market prices to rise sharply.Craig Lowrey, a principal consultant at Cornwall, said: “It might be tempting to look at rising bills and conclude that the push towards renewables is not working, and we should scale back on the transition. But the reality is higher energy costs only reinforce the need to accelerate our expansion of clean, reliable energy across the UK.”Consumers could face even higher bills if they use more than the typical amount of energy. This is because the energy price cap, which is recalculated every three months, limits the rate energy suppliers can charge customers for each unit of gas and electricity – not the total bill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of them warned that their firms might fold because they would not have been able to adapt.Under the proposals, any organisation that had a National Lottery Project Grant (NLPG) would need to wait until that project was completed before being able to apply for a new one. Another change would have limited applications to two a year.Arts Council England (ACE) confirmed that the changes, which were due to start on 1 April, have been axed after “new feedback” and “concerns” were raised by people in the sector. Now changes could happen in September after a consultation.The knock-on effect for production companies and other artists would have been huge, as many start applications for new grants while still working on other projects in order to keep working rather than pause to wait for more funding.Producers said that the plan was “the worst idea in the world”, and would “make an unstable situation much worse” while forcing companies to “go dormant between productions”.“They’re not considering the long-term health of the sector,” said one producer, who asked to remain anonymous. “The arts council can’t cope with the strain it’s under and is pushing it on to a sector that isalready in crisis.”ACE told the Guardian that it expected applicants to request £60m more than in the 2022-23 period because of the increased costs that producers and artists are facing. In 2022-23, ACE awarded almost £105m to just under 3,000 applicants.NLPG is the funder’s rolling grant scheme, in which artists and companies can apply for three different types of funds: under £30,000, over £30,000 and over £100,000. Theatre and dance, museums and libraries are all covered by it.But this process has been criticised for requiring“weeks of free labour, and a failure to secure it leads to a stark choice: empty diaries or further self-exploitation”.ACE’s deputy chief executive, Laura Dyer,told the Stagethat changes were required because the organisation was facing, “an ever-increasing level of demand” despite having “static income in terms of lottery [funding] for the past three years”.Dyer also admitted that the proposals were “creating a degree of anxiety” and confirmed about 80 people had been consulted on the changes, which also included the Developing Your Creative Practice funding scheme.“The challenge was how can ACE manage that demand in a way that means when people apply, they are not doing so with a low-level chance of getting a successful award, as it’s a lot of effort [to apply],” she said.An ACE spokesperson said: “Collectively as a sector, we are grappling with the problem of growing demand for both these programmes … we acknowledge how frustrating it is for people to spend time on grant applications when success rates are falling.“While we have to tackle the problem of demand, we think it’s right to take more time to talk to groups and individuals about how any changes can be as fair as possible to all applicants.”Explore more on these topicsArts fundingArts Council EnglandArts policynewsShareReuse this content"

The RSF holds the northern parts of the state, including the villages where the latest attacks took place.A medical source said it was nearly impossible to confirm a toll.“Some bodies are still lying in the street, and some were killed in their homes and no one can reach them,” the source said, requesting anonymity for safety reasons.Fighting has intensified across Sudan in recent weeks as the army attempts to reclaim full control of the capital from the paramilitaries.On Tuesday, the Emergency Lawyers accused the army of “barbaric” assaults on civilians in east Khartoum, days after its paramilitary opposition killed six civilians in the area.The network said that civilians in the East Nile district accused of collaborating with the RSF had been subjected to “killings, forced disappearances and arbitrary arrests” by individuals linked to the army.The UN’s children’s agency said children in Khartoum were trapped in “a living nightmare” of indiscriminate shooting, looting and forced displacement.Unicef said it had also received alarming reports of families being separated, with children abducted and subjected to sexual violence.The UN human rights office said “entrenched impunity” had fuelled mass human rights violations across Sudan.“Continued and deliberate attacks” on civilians including “summary executions, sexual violence and other violations and abuses underscore the utter failure” by both sides to respect international humanitarian law, it said in a statement on Tuesday.‘In El Fasher you face only death’: Sudan city empties as paramilitaries close inRead moreThe UN also called for the expansion of the international criminal court’s jurisdiction and a longstanding arms embargo to cover all of Sudan instead of just Darfur.The vast western region, home to around a quarter of Sudan’s population, has seen escalating violence in recent weeks as the RSF seeks to consolidate its hold. The paramilitary group has intensified attacks on North Darfur state capital El Fasher, the only major city in Darfur it does not control.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The crash, which occurred at Canada’s busiest airport, sent 21 people to the hospital, including three in critical condition.Soon after the crash,mobile phone clips capturedthe harrowing moments when passengers escaped through the plane’s upside-down doors and into the bitter cold. Blasts of fire retardant hung in the air and some of the passengers stood dazed in the snow. Others unleashed a string of expletives as they processed the unfolding chaos.“Oh no, no, no, no, no,” the person recording the crash can be heard saying as the fuselage rolls over.At least 18 injured after plane crashes and flips on landing in TorontoRead moreTwo adults in critical condition were airlifted to a nearby trauma centre and one child was taken by ambulance to a hospital in downtownToronto. In a post on social media on Tuesday, the airline said 19 people had since been released from hospital.Flight 4819, a Bombardier CRJ900 jet operated by the Delta subsidiary Endeavor Air, crashed while landing in Toronto around 2.45pm local time, having flown from Minneapolis in the US state of Minnesota.In audio from the air traffic communications, the plane was described “upside down and burning” moments after impact, with passengers exiting the aircraft as plumes of thick black smoke poured from the burning fuselage. The US Federal Aviation Authority said all 80 people onboard had been evacuated.Peter Carlson, a passenger on the plane, toldthe Toronto Starthe crash felt like he had “smacked into a wall” before passengers were flipped sideways. When he realized he was uninjured, Carlson scanned the plane, undid his seatbelt and “kind of just dropped”. He sent a message to his wife: “I love you, and I love our kids” and helped other passengers exit the plane.The CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, Deborah Flint, hailed the response of the plane’s crew, telling reporters on Tuesday: “The crew on Delta flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety, evacuating a jet that had overturned on the runway on landing amid smoke and fire. I thank each and everyone of these heroes.”The cause of the crash is not yet clear, but Todd Aitken, the airport’s fire chief, said: “It’s very early on. It’s really important that we do not speculate. What we can say is the runway was dry and there was no crosswind conditions.”The crash came as the country’s biggest airport was struggling to clear a backlog of delayed and cancelled flights, following a huge snowstorm that battered the city on Sunday.By Tuesday morning, two of the airport’s five runways remained closed.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTorontoAmericasAir transportPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas has claimed the young boys and their mother were killedby Israeli bombing.Hamas has said it will release six surviving hostages on Saturday, which represents a slight acceleration of thefirst phase of the ceasefire agreement. Under the originally agreed timetable, they were to be released in two groups of three, the last on 1 March, when the second phase is due to begin. A further four bodies are to be handed over on schedule next week.The release of six hostages on Saturday was confirmed by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In return, all the remaining Palestinians due to be released from Israeli prisons in the first phase will be freed on Saturday. Israeli press reports said thatIsraelwould also allow into Gaza some of the bulldozers and mobile homes that have been waiting on the Egyptian side of the border, to begin the vast task of rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said that Israeli negotiators in Doha would begin discussing thedetails of the second phaseof the ceasefire agreement “this week”, something Netanyahu had previously refused to condone despite the fact that under the agreement second-phase talks were supposed to start in the first week of February.The second phase is supposed to include the release of all remaining hostages with a corresponding number of Palestinian detainees and prisoners, and the completion of the Israel Defense Forces’ withdrawal from Gaza, including the Rafah crossing point intoEgypt– in effect putting an end to the war.The right wing of Netanyahu’s governing coalition has adamantly opposed the start of the second phase, threatening to bring down his government, but Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, put his foot down on the issue over the weekend.“Phase two is a little more complicated than phase one. But phase two is absolutely going to begin,”Witkoff told Fox Newson Sunday, adding that he just talked to Netanyahu about the issue by telephone that day.Two days later, Sa’ar said: “In the security cabinet meeting last night, we decided to open negotiations on the second phase. It will happen this week.”Asked what would happen if there was no agreement in the next 10 days on how to implement the second phase, Sa’ar said there were two other options: a return to war or an extension to the 1 March deadline for beginning the phase two if there was “constructive dialogue aimed at getting to an agreement”.Gaza’s future beyond the second phase is even more hazy. Israel has insisted that Hamas can play no further role in its governance. Sa’ar argued there had to be a complete “deradicalisation” of Gaza’s society.Trump caused global outrage earlier this month by saying the USwould take over ownership of Gaza, its more than 2 million residents should somehowdepart to neighbouring countries, and the whole coastal strip would be redeveloped into a “Riviera” resort.Egypt andJordan, which were expected to take most of the deported Palestinians under this plan, have rejected the proposal. On Friday, leaders of the two countries are due to meet their counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in Riyadh to put together an alternative plan that would ensure Gaza remains Palestinian land. There will then be an Arab League summit on the issue in Cairo on 4 March.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.“It looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,” the Clark county district court judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.When asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.Davis’s defense team filed a motion on Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.Attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involved decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.On the night of 7 September 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by the Death Row Records founder, Marion “Suge” Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur’s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were “done for entertainment purposes and to make money”.Judge rejects house arrest for man charged with murder of Tupac ShakurRead moreArnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.Prosecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.Defense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur’s death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death.Explore more on these topicsTupac ShakurNevadaUS crimeGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The last post on their Facebook page, from Isfahan, in Iran, on 3 January, included selfies with the caption: “What a wonderful place.”The detention of the two British nationals and charges of espionage comes as the new Iranian ambassador to the UK, Seyyed Ali Mousavi takes up his post.Recent economic sanctions reimposed on Iran by the US have placed the UK and other European powers under further pressure to distance themselves from the country.According toAmnesty International, the penalty for espionage in Iran can range from two years in jail to the death penalty. However, it is unclear how these penalties apply to foreign nationals.Since 2010, at least 66 foreign and dual nationals have been detained by Iran, according to research by the University of Essex in 2022, part of a growing practice of “politically motivated arrests” that has been decried by Human Rights Watch.After the death in September 2022 of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman of Kurdish origin who had been arrested three days earlier for allegedly breaching the Islamic dress code, at least 40 foreign and dual nationals were arrested.Last week, Iranian state media published photographs showing the UK ambassador, Hugo Shorter, meeting two British “national security” suspects at the general and revolutionary prosecutor’s office in Kerman province, about 500 miles south-east of Tehran.The photo, with blurred faces of two individuals sitting across from Shorter, shows that the meeting on Wednesday was held in the presence of the Kerman prosecutor Mehdi Bakhshi and Kerman governor’s deputy for security and law enforcement, Rahman Jalal.Relatives of the Foremans spoke of their concern at the couple’s “distressing situation” . The pair are being held in the southern city of Kerman.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national freed in 2022 after five years in a Tehran prison, was transferred to Kerman after her initial arrest. In 2016, she was detained for more than 150 days and later sentenced to five years in jail for spying. At the time, the UK accused Iran of using the dual citizen as a “pawn for diplomatic leverage”.On Sunday, Richard Ratcliffe, Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband,called on UK ministers to act “more promptly”than they did in his wife’s case. “A court process may soon come. It’s not a real court. But it will be a form of brutal theatre to get the government’s attention,”said Ratcliffe.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran.“We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities. We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members.”The UK government advises against all travel to Iran, saying British and dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention, and that a British passport or UK connections “can be reason enough” to be detained by Iranian authorities.Explore more on these topicsUK newsIranMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “As darkness falls, the situation becomes extremely dangerous, with rising risks of falls and people sinking into the snow.”His warning, however, appeared to fall on deaf ears.Eight people, including two minors,got lost during an excursionon Monday and were only located several hours later, a development that prompted a call to the fire brigade. On Sunday, a 48-year-old man suffered a fractured foot from a fall and four others had gone missing the previous night.Firefighters were brought in to assist locals and curb the flow of tourists and day-trippers from Sicily and beyond through the overcrowded streets, while mayors of the towns on the volcano’s slopes have ordered visitors to stay at least 500 metres from the lava – a directive which has been almost completely ignored.Hundreds of videos featuring day-trippers who reached the area have gone viral over the weekend, showing visitors just centimetres from the snow.One TikTok clipshows dozens of tourists near a lava flow that, slowly descending the snowy slope, has melted the snow to form a stream.“I’ve seen many photos and videos of people dangerously close to the front, even skiing,” saidCarlo Caputo, the mayor of Belpasso, a town nearby. “Though visually striking, it exposes them to serious risks, as the lava, interacting with the snow, can instantly vaporise it and, with the thermal energy released, may violently hurl fragments or rocks.”Italy, home to the most Unesco heritage sites in the world, is becoming wearily accustomed to episodes of overtourism.Last month, the mayor of Roccaraso, a popular Italian ski resort,clamped down on day-trippersand even hinted at calling in the army to deal with an unprecedented invasion of tourists after the town was overwhelmed by 260 buses carrying more than 10,000 visitors from Naples and the surrounding Campania region, lured by a TikTok star and cheap tickets.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeOvertourismnewsShareReuse this content"

While it didn’t make the UK charts, the album earned critical acclaim and a dedicated audience on streaming, drawn to its examination of race, mental health and working-class life in north-west London.Bashy originally broke through in 2007 with Black Boys, an anthem for racial pride that celebrated successful peers like Dizzee Rascal and Kano while rejecting stereotypes about young Black men: “No we ain’t hooligans / Just young and talented nubians.” He released his debut album, Catch Me If You Can, in 2009, and while there were handful of mixtapes in the following years, it took until 2024 for him to release a follow-up album.Bashy: Made in Britain – videoIn between, he has had a successful acting career, with roles in TV shows such as Top Boy, Them and 24: Legacy, and films such as Brotherhood and the Oscar-winning short Skin.Another artist with two awards at the Mobos, held this year at Newcastle’s Utilita Arena, was British-Nigerian vocalist Darkoo, who won best female act and song of the year, for Favourite Girl. She continues to build on the early success of 2019 hit Gangsta and a No 1 in 2021 as part of the multi-MC remix of Tion Wayne and Russ Millions’ drill hit Body. Favourite Girl has racked up tens of millions of streams both in its original and a remix with Nigerian star Rema, and other recent songs such as Focus On Me (All the Sexy Girls in the Club) and the Davido-featuring Right Now have been performing well.Also with two wins was Odeal, who picked up best newcomer and best R&B/soul artist, after winning a major following for his heart-on-sleeve vocal style. The singer was originally born in Germany and raised across Nigeria and Spain before settling in the UK, and put out a steady stream of music in 2024 including the EP Sunday at Zuri’s and the mini-album Lustropolis, featuring a collaboration with US star Summer Walker.Darkoo (feat Dess Dior): Favourite Girl – videoNigerian singerAyra Starralso picked up two in the overseas categories, for best African music act and best international act.Central Cee was named best male act, following the release of his long-awaited debut albumCan’t Rush Greatness, which cemented him as the most popular UK rapper globally – it reached No 1 in the UK but also No 9 in the US, an unusually high placing there for a UK MC. In the other rap categories, Scorcher won best grime act and Pozer picked up best drill act.Elsewhere at the ceremony, which featured live performances from Bashy, Darkoo, Odeal, Pozer and more, former Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis was given the Paving the Way award. The Impact award was given toVybz Kartel, the dancehall vocalist who last year was released from a Jamaican prison after 13 years, after his sentence for a murder – which he consistently denied – was quashed.Mobo awards 2025: full list of winnersBest male act: Central CeeBest female act: DarkooBest newcomer: OdealAlbum of the year: Bashy – Being Poor Is ExpensiveSong of the year: Darkoo – Favourite Girl (ft Dess Dior)Video of the year: Mnelia – My Man (directed by Femi Bello)Best hip-hop act: BashyBest grime act: ScorcherBest drill act: PozerBest R&B/soul act: OdealBest media personality: 90s Baby ShowBest African music act: Ayra StarrBest performance in a TV show/film: Jacob Anderson as Louis in Interview With the VampireBest electronic/dance music act: TshaBest gospel act: AnnatoriaBest jazz act: Ezra CollectiveBest producer: JulsBest Caribbean music act: ShenseeaBest alternative music act: Alt Blk EraBest international act: Ayra StarrMOBO Paving the Way award: Denise LewisMOBO Impact award: Vybz KartelExplore more on these topicsMobosAwards and prizesRapHip-hopR&BPop and rockGrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Stars Stephen Graham, Malachi Kirby and Erin Doherty talk thievery, brawling and broccoliAndy WelchTue 18 Feb 2025 12.02 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 12.17 ESTShareStephen Graham is red-faced and fidgeting in a London hotel alongsideMalachi Kirbyand Erin Doherty, his co-stars in A Thousand Blows. I explained how my partner had initially dismissed the gritty period drama on account of all the brutal boxing bouts. But after seeing a glimpse of an extremely hench, shirtless and sweating Graham, she decided that she probably would be able to join me in watching after all.“I don’t know what to say,” says Graham, as Kirby and Doherty tease him. “If that’s what it takes to get bums on seats, I’ll go with it.”I’m just going to be honest – there are a lot of twats in this industry. Do you know what I mean?The physical transformations – Kirby says he lost his “lockdown belly” and he looks like a mean, lean fighting machine in the show – took them about six months, training five days a week and eating a diet of chicken, rice and broccoli. Graham, who admits he is an “obsessive person”, continued the training long after filming wrapped. “It’s now part of my life,” he says.If you thought Graham was menacing as Combo in This Is England or as Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire, just wait until you see A Thousand Blows. He stars as Sugar Goodson, an undefeated champion in the world of illegal boxing in Victorian-era London.View image in fullscreenDreamer ... Malachi Kirby as Hezekiah Moscow.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney+Sugar’s dominance is threatened by the arrival of Hezekiah Moscow (Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), best friends from Jamaica, seeking a better life in Britain. Hezekiah, younger and fitter than Sugar, is also more than his match in the ring, which sends Sugar into a jealous rage.Doherty, 32, meanwhile, plays Mary Carr, the pistol- and knife-wielding leader of the all-female gang of thieves the Forty Elephants. Best known for playing Princess Anne inThe Crown, Doherty sees the Forty Elephants as akin to the suffragettes. Like their more famous sisters, the Elephants are also seeking emancipation – but using different methods.The series was created bySteven Knight, the man behind Peaky Blinders and SAS: Rogue Heroes. Like those shows, A Thousand Blows is loosely based on reality. Goodson, Moscow and Carr were all real people, while the shoplifting gang operated in London’s Elephant and Castle area from the 1870s onwards.You can see every penny of Disney’s budget on screen. It was filmed at The Story Works, a nine-hectare complex in south-west London. For the duration of the shoot – which saw two six-episode series filmed at the same time – A Thousand Blows built a fully functioning slice of Victorian London.“I’ll never forget walking on to that set for the first time, realising I could go into all the buildings,” Kirby says. “They built the pub, everything.” He was so taken with the atmosphere that he would often go to set on his day off to take even more of it in.Graham says he has only ever seen this scale and attention to detail on big-budget sets he’s worked on in the US, while Doherty adds that the mix of animals walking around the streets and muddy puddles covering her dresses with dirt almost removed the need to act. “We were just plonked in it and pressed play.”“I did feel we were doing something special,” Kirby says. “I’ve never been so excited by a job. Usually, I’m terrified that I’m going to have to find a cave to hide in after I’ve finished filming something.”That does seem unnecessary, given that the 35-year-old’s CV includes the lead role of Kunta Kinte in the 2016 remake of Roots, the Black Mirror episode Men Against Fire, and the Mangrove episode of Steve McQueen’s 2020 anthology Small Axe, which won him a Bafta for his portrayal of the racial justice campaigner Darcus Howe.View image in fullscreenLeader of thieves ... Erin Doherty as Mary Carr.Photograph: Disney+“Honestly,” he says, “I genuinely think that if something I’m in comes out, I’m not going to work again. I was depressed after I watched myself in Small Axe. I’ve just accepted that I’m never going to see myself like an audience does. I’m always going to look at it through the perspective of whatever it is that’s going on in my head. But with A Thousand Blows, I felt butterflies throughout the entire process.”The show was co-produced by Matriarch Productions, the company Graham and his wife, Hannah Walters, founded (they are both executive producers of A Thousand Blows, along with Knight andDavid Olusoga, among others). Graham says they go out of their way to ensure a “no twats” policy on set.“I’m just going to be honest, there are a lot of twats in this industry, do you know what I mean?” he says, sounding more scouse as he relaxes into our conversation. “There are loads of egos and I really don’t like that. The industry should have changed and with the ethos of our little company we are trying to move it in the right direction. I want people to skip to work.”The cast did what research they could on the real-life history of their characters. Details are sketchy – in Hezekiah’s case, complicated by the fact that he went by numerous names – but there is a startling photograph of the real Moscow, fists held high, that formed a great deal of Kirby’s understanding. The existence of the photograph, an expensive item in the late 19th century, suggests that he was a man of a certain standing, while newspaper cuttings of his boxing bouts hint at a formidable talent.Graham felt the weight of history when his character’s great-great-granddaughter visited the set with her daughtersIn the case of Mary Carr, there is a little more to discern, but Doherty says she tried to ignore certain facts. “It just forms a backbone. Like I know she was arrested for a certain crime on a certain date,” she says, “and I know the Elephants carried out this heist on this date. I found it very freeing having these little bits of information, then it was up to me to flesh it out.”Graham felt the weight of history when Goodson’s great-great-granddaughter visited the set with her daughters. “They had a look round and I met them,” he says. “She couldn’t really tell us anything about him, but I felt the connection, and that meant I have an obligation to try to play him as honestly as I possibly can.”A Thousand Blows may be set in the late 19th century, but its central themes are just as familiar in 2025. Themes such as race, gender, class, poverty and migration drive the drama, although its approach is nuanced. For example, in the opening episode at least, no one mentions the colour of Hezekiah’s skin, so much so that viewers may wonder if this is going to be a colour-blind cast period drama.“There was excitement about being in a show set in the 1800s and playing a black man from Jamaica that hasn’t got chains on him and is not a servant,” says Kirby. “You don’t really see that a lot. He’s a dreamer, which does not mean he’s just a young man dreaming of becoming a lion tamer.”View image in fullscreenA time of divisions … Doherty and Graham.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney+“This was one of the key elements Steve [Knight] wanted to get across,” Graham says. “We have this perception that there weren’t many black people in London in those days, and if there were, they were enslaved, or being exploited. But Steve is so fastidious with his research, and he learned that it wasn’t so much ethnicity that divided people in the East End, but class.”Away from their fights in the ring, Sugar and Hezekiah’s interactions allude to them having overcome similar hardships a continent apart. The show suggests that if they weren’t such foes, the characters might be firm friends. Sugar, Graham says, “sees Hezekiah as an equal, but he’s fearful” – that his status as king of the ring is under threat. “That’s where racism really lies, in the deep insecurities that the racist person has.”I ask if they took any mementoes from the set after shooting wrapped. Doherty said there is something special that she wants to keep once she’s done playing Mary, a ring that looks like an heirloom. As much as she thought about taking it home, she ultimately decided not to tempt fate, while waiting to see whether there will be a series three and four.Kirby says he stopped keeping items of his characters’ clothing some time ago as it was becoming “unhealthy” and leaving him unable to detach from the role. Instead, he opted to retain a characteristic of Hezekiah’s. “I took his fight. It was something that I personally needed at the time.”Graham was given an image by the set designers drawn in the style of a Victorian boxing poster, but with his face rather than the real Sugar. “I turned 50 when we were on this job” – he’s now 51 – “so they made the poster and every single person signed it …” he trails off, tears forming in his eyes. Blushes and tears in the space of an hour – talk about range. “Why am I getting like this?” he says, laughing. “So that’s now hanging in my den. It means a lot. It’s a very special thing.”A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ on 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevisionStephen GrahamDisney+Peaky BlindersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was 80.In a statement to the Guardian, agents for the actor confirmed that Holloway died after a brief illness in a Bournemouth hospital on 16 February.The son of My Fair Lady star Stanley Holloway, the actor was a staple of the innuendo-laced Carry On comedies throughout their most popular period, featuring in films such as Carry On Camping and Carry On Up the Khyber.Born in 1944, Holloway attended Rada before forging a career on the 1962 sitcom Our Man Higgins.

But, she says, it’s time this under-appreciated art received proper recognitionLyndsey WinshipTue 18 Feb 2025 10.53 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 13.59 ESTShareEllen Kane is on a roll. When we speak, the choreographer and movement director has two shows running,Ballet Shoesat the National Theatre, andNatasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812at the Donmar. She has just finished Why Am I So Single?, the follow-up from the writers of Six, the smash hit about Henry VIII’s wives, and she’s in rehearsals for the revival of Dear England, James Graham’s funny and stirring depiction of Gareth Southgate’s tenure as England manager. If you watched all those shows in a row, you would have no idea the same person had a hand in them all, such is the art of the movement director, a job that many may not even realise exists. But it’s an essential one.“Outside actually directing a scene, everything that moves on the stage is usually done by me,” says Kane, chatting backstage at the National. That means any dance, obviously, but also scene transitions, characters getting from A to B, and working with actors on how they connect with the audience. She helps make visible a character’s emotional experience. “So that we, the audience, can feel it,” she says. “I love to feel. I can watch something and appreciate it, ‘Oh that’s beautiful.’ But do I leave moved?”What is striking about those shows is how caught up audiences are in their energy – and part of Kane’s job is to shape that energetic arc, to make sitting in the theatre a visceral experience, as well as an intellectual one. In Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 the characters are at crisis point, tackling love, infidelity and the meaning of life. “Huge topics of human existence,” says Kane, “so the vibration of the person dealing with those things is large, right? We’re not just going to tell you about it, because that’s not how we live those experiences.” She doesn’t work by giving the performers exercises or moves to do, but by dissecting the text. “I adore finding the right energy for each beat, the sharp turns and corners you can take.”View image in fullscreen‘There are not many working-class people at this level. Now there will be even fewer’ … Ellen Kane.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianOnDear England, one daunting job was to help actors morph into well-known footballers. Kane didn’t work much with Joseph Fiennes on his impressive Gareth Southgate. “Joe did that himself,” she says (Gwilym Lee will take on the mantle in the revival). But to hone the squad – Harry Kane, Harry Maguire, Marcus Rashford et al – she and co-movement director Hannes Langolf studied hours and hours of footage of the players, analysing mannerisms and tics. She brought in footballer Lee Dixon to teach them about penalties, drills and formations, and absorbed all of that into the show, generating the spirit of a match without ever passing a ball.“Rupert Goold, the director, is a huge fan of football and he said, ‘Let’s bring in the ball.’ And I was like, ‘Ooh, that’s so dodge!’” She laughs and cringes. “Because you’ll never replicate the real thing. If there’s no ball, all they can feel is the tension in the situation, and our job is to heighten the tension.”Choreography in theatre and film is an underappreciated art. Alongside movement director Polly Bennett, Kane is working with Equity to set up a choreographers’ network and tackle their low profile in the industry. “You know,” she says, “why aren’t there Oscars for choreography? Why aren’t there Baftas? Why aren’t we being credited?” Kane’s work on the film ofMatilda the Musicalis all over social media, for example (sample comments: “The choreography for Matilda is AMAZING”; “THIS MUSICAL WAS TOO SICK YALL GOTTA WATCH IT”), but her name is rarely attached. They are wrangling with IMDb over getting a proper credit on films, rather than being lost among the “additional crew” at the bottom of the page.View image in fullscreen‘I love to feel. I can watch something and appreciate it. But do I leave moved?’ … Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812.Photograph: Johan PerssonNot that Kane is out for glory. She’s just passionate about what she does, even if she never really planned this career. Growing up in (pre-gentrification) Hackney, London, there was the odd after-school dance class and a randomly chosen dance GCSE, but when dancers from Lewisham College came to perform at her school, she recalls: “I was just so moved by it. I was, like, ‘I’ve got to do that!’”She went to Lewisham, which in the 1990s ran an inspiring dance course, full of late starters who’d never done a ballet class, many of whom have gone on to influential careers. That course is no more, and Kane laments that the decimation of the arts in schools will leave no pathway for others like her to get into the industry. “There are not many working-class people at this level. Now there will be even fewer. How do we get there if there is no exposure, no access?” You can’t argue it’s a superfluous subject, she says. “Dance changed the trajectory of my life. It has to be valid.”When she went into dance training, Kane was adamant she would never do musical theatre. She performed contemporary dance with Richard Alston’s company and others. But she began choreographing as assistant to Peter Darling on Billy Elliot, and now at 50 she’s really hitting her stride, with two big musicals coming up, Nanny McPhee andPaddington. “I’m just loving my life,” she says, “and grateful that I’m given the opportunity to make these stories come alive.”Ballet Shoes is at the National Theatre, London, until 22 February; Dear England, is at the same venue,10 March-24 May.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreDanceMusicalsNational TheatreAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But speaking on Hollywood Reporter’spodcast Awards Chatter, the actor said he was now attempting to be franker about his co-star’s alleged behaviour.“I just try to be more honest about it now and call it for what it is,” said Pearce, saying that he “broke down and sobbed” once he achieved more clarity on what had happened.But Pearce sought to minimise his distress compared with that of others who allegedly had more troubling experiences, saying: “Even though I probably was a victim to a degree, I was certainly not a victim by any means to the extent that other people have been to sexual predators.”He continued: “But I did that thing that you do where you brush it off and go, ‘Ah, that’s nothing. Ah, no, that’s nothing.’ And I did that for five months. And, really, I was sort of scared of Kevin because he’s quite an aggressive man. He’s extremely charming and brilliant at what he does – really impressive, etc. He holds a room remarkably. But I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.”Pearce said that through the film’s production in Hollywood, the only moments in which he felt “safe” were when Spacey’s attention was focused on another actor, Simon Baker.Once “things came to light in 2017”, said Pearce, he reassessed his times with Spacey and raised them with him, saying he subsequently “had a couple of confrontations with Kevin” that “got ugly”.Pearce’s rethink was precipitated by the accusations, made by the actor Anthony Rapp, that Spacey made sexual advances at a party in New York in 1986 when he was 14. Numerous other accusations followed.“I heard these stories about Kevin, sort of officially as news stories,” said Pearce. “And I was in London working on something, and I heard [the reports] and I broke down and sobbed, and I couldn’t stop. I think it really sort of dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had sort of either shelved it or blocked it out, or whatever. That was a really incredible wake-up call.”Of his appearance on an Australian talk show shortly afterwards, Pearce said: “I just blurted it all out. And of course then it all hit the press. I’m sort of in that weird position of going, ‘I don’t want all the focus on this. I don’t want it. But at the same time I don’t want him to get away with what he gets away with.’” He added, “I just try to be more honest about it now and call it for what it is.”Spacey was legallycleared of misconductand, respectively, sexual assault, in separate trials in the US and the UK and successfully defended himself against a lawsuit brought by Rapp.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The backlash lasted years: ‘I thought they’d never stop hating me’Though she didn’t support the president, the performance nearly destroyed her career. Not so for Snoop Dogg in 2025Andrew LawrenceTue 18 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 10.34 ESTShareThe Grammy-winning singer Chrisette Michele keeps her phone switched off, a habit that stems from her long stint in cancellation purgatory. Her brother barely got through last month to relay the news that Snoop Dogg had been DJing at a party for Donald Trump’s second inaugural, and many in the Black community were irate. Longtime fans were calling Snoop a sellout, she learned, and were unfollowing him online by thehundreds of thousands.Snoop remained defiant in the face of this controversy, which really peeved the hordes who well remember when Snoop was regulating Maga support in the music industry. That defiance “was the thing that resonated with me”, says Michele when I initially reach her the week after Trump’s second inauguration. “We live in a different era where you can say what you think and not feel like you might die.”In 2017, Michele performed at a Trump inauguration in a shocking break from the music industry’s anti-Maga stance. She was met with considerable backlash from fans and from industry peers including Questlove, the Roots drummer and Tonight Show bandleader. Despite Michele’s extensive success working with rappers Nas and Jay-Z, the decision to perform for Trump cost her future gigs and more opportunities to collaborate with industry heavyweights.Now thatsomemusic stars have hopped on the Maga bandwagon, she can’t help reflecting on the price she paid for making the worst decision of her career. “I just remember sitting in a hotel lobby next to my manager, who was my husband of two years at the time, in tears, thinking, ‘Maybe I’ll just become a professor,’” she recalls. “The constant gnawing and chewing and shouting at me was so difficult.”You wonder if the outcome might have been different if Michele had a catalog to rival Snoop’s, or even a song as big as Drop It Like It’s Hot. A native of Long Island, New York, Michele, now 42, came to prominence during the neo soul movement of the mid-noughties, following Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and India Arie. Michele’s satin voice, jazzy vibes and overall versatility made her a sought-after hip-hop balladeer by everyone from the Roots to Rick Ross – the latter of whom appeared at last month’s inaugural Crypto Ball alongside Snoop and Soulja Boy. In 2009, Michele earned a performance Grammy for her third single, Be OK, which also featured will.i.am. All the while Michele remained open about the pressures she felt around her body image, becoming a champion of the #BlackGirlMagic movement.View image in fullscreenSnoop Dogg performs in Los Angeles in December.Photograph: Frank Micelotta/Picturegroup/Rex/ShutterstockMichele didn’t enter the political arena; it landed on her in 2014, when Michelle Obama turned up for one of her shows outside Washington DC. She was not Michelle Obama that night, Michele recalls, “she was my homegirl. She came backstage and asked for a selfie with her mom and her aunt. She wore pink lipstick – like, happy, girlie pink lipstick. She knew all the words. She was a fan.”In 2016 Barack Obama added If I Have My Way, a groovy ballad from Michele’s debut album, to his summer playlist. Michele sang for the president at that year’s Democratic national convention and at his final White House state dinner, when the Obamas hosted Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. She takes patriotic duty seriously and eagerly. “When it comes to singing overseas for the troops or at the DNC, I don’t take it for granted,” says Michele. “I’m proud to be an American, always have been since I was a kid – and that’s a very difficult thing to say as a Black woman.”When Trump’s team invited her to perform at a 2017 inauguration event, Michele accepted – somewhat naively, as it turns out. She doesn’t support or particularly like the guy and was aware of the potential career ramifications. But she saw the gig as an opportunity to confront Trump and see if he kept the same racist, misogynistic energy in person. Even though there seemed to be some cover on the inauguration event’s performance lineup, which also included the gospel music stars Travis Greene and Tina Campbell (of Mary Mary fame), Michele, because of her more mainstream appeal, became the focus. Michele’s longtime supporters begged her to reconsider the gig. In response to reports that she was receiving at least $250,000 for her appearance – the true fee was closer to $75,000 – Questlove and Talib Kweli, both former collaborators of Michele’s, volunteered to pay hernotto perform – which hurt. “Honestly, I had to stop paying attention after a while,” she says.The music industry was in no mood to party with Trump when he ran in 2016. Eminem openly criticized his policies. Queen’s Brian May condemned his use of We Are the Champions at the Republican national convention. Elton John turned down an invitation to perform at his 2017 inauguration. But few artists were as stridently anti-Trump as Snoop, a social justice advocate who once characterized the gang violence he grew up around in Los Angeles as a trickle-down effect of Ronald Reagan’s economic policies. Snoop set the rules of engagement, pre-emptively denouncing the Black artists who would perform for Trump’s inaugural as “Uncle Toms” and “jigaboos” – derogatory terms that insinuate a deeper racial betrayal. His 2017 music video for the song Lavender, a heavy-handed Trump allegory, features a society of clowns that is ruled by a character named Ronald Klump, whom he shoots with a toy gun. The video outraged Marco Rubio and other Maga Republicans and had Trump musing about the reaction Snoop might have gotten if he had made a similar video about Barack Obama.View image in fullscreenChrisette Michele backstage in Georgia in 2022.Photograph: Prince Williams/WireImageBut Snoop’s tune changed in 2021 after Trump pardoned Michael “Harry-O” Harris, co-founder of the Death Row Records label that launched Snoop’s music career. (Harris had been serving a 25-years-to-life sentence for drug trafficking and attempted murder.) “I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump,”Snoop said last year. “He has done only great things for me.”At the Crypto Ball, Snoop was photographed throwing up hand signs with Bo Loudon, a young Maga influencer who is close with Barron Trump; Loudon captioned the picture: “Welcome to Maga, Snoop!” The endorsement effectively consolidated Snoop’s metamorphosis from Murder Was the Case gangsta rapper to ubiquitous pitchman to all-American mascot. Reacting to the Crypto Ball gig, The View’s Ana Navarro likened Snoop to a “trained seal”. Other rappers who have performed for Trump have suffered backlash even as Carrie Underwood and other music industry standard-bearers have capitulated to Maga. (After Nelly performed at a separate inauguration event, the administrator of a popular Instagram page dedicated to his wife, the R&B singer Ashanti, stepped down, citing disappointment with the Hot in Herre rapper – who is also unapologetic.)Michele processed the scenes of Snoop with Rick Ross and Soulja Boy at last month’s inauguration ball with wonder. “My initial reaction was, ‘Isn’t it nice to see Black men dancing in America so unapologetically?’” she says. When she faced criticism for her own performance, “I guess I wasn’t so masculine in my way of saying, ‘You don’t get to tell me what to do,’” she adds. “I just did what I thought was right. I didn’t shout at anybody and tell them not to say what they think.”In the main, the reputational damage to these men has been mostly cosmetic. For Snoop, the controversy has simply presented yet another occasion for him to play the part of America’s lovable scamp. Weeks after raising hackles at the inauguration event, he was back on stage for the NFL’s year-end awards show and for a television PSA that ran during the Super Bowl calling on viewers to “stand up to hate,”reigniting criticism of his inauguration appearance. Michele remembers arriving at a Super Bowl party at the Fountainebleau resort in Las Vegas as the ad was airing. “I’m still processing that commercial,” she jokes.Sometimes Michele thinks an overtly militant defense might have shortened her time in purgatory. “That was the most uncomfortable realization,” she says. “Like, if I’m not shouting and throwing my fist in the air, then it’s quite possible that I get ignored because I’m Black and soft. Look at Amber Rose. She spoke at the RNC, people were hard on her – and she just said, ‘Screw you,’ with that big, beautiful smile on her face. And people just backed up. The funny thing is: I don’t agree with her! I just watched it like, ‘OK, girl …’”Michele hoped to make a statement throughthe inauguration performance itself, but her messages were mixed. She sang a gospel song called Intentional, which calls for an unwavering belief in a divine plan – an argument evangelicals use to justify Trump support. She wore a maxi skirt replete with images of Black torture and subjugation by Jean-Michele Basquiat. In the end Trump didn’t make the performance, and she never got to meet him. By the time she walked off stage after the four-minute gig, “the death threats were starting,” Michele says. “I was afraid.”She thought she could make them stop if she just took a moment to explain herself – although, she admits, her first instinct was “to be completely silent and just go somewhere and mind my business for four years”. In an open letter pushed on social media, she said she intended her performance to serve as a “bridge” between Trump supporters and opponents. During an appearance on the Breakfast Club, Michele emphasized her Basquiat skirt again while reviewing the other rebellious nuances of her performance. But her attempts at subtlety were ultimately lost on the masses. “That was me overanalyzing everything, overthinking everything,” she says. “Because my parents are teachers, I want everybody to understand all the angles. My shouting came from insecurity, from needing people to believe that I did this for the right reasons.”By then the blowback against Michele was already fierce and unrelenting. She was dropped by her record label and by Spike Lee – who had one of her songs, Black Girl Magic, slated for the Netflix reboot of She’s Gotta Have It. Industry friends kept their distance. Her marriage eventually fell apart under the strain. The sneaker preacher Jamal Bryant called for a boycott of her music. He’d later apologize, but Trump’s camp never reached out to check on her. “Can you put a note in there asking them to reach out to Chrisette?” she asks me, laughing. “My team is waiting on a follow-up phone call.”View image in fullscreenChrisette Michele performs a song for the Obamas, Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, and Madam Ho Ching at the White House in 2016.Photograph: Getty ImagesBut it was the constant stream of death threats coming through her phone that really pushed Michele into depression and suicidal ideation. “We had security guards at my hotel doors,” says Michele, who also recalls being heckled on stage. “I wasn’t going to the grocery store by myself for years.” In October 2017 she shared that the fallout from her inauguration performance had caused her to suffer a miscarriage – and was further vilified for punctuating the news with a picture that was not ofheractual miscarriage. “That was me at my most panicked, the point where I came close to doing anything to get people just to be nice to me for one second,” she says. “I thought people were never going to stop hating me. I didn’t think this would go on foryears.”In a 2018 Facebook post, a year into Trump’s first term and just before the midterm elections, Michele posted a picture of herself between the Obamas and the Singaporean prime minister at the state dinner while calling on voters to rebalance the scales. (“When I look back at this moment it reminds me of what this country’s leadership should look like,” she wrote. “Diplomacy. Civility. Compassion. Love. Integrity. Gangsters don’t run this country. The people do.”) But it just became a reason for critics to come at her harder.Michele started treating her phone like a landline, switching it on every now and then for friends and family. “As a person in the public space, you think it’s your job to be connected all the time,” she says. “But it’s incredibly easy to disconnect.”But even as Black America disavowed Michele, many industry peers rallied around her. “Anita Baker was very vocal about making sure I had her number and about calling her if I needed anything,” she recalls. “India Arie did an entire interview explaining how I should be spoken to as a person, pulled me backstage and shook [the sense back into] me. Kirk Franklin was like: ‘The Black community owes you an apology.’ But Stevie Wonder was the most adamant to me about continuing in this music space because he’s been through so many things himself. These are the people who really wanted to make sure that I knew they were there for me.”She carried on quietly for years – performing around the country and even launching a podcast called Inner Peace Examination, dedicated to self-reflection – until a curious thing happened: the political winds shifted. Trump stormed back from his 2020 defeat to win re-election, this time with backing from tech billionaires. Corporate America rushed to scrap its DEI programs in a fit of anticipatory obedience. Just last month Obama and Trump were observed chatting warmly to each other while sitting together at Jimmy Carter’s state funeral – as if they hadn’t been mortal enemies for the past 17 years.Ultimately, Michele wishes she could have been like Snoop and told her critics to kiss off, and she also wishes she had never taken the inauguration gig in the first place. It’s another nuanced position that could threaten her ongoing career recovery and land her in hot water all over again – but at least now Michele knows she’s built for tough times. “For about four or five years, I hated the wordresilient,” she says, “because it meant I got cancelled and got back up. But now I embrace it because it means you kept going, and people stuck with you and you’re here now.”Explore more on these topicsMusicDonald Trump inaugurationSnoop DoggDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As with other staples – denim, T-shirts, tailoring et al – it’s an investment that will go beyond any trend or season. So, if you buy the right pieces, you’ll likely wear them for years to come.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.With that in mind, there are a few things to consider when hitting the shops. Above all, it’s best to choose jumpers youknoware made well, using good fabrics. That means you should go for brands you can trust in terms of craftsmanship and stick to natural fibres, such as cotton, wool and cashmere. Unlike human-made textiles, these are naturally breathable and temperature-regulating so they’re more comfortable and better for your skin. This sometimes means the price is a little higher than a fast-fashion buy, but they tend to last longer – just be sure to keep them protected when moth season hits.You may see it as a winter essential, but knitwear is actually a year-round layering hero. Say you buy a great cashmere crew neck: it’s the warm added layer you need beneath awinter coat, but it can also be the perfect finishing touch in summer, around your shoulders à la Brideshead Revisited.In terms of trends, there are a few big styles right now. Paul Mescal favours a shrunken knit, while Jacob Elordi likes it slouchy. You could go for a Tyler, The Creator-coded preppy cable knit or a simple Gant V-neck to lean into the Ivy League look that’s still dominating the scene. Or, you could of course go for the crowning jewel of the knitwear world: the classic crew neck.Either way, here’s a guide to the best men’s jumpers available to buy now.The best men’s jumpersBest cashmere jumperRise & Fall finest cashmere mid-weight crew neckView image in fullscreen£175 at Rise & FallPremium cashmere at a good price is hard to come by – until you’ve heard of Rise & Fall. The London-based label offers luxurious staples at a fair price, and does so with a transparent pricing structure and responsible manufacturing processes. From this mid-weight cashmere, which comes in seven colours, to a light merino take, the entire collection is less expensive than the top brands but feels just as good.The ultimate men’s capsule wardrobe: the only 22 items you’ll ever needRead moreBest V-neck jumperGant classic cotton V-neckView image in fullscreen£100 at GantFrom £53.95 at Love The SalesGant is your best bet for preppy staples and the American turned Scandi label has a strong selection of V-neck jumpers. Though you may have once considered these dad-core, they’ve quickly become a coveted menswear essential. This one’s 100% cotton, and the brand’s embroidered archival shield amps up the Ivy League look. If you want to go all the way, wear it over a shirt and tie with a pair of straight-leg jeans.Best merino roll neckMango 100% merino wool turtleneckView image in fullscreen£55.99 at MangoA lightweight merino wool roll neck is a key that canunlock your wardrobeduring winter. Since they’re thin, they can be worn under relaxed shirts, beneath blazers or simply tucked into jeans. For pure merino on the high street, there’s nowhere better than Mango.Best cable knitLemonate cable knit sweaterView image in fullscreen£144 at LemonateI discovered Lemonate only last year, but most of the Belgian brand’s collection is already on my wishlist and the knitwear is particularly strong. This jumper is a prime example. It’s made using an extra-fine merino wool, but still has the expensive weighty feel you want from a cable knit. Fabric aside, the contrast cuff and slightly cropped fit are a modern take on the classic.BestBritish-made jumperSims Wear strath green merino lamb’s woolView image in fullscreen£195 at Sims WearIndependent knitwear expert Sims Wear follows a slow-fashion agenda. All its pieces are made in the UK using premium textiles; this jumper in particular uses wool from the first shearing to ensure it’s as soft as can be. Everything’s built to last, and you can really tell. From the softness to the colour and the substantial weight, this will quickly become the jumper you reach for the most. As a matter of fact, of my entire collection, my Sims Wear is the piece I receive most compliments on. An investment worth making.Best long-sleeve polo knitGap green merino wool poloView image in fullscreen£55 at Gap£55 at NextDressing smart casual isn’t always easy. You don’t want to look overdressed in a smart shirt, but a T-shirt is too casual. Let me introduce you to the long-sleeve merino polo, which hits the mark every time, especially Gap’s versatile khaki take. Wear it with black trousers and you’ll look like you’ve made an effort, even if you haven’t.Best cardiganArket cotton cardiganView image in fullscreen£87 at Arket£97 from H&MArket may be a high-street store but you can always count on the quality craftsmanship and fabrics across its collection. The Scandi label offers this year’s update on a men’s cardigan: a collarless crew neck design with a relaxed bottom hem. This one’s pure cotton and even features pockets.

Every season, the designer offers a fresh take on his signature classics: relaxed tailoring, strong casual wear and a great selection of knits. Our favourite for spring/summer 2025 is this colour-blocked navy crew neck, which is constructed using a cosy extra-fine wool.Best sweater vestMassimo Dutti V-neckView image in fullscreen£59.95 at Massimo DuttiAs with this year’s update on the cardigan, 2025’s take on the sweater vest errs on relaxed. Massimo Dutti’s is a great example of how to do it well. Rather than having any clingy hems, it falls easily over your body, looking and feeling more luxe. The V-neck collar and super-soft wool-cashmere blend fabric lean into the quiet luxury aesthetic.Best for music fansHades Iggy Pop Lust For LifeView image in fullscreen£230 at HadesIf you consider yourself a music fan, Hades should be on your radar. The Midlands-based label regularly collabs with the estates of musicians, from David Bowie to The Sex Pistols. This jumper, which features the title of one of Iggy Pop’s most renowned songs, is a part of the punky Iggy Pop capsule. All the brand’s jumpers are handmade in Scotland, and you can read aboutits transparent manufacturing process on its website.Best for film fansScrt Come Home knitView image in fullscreen£155 at ScrtWhile Hades is good for those into music, Scrt is for cinephiles. The independent brand regularly takes cues from surreal cult classics, old and new. From Donnie Darko and American Psycho to Lost in Translation and The Substance, movie buffs are sure to find something they like across the selection of T-shirts, accessories and jumpers. For those who don’t recognise this eye from the film poster, this knit is inspired by Requiem for a Dream.Best high-street cashmereM&S Autograph pure cashmere crew neckView image in fullscreen£99 at M&SNot many high-street brands have a great cashmere offering. The good news? Marks & Spencer’s Autograph range hits the brief every season. This year, this rich burgundy hue is my top pick. If you’re feeling like you want to liven it up, follow the brand’s lead and layer two on top of each another.Best funnel neck jumperPercival fisherman quarter zipView image in fullscreen£159 at PercivalPercival’s best for guys who like design-led menswear. Although the collections feel timeless, most of the pieces are elevated with a twist. Take this chunky knit, for instance, with its unusual ribbed funnel neck and contrast cuffs. It’s the type of jumper that makes you look twice, but it’s completely wearable – and, like the rest of the brand’s offering, it’s constructed well using cotton for a long-lasting finish.Best high-street lamb’s woolUniqlo lamb’s wool crew neckView image in fullscreen£34.90 at UniqloJapanese high-street giant Uniqlo makes some of the best affordable jumpers on the market. Case in point: this pure lamb’s wool crew neck, which is available for less than £35. It comes in nine colours, but the best shades tend to sell out every season, so it’s best to get your favourite before it’s gone.Bestunusual knitThames Avonmore poloView image in fullscreen£128 at ThamesFor the type of knits that you won’t find anywhere else, head to Thames. The collection pulls inspiration from British subcultures – from skateboarding to the punk movement and grunge. This jumper is one of its newer arrivals, and it’s quickly become my favourite, for good reason. It’s comfy. It’s elevated. It’s unusual. And, considering the first-class finish and strong design details, from the argyle pattern to the embroidered logo and contrast collar, it’s great value for money, too.Explore more on these topicsMen's fashionThe FilterMen's topsMenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I rarely use a whole tin of coconut milk in one go. What can I do with the leftovers?Happily, the warming sweetness of coconut milk is welcome in all the things you want to eat right now, sitting at home in your thermals (Curry! Soup!), meaning leftovers are no bad thing. When Mandy Yin, chef-owner ofSambal Shiokin north London, is faced with this same predicament, it usually means coconut rice: “It’s so straightforward, too: just replace half the water you’d need to cook the rice with coconut milk.” Otherwise, the excess milk could make an appearance in stews, even bolognese, or creamed spinach, she adds: “Replace the cream with coconut milk and a dash of fish sauce, and that’sreallydelicious.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Coconut milk is, of course, a fundamental ingredient in Sri Lankan cooking. “You’ll findkiri hodi, a coconut milk-based sauce infused with garlic, turmeric and pandan leaf, in 90% of kitchens in Sri Lanka,” says Eroshan Meewella, co-founder ofKolambain London, and he recommends you do the same. “The turmeric and garlic balance the quite creamy, quite sweet coconut milk, and it pairs beautifully with rice or crusty bread.”Another way to work through what’s left in the tin is soup, especially if butternut squash or lentils are on the agenda. “You can jazz up a shop-bought one by melting coconut oil in a pan, then frying tempering spices [curry leaves, red chilli, mustard seeds, fenugreek] for a few minutes, and stirring that into the hot soup,” saysKaran Gokani, director ofHoppersin London. That will make it “nice and spicy”, then go in with a splash of coconut milk to mellow out proceedings to taste.Try this recipe and many more coconut-themed inspirations on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.And, of course, there are also curries. For a simple yet satisfying week night meal, Yin’s formula goes like this: “Blitz onions and chilli powder, then fry that down, and add coconut milk, cabbage, carrots, green beans or whatever vegetables you have.”Saiphin Moore, co-founder ofRosa’s Thai, meanwhile, leans towards a red curry, orchu chi. “Fry curry paste until it’s fragrant, then add half a can of coconut milk and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and cook until the mix turns deep red and the oil separates from the coconut milk.” Fry some fish – “salmon or sea bass works well” – then drizzle with the sauce. And if prawns are more your thing, Arun Tilka, executive chef atDishoom, heats mustard seeds, curry leaves, fresh ginger (julienned) and slit green chillies in oil. “Add chopped red onions, saute until translucent, then stir in powdered spices [turmeric, coriander, red chilli].” Stir in some tomato puree followed by the prawns and, finally, coconut milk: “Bring all that to a boil, then finish with lime juice and chopped coriander.”Coconut milk isn’t solely for dinner, mind. “I use it instead of milk in porridge for a tropical feel,” says Yin, who tops cooked oats with chopped tinned pineapple and brown sugar. “If you don’t want it quite so coconutty, use half coconut milk and half milk.” The white stuff also adds depth to desserts: “Thick coconut milk with a bit of jaggery [palm sugar] and salt makes a nice, rich sauce to pour over cakes or jelly,” Gokani says.Alternatively, he, says, head to the bar: “Freeze leftover coconut milk in ice cube trays, ready to blend into cocktails.” Piña colada, anyone?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Will this change our language for ever?Nyima JobeTue 18 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTShareWhen Maelle Kouman, 24, turned off auto-capitalisation on her phone as a teenager, she didn’t realise it would become a lifelong habit. “Lowercase feels like an ongoing conversational tone without a start or end,” she says. “It removes the serious tone certain texts can exude, even without trying.”Ruweyda Hilowle, 24, has also turned her back on capitals. “I text in lowercase because it feels more relaxed,” she says. “When I start using proper capitalisation, it feels as if I’m trying to make a point stronger than it needs to be.”Kouman and Hilowle are not alone. For many members of gen Z, lowercase writing is not just a style preference but a cultural marker, reflecting their values and attitudes to tradition. Influential artists such as Billie Eilish, 23, have reinforced this aesthetic, using lowercase in song or album titles such as don’t smile at me or my future.Brands are taking notice. Spotify’s curated playlists, such as chill vibes and teen beats, embrace lowercase to signal informality, while haircare company amika, which has a millennial and gen Z following, has done the same with its packaging to create a soft, approachable image.“Capital letters can feel stern or abrupt,” says Caitlin Jardine, a social media manager at marketing agency Ellis Digital. A “calm, friendly” tone resonates more with gen Z’s values. This, after all, is a generation that grew up online, where the line between formal and informal communication is often blurred. “Lowercase writing is a way to reject the authority and rigidity associated with traditional grammar,” says Jardine. “It fosters an atmosphere of inclusivity and emotional connection.”Karim Salama, founder of the digital marketing firm e-innovate, believes it’s a reflection of gen Z’s need for self-expression. “Language is constantly evolving, especially with new technology. First we saw this with the rise of emojis, which expressed feelings effectively for this generation. Using lowercase is straightforward and free from the constraints of past generations.”View image in fullscreen‘Everyone in my school group chat did it … after a while it felt normal.’Photograph: Maskot/Getty Images (posed by a model)It’s not an entirely new phenomenon, however. There was a similar, if smaller-scale rejection of capital letters in the 20th century, most notably in the poems ofEE Cummings. Later, the feministwriter and activist bell hooksmade the decision to lowercase her own name. This was not simply about aesthetics – it was a political statement, challenging hierarchies and rejecting formality, while also attempting to shift attention from hooks the person on to her ideas. As she put it in 2013, on a visit toRollins Collegein Florida, she wanted people to focus on her books, and not on “who I am”.For some gen Zers, however, lowercase is also a question of style. “There’s something about how the letters line up – it just looks better to me,” Hilowle says. The minimalism suits gen Z’s broader love of simplicity and imperfection.Even for those who aren’t consciously aware of its visual appeal, lowercase writing often feels instinctively right. “I think I’ve kept using lowercase out of habit,” says Kouman. “But when I look back, it started because everyone in my school group chat did it, and I guess after a while it felt normal.”Many young people, however, switch back to uppercase in professional or academic settings, where formality still holds weight. “I actively choose to text using capital letters when I know I’m speaking to work colleagues,” says Nardos Petros, 23. “It’s about presenting myself in a certain way.”Some have even adopted capitalisation as a humorous marker of adulthood. Kouman points to a trend on TikTok where young adults announce they’ve turned their auto-capitalisation back on as a sign of maturity.It’s too early to tell if lowercase is here to stay, or whether later generations will rediscover a taste for capital letters. For Kouman, at least, lowercase is a small but meaningful choice. “Lowercase is more than just a style,” she says. “It’s a way to communicate in a way that feels like me.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Shortly afterwards, easyJet notified me that there were building works at the hotel. I was given the option of going ahead with the trip, or changing the holiday and paying any difference in price. Equivalent packages cost more, and since I’ve been under a lot of stress the last thing I wanted was a week on a building site, so I asked for a refund, but easyJet refused.JT, BrightonThe easyJet alert is certainly discouraging given the hotel advertised was in a “quiet” location. It warned that the noise of hammering was likely for 11 hours a day while the front of the hotel was repaired. However, because its facilities were still open, you did not qualify for a refund.Surprisingly, this seems to be backed up by the rules. The Package Travel Regulations stipulate a refund is due if the main characteristic of a holiday is altered, but it’s silent on noisy building works. Abta’s code of conduct says that if building work does not affect hotel facilities no refund is due. Katherine Allen at law firm Hugh James says you might have a case if the holiday was sold on the basis of tranquillity, works were extensive and another hotel of the same quality could not be found.EasyJet holidays says: “The building work was graded as ‘moderate’, meaning having an insignificant impact. We contacted JT as soon as we were made aware, and offered the opportunity to book an alternative.”Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

Distinct from its use in a parenting or psychology context (which can incorporate mindfulbreathing exercises), grounding or “earthing” involves walking barefoot outdoors or lying on the ground to realign oneself with the electric charge of the Earth.What is grounding?The surface of the Earth is slightly negatively charged. Grounding, so the claim goes, allows electrons (also negatively charged) to flow into your body, which would otherwise be blocked by insulating materials such as rubber-soled shoes. The ostensible benefits include, but are not limited to: improved sleep, metabolism and blood circulation; reductions in inflammation and in cardiovascular disease risk and pain; and relief from pre-menstrual syndrome.Grounding takes its name from a legitimate concept in electricity. Karen Livesey, an associate professor of theoretical physics at the University of Newcastle, describes it this way: “When you deliberately take an object that has possibly an excess negative or positive charge, and you connect it to the Earth so that the charges all equalise out.”“The object ends up with the same charge density that the Earth has,” she says.We’re constantly building up positive and negative charges on the surface of our bodies – take static electricity, for instance. “If you’ve got woollen socks on and you walk across the carpet, that rubbing between the socks and the carpet transfers charge, and you can develop quite a strong positive charge,” Livesey says. “You touch a doorknob, and suddenly that charge transfers to the ground.” The shock you feel results from the charge being neutralised.Negative charges from the Earth could, in theory, penetrate the body, but typically excess charge remains on the surface, Livesey says. “What we’re seeing in the literature is no causal link [explaining] why having a buildup of charge could adversely affect our health,” she says.Now is the time to unplug and reset. Next year we enter a more dangerous world – but for now I need the silence of nature | Paul DaleyRead moreNo dubious wellness trend is complete without someone turning a buck on it, so for those who live in cities or are otherwise precluded from regularly shoving their toes in the dirt, there is an assortment of conductive items people can plug into the grounding sockets of electrical outlets to get the same purported effects.You can stand on grounding mats, sleep with grounding mattress covers and sheets, and even wear grounding socks – a ChoiceShonkys winnerlast year. The socks, which come with a cord that effectively tethers a wearer to the wall, presumably do not yield great improvements in mobility.What does the evidence say?The flow of charge from one place to another is an electric current, measured in amperes. To put grounding into perspective, Livesey says appliances in our homes draw a maximum current of 63 amps. In comparison,one studyfound that a sleeping person connected to the Earth via grounding bedsheets produced a current of up to 10 nanoamps – that is, more than 1bn times smaller. “These tiny currents are almost undetectable,” Livesey says.Playing devil’s advocate, let’s say electrons from the Earth do make it into your body when you dig your heels into some sand. What effect would they have? One claim is that electrons from grounding can neutralisefree radicals, the reactive molecules that cause damage to cells. It’s a claim that sounds good but doesn’t stack up.“The concept that electrons flow through the body and neutralise oxidative stress is really quite a vague concept,” says Prof Judy de Haan, who leads the cardiovascular inflammation and redox biology laboratory at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne.“Not all free radicals are charged particles, so the idea of neutralising something which isn’t charged doesn’t always make sense. Indeed, in some instances the addition of electrons may exacerbate oxidative stress and cellular damage.”De Haan says the body has its own natural mechanisms for dealing with oxidative stress, such as antioxidant enzymes.The few scientific papers published on grounding have a “lack of scientific rigour”, De Haan says, with small sample sizes and poor study design. “When clinical trials are conducted, the important thing is that the researcher and the patient are both unaware of what the treatment might be,” she says – a feature known as double blinding, which reduces bias.What do the experts recommend instead?One thing grounding proponents have right is that there is solid evidence that spending time in nature – shoeless or not – is good for physical and mental health.“The benefits of nature contact are ample and myriad,” says Prof Thomas Astell-Burt of the University of Sydney. Longitudinal research he has led with Prof Xiaoqi Feng at the University of New South Wales found that people living in leafier city neighbourhoods are at lower risk of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as facing a lower risk of psychological distress, loneliness, sleep insufficiency and dementia.Prescribing nature: the restorative power of a simple dose of outdoorsRead more“We’re consistently seeing a 30% landcover of parkland and especially tree canopy being the bare minimum to observeconsistent benefitsacross health behaviours and mental, physical, and social health outcomes,” Astell-Burt says.“Just being in nature, or a view of it, can help us feel less stressed and better able to concentrate on things that matter to us,” he says. Green spaces “provide attractive settings to keep physically active, solo or with others, and opportunities for solace and respite”.De Haan says: “Walking in nature – of course that’s going to be beneficial. I don’t know whether touching the earth with your bare feet is going to make the difference.”So by all means go outside and, as the kids say, touch grass. Just know that any improvements in your sense of wellbeing aren’t likely to be from a negative charge from the planet below you.Donna Lu is Guardian Australia’s science writerAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Most women have come alone, though you wouldn’t know it.This weekend is a collaboration between two outdoor adventure companies: women’s trail running and hillwalking specialistGirls on Hills, andThe Adventure Syndicate, a trio of epic cyclists who put on madcap events on two wheels throughout the year. Both organisations frequently partner with Hostelling Scotland, and we’re staying at the newly reopenedBraemar Youth Hostel. Adding to the fun is yoga teacher Lindsay Warrack, and a hired sauna from Stravaig Saunas set up in the woods outside the hostel.‘It’s all about the camaraderie and getting to meet like-minded women. It’s very supportive and there’s a lot of peer learning.’Girls on Hills was launched in Glencoe in 2018 by outdoor instructors Keri Wallace and Nancy Kennedy as a way to address the gender disparity in trail running. Starting with just a couple of weekend courses, in 2023 the company delivered 98 events for women across the UK. Wallace says that since the pandemic there has been an increased demand for courses that include a social element.“It’s become a really big part of what we do,” she says, “it’s all about the camaraderie and getting to meet like-minded women. It’s very relaxed, sociable and supportive, and there’s a lot of peer learning.”View image in fullscreenA hostel makes a great base for the weekend.Hostels make great bases as they are cost effective and have a community-minded set up, say both companies (and Hostelling Scotland reports a real shift in its customer demographic, with more women using them for outdoor adventures). Braemar proves perfect for our gathering with an expansive catering kitchen, two dining areas and a big living room that’s nicer than many hotels. The excellent drying room makes light work of piles of wet shoes and soggy waterproofs.At the Hostel Hoolie, participants choose which activities to take part in, including morning yoga, full days’ hillwalking, trail running, or cycling, and evening sessions in the sauna. Everything is optional. On the first night there’s a meeting to learn about the activities and sign up. Walk leader Jess Williams says of her route: “It’s going to be wild, and we might not see anything.” Cycle leader, and the Adventure Syndicate founder, Lee Craigie makes similar promises: “It’ll be wet and cold and a wee bit grim in places.” The enthusiasm in the room remains undimmed.We cheer each other on as we take turns to dunk in the icy tin bath outsideThe dormitories are clean and warm with a mix of bunk beds and single beds. I bag a bunk in the smallest (sharing with only two others – the largest sleeps eight) tucked into the eaves of this former hunting lodge and sleep surprisingly well. The next morning after a yoga class I join the guided trail run, beginning with a session on winter kit and decision-making before we head out (key takeaways are the importance of navigation skills and having a plan to keep warm if someone gets injured – as well as plenty of snacks). From Braemar it’s a short distance to Linn of Dee where our 12km route winds through the native pinewoods of Mar Lodge Estate, snowy mountain tops sometimes visible between the trees. At the snow line we pull microspikes over our trainers and practise running up and down icy slopes, learning safe winter descending techniques. There’s a wide range of experience in the group, from ultra-marathon veterans to near beginners. The pace is relaxed and chatty, and the only race is for a seat by the fire at the bothy lunch stop.View image in fullscreenCycling through the snowy forest.Night falls early so the evenings are long and unhurried. There’s a strong presence in the local pub, Farquharson’s, with a fierce Connect 4 challenge. At the hostel, soup putters on the stove and new friends stretch out in front of the fire, with wine, books and knitting. In the sauna, the conversation is about strength training, triathlons and massage, and cheering each other on as we take turns to dunk in the icy tin bath outside. Stories are swapped of the different days’ activities, and future plans and routes are plotted.We’re challenging the notion that you start to fall off a cliff edge in your 30s, and post-menopause you’re invisible to societyAlice Lemkes, the Adventure SyndicateOver the course of the weekend I try things I’d typically shy away from, partner yoga for one, working together to ease into deep stretches, any qualms about personal space long discarded (I loved it). I also find myself taking an icy river dip with swim coach Penny Clay, the momentum of spirited women spurring me on, fuelled by joy and camaraderie.The increased demand for all-female community events is not about a lack of drive, Wallace is keen to stress. “It’s not all ‘girls just want to have fun’,” she says. “Women want to do hard things, we want to push ourselves.” The Adventure Syndicate’s co-director Alice Lemkes agrees: “Women want to challenge themselves, but it doesn’t have to always be within the traditional model of competition. We create an environment in which women can push their comfort zones and set new boundaries around their limits and their confidence.”View image in fullscreenAn evening in the local pub, with a Connect 4 challenge.The biggest growth area in the outdoors industry is women in their late 30s onwards, they report. While hillwalking, climbing and running are still mainly marketed to young people, both companies say their trips appeal to women who are a bit older and desperate to get out there and meet like-minded individuals.“We’re challenging the notion that you start to fall off a cliff edge in your 30s, and post-menopause you’re just invisible to society,” says Lemkes. “We’re also hearing from women in their 60s and older who’ve never done anything like this before. That’s also a really exciting demographic. It’s a mindset shift.Wild women: the rise of all-female outdoor activity groupsRead more“When women get together in the outdoors, the energy is just so incredible,” she adds. “It’s a lovely, positive, reinforcing loop. We want more of it, it’s so nourishing.”She’s right, I think, as a weekend packed with adventure, fun and community draws to a close. I definitely do want to come back for more.The trip was provided byHostelling Scotland,Girls on HillsandThe Adventure Syndicate.

But the era of Jim Crow segregation laws and white supremacy in which the movie is set was all too painfully real.Why Nickel Boys should win the best picture OscarRead moreThe adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning2019 novelreveals stark truths about the ordeal the Dozier boys endured, including the abuse and violence inflicted upon them by staff and guards, and how white officials hid the truth for years.“Quite literally, the boys were buried, and the history was attempted to be buried,” Ross said. “Now [the Dozier story] is elevated to academic history, to literature history, to like the annals of cinema.”Ross’s Nickel Academy is less of a film-maker’s visualization of a brutal 1960s deep south, state-run youth rehabilitation facility than an unvarnished replica of Dozier, formally known as theFloridaReform School for Boys from its opening in the tiny panhandle town of Marianna in 1900 to its eventual closure in 2011.In the grounds, a lime-washed building known as the White House was where children as young as six were taken after minor transgressions and chained to tables as they were flogged into unconsciousness.View image in fullscreenRaMell Ross attends the Writers Guild Awards in Los Angeles on 15 February.Photograph: Variety/Getty ImagesThere were allegations by survivors, many of them now deceased, of a “rape dungeon”; others recalled relentless thrashings with the metal buckle of a leather belt known as “black beauty”; in real life as well as in the book and movie, some children would disappear in the middle of the night, never to be seen alive again.The bodies of those who did not return joined others uncovered during a three-year dig that began in 2013 by anthropologists from the University of South Florida (USF),whose workprovided the inspiration for Whitehead’s book and ultimately Ross’s historical drama.The USF team was led by Dr Erin Kimmerle, who uncovered human remains in 55 graves. Some were buried within a makeshift cemetery known asBoot Hill, depicted in bleak realism in the movie with crude metal crosses as markers.Others were found elsewhere, several with gunshot wounds or blunt force trauma, or showing “substantial evidence” of malnutrition or infections. Eight, including two teachers, died in a mysterious dormitory fire in 1914; 11 more fell victim to influenza four years later.Poorly maintained and incomplete state records showed 31 burials between 1914 and 1973, but the USF investigation placed the figure at a minimum of 98 deaths. Not all the bodies were recovered, and in 2019another 27 “possible” gravesiteswere discovered.It’s always the right time, it just becomes more the right time, because these things seem to never endRaMell RossPainstaking research and DNA testing allowed Kimmerle, who acted as an anthropological consultant forNickel Boys, to positively identify a handful of the victims and bring what she called “a type of justice” to the families of those who died.One was George Owen Smith who, like one of the main characters in Nickel Boys, was sent to reform school when he was found riding in a stolen car. He was 14 when he disappeared in 1940, and school officials wrote his parents that he had run away and was later found dead from pneumonia.But a witness saw staff taking him to the White House and carrying him out again motionless. Smith’s sister, Ovell Krell,told the Guardian in 2014that his identification and return of his body was “the end of a long, hard journey”.Kimmerle said she appreciated the accuracy of Nickel Boys in dramatizing many of her team’s revelations. She pointed to the clear depiction of a pre-civil rights era in which young Black men and children could be sent to harsh institutions such as Dozier for smoking, truancy, being considered “incorrigible”, or simply having no other place to go.“There’s so many stories, so much death and abuse, and just the injustice of why they were there, and who was there, and all of it,” she said.“All these boys who died, it was one example after another of injustices before civil rights, like why do these children not have lawyers, why are they arrested without their parents notified, why are they just deemed incorrigible and sent to a labor camp for two years?“It can be so heavy, and hard to talk about, and when I’ve spoken about the research or the history, sometimes I feel like I’m leaving the audience so down and depressed. But it’s also the story about finding peace and hope for those families, so I really appreciated the [movie’s] approach.”Ross said he hoped the Dozier story, and his Oscar-nominated retelling of it, would be seen as a poignant “movie of the moment”.Donald Trump’sadministrationisattacking diversity, equity and inclusion(DEI) programs; and in Florida, despite anofficial apologyfor the Dozier abuses in 2017 and opening of a$20m compensation fundfor victims, the hard-right governor,Ron DeSantis, is accused of being “actively hostile” to the Black community.Nickel Boys review – Colson Whitehead novel becomes intensely moving story of a racist reform schoolRead more“It’s made me think about the way in which history is being erased contemporaneously [and] the way in which history can be like a sort of experiential monument,” Ross said.“The thing about making work about quote unquote justice, and I like to see this film as a sort of visual justice, is that it’s always the right time, it just becomes more the right time, because these things seem to never end.“Hopefully I’m wrong, but I’m sure that it’ll be a movie of the moment in 10 years because of the way that things are going and the way things have gone.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsNickel BoysFloridaUS educationSchoolsRaceUS crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I look forward to seeing my friends, my family, and my community. It’s a good day today.”Peltier hadmaintained his innocencesince his conviction before BidenorderedPeltier – now 80 and in poor health – to transition to home confinement after spending nearly 49 years federally imprisoned.‘He’s going home’: new film documents the fight to free Leonard PeltierRead more“This commutation will enable Mr Peltier to spend his remaining days in home confinement but will not pardon him for his underlying crimes,” Biden said at the time.The National Congress of American Indianscelebratedthe commutation, calling it “historic” and adding that the case “has long symbolized the systemic injustices faced by Indigenous Peoples”.Peltier’s imprisonment resulted from a 1975 shootout that occurred on South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation between two FBI agents – who had entered the private property to serve arrest warrants – and members of the American Indian Movement (AIM), a cold war-era liberation group that sought to address police brutality and discrimination againstNative Americans.The group of Native American men who traded gunfire with the FBI agents included Peltier. The shootout resulted in the deaths of both agents, Jack Coler and Ronald Williams, who were shot in the head. Joseph Stuntz, a Native American, was killed, too.Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota and an active member in the AIM, was one of several individuals indicted in connection with the agents’ killings.He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences.Two other movement members were acquitted on self-defense grounds.Peltier has consistently claimed that he did not shoot the agents. His supporters have long argued that prosecutors withheld critical evidence that could have supported his defense while also fabricating affidavits against him.Prosecutors argued during trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank range. Peltier admitted to being present and firing a gun at a distance, but he claimed that it was in self-defense.A witness who initially testified to have seen Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying her initial statements were coerced.For decades, advocates such as Nelson Mandela, Pope Francis and James H Reynolds,the US attorney who handled the prosecution and appeal of Peltier’s case, have fought for his release.In recent years, Reynolds haswritten to various presidents, asking them to grant Peltier clemency and calling his prosecution“unjust”.In aletter to Biden in 2021, Reynolds stated that Peltier’s continued incarceration reflected a flawed justice system.Peltier’s “conviction and continued incarceration is a testament to a time and a system of justice that no longer has a place in our society”, hewrote.Peltier wasdenied parole as recentlyas July and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026.Biden commuted Peltier’s sentence despite objections from the former FBI director Christopher Wray. Wray had called Peltier “a remorseless killer” in a letter to Biden, which wasobtained by the Associated Pressand urged the president to not give him clemency.Wray argued that granting Peltier “any relief from his conviction or sentence” would be “wholly unjustified” and “would be an affront to the rule of law”.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS justice systemUS crimeUS politicsNative AmericansIndigenous peoplesJoe BidennewsShareReuse this content"

But unlike his counterparts in Italy, Germany or France, Pedro Sánchez was intent on rallying the country behind a markedly different approach.“Spain needs to choose between being an open and prosperous country or a closed-off, poor country,”he told parliamentin October. “It’s as simple as that.”Europe’s population crisis: see how your country compares – visualisedRead moreMigration was not only a question of humanity, he said, but – in a country where the birthrate rankedamong the lowestin the EU – it was the only realistic means of growing the economy and sustaining the welfare state.View image in fullscreenPedro Sánchez took a radically different approach to migration compared with his western European counterparts.Photograph: Luis Soto/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockMonths on, his stance has seemingly been backed by economic data: Spain’seconomy expanded by 3.2%last year. This far outpaced Germany’s 0.2% contraction, France’s 1.1% growth and Italy’s 0.5%. The figure was also ahead of Britain, whosetotal GDP grew by 0.9%last year and theNetherlands’ 0.8% growth.Crucial to this growth was the movement of people, said Javier Díaz-Giménez, a professor of economics at the IESE Business School. “It’s been done with a lot of tourists and a lot of immigrants.”A record 94 million touristsvisited Spain last year– up 10% on the previous year – creating jobs in hotels, restaurants and other tourist services. High rates of migration have allowed Spain to take advantage, and push unemployment levels to theirlowest since 2008,as migrants have plugged the gaps in a labour market where the working-age population is ageing.Other factors are also at play. Spain’s abundance of wind and solar renewables has helped to keep energy relatively cheap while EU Covid recovery fundsbolstered the economyand the socialist-led government ran a deficit to fund initiatives such as raising pensions and public sector hiring. “If you get this combination, it’s hard to beat,” said Díaz-Giménez.View image in fullscreenMore than 400,000 jobs created in Spain last year were filled by migrants or people with dual nationality.Photograph: Kevin Foy/AlamyAfter years of watching the far right’shardline views on migrationbecome mainstream, analysts were swift to highlight how Spain was different. “One remarkable facet of Spain’s recent performance has been the role of immigration,” economists at JPMorgan noted in a recent research report. “2022 saw the highest net migration in 10 years, at close to three-quarters of a million individuals.”The result was a working-age population that nearly doubled compared with other countries in western Europe. Of the 468,000 jobs created across Spain last year, roughly 409,000were filled by migrantsor people with dual nationality, many of them from Latin America, but also from across Europe and Africa. “Overall, Bank of Spain analysis suggests immigration contributed over 20% to the near 3% GDP per capita income growth during 2022-2024,” noted JPMorgan.The Spanish experience comes as countries acrossEuropewrestle with a seemingly intractable dilemma. As politicians on the far right and the right compete for votes by peddling hostility towards migrants, ageing populations are shrinking the pool of workers who can pay for pensions and support the welfare state.As Germany gears up to vote in elections on 23 February, the heated campaign hashinted at howthe rising rhetoric around migration is working against the needs of the economy.While some politicians had called for Syrians in Germany to return to their homeland, a study by the German Economic Institute highlighted that about 80,000 Syrians were working in sectors experiencing deep labour shortages, from the auto industry to dentistry and childcare.More than 5,000 Syrian doctors were also fully employed in the country, meaning returns could result in “critical shortages” in medical services, it noted.Studies carried out across Europe and the US had long demonstrated the economic benefits of migration, said Jean-Christophe Dumont, the head of the OECD’s international migration division. “What is clear is that migration makes a positive contribution to the economy, provided that it is well managed.”Migration had long been shown to be positive for productivity and income per capita in the long term, said Dumont. Additionally, “migrants contribute more in income tax and social contributions than they receive in individual benefits in all OECD countries”.The role of migration was likely to become sharper in the coming years, as the populations of OECD countries declined and people had fewer children, said Dumont. “But that migration needs to be well managed,” he added , citing efforts to ensure that migrants could learn the local language, that their qualifications were recognised and that they had access to housing.‘I was shot in the leg back home’: the refugees reviving rural SpainRead moreIn Spain – which has in recent years become one of the EU’s main recipients of migrants – the government has vowed to invest in improving integration, from helping migrants navigate the labour market to ensure they are not confined to low-skilled, low-paying jobs, to reducing red tape for residency applications.It was a glimpse of the delicate balancing act required of governments, said Rafael Doménech, the head of economic analysis at Spain-based bank BBVA.Spain’s relative openness to migration “is certainly an advantage and it’s an opportunity, but it has to be managed well”, said Doménech. “If not, it can lead to major imbalances and tensions that can turn into social unrest or foment populism,” he said. He cited thecountry’s housing crisisas a potential flashpoint.He cautioned that it was too soon to draw any sweeping lessons from Spain, a country where migrants had gone from making up less than 2% of the population in 1998, to more than 15% in two decades. “It remains to be seen how this will play out,” said Doménech, who pointed to countries such as Denmark, where the far right had successfully turned migration into a polarising talking pointafter years of relative openness.“I think we’re just getting started here,” he said. “It would be good to have this conversation in five or 10 years from now, so that we can evaluate how well Spain has done.”Explore more on these topicsSpainMigrationPopulationEuropeEuropean UnionEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

For about 30 minutes, Sugishita wandered the wreckage, looking at the empty space where his room had been.“What’s burnt is burnt,” the 26-year-old artist said. “I told myself: ‘I’m going to make something new out of this.’”Sugishita went to his car, took out the helmet sculptures he had saved from the blaze, and started photographing himself, using only his iPhone and a tripod.One of those self-portraits –Sugishita, standing amidst the charred ruins, wearing a helmet of flowers – is now at the center of a Los Angeles art exhibit that opened Friday, which brings together the work of nearly 100 artists who lost their homes, studios and life’s work to January’shistoric wildfires.Highlighting the ongoing toll of California’s extreme weather, the show for artists displaced by wildfire opened as the gallery was being flooded by torrential rains. Water seeped across the gallery floor, and workers swept puddles out the dooras new emergency alerts had been issued, highlighting the risk of mudslides in recently-burned areas acrossLos Angeles.View image in fullscreenPaul McCarthy, a prominent LA-based contemporary artist, contributed to the post-wildfire show.Photograph: Joshua White/courtesy of Aram MoshayediSome of the artists who contributed to the new show are well-known, such asRuby Neri,Kelly Akashiand Kathryn Andrews, or even, likePaul McCarthy, famous in the art world for decades. Others have mostly exhibited their work locally, or are just beginning their careers, like Sugishita, who graduated from art school in 2023.“It felt really necessary to create a context where people who have been displaced could converge together, in an exhibit that could be as far-reaching and inclusive as possible,” said Aram Moshayedi, who serves as the interim chief curator of the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, but who put together the show independently, as part of an all-volunteer effort.A hundred percent of any sales will go to the artists, he said, inspiring the show’s name: One Hundred Percent.The thread of the exhibit is the artists’ common and very recent devastation. Some of the works exhibited are ones the artists threw in their cars as they fled the fast-moving flames.One Altadena artist gently touched the chipped frame of her photo collage of a contemplative woman, which had been damaged in her escape from the Eaton fire.For the past month, “all of my art has been in my van and in Airbnbs”, saidCalethia DeConto, 44, whose Altadena rental is still standing, but so damaged by smoke and soot that she cannot return.Daniel Mendel-Blackdisplayed a digital print of a painting that he had just finished in early January, but had been incinerated in the Eaton fire. The original painting had been inspired by themes of social fragmentation and dystopia, he said, and it was strange to try to reconstruct it. “A lot of things I could talk about conceptually, are now completely emotionally actualized,” he said.Some artists showed works salvaged from the ashes of their homes, likeRonna Ballister’s row of slightly charred ceramic pots, which the 73-year-old found by digging through the rubble of her Altadena home.View image in fullscreenA view of Ronna Ballister’s pottery, which she dug up from the ashes of her Altadena home, on display at the One Hundred Percent show in Los Angeles.Photograph: Joshua White/courtesy of Aram MoshayediFor others, their only option was creating something entirely new.Howard Goldberglost almost everything he had made to the Altadena fire, “30 years of art turned to ash”.Without a home, studio or materials, moving from place to place, Goldberg made new work using recent copies of the Los Angeles Times, a throwback to a technique he has used before. It felt appropriate, he said: “My own personal catastrophe is on the front page.” He rearranged the letters of the paper’s name into different daily messages, Among Less EliTes, me see LosT signAl, as if the newspaper itself was speaking, or even “blabbering”, like “an idiot that has to keep talking … has to find the story”.View image in fullscreenAfter losing his home, his studio and 30 years’ worth of work to the fires, Howard Goldberg turned to a cheap and easy material for making new work for the show: a daily newspaper.Photograph: Joshua White/courtesy of Aram MoshayediDisplaying their work in a group show with other artists who had suffered wildfire losses inspired complicated feelings, the artists said: hope that community could be restored by coming together, but also layers of grief and anger.View image in fullscreenThe Malibu house that Victoria Franklin-Dillon’s family had lived in for 70 years, burned to the ground.Photograph: courtesy of Victoria Franklin-Dillon“Behind every single one of these pieces is a whole history that is gone,” said Lou Dillon, 38, whose mother’s home in Malibu, where their family had lived for 70 years, had been reduced to charred stones. Dillon and her mother, Victoria Franklin-Dillon, 73, displayed their two works of art side-by-side: the mother’s drawing of a view from her Malibu home, and the daughter’s 2015 painting of that hill on fire during a previous Malibu blaze.“This was a climate change disaster and all of us are responsible for it,” saidCamilla Taylor, whose Altadena home was destroyed. “We are addicted to convenience, and there is a cost to that convenience.”The heat of the fire that burned their house was so great that “the windows didn’t break, they slumped, they melted,” they said. “I had a collection of marbles. They are now a single mass.”Taylor contributed a sculpture of a blackened figure with a metallic mask that had been stored in a gallery, and thus survived. Though Taylor had made the figure before the fire, it now reminded them of what it was like picking through the charcoal of their destroyed home, and seeing an occasional rivulet of metal.“It’s going to come for all of us,” they said. “We have to do better.”View image in fullscreenCamilla Taylor originally made this sculpture for a show about the climate crisis. After her Altadena home was burned down, she said, the figure has taken on a new meaning for her, reminding her of the sudden flashes of molten metal she saw while sorting through the charred ashes of her destroyed home.Photograph: Joshua White/courtesy of Aram Moshayedi/One Hundred PercentMany of the artists in the show had stories of dramatic escapes.Vincent Robbins, 87, said he had been trying to put one of his large paintings into his truck as he evacuated from the Eaton fire, but the 100mph winds picked up the canvas, and him with it. He ended up sprawled on the driveway, with broken ribs and a damaged tooth. The painting had to be abandoned, and was burned along with his home. He “used to live” in Altadena, Robbins said, now “it’s all powder.”For the show, Robbins, who has been living with his wife in a Fema-funded motel, had made a new abstract sculpture, decorating it in part with ash he had gathered from what was left of his home, as well as with some tubes of paint brought along by accident as he evacuated. He called it: Uncertainty.Almadeus Star, 82, described being on the roof of his Altadena house, trying to save it from a tree felled by the heavy winds, when the power went out. In the darkness, he decided to evacuate and grabbed what he could, including a single precious artwork, a container holding an old piece of cloth with spiritual significance that he calls Shroud of Altadena. It was, he explained, “something I could hold in my hand”. He put Shroud of Altadena on display in the gallery, alongside a smoke-smudged glass vessel that survived the blaze.View image in fullscreenMore than 80 artists affected by the wildfires in Los Angeles contributed to a new group show that highlights the diversity of the creatives communities destroyed in the fires.Photograph: Joshua White/courtesy of Aram MoshayediOther artists said the show itself had encouraged them to make new work, despite the many logistical hurdles of life in the wake of disaster.Right before the fire,Mary Anna Pomonishad just put what she thought was her best work on display at Altadena’s Alto Beta gallery. Then the gallery, and everything in it, burned. For a while, Pomonis said, she worried that she might not be able to work again: “To lose it all gave me a fear that I couldn’t come back from it.” But she worked through the fear, and was displaying a digital copy of one of her lost artworks, coupled with brand-new work.Kassia Rico-Yeh, 32, said she had been to the emergency room twice in the past month, dealing with the overlap of asthma, smoke and Covid. But she had finally managed to finish the painting preserved in her downtown Los Angeles studio, inspired by the afternoon light on the foothills east of the city. She completed the last details on Tuesday morning, she said, meaning the painting was likely still a little sticky.On the exhibit’s opening night, many artists’ names were simply written in pencil on the walls next to their pieces, and some works were not labeled at all. But as the artists who had contributed work wandered through the gallery, some said that –almost to their surprise – they thought the hastily-assembled show was good, perhaps even better than a typical group show in Los Angeles.“It’s high and low and outsider and insider,” saidMolly Tierney, whose Altadenahome and studiowere destroyed. “There’s a lot of interesting work.”Moshayedi said the show aimed to be “non-hierarchical”, bringing together artists who work inside and outside the commercial art world. “Hopefully, the visibility of some artists can help other artists who are in more perilous states of displacement,” he said, noting that the works on display ranged from $50 to $50,000 in price.View image in fullscreenThis original version of this landscape, by Devin True, was so damaged by smoke in his Altadena home that he printed a new version to display in the One Hundred Percent show.Photograph: Devin True/courtesy of Aram MoshayediWhile some of the artists who contributed work had lived in areas affected by the Palisades fire, an area by the Pacific Ocean north-west of the city, the majority came from Altadena, a town nestled in the foothills east of Los Angeles.Once relatively affordable, Altadena attracted a racially diverse and close-knit community of creative residents. It’s a particular loss, said DeConto, one of the Altadena artists, “when you’ve found that magical place and then that place is completely destroyed”.ArtistDevin True, 49, DeConto’s partner, said he and his Altadena neighbors spent the morning of the Eaton fire working to put out spot fires with garden hoses, in order to protect the houses still standing on their block. When the water in their hoses ran out, they filled buckets from a neighbor’s hot tub.Now, with Altadena badly damaged, and rents rising across Los Angeles after the fires, “we’re not sure where we can afford to live,” True said.What was clear, many artists said, was that they would find a way to keep creating.“I’m beginning a new life’s work, that’s the way I see it,” said Robbins, the 87-year-old artist who lost his home in Altadena. “We’ll see what we can do.”One Hundred Percent is on view through 22 February at 619 NWestern Avenue in Los Angeles.

To the barricades,” she cried, quoting the old leftist anthem in a video watched more than 30m times in its first week online, according to the Linke.WithElon Musk and the US vice-president JD Vance openly courtingthe anti-immigrant, anti-Islam Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the German election campaign has undergone a dizzying scramble of traditional alliances.As hard right populists succeed across much of Europe and incumbents such as Germany’s Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor,Olaf Scholz, fail to meet the moment, many leftist voters in particular have said they feel unsure where to turn, creating an opening for the once down-and-out Linke.View image in fullscreenElon Musk has openly courted the Alternative für Deutschland and its leader, Alice Weidel.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPA“The explosion of rents in cities has hurt so many people and the Linke is the only party really addressing it,” said Michael Müllich, 26, at a standing-room-only campaign event last week in the Treptow district of eastern Berlin.Asked whether a Linke vote may be wasted given its slim chances of entering government, the computer science student said the party’s “tax the rich” message was crucial. “And I’m counting on it to stand up to the AfD when it becomes the biggest opposition party,” Müllich added.Syrian-born Marah Abo Zraa, who works in administration for the city government, said she was “excited” to vote for the Linke in the first national election since she became a German citizen in 2023.“The lurch to the right really scares me, although I couldn’t be better integrated [into German society],” said the 19-year-old, who arrived withthe 2015 refugee influx. “The Linke is the one party really rejecting hate and incitement. All the other parties seem to want to fight the AfD by imitating it.”View image in fullscreenOlaf Scholz’s government collapsed in November.Photograph: Michael Kappeler/AFP/Getty ImagesThe unpopular Scholz’s fractious government collapsed in November butrefused to step aside in favour of his defence minister, Boris Pistorius, potentially setting up the SPD for itsworst result since the second world warin Sunday’s snap election.Withclimate protection slipping from the agendaas the economy, Europe’s largest, limps along in recession, the Greens have returned to the low double digits in the polls – kingmakers at best.Meanwhile,Sahra Wagenknecht, the left’s most prominent face before Reichinnek, defected from the Linke and formed her own party a year ago with a nativist call for slashing immigration, increasing social welfare benefits for German citizens and reviving ties to the Kremlin.After a strong run in June’s European elections and three eastern state polls in September, however, her BSW party’s national campaign has since fizzled amid internal divisions.Robert Ketel and Sarah Knothe, a couple doing their grocery shopping in Hennigsdorf, a traditional SPD stronghold north of Berlin where the AfD has made significant inroads, said they were both still undecided.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The party has also softened key foreign policy stances including opposition to Nato, now condemningRussia’s invasion of Ukrainewhile calling for a “diplomatic” solution to the conflict.Linke membership hassurged to the highest level since the 2009 financial crisisand pollsters say that some of the ground lost to the far right in the former communist east has been regained among west German intellectuals, particularly students.View image in fullscreenDamaged election campaign posters of the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, right, and CDU leader, Friedrich Merz, in Berlin.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPAMerz, who has positioned his CDU/CSU bloc far to the right of where it was under the former chancellorAngela Merkel, has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD, which is polling in second place with about 20%.But many voters say they wereunsettled by Merz’s gambit to solicit far-right votes for a tougher border policyin response to the arrest of an Afghan asylum seeker after adeadly knife attack. Analysts say the drive to the right may have in turn reinvigorated the left, with the Linke best placed to benefit.Just as the AfD’s strength has alarmed the conservatives, the far-left renaissance may serve as a wake-up call to the weakened SPD and the Greens that they risk losing touch with younger voters.A mock election held among the under-18s last weekshowed the Linke coming in first place with more than 20%, followed by the SPD on 18%, the CDU/CSU and the AfD nearly tied at almost 16% each.

They waved signs saying “Save Our Beaches” and “Sort Toxics at the Burn Site” as they walked up and down the path along Will Rogers state beach in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, just outsideLos Angeles.Their message? Wildfire debris isn’t just ash – it’s poison. “Asbestos, heavy metals, dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will not remain contained,” apetition circulatedby a local resident, Ashley Oelsen, says. “Toxic contaminants from the wildfire debris could leach into the soil and the waterways. Onshore winds will undoubtedly carry these hazardous particulates, compromising the air quality where people live, work and play. The risk to our ocean’s health is just as alarming.”The celebrated stretch of beach isn’t the only place where a post-fire debris debate is brewing. With more than 6,800 structures destroyed in the Palisades fire – and another 9,400 in the Eaton fire across the city – there are tons of ash and debris – including burned-out cars, propane tanks, pool chemicals, paint and insulation with asbestos – that need to be cleaned up and removed. Winds and rain can carry bits of toxic material into other sensitive areas, so there is a rush to move quickly. The army corps of engineers estimates4,250,000 tonsof structural ash and debris need to be removed after theLA firesof 2025.The EPA has planned to clean up hazardous materials in just a month – a timeframe it announced in late January, after Donald Trump visited the area. The size of the disaster makes that timeframe challenging – after the devastating fires in Lahaina, Maui, it took the EPA more than three months to remove hazardous materials from just 1,448 properties that burned.‘Altadena is not for sale’: LA residents fear being forced out by wildfire rebuildRead moreOn a precious segment of California coastline, there are few places where the debris can be sorted. Right now, the Palisades cleanup is focusing onphase 1: the removal of hazardous material. For that, the EPA has deployed more than 1,000 people to remove, sort, consolidate and truck away any hazardous items. Officials saythe staging sitesneed to be at least five acres large, and preferably paved, so that trucks can enter and exit, and they can lay down large plastic sheets and fencing to contain dust.“In a situation like this, unfortunately, there are no good answers, and there isn’t really a ‘better place’. There’s just the least worst option,” says Annelisa Moe, associate director of science and policy, water quality, at the non-profit organization Heal the Bay in nearby Santa Monica.In Malibu, citizens objected to the EPA’s proposal to use a parking lot near the city’s Civic Center as a temporary storage place for hazardous materials. “I do resent comparing this to, like, cleaning out some old, like, Drano,” Jeremy Fink, a Malibu resident, said at a 5 Februarycity council meeting. “This is not fucking Drano.”Other residents pointed out the site was located only half a mile from two elementary schools, a quarter of a mile from the Santa Monica College’s Malibu campus and one mile from Pepperdine University. An EPA official has estimated this is thelargest lithium-ion battery cleanupin the world. Batteries can give off toxic gases and leach chemicals – and can also ignite new fires.Complicating matters further, the federal government has said it will not test the soil under properties burned in the fires, despite longstanding procedure – a decision first reported by theLos Angeles Timesthat came as a surprise to LA county officials.Following almost every major fire in the past 20 years, after removing ash, rubble and up to 6in of soil, agencies have sought sampling to ensure the next layer of soil is safe. This time, the army corps of engineers says the process hasn’t been authorized, and that simply removing 6in of topsoil is adequate, sparking concern from experts. After the Camp fire in 2018, lead and arsenic remained at a third of properties even after the topsoil had been removed. “We’re going to sit down and talk about this, because this is a concern,” Kathryn Barger, chair of the county board of supervisors, told the Times.Meanwhile, work has begun to sort and remove debris around the burn areas of the Palisades. At Topanga Beach, workers are handling lithium ion batteries from cars that have been burned, de-energizing them and sorting them for recycling, Moe says. Hazardous materials must be transported to permitted facilities out of state.Heal the Bay has opposed the EPA’sselection of Topanga beachas a site, due to its proximity to both the ocean, including a much-loved surf break, and streams that come down the canyon. “Topanga Lagoon is one of the last coastal wetland areas that exists, and so the protection of that area is incredibly important for us,” says Moe. “It’s also been a site getting ready for restoration work for the last 15 years.” That work now will have to change substantially.The EPA says the site is “highly controlled” and the agency is minimizing risk by wetting down any dust and sampling the area before and after its work. Moe still has concerns: “This is an unprecedented situation, and you never know what could happen.”Ash can get lifted into the air again by high winds, says Joost de Gouw, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado who studied the aftermath of the 2021 Marshall Fire in Boulder. “The biggest concerns are metals and asbestos, which have been associated with various health issues,” he says.The second phase of the cleanup includes removing what’s left around burnt buildings, including chimneys, hazardous trees, ash and up to six inches of soil. Materials deemed non-hazardous are already being transported to local landfills, which include Sunshine Canyon, the county’s largest active landfill. Some nearby residents worry that the fast pace of the cleanup means the lines are becoming blurred between what is hazardous and what is not.The county has said that landfills that accept ash have a liner system that prevents any contaminants from leaking into local groundwater.Recent rains have continued to bring ash and other runoff into the Santa Monica bay. Heal the Bay has been testing the ocean water off the coast of burned areas, both before the rains and after. The group collected samples and tested for levels of bacteria and turbidity – a measure of how cloudy the water is with suspended particles. They also tested for chemicals like Pfas – found in firefighting foam – as well as PCBs, benzene and metals such as mercury.Moe says the results aren’t back yet; runoff from the fire zone contains toxic substances for the ocean, but their concentrations are as yet unknown. It’s a similar situation on land. When the scientists tested the turbidity of the creek after it rained, their devices went to the maximum setting, with water that looked like milky fluid. The water isn’t used for drinking, but it plays an important role in the ecosystem, giving home to endangered steelhead trout, as well as dozens ofamphibian and reptile species. “We know there are particles in the water – not necessarily what those particles are,” Moe notes.Still, Federal Emergency Management Agency officials who presented at the Malibu city council meeting pointed out that leaving materials in place would do far greater damage than the “minimal risk of something to happen while the materials are in a plastic drum”.Moe agrees that it’s better to clean things up as quickly as possible, and that each choice will make some people angry. “Every location is going to be important to somebody, and so that’s why there’s no good answers here,” she says. “But there are places that we can look at that, while not ideal, would be a bit easier to contain.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresPollutionLos AngelesWildfiresUS wildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are typically applied at the back of a pet’s neck so they do not lick them off, according to Elizabeth Mullineaux, president of the British Veterinary Association.The insecticides are distributed through the grease glands of the coat and into the pet’s hair, making it toxic to fleas for one to three months.While there are a range of flea treatments, the two most common are imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and fipronil. Bothchemicals are bannedfrom outdoor agriculture to prevent the pollution of waterways.While some are available over the counter, flea treatments are often sold as part of pet healthcare plans by vets.What impact are they having on wildlife and the environment?Research at the University of Sussex has found that pesticides used inregular flea treatments are in 98% of English rivers, often at levels far higher than those deemed safe.Some of this is from treated dogs swimming, but much goesdown the drain from households, (eg from shampooing dogs, washing bedding, stroking and washing hands) and then enters rivers, according to Dave Goulson, professor of biology at Sussex, who co-authored the study and supervised the research.Recent researchalso found that 100% of blue tit and great tit nests are contaminated with pesticides from pet flea treatment, as the birds collect fur from dogs and cats to insulate their nests. The study, funded by the charity Songbird Survival, found that nestling mortality is associated with higher levels of the pesticides.“Other products used in flea treatments have not raised the same environmental concerns as fipronil and imidacloprid but we don’t necessarily have all the environmental data to say they’re absolutely environmentally safe,” said Mullineaux.So how can pet owners reduce causing damage to wildlife?The most important thing owners should consider is whether their pets need topical treatment and, if so, how often and when, and if there are alternatives, say experts.Mullineaux said: “Speak to your vet about the best way to use the products for your pet, and your circumstances and risk level. For example, the sorts of questions we might ask you are how much a pet goes outside, if you have other pets, if anyone in the household is particularly medically vulnerable, and what your pet’s lifestyle is like – whether it swims or goes for doggy daycare, or whether you need to wash and groom it a lot.“We strongly encourage vets and owners to take a risk-based approach to prescribing or recommending these medicines, reflecting an animal’s exposure to parasites.”If spot-on products are considered the only appropriate form of treatment, you should brush your pet indoors or in a sheltered area where you can gather the hair afterwards and dispose of it in a sealed bag.“What we don’t want is the hair blowing away and birds collecting it up as nesting material. I think a lot of us have probably thought that was kind of quite a nice thing for birds to do but clearly it really isn’t if the hair is contaminated with chemicals,” said Millineaux.It is also important to take care of packaging material, particularly from spot-on products. “I’ve heard horror stories of people washing out the little containers, which obviously do contaminate water,” added Millineaux.“What we want to be doing is not washing them out but disposing them of them in something like a seal bag and following any manufacturers guidelines.”Washing is discouraged for several days after treatments, owing to the risk of product getting into waterways.What about alternative treatments?There are plenty of suggestions for alternative methods of treatment – lavender oil, vinegar, rosemary oil, etc – but scientific evidence for their efficacy is scant, and some essential oils can be toxic for dogs.“When I’ve seen people trying to use these things, they can actually end up with massive flea infestations, which result in us using even more chemicals on both the pet, but also having to use it around the house as well,” said Millineaux.While there are still concerns over the environmental impact of oral medication for flea prevention, Ed Bailey, chair of Vet Sustain, an organisation that supports vets to change towards a more sustainable future, said there may still be a better alternative to spot-on treatments.“You might choose to use an oral product rather than a topical product to avoid the risk that we’re seeing with some of this emerging research … the two big bits of research that have come out recently are about ficronil and imidacloprid in wastewater, and were associated with owners stroking their pets and then washing their hands or washing bedding or directly washing the animal within the home and then [the product] going into wastewater.”Injectable products can also be used as a more environmentally friendly alternative to spot-on treatments. Liz Broadbelt, a retired vet from Ceredigion, advises cat owners to use injections that offer six-month-long prevention and control of flea infestation.“I have two cats. They are indoor and outdoor and, for many years, I have used injections every six months to control fleas. This is not an insecticide and works by blocking the development of flea eggs into adults. It doesn’t kill adult fleas. The main problem with flea infestation is the production of hundreds of flea eggs in the environment. I think this is a much more environmentally friendly way to control fleas, since it does not affect other invertebrates.”If you don’t want to treat your pet at all, then washing it weekly, washing the bedding, and vacuuming your house can be beneficial to remove flea eggs, Bailey says.“The advice would be around treating your pets in a more similar way to treating your children, in that you would check your kids for nits. You would use a nit comb but you don’t treat the kids every month for nits regardless of whether they have it. A flea comb can be beneficial for assessing whether or not there is an infestation present.”Explore more on these topicsPesticidesPetsPollutionBiodiversityAnimalsConservationWildlifeexplainersShareReuse this content"

Official figuresshowing strong wage growthappear to have ruled that out, at least for the time being.That is because policymakers at the central bank are likely to consider persistently high pay rises as inflationary. With prices already on track to edge up this year in response to elevated energy prices, only one or two quarter-point reductions in the cost of borrowing are possible without letting inflation jump even higher.There is always an element of doubt about the labour market figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), whichhave taken a batteringfrom MPs concerned about their accuracy after a drop-off in survey respondents.On the basis that they remain the best estimate by the ONS, a judgment thatannual wage rises including bonuses hit 6%in December from 5.5% in November, when City analysts expected wages to increase by 5.9%, must be taken seriously.It is not a large difference between the expectation and the data from the ONS, but the direction of travel is very much upwards.The Bank expected wage growth to accelerate. It expected an average increase in the fourth quarter of 6.3%.As the consultancy CapitalEconomicspoints out, data from HMRC shows employee wage growth up to January eased from 6.6% to 5.9% between November and January from the previous three months.Taking into account figures showing unemployment was steady at 4.4% in December and vacancies fell only slightly, Capital Economics said: “Overall, today’s data release provides little evidence that the Bank will deviate from its current gradual approach to interest rate cuts.”The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will read the data and could conclude that all the doom and gloom about her budget was overdone.The labour market was weakening before the October event and has continued to do so afterwards and only very slightly.Some retailers are blaming the tax rises in the budget for their financial troubles when it could be argued that their lack of cash is a result of boardroom mismanagement.Chancellors need to see past the pleading of some business sectors and resist the temptation to panic when the figures show the situation remains steady.However, there is another way to read the surprisingly strong increase in wages growth, which is even higher in the private sector at 6.2%, offset by a much lower increase in the public sector of 4.7%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The British Chambers of Commerce says that is definitely the way to think about businesses large and small.It says the most recent survey of its members reveals that four-fifths (79%) cannot easily find the staff they need to fill roles.“At the same time, three-quarters of businesses say labour costs are the biggest pressure they face to raise prices,” it adds.The tightness of the labour market, even after a rise in unemployment and fall in vacancies, illustrates how much work the government must do to improve skills and bring people of working age back into the labour market before wages track downwards and borrowing costs become much cheaper.Explore more on these topicsBank of EnglandInterest ratesEconomicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsOffice for National StatisticsInflationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the anti-immigration Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is polling second in the run-up to the German federal election this month.But those wanting to shut Europe’s borders must contend with a stark demographic reality: the continent’s native population is expected to fall sharply over the next century in an era of low birth rates.Experts warn that European societies will age more quickly without immigration, bringing forward a host of economic challenges as workforces shrink and care burdens grow.“Most politicians on the centre-left and centre-right recognise that immigration is needed to ease demographic pressures,” said John Springford, an associate fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank. “They have sought to focus on tougher – and often inhumane – asylum rules in the hope that stricter border enforcement will provide political cover for higher regular immigration.“But radical right parties are increasingly challenging the mainstream consensus. Those countries that manage to hold the line against demands to cut working-age immigration will be in a stronger position economically in the long run.”The latest projections produced byEurostat, the EU’s official statistics agency, suggest that the bloc’s population will be 6% smaller by 2100 based on current trends – falling to 419 million, from 447 million today.But that decline pales in comparison with Eurostat’s scenario without immigration. The agency projects a population decline of more than a third, to 295 million by 2100, when it excludes immigration from its modelling.Eurostat’s baseline projections assume countries will maintain their average net migration levels from the past 20 years, but the Guardian has examined figures also published by the agency with this assumption left out.Likewise, the UK’s Office for National Statistics publishes population projections that include a zero net migration scenario.Italy, France and Germany, where anti-immigration politicians have recently made inroads, would face big population declines in a zero-immigration scenario.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has made cracking down on migration a priority in her first term, but her country has one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe and its population would more than halve by the end of the century under zero immigration.In Germany, where the anti-immigration AfD is polling second, the population could shrink from 83 million to 53 million over the next 80 years if its borders were completely closed.And in France, where the National Rally won the first round of legislative elections last summer after campaigning for restrictions on incoming people, a zero-immigration scenario would mean a population fall from 68 million to 59 million.Only a handful of EU states would notice little difference from closed borders: Romania, Latvia and Lithuania, all countries that have experienced a net outflow of people.Instead, in most of Europe, populations would not only shrink in the absence of current immigration levels, but also become older as the number of working-age people fall relative to elderly people.View image in fullscreenGiorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister, has cracked down on immigration – despite the country having one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe.Photograph: Antonio Masiello/Getty ImagesToday, 21% of the EU population is aged 65 or over. In Eurostat’s baseline scenario, this proportion will rise to 32% by 2100, but in the agency’s zero-immigration scenario, it will increase further, to 36%.Those studying Europe’s changing age pyramid say this will put countries under increasing economic pressure.“The main consequences will be slower growth because the labour force will shrink, and higher tax burdens, because pension spending and the demand for health and elderly care will rise,” said Springford.Indeed, much of the EU is already seeing this, with tax burdens – as expressed through tax revenue as a percentage of GDP – climbing in counties such as France, Italy, Germany and Spain in recent decades.The health and social care industries will become increasingly important for managing an ageing Europe, and many health systems in the EU are already dependent on immigrant doctors or nurses.“More people are going to require care, though that does depend on how healthy people are in old age, and how much care they need,” said Alan Manning, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics.“You also have the other side of the equation that because of fewer children, because of low fertility rates, you need fewer people in education and childcare. So what we need to be doing, in some sense, is redistributing people who were caring for children to caring for old people.”At the same time, experts stress that immigration is not a silver bullet for Europe’s demographic challenges, instead suggesting it is one of many solutions, or at least a way to ease the transition to an older society.“Increasing immigration levels will not solve these demographic problems on their own – the levels required to do so would be very large, and there are only so many migrants who are willing to move,” said Springford.“But they would help, as would raising employment rates of working-age people, pushing back the age of retirement, reforming pensions and shifting the burden of taxation from labour income to wealth, especially property.”Manning added: “For immigration to help, it’s got to be that immigrants are actually in work, and many European countries have quite low employment rates among a lot of immigrants. So you can’t take that as a given. If you had an immigrant who came in and didn’t work and then needed support, for welfare, that wouldn’t make things better, that would make things worse. So it’s really important that they’re going to be in work, and that has been problematic in some cases.”Within national borders, rural areas will bear the brunt of the EU’s coming population decline. Over the next 80 years, more villages could suffer the same fate as Camini in southern Italy.The village is one of many in the Calabria region where the population declined sharply later in the 20th century as younger residents moved elsewhere for opportunities.Camini has recently become the site of a project that is resettling refugees, in an attempt to bring the community back from extinction. It was cited ina recent Council of Europe report written by the Labour MP Kate Osamorthat examined the potential of immigration to alleviate the challenges of an ageing population.“I was watching the place slowly dying. The houses were just falling down because no one was living in them,” said Rosario Zurzolo, who was born in Camini and is now the president of the cooperative running the resettlement project,Eurocoop Servizi.So far, 50 refugees have settled permanently in Camini under the scheme, bringing the village population to 350, while a further 118 refugees are being temporarily hosted. A symbolic achievement for the scheme was the recent re-opening of the local school.Zurzolo says Camini can act as a model to help revitalise other European regions experiencing population decline.Serena Franco, who is also part of the Camini project and presented evidence to the Council of Europe for its report, added: “They’re bringing knowledge, and now we are starting to grow with them and to make new things, new processes, new jobs as well that would be impossible without them.”"

The problem is, most plastics can’t be recycled. And what remains are toxic heaps of trashByAlexander ClappTue 18 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 12.17 ESTShareOn a chilly evening in late 2016, a few miles from the Turkish city of Adana, a Kurdish farmer named İzzettin Akman was sitting on the second-floor balcony of his concrete ranch house when a construction truck backed up to the edge of his citrus groves, paused, then dumped a great load of rubbish along the roadside. Before he pulled away, the truck’s driver set a paper bag on fire and tossed it on top of the garbage, triggering an outpouring of flames blacker than the night sky into which they ascended. Akman leapt up, put on his sandals and sprinted out along his dirt driveway toward the crackling trash pile.The trash, by the time Akman got to it, was a hissing mass of fire. Plastic is less flammable than wood or paper, though it emits more heat as it burns. It is at least as capable as either of getting swept up in a gust of wind and, in Akman’s case, setting alight about 50 acres of orange and lemon trees. “Son of a bitch!” Akman wheeled around, ran back home, located a bucket, then rushed back to the conflagration, which he began dousing with water lifted out of a stream by the edge of the road.Akman kept pouring. After about an hour, the flames started to dampen, then die, revealing a bed of thousands of half-incinerated fragments of garbage. Akman knelt down to examine the smouldering pile, turning over bits of candy wrappers and makeup containers with his fingers before being struck by something peculiar. The writing on the packaging wasn’t Kurdish. It wasn’t Turkish either. Akman kept clawing through the still-scalding plastic, looking for price labels. He found several. They were in euros and pounds.For decades, Akman – a slim, middle-aged man with cheeks peppered by scraggly stubble – had, like generations of Akmans before him, made his living harvesting oranges and lemons and exporting them to Europe. Now Europe appeared to be sending its trash in the opposite direction, to the very edge of his citrus groves. Akman couldn’t help but be bemused by the occasional charred carton of juice jutting out of the pile. “That might have been made with my oranges,” he told me as we walked the edge of his farm, where, six years after its unceremonious dumping, the heap of garbage was now a lumpy mound of ash-cum-plastic.A few weeks after the trash was dumped beside Akman’s property, the leaves of many of his citrus trees started turning yellow. Then their oranges and lemons began dropping to the ground. A year later, by which time Akman’s losses had brought his family to the brink of serious financial trouble, the trees bore no fruit at all. It turned out that a truckload of garbage set alight along the side of a citrus farm, even if it only burns for an hour or so, can be the catalyst of much longer-term damage. Days after the trash pile had been extinguished, it continued to let off smoke in all likelihood responsible for decimating the bee population that helps pollinate Akman’s citrus trees. And the innumerable pieces of half-melted plastic that had washed into the creek that provides water for Akman’s irrigation system had broken down into billions ofmicroplasticsand contaminants that circulated toward his groves before eventually getting sucked up into the trees themselves, crowding their roots like particles of fat in human arteries.Akman’s farmhouse sits in south-easternTurkey, about two hours’ drive from the Syrian border. It’s a stunning landscape: a lush plain across which snowmelt from the Taurus mountains trickles out toward the Mediterranean Sea shimmering to the south. The roads really do smell of fresh oranges, the rocky outcrops are ringed with medieval monasteries and ancient fortresses, and the land’s fertility has been legendary for as long as anyone can remember. For good reason it was here, of all possible places, that humanity is believed to have first made the shift from so many tens of thousands of years of a wandering, nomadic existence to a settled, agricultural one.By the time I met Akman, his orange and lemon trees had begun to recover. But the land around Adana had not. The several tonnes of trash that had been dumped along the edge of his farm was, it turned out, no one-off. It was the start of something larger, more organised and more sinister to come.Since the mass rollout of plastics at trade fairs and expos in the 1940s,plastichad been marketed to the public as a material that would slip from sight as soon as the consumer had decided they were done with it. Manufactured from the chemical by-products of hydrocarbon refining, plastic has two advantages. It is scandalously cheap to produce, for its building blocks result from the production of energy itself. And it is extremely convenient to use.Yet plastic also comes at an unsustainable environmental cost, amounting to a ticking planetary timebomb in which objects that are used for seconds require nearly geological timescales to break down. Be it a lawn chair or a takeaway carton, the fate of the 9bn tonnes of plastic that humans have discarded since 1950 is much the same.It all still existssomewhere in some form.Much of it will spend thousands of years disintegrating into a near-infinite number of tiny pieces and contaminants, the devastating impact of which is still only slowly being understood.View image in fullscreenPlastic waste in Istanbul.Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesIn the 80s came a growing recognition of plastic’s disposal problems. Microplastics – a term not coined until 2004 – had been discovered within the stomachs of newborn albatross chicks off the coast of Hawaii, the waters of the Long Island Sound and inside the guts of fish. What really became of all the plastic we tossed away? That decade, the petrochemical industry hatched a solution to the spiralling publicity crisis. Discarding plastic, contended its producers in a well-funded marketing pivot, need not destroy the planet. It could help it. For you didn’t need to throw plastic into a landfill. And you didn’t need to burn it. The solution was to recycle it.Recyclingper se is not a myth. It is possible to turn an old issue of the newspaper into a new issue of the newspaper. It is possible to turn an old aluminium can of Dr Pepper into a new aluminium can of Dr Pepper. The copper extracted from electronic waste and the steel sourced from dismantled ships do end up in new electronic products and new steel structures. But the idea that the majority of plastics could ever be effectively recycled was to prove by and large a con, an attempt to impose a “circular economy” on a material to which it does not truly apply. For it has never been possible to functionally or economically convert most old plastic into new plastic. The process just doesn’t work.The most obvious difficulty pertains to the material. Plastic is a broad term for what is in fact thousands of different combinations of synthetic polymers that differ mainly in chemical complexion and quantity of additives. One recycling expert has likened plastics to cheeses: much as it is unfeasible to melt mozzarella down and expect to produce parmesan, so with plastic is it impossible to shred and reduce polyethylene in order to get polystyrene or polypropylene or polyvinyl chloride.It was a problem evident as early as 1969 when, in a collection of studies funded by Esso and Chevron, along with the American Petroleum Institute, the petrochemical industry lamented the fact that the miracle of plastic stemmed from its peculiar chemical makeup. “It is ironic that the very molecular structure that has made [plastic] so popular creates certain disposal problems,” conceded Thomas Becnel, a Dow Chemical executive. Plastic didn’t naturally break down in landfill. It couldn’t be re-smelted. It just kept accumulating.Then there are the economics of recycling. Manufacturing new plastic has always been cheaper than attempting to resurrect old plastic. “It is always possible that scientists and engineers will learn to recycle or dispose of wastes at a profit, but that does not seem likely to happen soon on a broad basis,” the American Chemistry Council claimed in a 1969 report entitled Cleaning Our Environment.There is a related problem here. Even if old plastic could be turned into new plastic at a profit, it is not a process that can be replicated countless times – as it can with, say, steel. After two or three uses, plastic wears down beyond any ability to cycle back into production streams, meaning that recycling never prevents final disposal; it simply delays it. As the Vinyl Institute, a plastics lobby, conceded in 1986: “Recyclingcannot be considered a permanent solid waste solution, as it merely prolongs the time until an item is disposed of.”The final reason why recycling offers no feasible solution to the problem of plastic’s disposal? It is increasingly being revealed to be a poisoning process. Consumer plastic contains a variety of poorly regulated additives – flame retardants, plasticisers, stabilisers – that, were they to be discarded and shipped to developing countries within steel drums, would be considered hazardous forms of toxic waste and therefore an illegal export. And while you might be forgiven for thinking that the recycling process – washing and shredding those plastics and melting them down – would eliminate these poisons, recycling in fact has the opposite effect: leaching those toxins out and diffusing them throughout newly created plastic, a process known as migration.Still, the most important argument against plastic recycling might be this: even if it were to work, even if it were to be profitable, even if it were to be safe, recycling plastic would still never address the engine driving our global trash crisis. This is our unsustainable production output. There now exists 40 years of evidence to demonstrate that countries claiming to recycle more also produce more plastic waste. Because there are a limited number of times that it can be resurrected, plastic invariably requires inputs of virgin resin during the manufacturing process, meaning that even the act of “recycling” plastic is never reducing waste but only ever guaranteeing more of it. Since the “solution” of plastic recycling was presented to the public, net plastic waste outputs in the US have skyrocketed, up from 60lb (27kg) a person a year in 1980 to 218lb (99kg) a person in 2018. The petrochemical industry knows all of this. It has known it for more than a generation now. Yet, all the same, recycling emerged as its answer to a cataclysmic trash pandemic of its own making.In the summer of 2017, Turkey’s first lady emerged on a stage in the capital of Ankara and announced a grand new plan for İzzettin Akman’s country. Over the next 15 years, Emine Erdoğan proclaimed, Turkey would be turning itself into a “zero-waste” nation. Sure, other countries began their pivots to a green future by slashing fuel emissions or constructing windfarms or taxing carbon outputs. But Turkey’s transition, Erdoğan explained, would start elsewhere. It would begin within the homes of 85 million Turkish citizens. Turks would be eliminating their trash.True enough, the country’s recent track record of discarding garbage had been dreadful. Over the previous 30 years, Turkey had become as addicted to plastic as any other place on Earth. Its network of public fountains – a tradition dating back half a millennium to the Ottoman sultans who aspired to adorn every community of their domain with marblesebils, “kiosks” of free-flowing water – had stood no chance against the unrelenting convenience of a water bottle made of polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, introduced to Turkey in 1984 and which, by the early 2000s, Turks were buying in the tens of millions every day. Street bazaars that sold fruits and nuts to shoppers bearing cotton sacks had given way to supermarkets that inserted every conceivable purchase into a low-density polyethylene bag – those plastic bags that are so flimsy you can see through them – which by 2010 Turks were discarding at the rate of 35bn a year.More than 90% of all of this plastic was ending up in landfill, the countryside or the sea, a travesty captured in real time in Fatih Akin’s documentary Garbage in the Garden of Eden, in which the acclaimed Turkish German film-maker, returning after a long absence to his grandparents’ picturesque tea-growing village in the mountains above the Black Sea, chronicles a plan to convert its outskirts into an open-air dump site. No one in the village wanted the landfill; the authorities schemed behind their backs and it went ahead anyway. The result is the entirely foreseeable problem of plastic sloshing down into town, leading Akin to a grim conclusion: “Trash is the global excrement of our society.”That Turkey, assured First Lady Erdoğan, would soon be just a bad memory. Her campaign would effect a “clean Turkey” through a state-sponsored campaign that would “prevent uncontrolled waste” by collecting plastic efficiently and recycling it, resulting in a “livable world for future generations”.View image in fullscreenEmine Erdoğan, first lady of Turkey, who championed the Zero Waste Project.Photograph: Ercin Erturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesA clean Turkey! A livable world! In the years to come, Zero Waste Project would garner Erdoğan accolades – “Zero Waste Project is not just a campaign, it is an emotion,” gushed one Istanbul daily – and award after award courtesy of global institutions ranging from the UN to the World Bank. She contributed to a book on her initiative, The World Is Our Common Home, and read it aloud to Turkish children herded into the garden of the presidential complex in Ankara, her husband’s 1,150-room palace whose construction had recently razed an ancient forest. Zero Waste Project would even be deployed as an instrument of foreign policy, espoused by Turkey’s diplomatic missions around the world to underscore its commitment to combating the climate crisis. “As members of a religion where waste is forbidden and a civilisation that kisses bread on the ground and puts it on their forehead, we have assumed a leading role against this threat,” vowed Turkey’s minister of foreign affairs, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.Only there was one small problem with Turkey’s self-coronation as a zero-waste nation worthy of such international emulation. No sooner had Erdoğan announced her initiative than Turkey emerged as one of the biggest recipients – and one of the biggest dumpsites – of plastic waste anywhere on the planet.Afew months after a truckload of garbage from the UK and Europe was set alight next to Akman’s citrus trees, and just weeks after Erdoğan pronounced Turkey a zero-waste nation, in 2017 the Chinese Communist party informed the world that it too wouldno longer be accepting trash.The petrochemical sector’s recycling push in the 80s was always dishonest. Plastic recycling was known to be unfeasible. But at play was an even deeper injustice. Because over the coming decades it wouldn’t fall to rich countries to process the ever-mounting piles of their citizens’ plastic refuse. In the 90s, plastic waste would get shipped overwhelmingly to poorer countries, which were desperate for economic opportunity of any kind, and whose conversion into western trash receptacles came with an unbelievable irony: these were the very countries that could barely manage their ownswelling trash outputs.In the early 90s China became the recipient of half the plastic placed into a recycling bin anywhere on Earth. Dusty bags of cereal, crumpled soda fountain straws, squished polystyrene egg cartons – for years all these things you thought nothing of tossing away became the objects of arduous, globe-spanning, carbon-spewing journeys, getting trucked to a nearby materials recovery facility and thereafter to a port, then shipped thousands of miles beyond that to any number of hundreds of Chinese villages that specialised in processing the contents of your recycling bin.By the early 2000s, American detritus had become one of the US’s biggest exports to China. At least as much plastic waste was getting jettisoned out of the EU from self-congratulating environmental stewards such as Germany, where state recycling quotas were often reliant on a filthy secret: much of the plastic that Germans claimed was getting recycled was in fact getting shipped to the other side of the world, where its true fate was far from clear.When China informed the world that it would no longer be accepting its plastic waste, many rich countries just located desperate new buyers – or unguarded borders – and continued to insist that their trash was getting recycled. As for petrochemical companies, they possessed every reason to keep on encouraging the diversion of all this waste: it would prove harder for western consumers to recognise the extent of the crisis – that the narrative they had been told about recycling often isn’t true – so long as it kept getting relocated thousands of miles away.Within months of China’s import ban, Greek garbage began surfacing in Liberia; Italian trash was wrecking the beaches of Tunisia; Dutch plastic started overwhelming Indonesia, its former colony. Poland would be forced to enlist a special police unit to patrol for waste getting trucked in from Germany. Trash exports from Europe to Africa quadrupled, Malaysia became the world’s greatest recipient of US plastic waste and the Philippines threatened Canada with war for dispatching containers of dirty diapers to the capital, Manila. And within less than a year of Erdoğan’s launch of the Zero Waste Project, more than 200,000 tonnes of plastic waste that would have headed to south-eastern China at any point in the previous 30 years made its way instead to south-eastern Turkey.At its most innocuous, the global waste trade shifts garbage from the world’s richest countries to those places that can least afford to handle it. At its most nefarious, the global trash trade is an outright criminal enterprise. Turkey was to prove a showcase for both. Most of its imported plastic was arriving from the UK, whose waste brokers – the businesses that function as intermediaries between the (often) publicly funded collection of your trash and the (often) privatised business of what becomes of it – had narrowed in on an egregious incentive for exporting garbage. They received paycheques from a state that, in the wake of Brexit, struggled to find lorry drivers and port workers, resulting in surging transport costs and massive delays and mounting piles of refuse. At just the time that China announced that it would no longer be taking the world’s plastic garbage, the UK threw up its hands and offloaded the task of waste management on to practically anyone willing to take a stab at it.In exchange for claiming to have collected 1 tonne of household plastic for recycling, a British waste broker could receive up to £70. Tens of thousands of waste brokers in the UK would eventually be found to be operating without legal permits, garbage parvenus looking to make quick cash off the UK’s desperate attempt to appear like a global paragon of environmentalism – and its even more desperate need to turn its plastic waste into someone else’s problem. So absurd was the situation that the Guardian journalist George Monbiot managed to register his long-deceased pet fishas a professional waste broker.Soon half the plastic garbage the UK insisted was being recycled was being shipped abroad, approximately half of that to Turkey. And that was just year one. Within three years of Erdoğan’s announcement of the Zero Waste Project, more than 750,000 tonnes of old plastic was being diverted to Anatolia from across Europe, turning Turkey into the single greatest recipient of plastic waste on the planet. The equivalent of one dump truck full of foreign garbage was entering the country every six minutes.To be fair, some of the plastic waste that got shipped to south-eastern Turkey really would be put to use. Its fate, however, was almost never to cycle back into its earlier form but to get turned into shoddy home goods. Through a stupefyingly energy-intensive and polluting process, western plastic was cleaned, shredded into flakes, chemically reduced, then converted into polyester, which in recent years had begun to replace world-renowned Turkish cotton as the preferred material of the country’s garment industry. If it wasn’t turned into carpet padding or dish towels, some of the plastic was burned in any number of Turkey’s cement factories, providing cheap – or even free – fuel for a construction industry that profited from erecting battalions of drab apartment buildings across Anatolia.View image in fullscreenGoats forage amongst dumped rubbish in Adana.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The GuardianBut a lot of the plastic that headed to south-eastern Turkey was too dirty to convert into a bathmat or incinerate as fuel. Its fate would be that of the garbage İzzettin Akman observed getting set alight on the edge of his farm: to get covertly dumped somewhere in the countryside and spend the next tens of thousands of years breaking down into billions of minuscule plastic pieces that would enter the sea and devastate croplands.Beginning in 2021, activists and journalists around Europe struck upon the idea of inserting GPS chips into empty bottles of laundry detergent or dishwasher soap, depositing them in local recycling bins, then tracking their movements thousands of miles to the east, to the most distant edge of Turkey, occasionally via wild odysseys that beggared belief in the dizzying amount of effort expended on moving material of such – apparently negligible – value. In one instance, journalists observed as a plastic bag dropped off at a storefront recycling bin outside a franchise of Tesco, a supermarket chain that liked to publicise its commitment to sustainability, got routed 80 miles from London to the port town of Harwich, from there to the Netherlands by ship, then to Poland by lorry before finally getting sent 2,000 milessouth to the outskirts of Adana, where it was found in an industrial yard layered with tonnes of other European garbage.Suffice it to say, by 2022 so much foreign trash was getting dumped under cover of night around Adana, across valleys or along rivers or indeed on the edge of farms, that the only way for local environmentalists to track its arrival was to monitor the region from several thousand feet in the air with drones. “About once a month we find a big new pile of garbage,” Sedat Gündoğdu, a marine biologist at Çukurova University in Adana, told me.I said goodbye to Akman after a few pleasant days in Adana in which spring seemed to elbow its way out of winter almost overnight, turning the city’s legion of orange trees into glorious shocks of white blooms. It was only after leaving the bursting Levantine landscape behind me that, while scrolling through my phone during the 13-hour bus ride back to Istanbul, I stumbled on a news article about one more Turkish government plan aimed at achieving “a significant reduction in the carbon footprint” of the country.It was a plan focused on, of all places, the one I had just left – a slice of sun-shellacked Mediterranean coast due south of Akman’s farm. In October 2021, the president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, flew to Adana to lay the foundation stone for a new petrochemical plant that would come to occupy a beachhead stretching the length of 2,000 football fields. The Turkish Wealth Fund, which was fronting $10bn for the “Ceyhan mega petrochemical industry zone”, insisted on its environmental bona fides. It claimed that turning south-eastern Turkey into a “global hub of petrochemicals” would ultimately reduce the country’s reliance on imported polyethylene, thereby freeing up Turkish capital to combat climate change in the longer term. The logic sounded like a parody of the arguments made by certain advocates of the green energy transition who maintain that accelerating carbon output in the next few years is justified by the streamlining of clean-energy sources it may guarantee for the rest of time.The rubbishscapes of Essex: why our buried trash is back to haunt usRead moreAdana was no longer just going to take in trash, in other words. Instead it was going to build its future economy around it. And Turkey was no longer going to continue to feign any commitment to a zero-waste future. Instead it was going to throw itself into the madhouse business ofmanufacturingplastic – 3bn lb of it a year, the equivalent of 60bn plastic water bottles. You would no longer need drones to track it. It would be right there in front of you, in full view, getting cooked into existence.And in all this – the transformation of the “fertile crescent” into one of the largest recipients of plastic on the planet, and a place that felt it had no other option but to open itself to the production of the very material destroying its hills and rivers and farms – it was hard not to detect a certain unnerving symbol of our age as well as a dire warning for our future.This is an edited extract fromWaste Wars:Dirty Deals, International Rivalries and the Scandalous Afterlife of Rubbishby Alexander Clapp, published by John MurrayListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readPlasticsRecyclingPollutionTurkeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The president outlined his red lines, too: that the US would have to be involved in some way in securing Ukrainian security once the fighting stopped; and that any negotiations over its future would have to involve Ukraine itself.Yet asMichael Safihears, barely two days later Donald Trump blew all of that out of the water. The US president said he had calledVladimir Putindirectly and begun to discuss how the war in Ukraine might end.If the announcement shocked leaders in Kyiv and acrossEurope, worse was yet to come – as statements from senior Trump officials began to call into question the very future of any US support for Europe’s security, undermining an alliance that came into existence nearly 80 years ago.So, what next for Ukraine?

The RSF holds the northern parts of the state, including the villages where the latest attacks took place.A medical source said it was nearly impossible to confirm a toll.“Some bodies are still lying in the street, and some were killed in their homes and no one can reach them,” the source said, requesting anonymity for safety reasons.Fighting has intensified across Sudan in recent weeks as the army attempts to reclaim full control of the capital from the paramilitaries.On Tuesday, the Emergency Lawyers accused the army of “barbaric” assaults on civilians in east Khartoum, days after its paramilitary opposition killed six civilians in the area.The network said that civilians in the East Nile district accused of collaborating with the RSF had been subjected to “killings, forced disappearances and arbitrary arrests” by individuals linked to the army.The UN’s children’s agency said children in Khartoum were trapped in “a living nightmare” of indiscriminate shooting, looting and forced displacement.Unicef said it had also received alarming reports of families being separated, with children abducted and subjected to sexual violence.The UN human rights office said “entrenched impunity” had fuelled mass human rights violations across Sudan.“Continued and deliberate attacks” on civilians including “summary executions, sexual violence and other violations and abuses underscore the utter failure” by both sides to respect international humanitarian law, it said in a statement on Tuesday.‘In El Fasher you face only death’: Sudan city empties as paramilitaries close inRead moreThe UN also called for the expansion of the international criminal court’s jurisdiction and a longstanding arms embargo to cover all of Sudan instead of just Darfur.The vast western region, home to around a quarter of Sudan’s population, has seen escalating violence in recent weeks as the RSF seeks to consolidate its hold. The paramilitary group has intensified attacks on North Darfur state capital El Fasher, the only major city in Darfur it does not control.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We are also aware that children were in possession of weapons,” Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN’s Office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR), said on Tuesday.Shamdasani said the three children, all boys aged 15 or younger, were in uniform and carrying weapons – all from an abandoned DRC military camp – and were killed when they refused to surrender the weapons.Decades-long fighting among regional armies and rebels in the mineral-rich eastern DRC has killed and displaced millions of people. Fighting escalated last month when M23 fighters captured parts of North Kivu and advanced towards South Kivu.Last week, M23 rebels occupied Bukavu, the second-largest city in eastern DRC, after earlier capturing the city of Goma.M23 is the latest in a string of Tutsi-led insurgent groups to operate in the region since a 2003 deal that was meant to end the wars that had killed 6 million people. It says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities.The DRC, the US and others have accusedRwandaof backing the group, which it denies.The UN has in the past accused the Congolese army and opposing militias of recruiting children, and the UN human rights council is investigating rapes, killings and other abuses committed by both sides.A Guardian report in Decemberdetailed stories of executions of children and rape of women by M23 rebels. The group’s spokesperson, Lawrence Kanyuka, said the allegations did not “reflect the likeness of the situation”.On Tuesday, M23 reopened a ferry route between Bukavu and Goma on Lake Kivu after weeks of closure, and Ugandan soldiers entered the north-eastern DRC city of Bunia to help Congolese troops fighting the rebels.This year’s conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of people in eastern DRC and between 10,000 and 15,000 have crossed into neighbouring Burundi in days,the UNsays. “The situation in the eastern DRC remains extremely challenging and fluid,” Shamdasani said.In the statement, Shamdasani condemned attacks on hospitals and humanitarian warehouses, and threats against the judiciary, all which were said to be connected to M23’s advance in eastern DRC.On Tuesday, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it had summoned Rwanda’s envoy to the UK to condemn the group’s advances.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandaUnited NationsHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

There was an exchange of fire, but it was not clear if any of the attackers were injured or killed, Guyana’s defense force said.“The force remains committed to protecting its borders and will take all necessary measures to address any threats to national security,” it added. The injured troops were airlifted to Georgetown, Guyana’s capital, for medical treatment.Yvan Gil, the Venezuelan foreign minister, accused his Guyanese counterpart, Hugh Hilton Tod, of spreading “a false, hostile and malicious narrative about an alleged attack against Guyanese troops”.Gil added that the information “is a false-flag operation and fake news designed to manipulate public opinion and divert attention from the violations of international law”.The attack comes as Guyana and Venezuelacontinue to feudover land and maritime borders.Venezuela claims that an 1890s boundaries commissioncheated it out ofthe mineral rich Essequibo region, which represents two-thirds of Guyana’s territory and lies near big offshore oil deposits. The area, which was administered by Britain for more than a century, has been under Guyanese control since 1966, when the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom.Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, has threatened toannex the regionby force.In late 2023, the leaders of both countries attended an emergency summit where theypromised to not use threats or force against each other.

The crash, which occurred at Canada’s busiest airport, sent 21 people to the hospital, including three in critical condition.Soon after the crash,mobile phone clips capturedthe harrowing moments when passengers escaped through the plane’s upside-down doors and into the bitter cold. Blasts of fire retardant hung in the air and some of the passengers stood dazed in the snow. Others unleashed a string of expletives as they processed the unfolding chaos.“Oh no, no, no, no, no,” the person recording the crash can be heard saying as the fuselage rolls over.At least 18 injured after plane crashes and flips on landing in TorontoRead moreTwo adults in critical condition were airlifted to a nearby trauma centre and one child was taken by ambulance to a hospital in downtownToronto. In a post on social media on Tuesday, the airline said 19 people had since been released from hospital.Flight 4819, a Bombardier CRJ900 jet operated by the Delta subsidiary Endeavor Air, crashed while landing in Toronto around 2.45pm local time, having flown from Minneapolis in the US state of Minnesota.In audio from the air traffic communications, the plane was described “upside down and burning” moments after impact, with passengers exiting the aircraft as plumes of thick black smoke poured from the burning fuselage. The US Federal Aviation Authority said all 80 people onboard had been evacuated.Peter Carlson, a passenger on the plane, toldthe Toronto Starthe crash felt like he had “smacked into a wall” before passengers were flipped sideways. When he realized he was uninjured, Carlson scanned the plane, undid his seatbelt and “kind of just dropped”. He sent a message to his wife: “I love you, and I love our kids” and helped other passengers exit the plane.The CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, Deborah Flint, hailed the response of the plane’s crew, telling reporters on Tuesday: “The crew on Delta flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety, evacuating a jet that had overturned on the runway on landing amid smoke and fire. I thank each and everyone of these heroes.”The cause of the crash is not yet clear, but Todd Aitken, the airport’s fire chief, said: “It’s very early on. It’s really important that we do not speculate. What we can say is the runway was dry and there was no crosswind conditions.”The crash came as the country’s biggest airport was struggling to clear a backlog of delayed and cancelled flights, following a huge snowstorm that battered the city on Sunday.By Tuesday morning, two of the airport’s five runways remained closed.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTorontoAmericasAir transportPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

They went there to murder him,” the mayor’s politician nephewtoldthe local press.Officials including São Paulo’s rightwing governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, and the country’s leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, weighed in with messages of outrage and support. “This crime must be thoroughly investigated and those responsible must receive exemplary punishment,” Luladeclared.But this week police investigators said they believed the seemingly botched homicide was a fraud and launched a series of raids targeting suspected conspirators code-named Operation Hidden Fact.The supposed ambush on Silva’s vehicle had, police told reporters, actually been a farce engineered by supporters of the 72-year-old mayor. They allegedly hoped the attack would cause an outpouring of sympathy and boost his campaign in the days before the vote.Police said evidence gathered as a result of one plea bargain deal suggested Silva’s allies had paid 500,000 reais (about $88,000 or £70,000) for the duo of bogus shooters to launch their fake strike on his SUV.“It was the mayor himself who asked for [them] to shoot at his car’s windscreen,” one unnamed witness reportedly told police, although investigators admitted they did not yet have conclusive evidence proving the mayor’s involvement in the ruse.Silva’s lawyers denied he had played any role in the alleged hoax and said he was surprised by claims the attack had been a simulation. “José Aprígio is a victim,” his lawyer, Allan Mohamed, claimed, pointing out that the mayor had been severely injured during the Kalashnikovattack and “nearly lost his life”.Reports in the Brazilian media suggested Silva’s injuries might well have been unintentional. According to police, plotters failed to take into account that the ballistic protection level of the mayor’s armored vehicle was insufficient to stop the bullets fired by assault rifles like the AK-47.“Evidence gathered … shows that there was no attempt to murder the mayor … as described by him, but a sham” designed to swing the election his way, a police report quoted by the news website G1claimed.If indeed that was the plan, it backfired badly. Silva failed to win re-election with voters instead handing his rival, Daniel Plana Bogalho, a landslide victory.“I can’t say I’m surprised because we were always sure this was a set-up. I’m happy with the way things have turned out,” Bogalho said on Monday, adding: “I hope now justice is truly done.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The move came amid domestic criticism of a lack of transparency, including a protest march to parliament on Tuesday.Cook Islands PM defends signing of wide-ranging deal with ChinaRead more“This does not replace our longstanding relationships withNew Zealand, Australia, and others, but rather complements them, ensuring that we have a diversified portfolio of partnerships,” prime minister Mark Brown told the Cook Islands parliament.“We are strengthening economic diplomacy through initiatives like our comprehensive strategic partnership with China,” he added, pointing to opportunities on offer in areas such as trade, infrastructure, and ocean resources.Opposition has grown in the Cook Islands to any threat its pacts with China pose to close ties with New Zealand, and Brown’s government faces a no-confidence vote in parliament after 25 February called by opposition parties.Roughly 400 protesters – led by opposition parties – gathered outside the capital city of Avarua on Tuesday, RNZ reported, with some holding signs reading “Stay connected with New Zealand”. Others waved placards showing the New Zealand passport in opposition to Brown’s now-abandonedcontroversial proposalto introduce a separate Cook Islands passport, which New Zealand warned would require holders to renounce their New Zealand one.“We have no problem with our government going and seeking assistance,” opposition leader Tina Browne said. “We do have a problem when it is risking our sovereignty, risking our relationship with New Zealand.”Last week, the prime minister signed an “action plan for the comprehensive strategic partnership” with Chinese premier Li Qiang in the northern city of Harbin during a five-day state visit toChina. Brown said earlier the accord set a framework for engagement in areas including trade, investment, ocean science, infrastructure and transport.After returning home on Monday from China, Brown told reporters he would release the full details of the agreement soon, and said China would provide the Pacific nation of 17,000 people with a one-time grant of about $4m.“Our ministries will be looking carefully at where they would look to allocate that funding as part of projects or initiatives that we might want to promote. And at this stage, it’s looking like primarily in the area of renewable energies,” Brown toldCook Islands News.The self-governing Cook Islands has a “free association” relationship with New Zealand, which provides budgetary assistance as well as helping on foreign affairs and defence. Its citizens hold New Zealand citizenship.New Zealandexpressed“significant concern”about a lack of transparency over the trip, amid growing concerns over China’s push for influence in the region, and alarm that Brown failed to properly consult New Zealand officials over the deal, which is an obligation within thespecial constitutional arrangementbetween the two nations.Brown said Wellingtonshould not have any concernsafter it reviews the deal.Cook Islands officials say they also discussed seabed minerals research with Chinese institutes during the visit to China, as the Pacific islandmulls deep-sea mining of nodules rich in metalssuch as nickel and cobalt.China’s state news agency Xinhua earlier quoted Li as saying the agreement would “deepen political mutual trust and expand practical cooperation with the Cook Islands”.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCook IslandsPacific islandsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Others include the Yankunytjatjaraartist Kaylene Whiskey, whose colourful works celebrate female pop culture figures such as Dolly Parton and Tina Turner; and Tokyo’s “half human, half toy” artist Saeborg, who creates disconcerting, cartoonish latex sculptures.Swingers’ curator, Grace Herbert, says she wants to celebrate the “surprisingly subversive” history of mini-golf, which originated in 19th-century Scotland after a group of women endured antagonism from male players while playing at St Andrews Links, one of the oldest and famous golf courses in the world.View image in fullscreenSaeborg’s work at the 2019 Dark Mofo festival in Tasmania.Photograph: Jesse HunnifordThe women decided they needed their own club and established the St Andrews LadiesGolfClub in 1867, with Mrs Robert Todd Boothby as president and Miss Ellen Boothby as vice-president.A nine-hole mini-golf course, called the Ladies’ Putting Green, was laid out for them by the famed Scottish golferOld Tom Morris.Herbert says Swingers will be family-friendly and will take roughly 45 minutes to an hour to complete.“It’s a nine-hole mini-golf course, except that each mini-golf hole is also an artwork,” Herbert says. “Every hole will be playable, though they may not be exactly what you would think playing a mini-golf hole will be like.”While she wants to keep July’s work a secret, Herbert reveals it would be the final hole. “Usually on the last hole of mini-golf, it eats your ball so you don’t get it back. When you play Miranda’s golf hole, you’ll be able to take some words from Miranda home with you. It is a really generous work.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhiskey’s work will be the first hole, Herbert says, and will draw on her childhood experiences travelling from her home in Indulkana, in the APY Lands, to play golf in Adelaide as a child. “Being Kaylene, of course we’ll have Dolly Parton there and you’ll have to putt through Cathy Freeman’s leg.”And Saeborg’s work will involve her usual inflatable animal latex body suits and will require players to don a strap-on animal tail and use it to putt. “I guess you’ll become a human-animal hybrid to complete this course,” Herbert says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And also because they’d be giving something a go that they wouldn’t normally do.”The other artists creating holes are the Singaporean-Australian sculptural artist Nabilah Nordin, the Turner prize-nominated British Romany artistDelaine Le Bas; and the Minahasan artist Natasha Tontey, with three more names to be come.“Each of the artists is responding to the history of mini-golf, and has been prompted to think about things like obstacles and their removal – in both a literal sense and a metaphorical sense, in response to that surprisingly subversive history that that mini-golf has,” Herbert says. “Obviously people have fun but it is also political and I hope that people can also engage with those ideas and that history.”This is the third time the Flinders Street ballroom has been transformed into an exhibition by Rising, after a show dedicated to the Melbourne sculptorPatricia Piccininiin 2021 and the immersive Indigenous showShadow Spiritin 2023.The rest of the Rising festival program will be announced in March.

Within a few more minutes, the likes of Jerome Laxale, Josh Wilson, Pat Conroy, Shayne Neumann, Mark Butler, Helen Polley, Tony Sheldon and the retiring Graham Perrett had also taken to their social media accounts to broadcast the news.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIt was the news Labor wanted. Chalmers claimed it as an endorsement of the government’s work in battling inflation – but even as he noted there was more work to do, and that families were still hurting, other Labor figures were happy to offer more effusive analysis of the RBA’s 0.25% cut.“Our economic plan is working,” Polley tweeted.3:36RBA interest rate decision 'does not imply further rate cuts are coming', Bullock says – videoChalmers’ response to the long-awaited rate cut dropped into our inboxes barely five minutes after the decision. The government had been sweating on an interest rate cut to boost its election chances, with the way now clearer for an announcement of a poll date potentially as soon as early April. Among the prevailing logic was that if Tuesday brought a rate cut, the election trigger would be pulled for April – but if rates stayed on hold, we’d hit the polls in May.“This will have no impact on the timing of the election,” Anthony Albanesesaid on ABC Radio in Brisbaneon Tuesday afternoon, suggesting more strongly than before that the government would indeed hold its scheduled budget on 25 March.‘Hypocrisy and shallowness’: the $110,000 ticket to Australian politicians in lead-up to electionRead moreThe Guardian Essential poll on Tuesday foundless than half of Australians could rememberthe government’s most proudly touted economic achievement, back-to-back budget surpluses. But a long-awaited rates cut on the eve of an election announcement may be a different story.There is also the potential of another rate cut at the RBA’s next board meeting on 1 April, which would be either just before an early April poll date or in the thick of one held in May – although the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, cautioned Tuesday’s decision“does not imply”further rate cuts coming.The truth is, Peter Dutton and the Coalition still have no substantial cost-of-living policy or plans to speak of (beyond the vague-to-the-point-of-meaninglessness pledge of a “back to basics” approach, which apparently meansshaving off a handful of DEI staffin the public service and saving a pittance onwelcome to country ceremonies).Conversely, the government can tout its $300rebates on power bills, itsrejigging of the stage-three tax cutsto give relief to millions more middle-income earners, extension of free childcare, slashing of Hecs and Tafe bills, and now the proof in the RBA pudding, that its moves on inflation are bringing down price pressures.Indeed, Albanese pointed to several of these measures in an afternoon radio blitz across the country – Brisbane, Perth and Sydney – painting his decision to remix the tax cuts as “courageous”.We still await more details of Albanese’s much-discussed “forward offer” of Labor’s plan for its next three years if re-elected; just as we live in anticipation as to whether Dutton will unveil his own or simply seek to coast into The Lodge on vibe alone. But at this stage, the government does have a more compelling story about its economic plan.View image in fullscreen‘Too little, too late’: shadow treasurer Angus Taylor speaks after the RBA rate cut.Photograph: Flavio Brancaleone/AAPThe opposition’s response to the RBA decision took a bit longer than Labor’s instant excitement (threading the needle of backing a rate cut for homeowners and families while still criticising the government under whose watch the cut came takes some time) – but it was not glowing.“Too little, too late,” tut-tutted the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor.“Australians have had to squeeze their budgets, because Labor can’t control its budget.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe Coalition’s position, of course, was that while Labor oversaw one rate cut, it had followed 12 rate hikes in a row under Albanese; that while inflation may be coming under control, long periods of rising prices were now baked in; and that a slight rate cut today does not make up for how far backwards people have gone.It’s a fair point in a cost-of-living crisis, and one the government still does not have a decent answer for.While it’s unclear if it’ll be this weekend or next that Albanese gets into what he calls “the white car with the little flags on the bonnet” for the ride to Government House, the broad contours of a Labor plan urging voters to “stay the course” were evident in Chalmers’ press conference.“When we came to office, inflation and interest rates were rising, now both are falling. Other countries have had to pay for that kind of progress on inflation with much higher unemployment, negative quarters of growth or even recessions,” the treasurer said.Translated: look what we’ve done for you. It could have been much worse, if not for Labor.RBA reduces interest rates, but don’t hold your breath for too much more this year | Nicki HutleyRead more“We can’t be complacent about the months and years ahead. We know that there is more work to do,” Chalmers continued.Translated: don’t risk switching horses mid-race. Don’t risk Dutton.“I spoke to the CEOs of all four major banks. Each of them has made an announcement that each of the major banks will be passing on, in full, the benefits of the decision taken by the independent Reserve Bank today. I don’t take credit for those decisions that they have made and announced already,” Chalmers went on.Translated: don’t forget, it was under Labor that your rates started going down.As election date speculation reaches fever pitch, the key question will be whether Australians remember Labor for delivering one rate cut on the threshold of the poll, or overseeing the 12 rate hikes before that.Josh Butler is a political reporter based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyAustralian politicsJim ChalmersLabor partyInterest ratesCost of living crisisanalysisShareReuse this content"

They are not Australian and Australia doesn’t want them.”Adeang said Nauru had demonstrated its capability and willingness to resettle migrants during its history as an offshore processing site.“Even for the refugees that came here, they have the same history: some of them killed people, some of them are disturbed people. But they will not do that here, instead they will live their life as normal and be happy along with us all.”Adeang said the three men had been granted 30-year visas and the right to settle and work in Nauru.“They will be living among us like normal free people … nothing stops them from working and being a normal citizen. They are also subject to our laws, they will also get same punishment if they break the law.”At least one of the three menre-detained in Australia before his removal to Nauruhas been told he would be flown to the Pacific island next Monday.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut sources in contact with the men told Guardian Australia a legal challenge was being contemplated.The men were released from indefinite immigration detention to live in the community as part of alarger cohort of more than 280 non-citizensafter the high court ruled in 2023 it was unlawful for the government to detain someone indefinitely. Two of the men had been taken back into detention in Villawood, in Sydney, while another was re-detained at Western Australia’s Yongah Hill detention centre.The deal with Nauru willtest laws passed in Novemberthat give the Australian government the power to pay third countries to accept unlawful non-citizens on a removal pathway, allowing them to be re-detained if they refuse.The Australian government has refused to say how much it has paid Nauru to take the three men or if other concessions were offered but Burke said the deal had been proposed by Nauru.Burke said he expected a legal challenge to the decision to remove the men whom he described as “violent offenders”.“Whenever I make any decision, I presume that there’ll be a contest in the courts,” he said on Sunday, adding he was confident of the legality of the government’s position.Australia now holds about 100 refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru. They are people who arrived by boat to Australia to claim asylum but were forcibly removed to Nauru under Australia’s “enduring” offshore processing regime with the Pacific nation.Abdul*, an asylum seeker who had been held on Nauru for eight months, said while housing in the processing centre – which is not locked – was sufficient, “we cannot eat enough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everybody has lost weight, and is very sick.“And we are so stressed, we cannot sleep, we are worrying always about our future. We can’t find any hope, and we cannot spend our life like this for an indefinite period.”Abdul said he did not believe the new transfers would be accepted within Nauru’s tight-knit familial community.“Everyone sent here is suffering, we are all going hungry, and these people will also be suffering if they are sent here.”Jana Favero, the deputy chief executive of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the government’s actions sent “a clear message”: “If you are not born in this country, you will never be treated equally.”She said the forcible transfer had been announced in the media, possibly in the shadow of a federal election being called, raising questions about the fairness of these actions.“We are considering all options, including legal challenges, and will continue to fight for people’s rights.“There has to be consideration of the lawfulness of banishing people offshore when they’ve been living as part of our community.”Amnesty International said the government’s move to forcibly detain and deport people to Nauru was a “blatant attack” on the rights of people seeking protection and a “back-door deportation scheme” to continue people’s indefinite detention when it had been ruled unlawful by Australian courts.Amnesty argued that the new policy effectively extended people’s indefinite detention elsewhere.“This decision sets a dangerous precedent for future policies that could see more people removed without proper safeguards,” said Zaki Haidari, Amnesty International Australia’s refugee rights campaigner. “The Labor government must put an immediate stop to these deportations.”As ofDecember 2024, 64 of the NZYQ cohort are subject to electronic monitoring, while a night-time curfew has been imposed on 37.Explore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumNauruAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsPacific islandsTony BurkeLaw (Australia)newsShareReuse this content"

Experts are blaming this on an alarming mix of poor diet, mass inactivity and soaring obesity.The average annual growth in life expectancy across the continent fell from 0.23 years between 1990 and 2011 to 0.15 years between 2011 and 2019, according to researchpublished in the Lancet Public Health journal. Of the 20 countries studied, every one apart from Norway saw life expectancy growth fall.England suffered the largest decline in life expectancy improvement, with a fall in average annual improvement of 0.18 years, from 0.25 between 1990 and 2011 to 0.07 between 2011 and 2019.The second slowdown of life expectancy growth in Europe was in Northern Ireland (reducing by 0.16 years), followed by Wales and Scotland (both falling by 0.15 years).Sarah Price,NHSEngland’s director of public health, said:“This important study reinforces that prevention is the cornerstone of a healthier society, and is exactly why it will be such a key part of the 10-year health plan which we are working with [the] government on.“The slowdown in life expectancy improvements, particularly due to cardiovascular disease and cancer, highlights the urgent need for stronger action on the root causes – poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity.”The NHS helped hundreds of thousands of people lose weight through its12-week digital weight management programme, Price said. “However, more action is needed across society because we cannot treat our way out of the obesity crisis, and we need to stem it at source.”The study, led by the University of East Anglia, examined changes in life expectancy in 20 European countries from 1990 to 2021.During the Covid pandemic between 2019 and 2021, all countries except Ireland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Belgium experienced a decline in life expectancy, with Greece and England experiencing the largest falls.Life expectancy growth from 1990 to 2011 were attributable to improvements in countries tackling the risk factors for heart disease and cancer.However, deaths due to heart disease were a key driver of the slowdown in life expectancy growth from 2011 to 2019, coinciding with increasing BMI levels and high exposure to poor diets and low physical activity.The countries that best maintained gains in life expectancy after 2011, namely Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and Belgium, maintained or boosted life expectancy even during the pandemic.Researchers said that the countries which “best maintained” improvements in life expectancy had fewer heart disease and cancer deaths.They said the findings highlighted the need for stronger government policies to tackle obesity and increase physical activity levels.Lead researcher Prof Nicholas Steel, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School, said: “Advances in public health and medicine in the 20th century meant that life expectancy in Europe improved year after year, but this is no longer the case.“We found that deaths from cardiovascular diseases were the primary driver of the reduction in life expectancy improvements between 2011-19. Unsurprisingly, the Covid pandemic was responsible for decreases in life expectancy seen between 2019-21.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These trends are decades long – there isn’t a quick fix.“This is about the big, long-term population protections from risk – so engaging with the food industry to improve our national diet to make it easier for people to eat healthier food and make it easier for people to move a little bit in our day-to-day lives.”However, Steel said Europe had “not yet reached a natural longevity ceiling”.“Life expectancy for older people in many countries is still improving, showing that we have not yet reached a natural longevity ceiling. Life expectancy mainly reflects mortality at younger ages, where we have lots of scope for reducing harmful risks and preventing early deaths.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care said it had inherited a broken NHS, with underfunded, under-resourced public health services, but added that it was committed “to ensuring people live well for longer”.Its upcoming 10-year health plan would “shift the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention”, a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsNHSEuropeHealthUniversitiesObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

The once-obscure devices experienced a surge in popularity in Europe after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring.“The very strong growth that appeared in 2022 and 2023 – war-related and gas price-related – didn’t have a foundation in robust policy,” said Paul Kenny, director general of the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA).He added: “One would think in Europe – with the enemy at the gates, and energy security and energy sovereignty so important in political minds – our policymakers would take the sort of actions that society needs.”Graph showing how heat pump sales fell in almost all of Europe in 2024The EHPA said the fall in sales in 2024 was driven by political uncertainty and changes to support schemes in a handful of key markets, as well as a sluggish economy leading to an overall drop in heating installations.Analysts said the shift could be a rebound effect after two unusually good years for the industry but struggled to explain the scale of the drop. Two million heat pumps were sold in 2024 – the same as in 2021 – despite high gas prices and security fears continuing to plague Europe.“It’s just surprising given that the gas crisis isn’t over,” said Jess Ralston from theEnergyand Climate Intelligence Unit, a thinktank. “It’s really uncertain times, and a slowdown in heat pumps isn’t going to do any good for energy security.”She added: “Unless we start to move to heat pumps, we’re just going to see more volatility – in household bills as well as wholesale gas prices.”Heat pumps cost more upfront than gas boilers but are usually cheaper to run, and result in fewer societal costs from dirty air and violent weather. The International Energy Agency’sroadmapto greening the economy as fast as world leaders have promised shows the share of heat pumps in global sales of heating equipment soaring from 10% in 2022 to 50% in 2026.In markets such asGermanyand theUK, the devices have also been the focus of intense disinformation campaigns that authorities are only starting to challenge.The slump has also hit manufacturers. The EHPA said the heat pump sector has invested billions in additional capacity since the start of the war but “much of this capacity now lies idle”. It estimated at least 4,000 jobs have been cut, and a further 6,000 workers face reduced hours or other impacts.It called on the European Commission and national governments to put heat pumps at the centre of the clean industrial deal next week, which seeks to align the EU’s climate, competitiveness and geopolitics goals.Kenny said the fall in sales was a “lost opportunity” for Europe. “Without the heat pump, we don’t get away from Russian gas, or American gas, or anyone else’s gas.”Explore more on these topicsHeat pumpsEnergyEnergy efficiencyEthical and green livingUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His general audience on Wednesday has also been cancelled.Francis had part of his lung removed in his early 20s while training to be a priest in his native Argentina.Despite his hospitalisation, the pope has maintained his nightly routine since 9 October 2023 of telephone calls to the Holy Family church in Gaza.“He was tired but had a clear voice,” Father Gabriel Romanelli told the Italian press after Monday night’s call. “He asked how we were and thanked us with prayers. At the end of the call he gave us his blessing.”The pope, who has suffered ill health in recent years, was also admitted to hospital in March 2023 for what was initially said to be bronchitis but later diagnosed as pneumonia. He was readmitted to the Gemelli for health checks in June that year and again in February 2024 after suffering from what he said was “a bit of a cold”.He also underwent a colon operation in June 2021.The pope has often been seen in a wheelchair or with a walking stick as a result of a sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisHealthVaticanCatholicismItalyChristianityEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "1:45US and Russia to explore closer relations after Ukraine talks in Riyadh, Rubio says – videoUkraineUS and Russia agree to explore mutual opportunities of end to Ukraine warRiyadh talks involving US secretary of state and Russian counterpart mark tectonic shift in relationsPjotr Sauer,Luke Hardingin Kyiv andDavid Smithin WashingtonTue 18 Feb 2025 14.21 ESTFirst published on Tue 18 Feb 2025 09.59 ESTShareUS and Russian officials agreed to explore the “economic and investment opportunities” that could arise for their countries from an end to the war inUkraineafter talks in Saudi Arabia that amounted to a tectonic shift in Washington’s approach to Moscow.The statements from the two sides came amid concerns in Kyiv and acrossEuropethat Donald Trump could push for a peace settlement that favours Vladimir Putin. No Ukrainian or European officials were present at the meeting.Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump dismissed Ukrainian concerns about being excluded from the talks and, astonishingly, seemed to imply that Kyiv was to blame for the war.He said: “Today I heard, ‘Oh, we weren’t invited’. Well, you’ve been there for three years. You should have ended it three years [ago] – you should have never started it. You could have made a deal.”The president complained that he had seen no accounting of how US military aid is being spent and conspicuously avoided voicing support for Zelenskyy.“I think I have the power to end this war,” he said.After the talks at Diriyah Palace in Riyadh, the most extensive negotiations between the two countries in three years, the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, said agreement had been made to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks and to explore “opportunities which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine”.It marked a dramatic break with the Biden administration’s efforts to isolate Moscow. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Putin’s chief foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, were photographed sitting across from Rubio, who attended the talks alongside the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East.Rubio said an end to the Ukraine conflict must be acceptable to all involved, including Ukraine, Europe and Russia, and that Washington’s European allies had been consulted.Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, tweeted a message to Rubio: “Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps. By working together with the US, we can achieve a just and lasting peace – on Ukraine’s terms.”The talks in the Saudi capital, however, underscored the rapid pace of US efforts to halt the conflict, raising alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, where officials met on Monday to discuss the possibility of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine.Lavrov rejected the prospect of such a move on Tuesday. He said the deployment of Nato member troops in Ukraine, even if they were operating under a different flag, was unacceptable to Moscow. Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of western boots in Ukraine.Trump and Vance have smashed the old order – how should Europe respond? | Nathalie Tocci, Yanis Varoufakis and othersRead more“We explained to our colleagues today what President Putin has repeatedly stressed: that the expansion of Nato, the absorption of Ukraine by the North Atlantic alliance, is a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation, a direct threat to our sovereignty,” Lavrov said.He also rejected a US proposal that Russia and Ukraine halt strikes on each other’s energy infrastructure, falsely claiming that Russia had never endangered Ukraine’s civilian energy supply system.Shortly after the meeting, Ushakov said the talks had gone well, with both sides agreeing that negotiators would discuss Ukraine. He said a potential Putin-Trump summit had been discussed, but that it was unlikely to happen next week.Ukrainian officials were not invited to the talks. During a visit to Ankara, where he held talks with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid his country would not accept the results of talks on how to end the war with Russia that were held “behind Ukraine’s back”.The Ukrainian president told reporters no decision could be made without Kyiv on how to end the war, and that he would always reject Putin’s “ultimatums”.View image in fullscreenRecep Tayyip Erdoğan (right) welcomes Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the presidential complex in Ankara.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe discussions in Riyadh mark the first high-level attempt to negotiate an end to Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since the war’s early days, when talks collapsed over the Russian president’s demands.Despite the flurry of diplomacy, little is known about Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine or Russia’s willingness to engage, and Tuesday’s meeting offered few new clues.Both sides issued carefully worded statements when the talks concluded. Rubio said the meeting was “the first step of a long and difficult journey”, adding: “An end to the Ukraine conflict must be acceptable to all involved, including Ukraine, Europe and Russia.”Waltz said: “This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end as we’ve seen in the past.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even before the meeting began, the US made several significant concessions to Putin, indicating that Ukraine would have to abandon its Nato ambitions and accept territorial losses.Putin has not commented publicly on the Saudi talks but told Trump last week during a phone call that Russia wanted to “settle the reasons for the conflict”. Some observers believe this suggests Russia may not limit its focus to Ukraine and may instead seek to reshape European security more broadly.Moscow’s demands could resemble those it issued on the eve of its full-scale invasion in 2022: that Ukraine adopt a neutral status and that Nato halts the deployment of weapons to member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began expanding to include former communist nations. This would affect much of eastern Europe including Poland and the Baltic states – Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.After the talks, Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, issued what appeared to be new conditions for peace, saying Russia was demanding “not just a pledge to deny Ukraine Nato membership but the annulment of the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration which promised Kyiv eventual membership without a specific timeline”.Putin has previously insisted that Ukraine drastically reduce its military forces, which many in Ukraine fear would leave it vulnerable to future Russian attacks.In Riyadh, Russia was also expected to leverage discussions on a potential Ukraine settlement to push for relief from western sanctions, which have placed significant strain on its economy.A diagram annotating politicians from the US, Saudi Arabia and RussiaLeading Moscow’s economic negotiations is Dmitriev, the 49-year-old head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and a close friend of Putin’s daughter. A former investment banker, Dmitriev has played a key role in Russia’s outreach to international investors.“US oil majors have done very well in Russia,” Dmitriev said in a brief interview on Tuesday before the talks began, suggesting that American companies could come back to Russia. “We believe that at some point they will return – why would they pass up the opportunities Russia has provided for access to its natural resources?”Tuesday’s talks in Riyadh offered Saudi Arabia and its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, an opportunity to assert themselves on the world stage.Once labelled a pariah by Biden over the 2018 killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi leader has emerged as a key intermediary in discussions between Russia and the US.The latest US diplomatic push has left Kyiv and key allies scrambling to secure a seat at the table, fearing Washington and Moscow could move forward with a deal that sidelined their interests. In response, France convened an emergency meeting of EU nations and the UK on Monday to coordinate a response.Emmanuel Macron announced after the meeting that he had spoken to Trump and Zelenskyy. “We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” Macron wrote on X.Still, the security talks in Paris yielded no concrete measures, as European leaders struggled to present a united front amid divisions over the deployment of troops to Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyRussiaMarco RubioTrump administrationVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The UK is seeking the brothers’ extradition after Bedfordshire police weregranted a warrantas part of an investigation into allegations of rape and human trafficking.Andrew Tate is also facing a separate civil action from four women who have alleged rape and coercive control between 2013 and 2016.On Tuesday, the British women, who say they were victims of sexual violence by the controversial social media influencer, expressed deep concern over reports of US government involvement with the case and asked for Romanian and UK authorities to be “left alone to do their jobs”.“We are extremely concerned about reports that figures in Donald Trump’s administration are pressuring the Romanian authorities to relax travel restrictions on Andrew Tate and his brother, which would increase the risk of the Tate brothers evading justice or fleeing from the authorities in Romania and the UK,” the victims said in a statement through their lawyers, McCue Jury & Partners.“We hope that the Romanian and the UK authorities will be left alone to do their jobs,” it added.The brothers’ case was brought up by US officials in a phone call with the Romanian government last week, according to the Financial Times, which said Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, met the Romanian foreign minister at the Munich Security Conference. Both diplomats served as ambassadors to Germany during Trump’s first term.A source told the paper a request was made to return the Tates’ passports to allow them to travel during the ongoing proceedings. The Romanian foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, confirmed the US had raised the Tate brothers’ case.“Richard Grenell told me he is interested in the fate of the Tate brothers,” he told G4Media on Monday. “Later I requested a new meeting to better understand his intentions in relation to Romania, but it never took place.” Grenell said there was “no substantive conversation” with Hurezeanu.In November, Tristan Tate touted the brother’s influence on the US election, posting on X: “Millions of young men inEuropeand the USA have a healthy rightwing approach to politics that they would not have if Andrew Tate had never appeared on their phone screens. His role in this cannot be overlooked.”Matthew Jury, lawyer for the British victims, said Trump was “interfering in due process” not just in Romania, but in the UK also, where the Tates are pending extradition.“It would be embarrassing for the UK government and a complete abdication of its responsibility to the victims if it stands by and lets this continue,” said Jury.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateTrump administrationUS foreign policyRomaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas has claimed the young boys and their mother were killedby Israeli bombing.Hamas has said it will release six surviving hostages on Saturday, which represents a slight acceleration of thefirst phase of the ceasefire agreement. Under the originally agreed timetable, they were to be released in two groups of three, the last on 1 March, when the second phase is due to begin. A further four bodies are to be handed over on schedule next week.The release of six hostages on Saturday was confirmed by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In return, all the remaining Palestinians due to be released from Israeli prisons in the first phase will be freed on Saturday. Israeli press reports said thatIsraelwould also allow into Gaza some of the bulldozers and mobile homes that have been waiting on the Egyptian side of the border, to begin the vast task of rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said that Israeli negotiators in Doha would begin discussing thedetails of the second phaseof the ceasefire agreement “this week”, something Netanyahu had previously refused to condone despite the fact that under the agreement second-phase talks were supposed to start in the first week of February.The second phase is supposed to include the release of all remaining hostages with a corresponding number of Palestinian detainees and prisoners, and the completion of the Israel Defense Forces’ withdrawal from Gaza, including the Rafah crossing point intoEgypt– in effect putting an end to the war.The right wing of Netanyahu’s governing coalition has adamantly opposed the start of the second phase, threatening to bring down his government, but Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, put his foot down on the issue over the weekend.“Phase two is a little more complicated than phase one. But phase two is absolutely going to begin,”Witkoff told Fox Newson Sunday, adding that he just talked to Netanyahu about the issue by telephone that day.Two days later, Sa’ar said: “In the security cabinet meeting last night, we decided to open negotiations on the second phase. It will happen this week.”Asked what would happen if there was no agreement in the next 10 days on how to implement the second phase, Sa’ar said there were two other options: a return to war or an extension to the 1 March deadline for beginning the phase two if there was “constructive dialogue aimed at getting to an agreement”.Gaza’s future beyond the second phase is even more hazy. Israel has insisted that Hamas can play no further role in its governance. Sa’ar argued there had to be a complete “deradicalisation” of Gaza’s society.Trump caused global outrage earlier this month by saying the USwould take over ownership of Gaza, its more than 2 million residents should somehowdepart to neighbouring countries, and the whole coastal strip would be redeveloped into a “Riviera” resort.Egypt andJordan, which were expected to take most of the deported Palestinians under this plan, have rejected the proposal. On Friday, leaders of the two countries are due to meet their counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in Riyadh to put together an alternative plan that would ensure Gaza remains Palestinian land. There will then be an Arab League summit on the issue in Cairo on 4 March.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

Their names are understood not to have come up in earlier research into the mass killings, suggesting they were not major players.Over the course of a civil war in which the Bashar al-Assad regime killedat least 300,000 civilians, by one estimate, the massacre at Tadamon has become one of the most infamous for the clarity and detail with which it was documented by regime forces.More than two-dozen videos showed uniformed members of Syrian military intelligence working with pro-Assad militiamen to kill an estimated 288 people, including 12 children. Their bodies were burned and buried using a bulldozer. The footage was dated to April 2013, a period in which the Syrian government and rebels were fighting over neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the capital.A technician in Damascus discovered the footage on a Syrian government laptop and secretly sent it to activists in Paris, who passed the videos to a pair of researchers in the Netherlands, Annsar Shahhoud and Prof Uğur Ümit Üngör, from the University of Amsterdam and the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies.The face of the massacre became a Syrian military intelligence official named Amjad Yousef, who is still at large.One of the videos showed Yousef, in military fatigues and a green fisherman’s hat with a distinctive scar on his eyebrow, leading 11 blindfolded men one-by-one to a pit, taunting several as he shoved them into the hole and murdered them.Searching for the shadow man (Part 1)Read moreÜngör and Shahhoud found a Facebook profile belonging to a man who resembled Yousef. The researchers befriended him and, posing as regime supporters, persuaded him to take part in several video calls that they filmed, excerpts from which werelater published by the Guardian.After one of the videos was published online, several of the families of the victims came forward sayingthey had identified their missing loved ones in the footage. The horror it sparked in Syria and among its diaspora led to rare concessions from the Assad regime, including the release of hundreds of prisoners and the appointment of a new defence minister.But Yousef remained free, andtwo years ago was reportedly working on a military baseoutside Damascus. A former colleague said that year that Yousef had terrorised the Tadamon neighbourhood for the past decade, regularly snatching women from the streets, many of whom never returned.“I saw him take women from a bread queue one morning,” the colleague said. “They were innocent. They had done nothing. They were either raped or killed. Nothing less.”The US government announced it had imposed sanctions on Yousef and his family in 2023.Syrian authorities announced in the days after Assad’s fall that they had arrested Yousef’s superior, Salih al-Ras.“We used to bring detainees arrested at checkpoints, put them under the buildings here and execute them, and then after we’re done explode the buildings over them,” Jazairi told the Associated Press in a separate interview. It was unclear whether he was speaking under duress or voluntarily.“Every batch constituted around 25 [people],” he said, adding that “around one week” passed between one batch and the next.

Abdul Rahman al-Dabbagh, corroborated the number, citing additional confessions from those arrested.“Many of those killed used to be collected at checkpoints and security [detention] centres, brought to Tadamon neighbourhood, where they were executed,” Dabbagh said. “The operation is ongoing to apprehend all those involved in violations and massacres against Syrians.”Syria’s new transitional government, led by the former leader of the Islamist militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has been conducting raids in different cities to arrest remnants of the previous regime and says it is working on a judicial mechanism to hold them to account.Explore more on these topicsSyriaWar crimesBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The last post on their Facebook page, from Isfahan, in Iran, on 3 January, included selfies with the caption: “What a wonderful place.”The detention of the two British nationals and charges of espionage comes as the new Iranian ambassador to the UK, Seyyed Ali Mousavi takes up his post.Recent economic sanctions reimposed on Iran by the US have placed the UK and other European powers under further pressure to distance themselves from the country.According toAmnesty International, the penalty for espionage in Iran can range from two years in jail to the death penalty. However, it is unclear how these penalties apply to foreign nationals.Since 2010, at least 66 foreign and dual nationals have been detained by Iran, according to research by the University of Essex in 2022, part of a growing practice of “politically motivated arrests” that has been decried by Human Rights Watch.After the death in September 2022 of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman of Kurdish origin who had been arrested three days earlier for allegedly breaching the Islamic dress code, at least 40 foreign and dual nationals were arrested.Last week, Iranian state media published photographs showing the UK ambassador, Hugo Shorter, meeting two British “national security” suspects at the general and revolutionary prosecutor’s office in Kerman province, about 500 miles south-east of Tehran.The photo, with blurred faces of two individuals sitting across from Shorter, shows that the meeting on Wednesday was held in the presence of the Kerman prosecutor Mehdi Bakhshi and Kerman governor’s deputy for security and law enforcement, Rahman Jalal.Relatives of the Foremans spoke of their concern at the couple’s “distressing situation” . The pair are being held in the southern city of Kerman.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national freed in 2022 after five years in a Tehran prison, was transferred to Kerman after her initial arrest. In 2016, she was detained for more than 150 days and later sentenced to five years in jail for spying. At the time, the UK accused Iran of using the dual citizen as a “pawn for diplomatic leverage”.On Sunday, Richard Ratcliffe, Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband,called on UK ministers to act “more promptly”than they did in his wife’s case. “A court process may soon come. It’s not a real court. But it will be a form of brutal theatre to get the government’s attention,”said Ratcliffe.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran.“We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities. We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members.”The UK government advises against all travel to Iran, saying British and dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention, and that a British passport or UK connections “can be reason enough” to be detained by Iranian authorities.Explore more on these topicsUK newsIranMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

High-profile charities and NGOs, such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Oxfam, are among the sponsors.The letter, coordinated by the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), reads: “The past 15 months have illustrated with devastating clarity that Israel is not committed to complying with international law.“Partners to the F-35 programme have individually and collectively failed to prevent these jets from being used to commit serious violations of international law by Israel.”It adds: “States have either been unwilling to observe their international legal obligations and/or claimed that the structure of the F-35 programme means that it is not possible to apply arms controls to any end-user, making the entire programme incompatible with international law.”The fighter jets are made by a global consortium led by the US defence giant Lockheed Martin. British firms supply 15% of the parts as part of an international agreement with countries including Israel.The UK government is already facinglegal actionover existing arms licences to Israel that includes components of F-35 fighter jets, and allegations ofcomplicity with war crimes. Similar legal action over arms exports to Israel has also been taken in the US, the Netherlands, Denmark, Canada and Australia.In September the UK suspended30 out of 350 arms export licensesto Israel because of a “clear risk” they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. The government exempted F-35 components, and said that it was not possible to suspend licensing the components without affecting the global programme and has justified the components for wider reasons of “international peace and security”.More than 48,000 people have been killed in Gaza, with some researchers estimating that thedeath toll is 40% higherthan figures from the Palestinian territory’s heath ministry. Most of the population have been forcibly displaced, and 69% of its infrastructure has been damaged by Israel’s bombardment, according to the United Nations Satellite Centre.The letter said the “fragility” of thecurrent temporary ceasefireunderscores the risk of further violations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. It accused states of being “unwilling” to observe their legal obligations or claiming that the programme meant it was not possible to apply arms controls to any end user, “making the entire programme incompatible with international law”.All the countries as part of the F-35 programme are parties to the arms trade treaty (ATT) – excluding the US which is a signatory, but has not ratifed it – which is required to prevent the direct and indirect transfers of military equipment where there is risk of violations of international humanitarian law.The UK has blocked licences supplying arms for Israel’s offensive use in Gaza solely on the grounds of potential maltreatment of Palestinian detainees and Israel’s controls on the supply of humanitarian aid into Gaza. It has refused to come to a judgment on allegations that Israel has used disproportionate force, exposing a potential future gap in UK arms legislation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These jets were instrumental in Israel’s 466-day bombardment of Gaza, in crimes that include war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide,” said Katie Fallon, advocacy manager at CAAT.“Since the limited ceasefire the US government, and lead partner to the F-35 programme, has threatened Gaza with mass ethnic cleansing and forced displacement. This programme gives material and political consent from all western partners, including the UK, for these crimes to continue.”A UK government spokesperson said:“In September we suspended export licences to Israel for items used in military operations in Gaza.“F-35 components have been excluded because it is not possible to suspend licensing of F-35 components for use by Israel without prejudicing the entire global F-35 programme, including its broader strategic role in Nato and military support to Ukraine.”This article was amended on 18 February 2025 to make it clear that while the US is a signatory to the ATT it has not ratified the treaty.Explore more on these topicsArms tradeIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelGazaDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

The tribunal found that it was. The prime minister and foreign secretary were denying things that the claimant believed to be true, based on what she had observed in the course of her work.”The tribunal also backed Stewart’s claim for unfair dismissal. It said: “The tribunal considered that no reasonable employer, acting reasonably, could base a decision to dismiss an employee in the claimant’s position on a process which failed to engage in any way with the case that she was putting forward. This was sufficient to lead the tribunal to conclude that the dismissal was unfair.”But the panel did accept that it was “unavoidable” that she was suspended from her job “while her security clearance was reviewed, as she was required to have such clearance”.Stewart’s solicitors, James and West, a legal firm that specialises in whistleblowing, said the judgment was “groundbreaking”, as it was the first case of its kind to establish that a civil servant was protected for disclosures to the media.Stewart, 44, who had worked at the FCDO office for seven years, said: “My experience of the FCDO crisis centre in August 2021 reflected the worst of our political system. By calling this out, I lost my career. The outcome of this case doesn’t change any of this, but it has achieved what I set out to achieve: it has established that civil servants have the right not to stay silent when systemic failures put lives at risk, as happened during the Afghan evacuation.“We can’t have a system that stays stay silent no matter what you see, and forces dedicated public servants to choose between their conscience and their career.”Cathy James, Stewart’s solicitor, said: “Today, the employment tribunal has vindicated my client’s actions and upheld her rights. This is an important win not just for Ms Stewart but for civil servants, the public interest, and democracy.”Millar said in submissions to the panel that Stewart’s whistleblowing related to “the endangerment of the safety and lives of extremely vulnerable people in danger of retribution from the Taliban at any moment, and a government communications strategy which concealed how badly the UK government let those people down”.An FCDO spokesperson said: “We will review the findings of the tribunal and consider next steps.”Explore more on these topicsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeCivil serviceMilitaryBoris JohnsonAfghanistanBBCForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

If this law was broken, the candidate would be subject to investigation by the police and prosecution by an electoral court.The issue is seen as particularly urgent in Wales becausechanges to the voting system at next year’s Senedd electionsand an increased size of parliament are likely to make the campaign particularly febrile, with Reform UK having a good chance of winning seats.Hannah Blythyn, the chair of the committee, said toughening rules for Senedd members and candidates was critical at a time when public trust in institutions was low.She said: “People should be able to trust those who represent them. Our report is putting forward recommendations to radically enhance our rules and make it clear to anyone who wants to hold public office that deliberately deceiving is not acceptable.”Sam Fowles, the director of theInstitute for Constitutional and Democratic Research, said: “This report is a rejection of the counsels of doom which say that demanding politicians are honest is just too difficult.“We have professional regulations which require other professions to act honestly. We need to hold politicians to the same professional standards we expect from others.”Jennifer Nadel, a co-director of the thinktank Compassion in Politics, said: “This report puts Wales firmly at the forefront of the battle against political deception. However, the report falls short of calling for serving members to be subject to criminal sanction, instead relying on beefing up existing standards mechanisms. We would like to see it go further in this respect. The Senedd is acting and we now call on Westminster to follow suit.”A Welsh government spokesperson said it would consider the findings and recommendations before responding formally.Explore more on these topicsWelsh politicsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

While it didn’t make the UK charts, the album earned critical acclaim and a dedicated audience on streaming, drawn to its examination of race, mental health and working-class life in north-west London.Bashy originally broke through in 2007 with Black Boys, an anthem for racial pride that celebrated successful peers like Dizzee Rascal and Kano while rejecting stereotypes about young Black men: “No we ain’t hooligans / Just young and talented nubians.” He released his debut album, Catch Me If You Can, in 2009, and while there were handful of mixtapes in the following years, it took until 2024 for him to release a follow-up album.Bashy: Made in Britain – videoIn between, he has had a successful acting career, with roles in TV shows such as Top Boy, Them and 24: Legacy, and films such as Brotherhood and the Oscar-winning short Skin.Another artist with two awards at the Mobos, held this year at Newcastle’s Utilita Arena, was British-Nigerian vocalist Darkoo, who won best female act and song of the year, for Favourite Girl. She continues to build on the early success of 2019 hit Gangsta and a No 1 in 2021 as part of the multi-MC remix of Tion Wayne and Russ Millions’ drill hit Body. Favourite Girl has racked up tens of millions of streams both in its original and a remix with Nigerian star Rema, and other recent songs such as Focus On Me (All the Sexy Girls in the Club) and the Davido-featuring Right Now have been performing well.Also with two wins was Odeal, who picked up best newcomer and best R&B/soul artist, after winning a major following for his heart-on-sleeve vocal style. The singer was originally born in Germany and raised across Nigeria and Spain before settling in the UK, and put out a steady stream of music in 2024 including the EP Sunday at Zuri’s and the mini-album Lustropolis, featuring a collaboration with US star Summer Walker.Darkoo (feat Dess Dior): Favourite Girl – videoNigerian singerAyra Starralso picked up two in the overseas categories, for best African music act and best international act.Central Cee was named best male act, following the release of his long-awaited debut albumCan’t Rush Greatness, which cemented him as the most popular UK rapper globally – it reached No 1 in the UK but also No 9 in the US, an unusually high placing there for a UK MC. In the other rap categories, Scorcher won best grime act and Pozer picked up best drill act.Elsewhere at the ceremony, which featured live performances from Bashy, Darkoo, Odeal, Pozer and more, former Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis was given the Paving the Way award. The Impact award was given toVybz Kartel, the dancehall vocalist who last year was released from a Jamaican prison after 13 years, after his sentence for a murder – which he consistently denied – was quashed.Mobo awards 2025: full list of winnersBest male act: Central CeeBest female act: DarkooBest newcomer: OdealAlbum of the year: Bashy – Being Poor Is ExpensiveSong of the year: Darkoo – Favourite Girl (ft Dess Dior)Video of the year: Mnelia – My Man (directed by Femi Bello)Best hip-hop act: BashyBest grime act: ScorcherBest drill act: PozerBest R&B/soul act: OdealBest media personality: 90s Baby ShowBest African music act: Ayra StarrBest performance in a TV show/film: Jacob Anderson as Louis in Interview With the VampireBest electronic/dance music act: TshaBest gospel act: AnnatoriaBest jazz act: Ezra CollectiveBest producer: JulsBest Caribbean music act: ShenseeaBest alternative music act: Alt Blk EraBest international act: Ayra StarrMOBO Paving the Way award: Denise LewisMOBO Impact award: Vybz KartelExplore more on these topicsMobosAwards and prizesRapHip-hopR&BPop and rockGrimenewsShareReuse this content"

I’m thinking back to us all rehearsing in my bedroom in Stanley Road, Woking.“To all the pubs and clubs we played at as kids, to eventually making a record. What a journey. We went far beyond our dreams and what we made stands the test of time.

Rick was a good guy and a great drummer whose innovative drum patterns helped shape our songs.“I’m glad we had the chance to work together as much as we did. My thoughts are with Leslie and his family at this very difficult time.”Buckler was due to embark on a Q&A tour of the UK later this year entitled A Night of Memories and Music, which was recently postponed due to his health.The drummer lived with his wife, with whom he had two children, Jason and Holly.Following his time in The Jam, he wrote a number of books and went into the furniture design and restoration industry.His books included a number on the history of The Jam and his autobiography, That’s Entertainment: My Life in The Jam, which was published in 2015.Explore more on these topicsCulturePaul WellerSurreynewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “It’s clear that long-haul is really winning out right now, for lots of different reasons.”However, long-haul flightshave long been criticisedfor their significant environmental impact relating to the amount of carbon emissions they generate.Value for money came through as a common theme for the current popularity, and Vietnam was highlighted as “a good example of somewhere which is leading the way with experience and adventure travel”, with its cities, food, culture and beaches combining to create special trips “at affordable prices”.View image in fullscreenThomas Cook said one of the big ‘winners’ was the US, especially destinations like New York.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesAt Thomas Cook, a spokesperson said that when it came to the summer months in particular, the price of breaks in faraway locations was often “comparable to holidays in the Med, so people are willing to head farther afield and try somewhere new with their holiday spend”.This renewed enthusiasm for travelling farther afield may also be linked totax changes on pensionsannounced in last October’s budget, which led to predictions that some older people were likely to withdraw more of their pension cash and spend it on holidays and other big-ticket items in order to reduce the value of their estate.Thomas Cook said one of the big “winners” was the US, especially New York, Florida and Las Vegas. At the time of writing, the firm was selling seven-night packages to Las Vegas including return flights from London for under £550 a person.The spokesperson added: “Mauritius and Thailand offer great value, especially for families who want to explore a new country.”View image in fullscreenTourists watch jumping whales near Hermanus, South Africa. The country has become one of Kuoni’s most popular long-haul destinations.Photograph: Jeannot Olivet/Getty Images/iStockphotoJulia Lo Bue-Said, the chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, a network of independent travel agents, said so far this year it had seen strong momentum in long-haul travel across its agency partners, with demand accelerating in the last few weeks.“Many families are discovering that long-haul destinations can be more cost-effective during school holidays than European alternatives, particularly in regions like Thailand and the far east, where local costs remain attractive,” she said.The popularity of shows such as The White Lotus, whosecurrent third seasonis set in Thailand, and ITV’s Love Island All Stars, filmed in South Africa, would fuel fresh interest in these destinations for 2025 holidays, she added.It was announced in last October’s budget that unspent money left in a pension plan after an individual’s death will be included in inheritance tax calculations from April 2027. That led to claims in some quarters thatthis “tax grab” could backfire, with Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, quoted as saying that the policy created a “huge incentive” to spend money rather than save it.Explore more on these topicsTravelThomas CookThailandSouth AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The X owner also latercalled her a “rape genocide apologist”.The prime minister suggested thata line has been crossedand that Musk’s comments had led to threats against the minister.Sentencing Bennett to 28 weeks in prison, District Judge Smith said the email had caused Phillips “great distress”.He said: “[She] was concerned for your potential to escalate or to encourage others for violence against her, having in her mind the murder of her colleague Jo Cox.”Bennett also sent racist and offensive emails to SirSadiq Khan, the mayor of London, in February 2024 and Matt Twist, an assistant commissioner at the Met police, in April 2024.The court heard that Bennett’s messages had started after he became “caught up” in online rightwing propaganda during the pandemic.The judge said the email to Khan “purposely sought to disparage, insult and offend him based on his ethnicity and Asian heritage”.He added: “The contents of your communications to all three was utterly deplorable, foul and abusive. Saturated in hate and intolerance and shamelessly racist and offensive.“Your angry, poisonous and hateful rhetoric discloses the real disdain you held for ethnic minorities, targeting especially Muslims and immigrants in your abusive tirades.”For Bennett, Caroline Salvatore said her client had no previous convictions and he presented as being neurodivergent and “largely socially isolated”.She said: “During Covid, he became exposed to rightwing propaganda and became caught up in it. He was encouraged to become incensed at various issues and he found their phrases became part of his vocabulary.”She said he had not acted until after his father died in 2023, which was a “triggering event”, with his mother, who he lives with, coming to rely on him. “He became even more withdrawn and started to live his life online, one website led to another, and things got worse and worse for him.”She added that he had been “genuinely motivated by the perceived incompetence of the people he sent emails [to]” but he accepted he was trying to be offensive and did “realise how he was wrong”.Bennett pleaded guilty to four counts of sending malicious communications and one of using a public communication network to send offensive emails.Appearing for Phillips, Hannah Cotton said the emails featured “serious racist abuse towards politicians” while the language used in the emails to Twist was “highly offensive”, with Bennett calling him a “rat willing to engage in strong-arm tactics against white English patriots”.She asked for restraining orders to be put in place for five years, which was granted by the judge.Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseJess PhillipsCrimeDevonMetropolitan policeSadiq KhanElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

The sweeping demand threatens to upend all aspects of campus operations, from essays on college applications to classroom lessons and campus clubs.It’s meant to correct what the memo described as rampant discrimination in education, often against white and Asian students.Higher education groups sue Trump over anti-diversity executive ordersRead more“Schools have been operating on the pretext that selecting students for ‘diversity’ or similar euphemisms is not selecting them based on race,” said Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights. “No longer. Students should be assessed according to merit, accomplishment and character.”The guidance drew sharp backlash from civil rights groups and university groups. Some believe its vague language is meant to have a chilling effect, pressuring schools to eliminate anything touching on the topic of race even if it may be defensible in court.“Creating a sense of risk around doing work that might promote diverse and welcoming campuses is much more of the goal than a clear statement of existing law,” said Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice-president of government relations at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents.The memo is an extension ofDonald Trump’s executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs. As legal justification, it cites the 2023 supreme court decision barring race as a factor in college admissions.“Put simply, educational institutions may neither separate or segregate students based on race, nor distribute benefits or burdens based on race,” it said.On Monday the education department announced it also cut $600m in grants for organizations that train teachers. The programs promoted “divisive” concepts such as DEI, critical race theory and social justice activism, the department said.Confusion around the implications of Trump’s anti-DEI order was apparent at last week’s confirmation hearing for education secretary nomineeLinda McMahon. Asked whether classes on African American history would run afoul of Trump’s order, McMahon said she wasn’t certain.The California School Boards Association is awaiting legal guidance so it can advise schools on the Trump administration’s deadline, spokesperson Troy Flint said.“At this point there is not enough information for a step-by-step playbook that tells school districts if you were doing A then now you should do B, or perhaps eliminate the whole program entirely,” he said. “I know people want that granular level of detail. But this is a new era, with some novel civil rights theories and there is no definitive reference for what’s happening now.”The new guidance takes aim directly at college admissions, suggesting colleges have sought to work around the supreme court’s decision.College essays, for instance, cannot be used to predict a student’s race, the guidance says. In the supreme court decision, Chief JusticeJohn Robertssaid nothing prevents colleges “from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life,” though he warned that colleges couldn’t use essays as an indirect workaround to consider students’ race.The memo also said it’s unlawful for colleges to eliminate standardized testing requirements “to achieve a desired racial balance or to increase racial diversity”. Dozens of colleges across the US have dropped SAT and ACT requirements in recent years, citing concerns the exams favor students from high-income families.Practices that have long been commonplace could become legal liabilities, including recruiting in underrepresented areas or buying lists of potential students with certain academic and demographic information, said Angel B Pérez, the CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.“Colleges and universities are going to find themselves between a rock and a hard place,” Pérez said. “They know that what they’re doing is not illegal, but they are worried that if they do not comply, not having federal funding will decimate them.”Some universities said they expect little change. At Oregon State University, a legal review concluded that its programs “are fully compliant with all state and federal laws”, according to a campus message from Rob Odom, vice-president of university relations and marketing.Musk’s ‘Doge’ guts nearly $1bn in US education department’s research officeRead moreThe department memo appears to take aim at scholarships for students from certain racial backgrounds. There’s been legal debate about whether the supreme court decision extends to financial aid, with some schools and institutions deciding to scrap racial requirements for some scholarships.The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators said there’s no consensus on the question, and the group is trying to understand how the memo could affect student aid.“The last thing students need when making plans about how to pay for college is uncertainty over when or whether they will receive financial aid they’ve been relying on,” the group said in a statement.Trump has called for the elimination of the education department, and Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has slashed dozens of contracts deemed wasteful.The Doge team won a legal victory on Monday when a federal judge declined to block it from federal student loan records. The judge said the plaintiff, the University of California Student Association, failed to prove it was harmed by Doge’s access to the data.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS educationSchoolsUS politicsUS supreme courtJohn RobertsElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Twitter/X that the order was evidence of the president’s “promises kept” – even thoughthe orderdoes not directly change any policy and does not, on its own, fulfill Trump’s campaign pledge to make the government or insurance companies cover IVF.“Americans need reliable access toIVFand more affordable treatment options, as the cost per cycle can range from $12,000 to $25,000,” the fact sheet reads.“It is the policy of my Administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.”During the 2024 presidential election, Trump recast his position on IVF as a strong supporter of the treatment,declaring himself the “father of IVF”while at the same time admitting he only recently discovered what the procedure involved.Trump’s campaign promise to in effectmake IVF freewas criticized byDemocratswho accused him of softening his stance only after voters signaled broad support for reproductive rights.After the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in a decision backed by three justices that Trump appointed,Republicanstried to distance themselves from the anti-abortion movement as pro-abortion rights supporters repeatedly won ballot measures even in red states.Trump’s Tuesday order may now drive a further wedge between theTrump administrationand the anti-abortion movement. The news of the order unleashed a torrent of complaints from anti-abortion activists, who are largely opposed to IVF because it can create unused embryos (which they consider to be people).Kristan Hawkins, the president ofStudents for Life of America, tweeted that the news was “tragic” and compared IVF with eugenics.“IVF turns children into a product to be created, sold, and discarded – violating their basic human rights,” tweeted Lila Rose, the leader of the anti-abortion group Live Action. In another tweet, she added: “IVF is NOT pro-life.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpReproductive rightsIVFUS politicsRoe v WadeRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

They are paid by the importer of the product – in this case, companies and consumers based inside the US – rather than the exporter, elsewhere in the world.Trump says US prices ‘could go up’ as he threatens new tariffs on trade partnersRead moreAsked on Tuesday if he had decided the rate of a threatened tariff on cars from overseas, Trump said he would “probably” announce that on 2 April, “but it’ll be in the neighborhood of 25%”.Upon being asked the same question about threatened tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, Trump replied: “It’ll be 25% and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over the course of a year.”The ramp-up, he explained, was designed to lure manufacturers to the US. “When they come into the United States, and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff.”Executives have cautioned that the administration’s plan for tariffs risks harming theUS economy. A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada “will blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen”, Jim Farley, the Ford CEO, told an investor conference in New York last week.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsInternational tradeUS economyEconomicsGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Officials wanted Cheung to investigate EPA contracts awarded during Biden’s tenure and freeze related funding, CNN reported.In her resignation letter, Cheung wrote to Martin that she and other prosecutors had determined there was insufficient evidence to warrant grand jury subpoenas, even if senior officials cited the Project Veritas video as justification.“When I explained that the quantum of evidence did not support that action, you stated that you believed that there was sufficient evidence,” Cheung wrote to Martin. “You also accused me about wasting five hours of the day ‘doing nothing’ except trying to get what the FBI and I wanted, but not what you wanted.”The dispute stems from the EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin’sclaim last weekabout $20bn in climate law funding being held in a Citibank account.The resignation adds to broader upheaval within the justice department, where prosecutors considered unaligned with current leadership have faced termination, particularly those involved in January 6 investigations.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS justice systemUS politicsBiden administrationUS Environmental Protection AgencyClimate crisisWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Democrats were also more likely to say they have stopped shopping at companies that have opposing political views to their own – 45% of Democrats indicated so, compared with 34% of Republicans.It is a sign that consumers with liberal views are starting to use their wallets in response to politics in the private sector.Most recently, this has been seen with a backlash against Target – the seventh-largest retailer in the US that has enjoyed a typically favorable reputation among liberal consumers.In January, Target announced it was ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, including a program that helped the company carry more Black- and minority-owned brands in its stores, saying it was trying to “stay more in step with the evolving external landscape”. Along with calls for a boycott on social media, Twin Cities Pride, the organization that runs the annual Pride festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Target is headquartered,saidit was dropping the company as a sponsor because of its announcement.“What is more important is that we send the message that companies do the right thing,” Andi Otto, executive director of Twin Cities Pride, told theMinneapolis Star Tribunein January.Apple asks investors to block proposal to scrap diversity programmesRead moreThe last few years have shown that boycotts usually come from the consumer base whose party is not in power in Washington. When Joe Biden was president, conservatives boycotted companies that were deemed too “woke”. After the beer brand Bud Light partnered with the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney for a sponsored social media post, abacklashagainst the beer grew online. Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of Bud Light, lost $395m in the ensuing months amid calls for a boycott.Now thatDonald Trumpis back in the White House, liberal consumers seem more ready to respond to political tides.After Trump won the election, multiple companies announced they were rolling back their DEI policies and pledges – much of which was created in response to Black Lives Matter protests after the murder of George Floyd in 2020.Though some companies had beenquietly rolling backDEI programs after the supreme court ruled affirmative action in higher education unconstitutional, raising questions about whether the court could end up scrutinizing diversity efforts in the workplace in the future, most companies were reticent about announcing any rollbacks publicly. That changed after Trump won the election, as the president said in his campaign that he would end all DEI.Walmart said it wouldphase outits DEI initiatives, including ones focused on diversity of suppliers and offering DEI training. Amazonsaidit was “winding down outdated programs and materials” related to DEI. McDonald’sannouncedthe end of specific diversity goals for senior leadership. The companies largely said they were responding to the changing legal landscape around DEI.Trump’s impact on DEI in the private sector is still up in the air, though his administration has indicated it is looking for ways to curtail DEI in the private sector. Trump signed twoexecutive ordersthat essentially ended all DEI in the federal government, including laws from the civil rights era that were meant to prevent discrimination when choosing private contractors.In response to the executive orders, the activist and Baptist minister Rev Al Sharptonannouncedin January that a council with his organization, the National Action Network, would conduct a study on companies that are ending their DEI policies. By May, the council will select two companies to focus on. Sharpton and his organization will then publicly scrutinize the companies for backing away from their DEI goals.“Donald Trump can’t make us buy your stuff. The Senate can’t make us buy your stuff,” Sharpton said at a speech last month. “In the name of Dr [Martin Luther King Jr], we’re going to do what King did.”Some companies have stood by their DEI policies, even when faced with pressure from conservative shareholder activists. Costco, Microsoft and Apple have all indicated they have no plans to cut back on their DEI policies.It has all made for a confusing landscape for American consumers, many of whom are frustrated by the political system. The Harris poll found that a third of Americans (36%) are trying to “opt out” of the economy – cutting back on spending to avoid getting involved with the muddle of companies and shifting politics.“Think of this as ‘laissez-faire consumerism’. Buyers aren’t boycotting, they’re just opting out,” said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. “Instead of demanding more, they’re simply disengaging with the marketplace and businesses who disappoint them.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsConsumer spendingUS economyRetail industryTrump administrationRacenewsShareReuse this content"

They are paid by the importer of the product – in this case, companies and consumers based inside the US – rather than the exporter, elsewhere in the world.Trump says US prices ‘could go up’ as he threatens new tariffs on trade partnersRead moreAsked on Tuesday if he had decided the rate of a threatened tariff on cars from overseas, Trump said he would “probably” announce that on 2 April, “but it’ll be in the neighborhood of 25%”.Upon being asked the same question about threatened tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, Trump replied: “It’ll be 25% and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over the course of a year.”The ramp-up, he explained, was designed to lure manufacturers to the US. “When they come into the United States, and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff.”Executives have cautioned that the administration’s plan for tariffs risks harming theUS economy. A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada “will blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen”, Jim Farley, the Ford CEO, told an investor conference in New York last week.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsInternational tradeUS economyEconomicsGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Because here’s the thing: unionsexpandopportunities for all workers – not just those who are members,” Martin wrote.Martin emphasized his experience and background growing up in a working-class family and as a card-carrying union member, organizer and then chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor party.“I fundamentally believe that our party is grounded in the values, principles,and aspirations of the working class. As chair of the DNC, that belief willguide my decisions and approach in the years ahead. In contrast, in only hisfirst month in office, it’s become abundantly clearDonald Trumpdoesn’tgive a damn about the kitchen-table issues that matter to most Americans,” Martin explained in the memo. “Trump and the billionaire advisors he has surrounded himself with don’t give a damn about what it takes for a working family to put food on the table and keep a roof above their heads – let alone make a better life for themselves and their loved ones.”He contrasts Democrats’ support of working people with Trump and Elon Musk’s actions over the past several weeks which have included the unlawful firing of a board member of the National Labor Relations Board,Gwynne Wilcox, that has undermined the agency’s ability to enforce workers’ rights and Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” working to dismantle federal agencies and gain access to data in the Department of Labor.In the first weeks of Trump’s second term as president, his administration has also rescinded worker protections for federal contractors, unilaterallycanceledcollective bargaining agreements with federal workers, and fired thousands of probationary federal employees while pushing 75,000 workers to accept resignation offers, inciting numerous lawsuits from labor unions representing federal employees.During his first presidential term, Martin noted Trump created offshoring incentives for corporations, stacked federal courts with appointees who attacked collective bargaining rights and attacked union workers on several occasions, claiming striking workers should be fired andcallingfirefighter union leaders “dues-sucking people”.“Trump’s administration includes more billionaires than any other inAmerican history, with a combined net worth that exceeds the GDP of 172different countries. These appointees bring damning anti-union, anti-workerrecords that mirror Trump’s own,” Martin added. “Despite his insistence on the campaign trail, Trump has never stood with working people. His disastrous first month in office proves that, while billionaires will be well taken care of, working people face great danger under this Trump administration.”The memo cited several Trump appointees with records of opposing workers’ rights, including Trump’s interior secretary, Doug Burgum, who opposed theInflation Reduction Actand theChips Actover labor protections included in the bill; billionaire Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, whose real estate firm haspromotedoffshoring jobs to Mexico to corporations; and education secretary and billionaire Linda McMahon, whosupportsdefundingpublic education, where70%of teachers are unionized compared with 11% at private charter schools, and dismantling the US Department of Education.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump’s continued Project 2025 threats to unions are a direct attack on the wellbeing of working families everywhere,” Martin concluded. “As I take over as chair of the DNC, union workers and labor leaders will be core to my decision-making. As Trump wages his war on working families, Democrats will fiercely answer the call to my favorite old union song, Which Side Are You On? I’ll tell you what: Democrats are on the side of the worker.

The coalition represents primarily institutional investors, such as pensions and foundations.“When you think about the investment portfolios our members have, they are very diverse,” Jones-Monteiro. “What happens in one sector impacts another.”The proposal is non-binding, but UnitedHealth Group is nevertheless fighting to stop it. In afilingwith the Securities and Exchange Commission in January, UnitedHealth Group attempted to exclude the proposal from proxy statements on technical grounds, arguing in part that the terms “public-health related costs” and “macroeconomic risks” are vague and subject to interpretation.Man charged in killing of healthcare CEO responds to supporters on websiteRead moreMembers of the coalition are seeking more “transparency” so shareholders can understand the “externalities” created by UnitedHealth Group – a behemoth by any measure.“I’ve been tracking shareholder proposals for many years,” said Shirley Westcott, senior vice-president at Alliance Advisors in the corporate governance group. “I have not seen anything like this before.”UnitedHealth Group is the 19th-largest company in the world by market capitalization, the largest US health insurer and the largest US employer of doctors.More than 5%of US gross domestic product flows through the company each day, according to one industry analysis.The motion argues that the company is so large that care delays caused by prior authorizations, by which patients are required to ask their insurer for permission before a treatment, and denials could ultimately hurt the broader US economy by keeping workers sick and indebted.“Overall performance of financial markets determines 75-94% of portfolio returns,” investors argued in their proposal. “Given UHG’s size and broad reach … shareholders fear UHG’s practices may impair the value of their portfolios.”Even if the SEC rules in favor of including the shareholder proposal, it may still be excluded from proxy statements if the company agrees to terms that satisfy the investors. Investors would then typically withdraw their proposal.The motion comes after the murder of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, who was shot and killed before a company meeting in Manhattan in December. His killing sparked a national debate about healthcare, after many publicly responded to his death withapathy and derision.UnitedHealth Group did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

To Celtic, all the plaudits following a heroic showing in Bavaria.ThisCelticperformance ranks among the finest by a Scottish team away from home in Europe in living memory. Extra-time felt the least they deserved after taking a second‑half lead. They were denied by a horrible, scrappy goal claimed by Alphonso Davies after a Cameron Carter-Vickers clearance flew back off him from all of two yards. Just 30 seconds of stoppage time remained. Celtic have grown in this Champions League. In Munich, they came of age. This outcome was so cruel on them.Bayern Munich 1-1 Celtic (agg: 3-2): Champions League playoff round, second leg – liveRead moreBayern supposedly have redemption on their mind after the penalty shootout defeat by Chelsea when European club football’s showpiece occasion was last held at the Allianz Arena, 13 years ago. Vincent Kompany watched with increasing anxiety as even a last-16 spot looked in serious doubt. Celtic can reflect so positively on that when the dust settles. But in the short term, aggregate defeat by the odd goal in five stung so much.Celtic’s scepticism over the prospect of Harry Kane missing this game proved justified. The England captain sat out training on Monday to assist his recovery from a facial injury sustained in the weekend draw with Bayer Leverkusen. Within 10 minutes he had already tested Kasper Schmeichel with a deflected effort. The teams had traded opportunities by that point; Serge Gnabry headed wide from a Michael Olise cross, with the Celtic captain, Callum McGregor, wasting a shot after a driving run from midfield.With a controlled, composed start to proceedings Celtic should have taken the lead. Instead, three wonderful chances were passed up within two minutes. Fine play on the left flank by Jota preceded the Portuguese attacker picking out Nicolas Kühn. Manuel Neuer was beaten by Kühn’s attempt but Raphaël Guerreiro was on hand to clear from the goalline.Next came a teasing Arne Engels cross that narrowly evaded the outstretched Daizen Maeda. Brendan Rodgers was still cursing those moments when Dayot Upamecano shanked a clearance straight to the feet of Engels. The Belgian fed Maeda, who had more time than he realised for a shot that sailed over Neuer’s crossbar.View image in fullscreenNicolas Kühn puts Celtic in front on the night against his former club.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAA quarter of the way through the match, Bayern were unquestionably spooked by the ferocity of Celtic’s press. Beyond that, Celtic looked admirably assured in possession.Joshua Kimmich missed the target as Bayern tried to settle an unconvinced crowd. For a team holding an overall lead, added to course and distance specialism, Bayern’s untidiness was curious. Gnabry had Leon Goretzka bearing down on goal, five minutes before the break, and he somehow passed straight into the hands of Schmeichel.We had a cup tie, in which one of European football’s powerhouses were being made to look hilariously ordinary. Kane almost broke the mould, handing Bayern what would have been a totally undeserved half-time lead, but struck the bar from Josip Stanisic’s cut-back. It was the visiting support who roared their side off at the break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Celtic midfielder waited far too long to shoot from close range, allowing Bayern to clear. This time, the home team did respond appropriately as Schmeichel was forced into a smart block from Goretzka. Rodgers introduced Adam Idah for Jota on the hour, due to the latter’s fitness rather than performance. By this time Bayern were dominating the ball without particularly troubling Schmeichel. Olise summed that up, his tame strike comfortably held by the Danish goalkeeper.Celtic’s moment was imminent. Maeda won possession on the left, his pass to Kühn initially cut out by Kim Min-jae. The defender’s attempted block was unconvincing, though, and allowed Kühn to collect possession. The 25-year-old made no mistake with only Neuer to beat. Celtic’s euphoria contrasted with boos from the Bayern following. Kompany removed Gnabry – who had been hopeless – and Guerreiro. Leroy Sané and Davies had the task of shaking life into Bayern.Maeda headed at Neuer as Celtic glanced at dreamland. In Sané’s first involvement a glorious pass found no takers in the six-yard box. Goretzka headed a Kimmich cross wide, moments after Olise appealed in vain for a penalty following a challenge from Jeffrey Schlupp. This was a sign of Bayern’s desperation. As Schmeichel batted away a deflected Kimmich cross, that sentiment grew.A series of Bayern corners stepped up the pressure on Celtic’s defence before Schmeichel denied Goretzka from open play. Carter-Vickers pounced on the loose ball, only to see it ricochet back off Davies. The Celtic players slumped en masse to their knees. Only those with rocks for hearts would offer no sympathy.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

You end up fiddling around and then closing the page and realizing you didn’t even do what you’d originally logged on for? Yes, the internet is a place full of distractions. TikTok, Instagram, whatever Twitter (X) is? It’s hard to remember what you had for breakfast some days. The same, of course, goes forNBAhistory.If you go online today to read about basketball, it can seem like the league or the sport itself was created in the 21st century. That anything before Kobe Bryant never actually existed. As a result, fans sometimes need a history lesson. And that’s exactly what we wanted to do today. To examine the careers of seven former NBA stars who contributed a great deal to the league but whose stories also risk being lost to time thanks to our modern attention spans.Jack Sikma (1978-1991)Talk to any basketball fan in Seattle for more than five minutes and the name Jack Sikma will inevitably come up. The blonde curly-haired big man helped lead the SuperSonics to the 1979 title – a fact that makes it all the more ridiculous that Seattle is without an NBA team now. Drafted in 1977 out of small Illinois Wesleyan University, Sikma became a seven-time All-Star thanks to his quirky catapult jump shot, which started far back behind his head and usually ended with a swish in the net. Over his first nine years in Seattle, Sikma notched 16.8 points and 10.8 boards per game to go along with that ’79 championship trophy. He finished his career with five more years in Milwaukee, battling the likes of Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics. (Highlights)Tiny Archibald (1971-1984)The 6ft 1in Nate ‘Tiny’ Archibald boasts a lot of hardware. But perhaps his biggest distinction is that in 1972-73, he was the league’s scoringandassist champion. Not only that, he’s the only person ever to achieve that feat. Later, the six-time All-Star was a member of the Boston Celtics team that won the 1980-81 NBA championship. From the 1971-72 season through the 1976-77 campaign, Archibald averaged 26.7 points and 8.6 assists per game. He sat out a year due to injury but then he reinvented himself as a cagey vet, finishing fifth in the MVP race in 1980 and winning a ring with Robert Parish, Bird and the gang the next season. Today, the four-time NBA champion Parish considers Tiny to be one of the top five Celtics of all time. (Highlights)Bob McAdoo (1973-1986)Raise your hand ifyou remember the Buffalo Braves? The short-lived franchise in western New York later became the San Diego Clippers through a convoluted series of relocations. But when the team was still in Buffalo it was led by MVP and three-time scoring champion, Bob McAdoo. When the versatile center entered the league in 1972 out of UNC, he became the rookie of the year. The next season ‘Do was the MVP runner-up. In this third year, he won MVP. And in his fourth season, McAdoo capped off three in a row leading the NBA in scoring. Things went a bit sideways for him in the middle of his career, however. He bounced around the NBA, going from the Knicks to Boston to Detroit to New Jersey. But in 1981, he landed with the Lakers, where he won two rings as an important double-digit scorer in the playoffs off the bench. (Highlights)View image in fullscreenBuffalo’s Bob McAdoo, right, reaches over the Cavaliers’ Lenny Wilkens and John Johnson during a 1972 game.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveAdrian Dantley (1977-1991)Ask Hall of Fame scoring forward Carmelo Anthony about Adrian Dantley, and he’ll tell you the surprising story of a successful basketball player who saved his money and who yet passes the time workingas a crossing guard. It’s a funny idea for someone who was a six-time All-Star and two-time scoring champion in the 1980s with the Utah Jazz. But it’s true! Prior to his working the crosswalks, though, Dantley averaged 29.6 points and 6.2 rebounds per game over seven years in Salt Lake City. Then ahead of the 1986-87 campaign, the forward went to Detroit where the Pistons were on the cusp of winning a championship. But in the middle of 1988-89, Dantley was shipped to Dallas, right before the Pistons broke through. Today, Anthony, who knew Dant when the latter as an assistant coach in Denver, still rightly reveres him. (Highlights)Alex English (1977-1991)In the 1980s, the Denver Nuggets were a high-flying, high-scoring basketball machine. And one of the biggest reasons why was forward Alex English. The first player in NBA history to score 2,000 points in eight straight seasons, English could hit the midrange and finish at the rim with the best in the league. Not only that, but the eight-time All-Star and 1982-83 scoring champion achieved these feats it in the latter half of his career. After a few fruitless years in Milwaukee and Indiana to begin his time in the pros, English landed in Denver, where his scoring took off. Over the entire 1980s, he averaged 26.9 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game while playing in the Mile High City. (Highlights)View image in fullscreenAlex English of the Denver Nuggets looks on during a 1990 game.Photograph: Focus On Sport/Getty ImagesMark Price (1987-1998)In 1992-93, Mark Price was the best point guard in the world. That season he was named to the All-NBA first team with the likes of Charles Barkley, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone. Not bad company. Over the course of his 12-year career, Price made four All-Star teams and four All NBA teams. Acareer40% three-point shooter at a time when few held that lauded distinction, Price, who also won the annual three-point shooting contest twice, led the Cleveland Cavaliers to great success over a string of years. They were feared. Yet, the team peaked in the early 1990s due to injury and the existence of Michael Jordan. Still, Price was fearless to the end. A streak coming down the court, the 6ft Price had an uncanny ability to split double-teams and then embarrass you with a lightning-quick jumper. (Highlights)Dave Bing (1967-1978)Not only is Dave Bing a former Rookie of the Year, seven-time All-Star and scoring champion, but he was also the mayor of Detroit for five years after his retirement. Bing, who played for the Pistons for nine seasons before suiting up a few more in Washington and Boston, finished in the top-six in MVP voting three times over his illustrious career. For his entire stint in the Motor City, the combo guard averaged 22.6 points, 6.4 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game, keeping a mediocre team afloat. Smooth as silk and dangerous as fire, Bing could fill it up both inside and outside. He was the first in a long line of star Detroit guards that today includes the likes of Isiah Thomas, Chauncey Billups and Cade Cunningham.

Verstappen fell foul of the rules last season when he was given a community service punishmentfor swearing in a press conference.Max Verstappen threatens to quit F1 after ‘silly’ punishment for swearingRead moreAsked if he believed the FIA agenda was misjudged, the world champion’s answer was clear. “Everyone has that feeling,” Verstappen said, and he was equally emphatic over whether it was failing to focus on matters that are important to drivers. “To drivers, teams. Improvement of the sport in general.”Verstappen was speaking at the F175 event held at London’s O2 Arena, where all 10 teams had gathered for the first time to unveil their liveries for the new season which marks the 75th anniversary ofFormula One.The 27-year-old was determined that the FIA should open a dialogue on the issue of swearing, which it has so far refused to do. “I am not going to tell you how you should behave in life,” he said. “It’s important we have a discussion about this but we need help from others, teams, promoters. We can have a proper discussion about this.”While teams met the press in London, the FIA dropped its own bombshell announcing that it was considering imposing a mandatory number of pit stops at the Monaco Grand Prix, with “the aim of promoting better racing”.At a meeting of the Formula One Commission on Tuesday it was agreed to consider a minimum number of stops at Monaco. The proposal will now be discussed in the next few weeks by F1’s sporting advisory committee, which will include representatives from the teams.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton steps out in Ferrari red at the O2 Arena.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesMonaco held its first grand prix in 1929 but has come increasingly under fire in recent years, with the width and weight of modern cars making overtaking all but impossible on the narrow streets.The Mercedes driver George Russell, meanwhile, said he would maintain his robust approach to battling Verstappen on track this year after the pair endured a very public and bitter spat at the end of last season. Russell claimed Verstappen had threatened to put his “fucking head in the wall” and responded by accusing the Dutchman of being a bully who wasincapable of dealing with adversity. The pair have not spoken since the finale in Abu Dhabi last season.“I haven’t spoken [to him],” Russell said. “Things got out of line at the end of last year, and I made it pretty clear that I’m not going to take it. Now it’s 2025 and I’m focused on the job and the job is to win. So I’m not going to change my approach, fighting him, or fighting any other drivers.”Lewis Hamilton, making his first public appearance outside Italy as a Ferrari driver, said he felt “invigorated” by the challenge of joining a new team. “I feel so full of life and so much energy because everything is new,” Hamilton told fans. “I’m so proud to be part of the team, something new and exciting.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenGeorge RussellMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old – ranked No 53 in the world – took the first set 6-4 and immediately broke in the first game of the second to pile on the pressure.View image in fullscreenMcCartney Kessler managed her first victory over a top 10-ranked player as she beat Coco Gauff 6-4, 7-5.Photograph: Amr Alfiky/ReutersThough it remained tight, Gauff was ultimately unable to turn the match around and went down 6-4, 7-5.There were no such problems for world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who dispensed with Veronika Kudermetova 6-3 6-4. Iga Swiatek, who is second in the world rankings, did not waste any time in dismantling Victoria Azarenka 6-0, 6-2.Rain delays meant the Italian fourth seed, Jasmine Paolini, had to wait nearly five hours on match point against Germany’s Eva Lys. The players went off at 2.15pm local time and it was approaching 7pm when they finally returned. Just nine shots later, Paolini completed a 6-2 7-5 victory.Raducanu and Katie Boulter, the British No 1, are set to compete at the new HSBC Championships in London. Women’s professional tennis will be returning to the Queen’s Club from for the first time in more than half a century from 7-15 June.Madison Keys – the Australian Open champion – also joins the lineup, alongside Naomi Osaka and last year’s Eastbourne champion, Daria Kasatkina, with more names still to be announced for the WTA 500 event.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuCoco GauffTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Most people would rather he went up to his opposite number and said eff off instead. Better still, try that with the thousands of City supporters landing in Spain hoping for a comeback of their own this time, see how they react: a smile, an embrace, or a punch in the face? At least that way they might get an answer to the question occupying them more than any other the past three days, expletives eclipsing everything.Even, it has felt, this European tie, conspiracy winning out over what Ancelotti said had become aclásico. These are strange times, strange and very silly times. At moments they have felt like slightly sinister ones too, and definitely depressing. Apologies for the language that follows, and for the amplification, but you should try being here. Laugh? You’ll cry.Let’s explain. On Saturday,Jude Bellingham was sent offas Madrid drew 1-1 at Osasuna. After the game Madrid’s manager said he shouldn’t have been: he hadn’t said “Fuck you” to the referee José Luis Munuera Montero, after all. He had, in fact, said: “Fuck off.”And that, the coach claimed, is “very different”, “not an insult”. The words were a bit of a red herring – what mattered more was that, Bellingham said, he wasn’t addressing the referee but talking to himself – but immediately it was everywhere, an entire country turning the air blue like there was no tomorrow. Many fell about laughing, others were deadly serious or perhaps just cynical, a furious debate started over the difference between “off” and “you”, perhaps the most versatile, nuanced word in the whole English language now dissected by those who don’t speak it.English teachers were invited to explain, or better still support the shoutiest. Some clearly felt awkward swearing like troopers on TV, others rather enjoyed it. The set of the nearest thing to Match of the Day – which is still a long way from Match of the Day – wasliterally emblazonedwith the words in question.View image in fullscreenCarlo Ancelotti has defended Jude Bellingham and played down suggestions that the playoff tie with Manchester City is as good as over.Photograph: Sergio Pérez/EPAA late-night radio showcalled a supposedly random English number, although they later said they had chosen a hotel to ensure someone would be on reception at that time, and just said: “Fuck off,” down the line to see the response, and find out of it was offensive after all. They were hung up on.It was all quite bizarre, a bit embarrassing too. It was also, no point pretending otherwise, very funny. Above all, it was genuinely inescapable, even on the eve of this match.Behind it all is something deeper: Real Madrid’s belief, actual or affected, that they are victims of a conspiracy, a willingness to see a plot in every penalty, to attack every official as an enemy. Madrid have embarked on a campaign against the referees which is now a full-on crusade, no going back, and one which conditions everyone, shaping debate and turning up the noise. Every week, Madrid’s TV channel delivers character assassinations of the men taking charge of their games, before and after the “crime”, while they have their crusaders out of house too, and plenty of them.The club recently sent an open letter to the federation and the government denouncing what they claimed was a corrupt and totally discredited system designed to harm them; ie, everyone was out to get them. Without mentioning it in the letter, the Negreira case, in which Barcelona paidthe vice‑president of the referees’ committee €7m(£5.8m) over almost two decades between 2000 and 2018(Barcelona deny any legal wrongdoing), underpins it all, or serves as a sort of justification for the accusations now, for demands that the entire system is pulled down. One front page talked of a “purge” of officials.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham scores Real Madrid’s winning goal in their 3-2 first-leg victory at Manchester City.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesAsked if decisions he called “inexplicable” and “surprising” in the three games since then might be a consequence of the letter, the decision to come out fighting rebounding on them, Ancelotti said: “I don’t want to comment on this subject.” It was the last answer of a press conference heavy on referees, despite the significance of the game the next day, in which Ancelotti had also said he was hopeful that Bellingham would not get a suspension following that red card and that he is more comfortable with the officiating in Europe than in the league with which they are at war. There was also a worthwhile discussion of the way the video assistant referee is used which was more conceptual than conspiratorial.But then everything is referees now, and at times it’s as absurd and unpleasant as it is unavoidable. One simple, slightly surreal way of showing how significant, how ubiquitous it has become is that on Tuesday afternoon Madrid’s likely captain, Fede Valverde,posted a tweet apologisingfor “not”protesting in his pre-match press conference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Refs are criticised a lot and no one praises them when they get it right,” he said then; barely an hour after leaving the press room, long enough for someone to have a word, he said he had not forgotten “the refereeing we’re suffering”; it’s just that he has to focus on the match.Well, it is tempting to respond, someone has to. (And, yes, look at all those words above and there is indeed a hypocrisy here.) Real Madrid v Manchester City is quite important, after all: “90 minutes in which everything is at stake”, as Ancelotti put it. Yet it hasn’t felt as built up as before: not just because of the crusade that conquers all, it is true, but also in part because the noise need not be channelled into a comeback this time.Madrid’s performance at the Etihad Stadium changes things, Guardiola saying he sees only a 1% chance of going through. And maybe that’s the risk for Madrid, reason for Valverde to turn his focus to the field.“I don’t think it’s 1%,” Ancelotti said. “I will ask him: do you really think you have 1%? I’m sure he really thinks it’s more, and that’s right. We don’t think we have 99%. We think we have a small advantage. It’s a psychological issue. We will have in mind [that leading could have a negative impact on performance]. It’s happened before. But it’s hard to fix. You can say: ‘No, no, we have no lead’; ‘We have to treat it as if it was 0-0’; or, ‘Play like we have to come back’, but that’s nonsense. No one believes you.“There is a fact: we scored three and City scored two and you can’t change that. You can try to change the team’s mentality, try to tell them not to hedge their bets, say we have to approach it like last week, but you can’t forget the way it is: that we have an advantage.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridCarlo AncelottiManchester CityJude BellinghamChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The men’s world No 1 was initiallycleared by an independent tribunalafter being provisionally suspended, howeverWada appealed against that decisionto the court of arbitration for sport.

When we look at these cases we try to look at them technically, operationally and we don’t do it with fear of what the public and the politicians or anyone is going to say.”This decision has drawn criticism.Novak Djokovic said: “A majority of the players that I’ve talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also in the last few months, are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled.“A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening.

Sinner, whodefended his Australian Open title last month, will be able to play at the Italian Open, his home tournament, as it begins three days after his ban ends. This would afford him the opportunity to compete in a clay-court eventHowever, Wenzel added: “Once you’ve reached an agreement, what you can’t do is then say: ‘Oh, but we’re going to have this apply from two months in the future for a period of three months.’ It must come into effect quickly. Of course, once the deal is done, it’s important that it is executed and that it is made public for reasons of transparency.“ The sanctions that we impose and the code even says this, they’re blind to the calendar. The correct sanction should be imposed and it comes into effect when it comes into effect and it shouldn’t be modulated or modified to take into account whether the events that are coming up are significant or not significant.”Explore more on these topicsJannik SinnerWadaTennisDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The club can win up to five trophies this year, and the journey towards two of them starts this week.Lionel Messi’s side begin their Concacaf Champions Cup campaign against Sporting Kansas City on Wednesday night, commencing a season when they will also compete in the 32-team Fifa Club World Cup, the MLS-Liga MX Leagues Cup, while gunning for a repeat of last year’s Supporters’ Shield honor and a maiden MLS Cup triumph.Miami remain the bookmakers’ favorites for the last of those, but there are reasons to bet against them as well. AnMLS-record points tallywasn’t enough last season, as the team was bounced from the playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United. The conditions for success are less certain and more challenging entering 2025.Could a new rule finally give MLS much-needed transfer gossip?Read moreThe team has an inexperienced new head coach in Javier Mascherano, while the off-season also saw front office tumult. Most importantly, the team’s veteran megastars – Messi,Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba – are another year older and entering potentially the most demanding season an MLS club has ever faced.At mid-season, Messi will be 38. Suárez, who contributed 21 goals and 10 assists inMLSplay last term, just turned that age. The great midfield playmaker Busquets is 37 this summer, and full-back Alba is 36 in March. None of the former Barcelona quartet is signed beyond 2025, although the club expects Messi to remain for 2026.Be that as it may, this squad is assembled to win now.Of Mascherano, beginning his first job in club football having previously coached Argentina’s youth squads, instant success is required. He replaces the experienced and decorated coach Tata Martino, who stepped down in November.“I’m not under pressure. I’m here trying to do my best, trying to help the players have success,” Mascherano told the Guardian. “It’s true that as a coach you need to see results, but we don’t analyse results, we analyse the game and how we play. I think the results are the consequence of what you do on the pitch. We are happy because we are doing the right things.”Mascherano has a unique opportunity among coaches; he knows the key players innately, from inside the lines. He played at Barcelona for eight of Messi’s prime seasons. Likewise with Busquets. He played alongside Alba for six of those years and Suarez for four. Combining Barcelona and Argentina, Messi and Mascherano took the field together over 400 times.“It’s not just about my relationship with Leo but also the relationship I have with the other three players because I played with them for a long time,” Mascherano said during his introduction.Miami will continue to make marquee signings when the fab four era ends – fielding stars is baked into the culture – but replacing the footballing telepathy crafted at the Nou Camp may be impossible. The opportunity to reunite those players was a one-off. Uniting them under a coach who was a huge part of that playing unit adds another layer of intrigue.Miami’s other top talents from last season have moved on. The 21-year-old Paraguayan midfielder Diego Gómez joined Premier League side Brighton in December. His compatriot, winger Matías Rojas, 29, also departed after failing to agree an extension.View image in fullscreenJavier Mascherano has plenty of experience with Miami’s stars but much less on the touchline.Photograph: Nathan Ray Seebeck/USA Today SportsFurther roster depth and youth has arrived with winger Tadeo Allende, 25, signed on loan from Celta Vigo, bolstering the frontline. Defender Gonzalo Luján, 23, played for Argentina’s U-23 team under Mascherano. 21-year-old midfielder Telasco Segovia has eight caps for Venezuela.Pre-season results have been good and, in training, players have reported a “different, younger energy” as compated to Tata Martino’s slower, old-school approach. Players are spending more time in the gym, and sessions are more intense and varied.Unsurprisingly, considering Mascherano’s long career as a prowling midfielder and then a centre-back, pre-season has seen greater focus on defensive solidarity, in-game organization, faster transitions from attack to defense, and winning personal duels.“We know that we have the quality going forward,” midfielder Julian Gressel said. “If we can stop teams scoring, we know we’ll be able to score almost every game. Javier was a good center midfielder and then a defender, so he knows what it feels like. That certainly helps.”Renewed defensive focus aside, much will probably depend on the availability of Messi. In 2024 he started only 15 regular-season games, as the Copa América and the ankle ligament damage suffered in the final denied Inter Miami his services for 14 weeks.Miami coped surprisingly well, as evidenced by the record points tally, but a repeated lengthy absence is unlikely to align with the club’s lofty goals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He can become part-owner in Inter Miami when his contract ends, and he was central to the recent managerial and sporting director appointments.Lionel Messi’s Miami compensation is more than entire payroll of 22 MLS teamsRead moreFellow Argentine Guillermo Hoyos, whom Messi calls his “footballing dad”, was his youth coach at Barcelona. Hoyos will now run sporting operations at the South Florida club, having previously guided the club’s academy.His front office experience? Seemingly zero. His coaching career? Interesting. After Barcelona youth, Hoyos helmed 16 teams in 17 years (perTransfermarkt) in Greece, Cyprus, Bolivia (including six games in charge of the national team in 2016), Argentina, Colombia, the US, Chile, and Mexico.The Messi ally is of stark contrast to the successful veteran MLS executive, Chris Henderson, who left for Atlanta United in December. The replacement initially hired, Raúl Sanllehí – a former director of football at Barcelona, head of football at Arsenal and CEO of Real Zaragoza – was quickly sidelined and reassigned to an ‘institutional relations’ role.GiveMeSportreported an “exchange of words” with Messi as a potential cause, yet Inter Miami say the reshuffle was pre-planned.A statement said the move was done “in coordination with the closing of the window at the end of January and the many activities that the team has with the Club World Cup, World Cup and other matters pertaining to institutional relations”.Either way, it’s Messi’s show now, in contrast to previous appointments – like former boss Phil Neville – being guided by co-owner David Beckham.This is a big year for Beckham too. On the field, it’s the full realization of his drawn-out battle to even establish a team in Miami. This summer, his club shares a global stage with the likes Real Madrid, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Chelsea in the United States. The tournament’s greatest draw will be wearing pink.The final element of Beckham’s plan comes to fruition next season, when the team begins playing in Miami at a purpose-built 25,000-seater stadium in Freedom Park.The move from the team’s current home in Fort Lauderdale opening could be a celebratory moment, as a champion club cuts the ribbon on a bright future, in Messi’s swansong season.It could also be the ultimate anti-climax; a shiny new home, yes, but a team that requires a rebuild with Messi mania in the past. So much depends on what happens right now.Explore more on these topicsInter MiamiMLSUS sportsLionel MessiLuis SuárezShareReuse this content"

However, he conceded that the situation is still not ideal and his team will need an “almost perfect” performance at the Santiago Bernabéu to progress. “At the least,” the City manager said, “we have to give them a fright”.Asked aboutJude Bellingham’s sending-offon Saturday, the mana­ger revealed that after eight years in England “I still haven’t worked out the difference between fuck off and fuck you – but what ­matters is the intention, not the insult [itself]”.Real Madrid’s referee conspiracies overshadow Manchester City’s visitRead moreThe Bernabéu was a place, Guardiola said, where he had good memories and he was quick to insist that while the pressure would be intense and there would be moments of “suffering”, the same was true when his side travelled to Barcelona, Anfield or Arsenal, and he would not have it any other way.“Against teams of that level, no matter what the stage, the pressure is there but it is more than welcome,” he said. “You cannot perform well without pressure. It is what it is and it is not the first time; it will depend on how we handle it. What I have learnt [from previous visits] is that you have to play with courage, you have to be yourself. You have to have that mentality, you have to play to win, otherwise … you can lose [still], but you must be yourself.”As a coach here, Guardiola’s Barcelona team defeated Real Madridin the 2011 Champions League semi-finalandput six past themin their most resonant victory in La Liga. However, having lost the first leg 3-2 at home last week, none of the results he has secured here as City manager would be sufficient to see them through and after the first leg he said they had only a 1% chance. Carlo Ancelotti said he did not buy that, dismissing suggestions that Madrid’s chances stood at 99%, and claiming he would ask Guardiola if he really believed that his hopes were so small.Now, seven days on, it seems Guardiola does not, even if he did admit: “We have to change a lot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That awkward away assignment is followed by a visit to Manchester City on Sunday. Arsenal took four points from their trips to Villa Park and the Etihad Stadium and Slot believes Liverpool’s position will be even stronger if they equal or better that return. Failing that, the head coach will take consolation in the Anfield factor, with seven of his team’s final 11 league games at home.‘Buckle up and enjoy the ride’: Van Dijk backs Liverpool to handle title pressureRead moreSlot said: “As a manager you never think: ‘After 25 games how many points will we be clear or behind?’ You only think about winning as many games as you can and implementing a certain playing style to get as many wins as you can. You never know how other teams will do and the fixture list also decides how things will work out.“These two games we are going to play now have already been played byArsenal– Villa away and City away. Then we can make a difference in the upcoming two games. If not, then we are on equal terms because we have played a lot of similar games and there are still 11 games to go. The positive thing is that, after these two games, we’ve got seven home games and four away. And we all know how much Anfield can help us.”Slot admitted that Liverpool’s performance level had dipped in the past two league outings, against Wolves and Everton. However, he insisted that was a consequence of allowing David Moyes’s team “to play their pattern” inthe Merseyside derbyand the knock-on emotional effect of James Tarkowski’s 98th-minute equaliser. Slot suggested that four points from two below-par displays could prove crucial.Asked whether Liverpool were in a difficult moment, the manager said: “Was it one and a half weeks ago that we completely outplayed Spurs?I don’t count Plymouth. I agree the last two performances were not the same level we had at West Ham away or Tottenham at home but are weTottenham 4-0 win at homeor are we the Everton team? I think we are somewhere in between.“If there’s any experience I’ve learned of winning a league title [with Feyenoord] it is that, if there are 38 games to be played, you don’t expect to play fantastic football 38 times. If you are a very good team and a special team you play 20-25 very good games, a few mediocre ones and you play a few very bad ones.“But it is more about the results in the mediocre or bad ones than the 20-25 because they are ones you will probably win.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Mexican declined to celebrate against the club he left in January, and soon after played in João Félix who put his effort over the bar.TheFeyenoordgoalkeeper, Timon Wellenreuther, parried away another Félix shot and Hernandez could only hit the rebound into the side netting, while Manchester City loanee Kyle Walker drew another save with a shot from 18 yards just after the break.Milan failed to add a second goal and the dynamic of the tie changed when Hernandez was dismissed, picking up a second yellow card for simulation. Feyenoord had struggled to make chances but only needed one, Hugo Bueno crossing for Julián Carranza to head Feyenoord level on the night and 2-1 up on aggregate.Feyenoord held on, but defender Givairo Reed was shown a red card after the final whistle as tempers flared between the two sides. “I’m sick, still, but happy,” Carranza, who was on the bench through illness, told Ziggo Sport. “I didn’t feel great, it was something unforgettable to come in and score.”“The way we were controlling the game in the first half and at the beginning of the second there was only one team on the pitch,” Walker told Sky Italia. “Then the referee made his decision [to send off Hernandez] and the game changed.”View image in fullscreenThéo Hernandez goes down in the penalty area and earns a second yellow card for simulation.Photograph: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty ImagesFeyenoord will meet either Inter or Arsenal in the last 16, with their opponents to be decided in Friday’s draw. The result is also a boost to interim manager Pascal Bosschaart, who replaced Brian Priske two days before the first leg.“This says about the team that they have character. I think that’s what I’m most proud of,” Bosschaart told Ziggo Sport. “You have to remember that they have received a lot of criticism, a change of coach, and then an unknown person comes in front of the group who occasionally throws in some empty slogans.”Later on Tuesday, another Italian side crashed out of the playoffs asAtalantawere stunned 3-1 at home byClub Brugge. The Belgian side arrived in Bergamo with a 2-1 first-leg lead and extended that advantage within three minutes, Ferran Jutglà crossing for Chemsdine Talbi to fire into the bottom corner.The 19-year-old Talbi made it 4-1 on aggregate when theAtalantagoalkeeper, Marco Carnesecchi, could only parry Christos Tzolis’s shot and he fires in the rebound. Simon Mignolet then pushed Davide Zappacosta’s shot onto the post before Brugge struck again just before the break, Jutglà finding space and finishing emphatically.Ademola Lookman came off the bench at half-time and scored within 35 seconds, stretching his leg to steer home Zappacosta’s cross.

It never looked like we would concede the goal that we did.“I can only take immense pride from the performance. The guys gave everything.

A top-division game, a lingering shot of the stands and the posh seats and there in overcoat, aside some simpering dignitary or other, is sat the England manager. Cue Kenneth Wolstenholme: “There’s Alf Ramsey, perhaps wondering if Sheffield Wednesday’s Johnny Fantham should be recalled to repeat his Owls goalscoring feats for England. Though perhaps West Ham’s Geoff Hurst might get the call.” From Brian Moore to Martin Tyler, “Motty” to “Clive” to Peter Drury’s Super Sunday’s poetry recitals, it’s all part of the routine. An England manager should be seen and not heard and sometimes spotted leaving early to beat the traffic on the M6. An England manager should know their Toddington from their Watford Gap, their Pease Pottage from their Knutsford, and be able to quote the price of a Wildbean Cafe meal deal without looking it up for their expense claims. An England manager is a knight of the road, forever clocking up the mileage in their speedy saloon, unstinting in their efforts to find the next Kalvin Phillips, the one player who can unlock a team’s potential.Until now. Frothy reports this week suggest Thomas Tuchel, the current England men’s manager and an actual German, is betraying this tradition. OK, you might have seen Tactics Tommy’s cap in the stands a fair bit since his 1 January start date but the word is he’s been taking time off. Tuchel missed the entire third round of the FA Cup on 11 and 12 January and then three whole Premier League rounds of matches. Remember, Sven Göran-Eriksson and Fabio Capello both lived in London and were happy to attend games. Though perhaps that isn’t so compelling an argument considering the end results …Last weekend, Tuchel attendedBayer Leverkusen against Bayern Munichrather than a match in England, his excuse being Harry Kane. One august publication has even published a full dossier on where Tuchel has been seen and not seen. On Sunday, he missed Tottenham and Manchester United serve up a potboiler, passing up the chance to see Harry Maguire, James Maddison and Djed Spence as starters before Archie Gray came on as a late sub. An FA statement groaned: “Thomas has attended 17 matches – both in England and abroad – to watch English players since he joined us in January, and is working full-time to assess players for his first squad announcement next month.”Worse, the suspicion that Tuchel has been … working from home, the kind of practice considered an indictable-only offence by the likes of Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe, certain right-wing politicians whose business interests lie in commercial property and those Fleet Street thunderers who usually file their bile from French chateaux, Dubai or poolside at Palm Beach. Coincidentally, Tuchel’s home these days is in Germany after post-Brexit regulations – and Todd Boehly’s axe – prompted him to move back from Surrey. Sarina Wiegman does OK, considering she lives in the Netherlands, right? Worst, Tuchel’s first game – against Algeria – isn’t until 21 March.

In my head, everything is fine. I don’t feel unstable in the knee. I need to get strength in the quads and everything. That’s most important” – Football Daily hopes everyone is enjoying Manchester City’s hiatus from world domination, because Rodri’s return from serious knee-knack appears to be going smoothly. Good news for him and Pep Guardiola, not so good for anyone else (including City’s Nico ‘mini-Rodri’ González).View image in fullscreenGet ready for a resumption.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSI loved the picture of Jude Bellingham seeing red fromyesterday’s Quote of the Day, although I still can’t shake the notion that the real reason for his comically astonished fizzog is that Vinícius Jr has just revealed the true age of Luka Modric to Birmingham’s finest export” – Colin Reed.Gosh, it must have been 40 years ago when I wrote (yes, a letter) to the great Patrick Barclay. I’d railed against a totally unnecessary change of team colours (memory thinks it was those serial offenders Aston Villa). I must have included my work phone number because he rang me (after a journalist’s liquid lunch) and totally agreed with me. Others in the personnel office of Lincolnshire county council neither shared my excitement nor understood the seriousness of a proper football reporter actually ringing me! And then agreeing with me. RIP Patrick” – Ian Dovey.As a long-suffering Bristol Rovers fan, your photo of Bert Tann retrieving his golf ball from a stream (yesterday’s Memory Lane, full email edition) reminded me that he was our manager when I was growing up. This prompted me to do a bit of research and, to my surprise, I found out he managed them for 18 years but was only their second longest serving manager. By the way, when I started supporting Rovers they were in the bottom half of Division Three. Sixty odd years later they’re still there. The photo could be a metaphor? Rovers groping for success?” – Andy Smith.I was amazed to see the item on Bert Tann. As a Bristolian I remember him as long-term manager of Rovers in the 1950s and 1960s, when he had a policy of ‘no buy, no sell’, relying on recruiting local talent.

Marcus Smith missed two straightforward kicks againstLes Bleusin the second half, hooking both left, before Fin Smith took over and kicked crucial conversions in the 71st and 80th minutes.Marcus Smith was also off-target with a conversion against Ireland, again dragging it left, leaving him with a 57.14% success rate in the tournament. Last year Smith revealed he adoptedmilitary breathing techniquesin an effort to improve his goal-kicking after costly misses in the two-Test series defeat by the All Blacks.Fin Smithoffered his namesake his staunch backingas an “unbelievable goal-kicker” last week and revealed the decision to make the change against France came about when the assistant coach Kevin Sinfield came on to the field carrying his tee, saying he and Marcus did not discuss it at the time.View image in fullscreenMarcus Smith missed with this penalty against France and almost missed a conversion but will be back on kicking duty against Scotland.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThat explanation was at odds with Borthwick’s, who said after the match that “the players make the decisions on the grass”, but after sticking with the Smiths in their dual playmaking roles for Saturday’s match, the head coach said it was an easy decision to keep Marcus on duty as England seek to end a four-match losing run against Scotland.“He’s a world-class goal-kicker. We all know that, so it’s very simple,” said Borthwick. “Marcus is a gamechanger. Marcus is a player with incredible ability. Sometimes, the opposition focuses very much on him. Sometimes, that creates space for others. Sometimes, there will be a window for him to find. With Fin Smith and Marcus Smith, we have two ball-players, two people who see space in the frontline and in the backfield, and that’s going to be very important this weekend.”Borthwick has made one change to his side to face Scotland, with Ollie Chessum coming in at lock in place of George Martin. Chessum impressed from the bench against France and will make his first start in 11 months after knee and shoulder injuries ruled him out of the autumn internationals and the summer tour of Japan and New Zealand respectively.Chessum does not bring the same heft as Martin but is a more seasoned lineout operator – an area where England struggled against France in the first half. “He had a very good impact from the bench in the French game, with the way he played in that last 20 or 30 minutes,” added Borthwick of Chessum. “He played really well and he is gradually looking fitter and stronger after having a period of absence through injury. So, it is less about a tactical and technical decision and more the feel that this is just the right game for him to start and George Martin to be on the bench.View image in fullscreenOllie Chessum (centre) replaces George Martin in the second row for England, the one change to the starting XV.Photograph: Julian Finney/RFU/The RFU Collection/Getty Images“He’s grown into a lineout leader and caller which wasn’t something he’d done previously, he’s applying himself diligently to do that. All that points to a guy who wants to improve himself. He has the respect of everybody, he’s had a couple of injury setbacks and worked incredibly diligently to get back. When he walked back into the squad you could see how happy everyone else was. He has a presence and a positivity about him that rubs off on everyone else.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 24-time grand slam champion said the collaboration was “indefinite”, opening the possibility of the former rivals also linking up at Wimbledon this summer.Jannik Sinner case ‘a million miles away from doping’, claims Wada officialRead moreDjokovic’s Melbourne campaign ended when he had to retire injuredin the semi-final against Alexander Zverev. Afterwards the 37-year-old said he and Murray would “cool off” before deciding whether to continue together.“We had a chat the day after I finished the tournament and we reflected on the period we spent together,” Djokovic told the ATP Tour’s media channel. “We agreed he was going to take some time and think, speak with his family members and see if he decides to keep working. I expressed my desire to continue the collaboration with him so I am really glad he did accept.“It is indefinite in terms of how long we are going to work together, but we agreed most likely in the States and some clay-court ­tournaments. We will see how it goes after that.”Djokovic is now over his leg injury and made his comeback in Doha. ­It ended rather abruptly, however, after he lost in straight sets to Italian Matteo Berrettini – the wait for a 100th career ATP title goes on after a 7-6 (4), 6-2 first-round defeat by the world No 35.Murray could then join Djokovic at Indian Wells and Miami next month before the clay-court season ­culminates at Roland Garros in June. Murray, who retired last year, won the first of his two Wimbledon titles by beating Djokovic in the 2013 final, one of 14 career victories over the Serb.“He obviously has a unique ­perspective on my game,” added Djokovic. “He has played me and all of the current best players in the world and knows everyone well. He knows exactly what we need to do tactically – the evolution of my game and what needs to be improved. He has a positive approach and has handled the whole pressure very well as it is a completely different situation from being there as a player.“He has been terrific with all the other team members and while it was unfortunate the way the Australian Open finished with injury, we had a great run.”Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicAndy MurrayTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Musk’s bot has seen less widespread adoption than DeepSeek’s namesake chatbot, which wowed the world weeks ago and caused panic in stock markets, as well as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.Grok-3 is being rolled out immediately to Premium+ subscribers of X, the social media platform owned by Musk. xAI is also launching a new subscription tier, SuperGrok, for users accessing the chatbot via its mobile app and Grok.com website. The chatbot can generate texts and images without many of thecommon guardrails against sexually suggestive imagery, vulgarity or the reproduction of well-known people’s likenesses. X users have deployed the chatbot to mock political figures, including Musk himself, create deepfakes of celebrities and manipulate copyrighted material.DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Grok … which is the best AI assistant? We put them to the testRead more“Grok-3 across the board is in a league of its own,” Musk said during a live stream alongside three xAI engineers late on Monday. He added the new model outperforms its predecessor, Grok-2, boasting of “more than 10 times” the computing power of the previous version and passing AI industry benchmark tests with flying colors. He called the bot “maximally truth-seeking AI, even if that truth is sometimes at odds with what is politically correct”. The billionaire CEO regularly spreads falsehoods to his 200 million followers on X.Musk said the bot leveraged “Big Brain” mode for more complex research tasks than a normal chatbot could conduct. The latest release introduces a smart search engine, called DeepSearch, which xAI describes as a reasoning-based chatbot capable of articulating its thought process when responding to user queries. The tool, demonstrated during the live stream, offers functions for research, brainstorming and data analysis. Two weeks ago, OpenAI released a large language model that can similarly comb through the open internet and conduct more human-esque research for paying subscribers to ChatGPT.Googlehas also added research functions to Gemini.“The introduction of Grok-3 puts xAI back in the race for leadership in open-source LLMs [large language models]. It outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on some benchmarks, which makes xAI relevant again” said Gil Luria, managing director at DA Davidson.As competition in AI intensifies, xAI is ramping up its data center capacity to train more advanced models by raising billions of dollars. Musk touts its supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, called “Colossus”, as the largest in the world.However, Luria said improvements over the Grok-2 model appear to be too small to justify the enormous resources used to train it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His actions are part of a broader Trump administration agenda to reduce the size and scope of government but have been uniquely aggressive and controversial due to Musk’s personal involvement.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology startupsComputingDeepSeekOpenAIGooglenewsShareReuse this content"

It is certainly anexpensiveshow, something Mr Beast, the alter ego for 26-year-old Jimmy Donaldson of Greenville, North Carolina, likes to frequently remind viewers. The series is a feat of scale shocking to audiences outside the realm of YouTube, and especially Donaldson’s fiefdom: 1,000 contestants, filmed by a system of 1,107 cameras, battling each other for a $5m cash prize – the largest in entertainment history, according to Donaldson. For the competition, Donaldson and his posse designed a warehouse war zone modeled on the Netflix dystopian series Squid Game, constructed a bespoke city and purchased a private island (also to be given away, along with a Lamborghini and other lavish prizes). Contestants eliminated in the first episode are dropped through trap doors to unseen depths; there is a pirate ship with cannons.MrBeast’s degrading game show is a dystopian nightmare – perfect for America in 2025Read moreYet for all the ostentatious displays of wealth, the show still looks terrible – garishly lit, frenetically edited, poorly structured, annoyingly loud and tackily designed. Many have pointed out that the show’s central conceit – broke Americans duking it out and playing psychological warfare for luxury prizes, many in the name of paying their bills – is as dystopian as the Netflix series it’s based on, adepressing spectacle of aggro-capitalismfor our neo-Gilded Age times, with Donaldson as aself-styled Willy Wonka figure.For sure, Beast Games has a rotted, though grimly compelling, core, but its surfaces are also telling. On a stylistic level, the show erases what line remained betweenYouTubeand television. Beast Games has a higher production budget than any of MrBeast’s YouTube videos, which run anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes and reach upwards of 360 million subscribers. (Almost all take some base-attention magnet concept – being stranded at sea, stuck in the Great Pyramids or helping blind people see again – to their most extreme and hyperbolic ends.) But it maintains the same aesthetics and incentives of addled attention. Itlookslike YouTube content – content being the operative word (Donaldson also made the first three episodes available on YouTube).And it is popular. Beast Games is now Amazon Prime Video’smost-watched unscripted seriesever, reaching 50 million viewers in 25 days (although it’s worth noting that Amazon does not disclose what counts as a “viewer”). It reached number one on Amazon in 80 countries. Squid Game, for reference,reached 142 million householdsin 2021, according to Netflix. The show is not a sea change – plenty of reality shows look terrible, and many Americans have long consumed YouTube videos as their primary source of entertainment – but it is a line in the sand, as television shifts both in form and function.What is television in 2025? Is it a device? A style? A format? It’s hard to say – the content isshifting from linear to streaming platforms, while use of the device shifts to YouTube. In the US, people watch YouTube on a TV more than any other device, causing CEO Neal Mohan to proclaim, in hisannual letterthis month, that “YouTube is the new television”. YouTube is not making television, per se, but is serving as such; global viewersstreamedover 1bn hours of “content” on their TV screens last year, according to the company, including400m hoursa month of supposedly audio-only podcasts. The company shut down its Originals division in 2022, though it is nowmaking a pushinto children’s entertainment,recruiting a dedicated head of family entertainment and learningin late 2024.Functionally, YouTube may not be the new television so much as its next evolution. Formally, they’re converging. Even though digital-native influencers like YouTube talent (andTikTok talent, for that matter) havestruggled to break into Hollywooddespite huge numbers of fans, the ethos of the platform – the incentive structure of more eyeballs, the ring light glare, the maximalist aesthetic for maximum viewership – dovetails with evolving Hollywood logic.As one MrBeast directortold Time: “These algorithms are poisonous to humanity. They prioritize addictive, isolated experiences over ethical social design, all just for ads. It’s not MrBeast I have a problem with. It’s platforms which encourage someone like me to study a retention graph so I can make the next video more addicting.” In other words, value-neutral entertainment over art. Content as a means to an end. Which is not that different than the business logic of a streaming platform. Hollywood has its own race to the bottom for viewers, with its own aesthetic effect – therise of mid TV, thepredominant cheap Netflix sheen, theendless scroll of a “content” library– that mirrors the lowest-common-denominator attention economy ethos of a MrBeast.Donaldson, after all, now leads an Amazon show, styled after a Netflix original series, that is explicitly fixated on “entertainment”. The show is all about, as he says, “making entertainment history” – being the biggest, the brightest, the most shocking, the mostentertaining.As in, a product devoid of complexity or values or even narrative, for the one value of capturing attention. With the MrBeast-ification of entertainment, as Vox’s Rebecca Jenningsput it, the lines between content, entertainment, television and influencer are even blurrier than they already were. He has crossed what divide remained – will Hollywood subscribe?Explore more on these topicsTelevisionUS televisionYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over the last couple of weeks, mini-Musks have been popping up at high-profile political events, generating a steady stream of memes, headlines and analysis.Three of Musk’s young children were at a meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi last Thursday, for example. Why were Musk and Modi meeting? Good question. EvenTrump doesn’t seem to know, but told reporters he assumed Musk “wants to do business in India”. Which, considering Musk has burrowed his way deep into the US government, sounds ateenybit like a conflict of interest. But let’s not focus on that, eh? Let’s focus on Musk’s parenting instead! Don’t ask any difficult questions, just look at the cute pictures – disseminated widely – ofModi showering Musk’s kids with gifts. Adorbs.Musk’s four-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii (often called “X”), is something of a seasoned statesman now. Just a few days before the Modi meeting, X joined Musk and Trump for apress conference in the Oval Office. While Musk rambled about democracy and walked back a despicable lie about $50 million’s worth of condoms going to Gaza, X looked as if he would rather watch Paw Patrol. At one point heappeared to say– perhaps to Trump – “I want you to shush your mouth”. (Where did he hear that, one wonders?) And, at another point, X (who Musk once described as his “emotional support human”) seemed to pick his nose and then wipe the results on Trump’s desk. The nose-picking is very normal for a little kid. The standing by the president of the US, while your dad, who seems to think he is king of the world, makes outlandish claims? Not so much.Musk’s recent spate of in-your-face parenting has divided public opinion. His acolytes seem to think it’s super-cute and a sign that the billionaire isn’t just the saviour of America and human civilisation, but also the world’s best dad – gallantly putting his pronatalist views into practice. Other people (normal people) seem to think it’s a cynical and exploitative PR strategy designed to humanise Musk and distract from all his meddling in democracy. After all, having a kid on your shoulders makes you seem less like a robber baron with a weird breeding fetish and more like a fun dad.No prizes for guessing which camp I’m in: I don’t think there is anything cute about Musk parading his poor children in front of the cameras. Rather, it feels completely self-serving. Bringing your kids to work so you can spend more time with them amid your busy schedule is one thing. Carrying them around like props for photo opportunities, as Musk seems to be doing, is quite another.To be clear: I’m not saying politicians should always keep their kids hidden away. Having leaders parent in public can send a powerful message. In 2018, for example, the former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern became the first world leader to attend the UN general assembly meetingwith her baby in tow. Ardern was broadly praised for showing people that a woman can be a mother and a leader.What Musk is doing, however, feels very different. Not least because Grimes, who has three children with Musk, including X, has said multiple times that her young son “should not be in public like this” (or variations on the theme). Grimes also claimed she didn’t see one of her kids for five months while she and Musk were engaged in a battle for parenting rights and said her own “Instagram posts and modelling” were weaponised as reasons she shouldn’t have care of her children. Last year, Grimes’s mother similarly accused Musk of withholding her grandchildren’s passports so they couldn’tvisit their dying great-grandmother. There are plenty of phrases that seem to describe what Musk is doing here and “dad of the year” is not one of them.Anyway, I have to wrap this up now because I brought my kid to work today, too. That’s not for PR points, to be clear. It’s because I work in the living room and the child is off school. She hasn’t been wiping her nose on my desk but she has put Play-Doh in my socks.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskChildrenUS politicsParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Infamous for hisexpletive-laden viral rants at livestreamed awards shows, Fares is a refreshingly firy and unpredictable voice in an all too corporate industry. As he puts it, “It doesn’t matter where I work or what I do, I will always say what I want. People say to me that that’s refreshing – but isn’t it weird that you cannot say what you think in interviews? Do we live in a fucking communist country? Obviously, you have got to respect certain boundaries, but to not even be able to express what you think personally about stuff? People are too afraid!”Yet while gamers know him as a grinning chaos merchant and passionate ambassador of co-op gameplay, in Fares’ adopted homeland of Sweden, he is best known as an award-winning film director. His goofy 2000 comedy Jalla! Jalla! was a domestic box office success, while his2005 drama Zozowas a more introspective work about his childhood experience of fleeing the Lebanese civil war.Twenty years, five feature films and three video games later, Zozo was just one of many cathartic endeavours for Fares. “I’ve always been a storyteller,” he says. “When I was young, I’d draw my own comics. The first time I got a camera I borrowed it from a friend’s father, and that was that.” With no formal training, he learned by doing. “I started to make my own movies in the early 90s … and I just kept creating. I made 50 short movies until I did my first feature. So there was a lot of trial and error – just doing, doing, doing, doing until I got it right.”View image in fullscreen‘There was a lot of trial and error – just doing, doing, doing until I got it right’ … Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.Photograph: 505 GamesIt’s this DIY, inquisitive approach that guided Fares towards game-making, his pivot into interactive entertainment born from that same unflappable curiosity. “I’ve always been a huge gamer,” Fares says. “ I was lucky. I had the first [console] in Lebanon, an Atari. I played Pong and I was like, wow! I was just utterly fascinated with it.Gameshave always been my first love.”Once Fares finished work on his fifth feature film, a friend encouraged him to pursue his love of games, and convinced him to participate in a student-led game jam. “I was so excited! I came up with the concept of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons the same night” Fares says. “ I couldn’t sleep that night because I was like, I want to do this! I came up with how you control the two brothers, how it feels to play, everything. All in that same night.” He soon took his evolving prototype to a respected game studio in Stockholm – Starbreeze. “They were like, ‘Well, maybe you can do this as a kind of test project.’ But I’m like, fuck a test, I’m going to do the whole thing!”That passion fuelled a year and a half of intense work, with Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons being released in 2013. The co-op adventure about siblings embarking on a dangerous journey to find a cure for their sick father has now sold over 10m copies. Despite its success, many in Sweden were baffled by his artistic pivot, a transition for Fares that felt natural. “With movies, I came to a point where I felt that the passion really wasn’t there. Passion lead me to video games. It was very challenging being new in the industry and coming in with a different approach – wanting to create new mechanics. Today it’s different because [people] listen to me, but it was very hard in the beginning.”View image in fullscreen‘It was very challenging being new in the industry’ … It Takes Two.After Brothers’ success, Fares started his own gaming studio, Hazelight – a team focused on making story-driven co-op games, a surprisingly rare proposition in our online age. “Hazelight started because me and a friend tried – and failed – to find a game where it’s not just drop-in, drop-out [co-op] but something that you can play together and share a story experience. We couldn’t believe that no one was doing this. It’s why we don’t just make games with a split-screen element at Hazelight – all our games are designed and written right from the beginning to be co-op.”Much like Hideo Kojima, Fares can’t code, but instead assumes the role of writer and director on his games, laying out the vision for the story and gameplay mechanics, entrusting his talented team to bring his vision to life.Fast forward 12 years, and a new Hazelight game is now a massive event. Fares’ most recent release was the colourful co-op platformer It Takes Two, about two parents who find themselves magically miniaturised and must fight through their home to reach their young daughter. Highly acclaimed by critics, it won game of the year at the 2021 Game Awards. Now Fares is previewing his latest co-op extravaganza, Split Fiction. Much like Hazelight’s previous work, it’s a thrill ride of exhilarating successive set pieces. As dual protagonists Mio and Zoe battle their way across hostile re-creations of their own sci-fi and fantasy novels, each level throws new ideas at the player with Nintendo-esque abandon.View image in fullscreen‘It’s way harder to make games’ … Split Fiction.Photograph: Electronic Arts“Variation and pacing – how things shift all the time, I think that comes from my movie background,” Fares says. “Other people say, ‘If you have this crazy scene, why do you only use it for 10 minutes?’ Because if you have a cool scene in a movie, you don’t repeat it just because it’s cool and costs a lot of money!”Despite his undeniable talent for storytelling, Fares says he finds interactive narratives far more difficult to construct than their Hollywood counterparts. “It’s way harder to make games, because games are interactive and movies are passive. Movies spend much longer in production, writing, everything too – they just have more time for you to figure it all out. I always joke that if I want to go on vacation, I’m going to make a movie.”“I believe that we’re still figuring out how to actually tell a story in games,” he continues. “But that’s the fun part! Even the movie industry is now realising that great shit is happening in video games.”What Fares finds less fun, however, is the direction in which the games industry has been heading in recent years. “I don’t like live service games – I think that they’re bad for the industry,” he says. “I understand that money is important, and that we live in a capitalist society, but creativity and money have to meet somewhere in the middle. It can’t be either too much creativity or too much money. We should focus on pushing our medium forward: no micro transactions, no bullshit, just pure gaming love – because, ultimately, great games will do well.”Split Fiction is released on PC, PS5 and Xbox on 6 MarchExplore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesAdventure gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Part thriller, part relationship drama, it used music, art and relatable characters to create a touching paean to unshakeable friendship. Aftera series of sequels, Don’t Nod’s Montreal studio has crafted a new tale about teenage relationships, split into two episodes, or Tapes, the first of which will doubtless have fans on tenterhooks for the concluding part.It’s 1995 and introverted teen Swann is facing a final quiet summer alone in the rural town of Velvet Cove, Michigan, before her family moves to Vancouver. But in the parking lot of the local video store, she meets fellow 16-year-olds Nora, Autumn and Kat, and the four girls bond over their boredom and frustration with small-town life. Soon, they are inseparable, spending their days hiking in the nearby forests, making camp fires, confessing their secrets – until they discover a spooky shack hidden out among the trees and decide to make it their base. Here, they form riot grrrl band Bloom & Rage, channelling their dreams, desires and fears into fantasies of fame and revenge on shitty boys and repressive parents. But when their swirling emotions seem to awaken a supernatural presence in the woods, something terrible happens and the girls swear each other to a lifelong secret.View image in fullscreenA quiet summer, then … Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.Photograph: Don’t NodNow, 27 years later, the group are meeting again in a rough bar on the outskirts of town that holds special relevance to their story. Autumn has received a sinister package addressed to their band. Whatever’s in the box may well be the dreadful result of that tumultuous summer.In a style typical of Don’t Nod, the game intercuts compelling cinematic sequences with interactive scenes, giving you control over conversations that subtly shape your relationships and the direction of the story. The narrative swaps back and forth between two timelines – the adult characters reminiscing in 2022 and their pivotal summer together in 1995 – and your actions in one affects outcomes in the other. At times, decisions you make as 43-year-old Swann at the bar are then retrofitted into her youthful experiences, creating fascinating ambiguities of causality and memory.View image in fullscreenAs much about the way we edit memories as what actually happens … Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.Photograph: Don’t NodIndeed, this game is as much about the way we craft and edit memories as it is about what actually happens to the girls. Swann is a keen film-maker and her 1990s camcorder is with you throughout the game; at any point you can hit the right trigger to view the world through the camcorder lens. In the main story, you’re using it to film a music video for the band, but you’re free to record whenever you want. This feature is incentivised by a bunch of themed checklists – record 10 different birds, or five ruined playground rides, or snatches of graffiti. But you can also capture your own scenes from the town and its environs, or discreetly record your friends, building themed sequences that you can then store and edit. Although the interface recalls games such as No Man’s Sky and Marvel’s Spider-Man, where filming objects is a practical gameplay component, here the camcorder is also a metaphor for recollection and nostalgia – how trustworthy are these recorded artefacts? At the same time, the player’s role as both gamer and cinematographer asks interesting questions about how we relate to the protagonists we embody in games.It’s not the only clever trick the game plays with format and convention. The dialogue system, for example, is specifically designed to capture the energy and chaos of the excitable-group dynamic. Options and responses change depending on who you’re looking at as you talk, characters shout over each other, and comments get lost in the noise. At times, you can simply allow the dialogue options to time-out and choose not to say anything. In several wonderful moments this mechanic perfectly captures the desperate improvisational nature of teen relationships, the way a whole day can teeter on a single comment, or a fleeting moment of eye-contact.There are times when the dialogue feels stilted and over-earnest, and the sense of authenticity gets stretched. Those who’ve played Life Is Strange will also see many parallels with that game, especially between Swann and Max Caulfield, both shy photographers using the lens as an emotional security blanket.But like its predecessor, Lost Records wonderfully captures how, in young adulthood, seemingly insignificant moments can be charged with meaning. There’s a picnic by a lake and later a game of truth or dare that absolutely crackle with intensity. The 90s setting is also well-supported, with spot-on contemporary references, from grunge band mix tapes to video players and troll dolls – it’s fun to just pick up objects in the environment and reminisce, like wandering about some themed pop culture museum.In the background, the mystery at the heart of the game is subtly introduced and there’s much to anticipate from the second part. Mostly though, it’s the characters and their brittle relationships that stick with you. Three days after finishing the game I’m still thinking about them, worrying about them, inhabiting that old shack with them. Unless you simply refuse to indulge in emotional young adult drama, you will be right there, too.Lost Records: Bloom & Rage (Tape One), is out now; £35.89Explore more on these topicsGamesAdventure gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But despite the transformative subject matter, Ellen McDougall’s production has as much propulsion as a car in reverse.Skins actor Kaya Scodelario plays Lena, a former Mennonite and gifted coder, who is wrestling with the expanding consciousness of Logos, the software her company has developed. We meet her as she is preparing to be questioned by the workplace bigwigs who watch her from the upper level of Alex Eales’s two-tiered sciene-inspired set as if she is a caged animal. Lena and her lover, Sasha (Luke Treadaway) are being investigated after a security breach. For a fleeting second, the tension in McDougall’s direction is sky-high.But, that’s as far as East Is South goes in terms of sparking anxiety. Willimon’s writing is weighty and thick. There are references to religion, love, abuse and deceit, and the play attempts to answer the big, complicated question of what makes something human. But the pace of the drama slows and sags.Scodelario does her best with a soulless role and at one point she looks believably on the verge of tears. But the language of the play is peculiar. The romantic scenes between Lena and Sasha have no heat; the pair stand awkwardly beside each other as if they’re meeting for the first time. The interview scenes are void of any fire. If Willimon hoped to use his play to show AI as a potential threat to humanity, his scenes would need to have more fear sewn in.The risks Logos presents are nothing new; we already know that AI’s power is multiplying by the day, and that if this continues, it could possibly become free-thinking. All the emotional and moral issues Willimon poses feel well-trodden and are laid out plainly in his script.In 2025, there is an abundance of plays about technological advances, including the considerably more fascinatingMore Lifeover at the Royal Court. Next to such works East Is South seems unnecessary and uninspired. If you’re looking to be freshly frightened by AI’s perils in a drama, perhaps go to another theatre, elsewhere.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 15 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageArtificial intelligence (AI)TheatreHampstead theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The key culprit, in my opinion? Screen time.On a child’s first day at school, it’s normal to expect a few nerves. But they should be able to move around confidently, pick up stationery, make new friends, build a relationship with their teacher and start to feel part of a wider community. Instead, a recentsurvey reportedthat some children in England and Wales are unable to sit up or hold a pencil. I have seen kids racked with separation anxiety and unable to form bonds. Upset and confused, they miss instructions and hold back or lash out. To a busy teacher this looks like a lack of ability, or a disruptive child to be managed.Children are simply being set up to fail.For a while, it seemed as if the pandemic might have been the culprit for delayed development. Lockdowns undeniablyhad an impacton the development of children raised during that periodas they were unable to play outside and interact with others, but five years on, it would seem that this was a short-term issue masking a much longer-term trend.Lockdowns compounded habits that had already begun with the introduction of the first touch-screen phones. More and more parents relied on smartphones to work, organise their lives, shop, and keep in touch with friends and family. Burnt-out and distracted, they spent less time actively parenting. In turn, they handed their kids a device to keep them entertained. The result has been children growing up with less physical activity and face-to-face social interaction.Imagine spending a year immobilised in a cast – your muscles would weaken and your movements would become awkward. Now, think about children missing foundational years of muscle development, when practice should be natural and constant, because, instead of moving, children have been incentivised to sit quietly with a device.Children need opportunities to run, play, climb and explore. They need obstacles to move their bodies around, tunnels to crawl through, beams to balance over, and hula hoops to jump between. Every muscle and joint should be used as they develop balance and posture. This helps to forge the deep brain-body connections required for coordination and spatial awareness.Cognitively, children are struggling because they are not having quality interactive time with their caregivers. Acohort studyof Australian children aged 12 to 36 months found a negative association between screen time and parent-child talk. With fewer adult words spoken, there was a reduction in child vocalisations and the back-and-forth conversations crucial for language development and social skills. Devices are also having a behavioural impact, withstudies showinga link between excessive screen time and emotional reactivity, aggression and externalising behaviours in children.Labour gave us Sure Start to tackle child poverty. Now it should hike tax to keep it | Polly ToynbeeRead moreEven more worryingly, these outcomes are not being distributed equally among children; they affect those who already face significant disadvantages due to economic and racial inequality.Research revealedthat Dutch children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have higher screen time and astudy from the USexamining sociodemographic factors found that Black children reported higher levels of various screen time activities compared with their peers. Interestingly, the researchers behind the US study made an association between limited access to safe recreational spaces and increased screen time. Our environments shape us, and it is clear that children need access to safe play spaces where they can experience socially interactive and physical play.Some children are simply more vulnerable when starting school than others. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, children and families, especially those with other disadvantages, would benefit from targeted parenting programmes and support. The main lesson I would give to parents is this: when screen time is used it should be interactive, with engaging discussions about the content to enhance learning and connect on-screen lessons to real-life situations, promoting a child’s cognitive and social development. We cannot turn back the tide of technology, but we can use it more mindfully.Kathryn Peckham is an early childhood consultant, researcher, author and founder of Nurturing ChildhoodsExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionEarly years educationChildren's healthChildren's techMobile phonesChildren's rightsChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, underscored that when hesaidthe two sides would create a team, not only to support Ukraine peace talks but also to explore the “incredible opportunities” to partner with Moscow geopolitically “and, frankly, economically” that might result.Kyiv and other European capitals are still reeling at the full extent of Donald Trump’s cynicism when it comes to world affairs, and callous disregard for the people caught up in them. But it should be no surprise that business dealings were high on the agenda. Vladimir Putin would dearly love to end his country’s economic isolation. Russia ismaking the casethat American energy firms and others could profit handsomely by doing business with it again.For Mr Trump, his two key interests – money and power – are not only interrelated but fungible, just as US goals and his personal interests oftenappear indistinguishableto him. (This is a man wholaunched his own cryptocurrencytoken days before returning to the White House, and as he sought to ease regulation of the industry).When he talks of the future of Ukraine or Gaza, he speaks not of human rights and security, lives and homes, but of laying US hands on$500bn of mineralsand a “big real-estate site” respectively. He believes in cutting deals, not making peace. At the heart of his foreign policy team is Steve Witkoff, not a diplomat but a billionaire real-estate developer and golf buddy. Mr Witkoff was first appointed as Middle East envoy and then dispatched to negotiate with Moscow. The head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, was also in Riyadh – while Ukraine and European allies have been denied a seat.Mr Trump’s merging of wealth and strength were obvious even before he took office the first time. He suggested he could use Taiwanas leverage with Chinaon issues including trade. John Bolton, who became his national security adviser, latersaid(though Mr Trump denied it) that the president pleaded with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, to ensure he would win the next election, “stress[ing] the importance of … increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome”.Mr Trump’s Middle East policy is not only pleasing to his evangelical Christian supporters. His repugnant proposal to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza, allowing the construction of an American-owned “Riviera”, is shocking but in many ways builds uponideas long held bybusinessman friends as well as Israeli settlers. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a former real-estate developer charged with overseeing Middle East policy in Mr Trump’s first term, suggested last year thatGaza’s “waterfront property”could be “very valuable”. (Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, incidentally, becamea major investor in Mr Kushner’s private equity firmafter he left the administration.)Volodymyr Zelenskyy tried to capitalise on Mr Trump’s economic transactionalism by offering access to Ukraine’s resources, notablyminerals, in exchange for security. He got Mr Trump’s attention – but the terms of the resulting USdemandmake it look less like diplomacy than extortion. The US president prices up everything and knows the value of nothing. Others must now endeavour to show him that his plans will not come as cheaply as he believes.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As recently as inauguration day, the conventional wisdom on Elon Musk’s role in the administration was that he’d been given a meaningless post at a powerless agency whose name itself was a joke. From the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, it was said, Musk would issue easily ignored recommendations the gullible would take as evidence that Trump was streamlining the federal bureaucracy – a promise reliably made and broken by countless presidents. Instead, in a turn of events magazine cover artists have delighted in, Musk as a “special government employee” has seemingly taken the reins of the executive branch ⁠– a de facto co-president or perhaps a vice, while JD Vance busies himself with his duties delivering social media clapbacks and jeremiads about wokeness to European leaders.For weeks now, the Doge’s fleas have been hopping from agency to agency,gaining accessto key administrative and financial systems, including databases filled withsensitive informationon ordinary Americans andinfrastructureat the treasury that disburses trillions in payments across the federal government. One member of the team Musk installed there, Marko Elez,resignedafter it was revealed he had written posts supporting, in his words, “Indian hate” and a “eugenic immigration policy” as recently as December. Afterdefensesfrom Vance and Trump, he wasreinstated. Meanwhile,firedleaders across the government are now seeking employment; about75,000 federal workershave accepted a buyout from the administration. USAid has been gutted, putting thehealth and sustenanceof countless vulnerable people around the world in immediate jeopardy, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education are now under assault. Words and whole areas of inquiry are beingbannedfor researchers; government-wide, anything that smacks even vaguely ofdiversity and equityrecruitment and training isn’t long for this world. What’s more, all of this comes on the heels of Trump’s extraordinaryfreezeon federal loans and grants ⁠– justified as a step towardsrooting out“Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies” in government ⁠– which threatened programs like Medicaid, Head Start and even Meals on Wheels before it was blocked in court.There and elsewhere, those hoping to put the brakes on the administration’s moves are relying on lawfare to restore order. But this blitzkrieg is working anyway ⁠– the federal government has been weakened and all Trump and Musk have left standing is being remade in their image. Meanwhile, outside DC, Trump’s deportation campaign has begun with alarming departures even from the barbarism of Trump’s first term, like theprovisionsbeing made to house migrants at Guantánamo Bay and to send detainees, perhaps including American citizens, to prison inEl Salvador.It’s on tariffs, though, that Trump’s ambitions seem to have been significantly impeded. When Canada and Mexico struck border security deals to pause the administration’s threatened levies for a month, the White House was quick to frame them as victories for its trade agenda.But anyone who’s bothered to examine the Canadian and Mexican concessions closely knows that Trump delivered next to nothing ⁠– his ploywona Canadian border plan that had already been announced and a reshuffling of Mexican troops to bolster the 10,000 already stationed at that border to little effect as far as the flow of fentanyl is concerned. Even the 10% tariffon Chinanow in effect is much lower than the 60% levy Trump promised during the campaign.It will take some time before all the dust settles and the rest of the Trump domestic agenda shapes up. But these early days have given us enough of a glimpse at what will matter most to the administration that we can finally close the book on what Trumpism is all about. Nearly 10 years have been spent parsing Trump’s policies and rhetoric to identify points of departure from the Republican party of old. In columns and essays, academic symposiums and cable news bull sessions, it’s been argued that Trumpism has less to do with conservatism as we’ve known it than with other more interesting -isms ⁠– post-liberalism, post-neoliberalism, populism and, yes, fascism. It ought to be clearer to us now ⁠that the reality is much simpler. Donald Trump, a Republican president backed by Republican voters and the Republican party as an institution, is using extralegal means to enact longstanding parts of the Republican agenda and the conservative project ⁠– including, chiefly, the crippling of the federal government. The most significant standing policy accomplishment of his first term in office was a large tax cut Republicans are hoping toextend. This Trump administration promises to be more innovative to the same ends. The tasks of deregulation and privatization are themselves being deregulated and privatized ⁠– turned over substantially to Musk, who seems willing to shrink and weaken government in ways Republican politicians and bureaucrats in administrations past were unwilling to try themselves, a crusadelegal scholarsandgovernment officialsare calling illegal.As Musk and conservative movement veterans like office of management and budget director,Russell Vought, work away at all this, Trump’s tariff agenda ⁠– long scoffed at by Republican business leaders and donors ⁠– is faltering. And on immigration, it bears repeating that Trump’s supposedly distinctive nativism has precedents in Republican politics. The more immigration-friendly George W Bush-era that the Trump years are often unfavorably compared with were preceded by a period in the 1990s when the right, includingestablishment figureslike William F Buckley Jr, strongly backed restrictionism. They were followed, in the years just before Trump fully entered the picture, by a period when candidates like the now-saintedMitt Romneyleaned into restricting immigration so strongly that Republican leadersopenly fearedthey would be permanently uncompetitive with Latino voters.That never came to pass for reasons the 2024 election underscored clearly ⁠– many Americans, of all ethnicities, are plainly through with politics as usual. Decades of rhetoric from mainstream politicians about how Washington is broken and in need of candidates willing to bust things up and Get Stuff Done, whatever the Stuff may be, have culminated in the re-election, by a genuine plurality, of a candidate willing to abrogate the constitution to that end ⁠– one who has also promised to finally deliver on another standard bit of political pablum, the idea of “running the government like a business”. This is essentially what Musk has been brought on to do. The move-fast-and-break-things ethos of Silicon Valley is breaking the federal infrastructure; whether they recognize it or not, workers across many industries have faced the very same situation federal workers do now, with their agency and very livelihoods being sacrificed on the altar of supposed efficiency.The Democrats who have been roused to action on their behalf ⁠– feebly and belatedly, per usual ⁠– have centered the argument that Trump’s and Musk’s rampage through the federal government is unlawful and unconstitutional. “What Trump and Musk have done is not only wrong, it’s illegal,” the Virginia congressman Don Beyersaidat a rally outside USAid’s offices earlier this month.The very mechanisms the founders crafted to protect the republic are now an existential threat to it“USAid was established by an act of Congress, and it can only be disbanded by an act of Congress. Stopping this will require action by the courts and for Republicans to show up and show courage and stand up for our country.” Republicans, wouldn’t you know it, have gotten rather blase about the whole constitution thing in response. Last week, John Kennedy, the Oxford-educated senator from Louisiana who does a mean Foghorn Leghorn impression for his constituents and the press, defended the constitutionality of Musk’s activities immediately before dismissing the idea that their constitutionality mattered at all. “[T]he issue, anyway, is not process,” hesaid. “The issue is substance. Did they find wasteful spending, or not?” The North Carolina senator Thom Tillis was more direct ⁠– while Musk’s attack on Congress-approved spending “runs afoul of the constitution in the strictest sense”, he said, “nobody should bellyache about that.”Just how much bellyaching about the constitution should Democrats actually be doing? All that’s happening now is happening in large part because the men who wrote the constitution more than two centuries ago failed to anticipate anything like contemporary political parties, much less parties that would adopt the ironic disposition towards the document thatRepublicansnow have. Its checks and balances simply weren’t designed to withstand the skulduggery of organized political factions willing to sacralize the document instrumentally and disregard it as necessary. It should never be forgotten that Trump was brought to power by an ugly mutant of the founders’ electoral college to begin with. The longstanding Republican structural advantage in the Senate and constitution’s supermajoritarian threshold for an impeachment conviction allowed Republicans to defend him from the consequences of his actions twice ⁠– the second time despite a simple majority of senators voting to convict in the wake of his scheme to steal the 2020 election and the resulting attack on Congress.In November, voters either enthralled by his seeming invincibility or resigned to it sent him back to the White House. And the major legal challenges to all he’s done and will do this time around will inevitably wind their way to a supreme court dominated by conservatives Trump himself and the Republican party successfully installed, in full keeping with the constitution’s rules, to give themselves their best possible odds of winning their policy fights and hobbling Democratic governance. Topping it all off, Musk’s seat at the heart of the federal government has been handed to him as a reward for themore than $250m⁠– a mere sliver of his wealth ⁠– that he contributed to Trump’s re-election effort, a sum only made possible by the supreme court’sCitizens Unitedruling in 2010, which allowed donors, corporations and interest groups to raise and spend unlimited amounts on elections through Super Pacs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The very mechanisms the founders crafted to protect the republic are now an existential threat to it; in their greed and determination to implement the conservative agenda, Trump, Musk and Republicans empowered by those mechanisms are happily ignoring or working to override the parts of the constitution that don’t advantage them or suit their ends. As a matter of substance, this is a system that needs to be dramatically reformed or reimagined rather than rescued; as a matter of politics, one of the central lessons of this past election is that critical constituencies Democrats need to improve with in order to stay competitive federally care far less about protecting our sickly institutions than they care about a great many other things that they hoped Donald Trump would accomplish. As of now, even amid the mess in Washington, voters aren’t giving him marks that are all that terrible – a recent CBSpollfound solid majorities of Americans describing his leadership so far as “tough”, “energetic”, “focused” and “effective”.The legal fights against the administration being waged on constitutional grounds should obviously continue; like Republicans, liberal lawyers seeking liberal ends should avail themselves of whatever arguments stand the best chance of prevailing in the courts. Politically though, Democrats need to refocus. If appeals to our norms and constitution were politically potent enough on their own to work against Trump, he wouldn’t be in the Oval Office waging war against the administrative state today. Put more simply, no one watches a game for the referees.Democrats should be positioning themselves not as the guardians of America’s institutions but as the defenders of the American people’s concrete interests ⁠– showing and telling voters about all the federal government does for them every day and how the conservative agenda Trump, Musk and the Republican party are pursuing threatens and has always threatened them. The perversity of a man getting to rework their government purely because he happens to be the wealthiest person in the world and financially backed Trump’s campaign should, of course, also be underscored.The especially ambitious might even try arguing to the American people that all the goings-on in Washington illustrate the danger of having so much wealth accumulate in the hands of a few in the first place.Elon Muskis gliding towards becoming the planet’s very first trillionaire. His access to the levers and gears of the federal government now could help him along in myriad ways. Even an improved political system would struggle to constrain the amount of power he possessed as a private citizen and has now leveraged into a public office; democratic republican governance will never be secured in America without turning our attention to the structure of our economic system as well. Dismantling the federal government to prevent that from happening was a key object of the conservative project before Trump. It has remained so with him at the head of the Republican party and will remain so whenever his time is up. Right now, that project is succeeding.Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionElon MuskDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I suspect the latter ...Tue 18 Feb 2025 10.13 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 10.53 ESTShareWelcome to the White House, where every day seems to be bring-your-kid-to-work-day if you’re Elon Musk. The tech billionaire,fascist-salute-enthusiast, and de facto president of the US hasn’t just moved himself intogovernment digs– he has seemingly moved in a selection of his kids as well. Over the last couple of weeks, mini-Musks have been popping up at high-profile political events, generating a steady stream of memes, headlines and analysis.Three of Musk’s young children were at a meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi last Thursday, for example. Why were Musk and Modi meeting? Good question. EvenTrump doesn’t seem to know, but told reporters he assumed Musk “wants to do business in India”. Which, considering Musk has burrowed his way deep into the US government, sounds ateenybit like a conflict of interest. But let’s not focus on that, eh? Let’s focus on Musk’s parenting instead! Don’t ask any difficult questions, just look at the cute pictures – disseminated widely – ofModi showering Musk’s kids with gifts. Adorbs.Musk’s four-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii (often called “X”), is something of a seasoned statesman now. Just a few days before the Modi meeting, X joined Musk and Trump for apress conference in the Oval Office. While Musk rambled about democracy and walked back a despicable lie about $50 million’s worth of condoms going to Gaza, X looked as if he would rather watch Paw Patrol. At one point heappeared to say– perhaps to Trump – “I want you to shush your mouth”. (Where did he hear that, one wonders?) And, at another point, X (who Musk once described as his “emotional support human”) seemed to pick his nose and then wipe the results on Trump’s desk. The nose-picking is very normal for a little kid. The standing by the president of the US, while your dad, who seems to think he is king of the world, makes outlandish claims? Not so much.Musk’s recent spate of in-your-face parenting has divided public opinion. His acolytes seem to think it’s super-cute and a sign that the billionaire isn’t just the saviour of America and human civilisation, but also the world’s best dad – gallantly putting his pronatalist views into practice. Other people (normal people) seem to think it’s a cynical and exploitative PR strategy designed to humanise Musk and distract from all his meddling in democracy. After all, having a kid on your shoulders makes you seem less like a robber baron with a weird breeding fetish and more like a fun dad.No prizes for guessing which camp I’m in: I don’t think there is anything cute about Musk parading his poor children in front of the cameras. Rather, it feels completely self-serving. Bringing your kids to work so you can spend more time with them amid your busy schedule is one thing. Carrying them around like props for photo opportunities, as Musk seems to be doing, is quite another.To be clear: I’m not saying politicians should always keep their kids hidden away. Having leaders parent in public can send a powerful message. In 2018, for example, the former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern became the first world leader to attend the UN general assembly meetingwith her baby in tow. Ardern was broadly praised for showing people that a woman can be a mother and a leader.What Musk is doing, however, feels very different. Not least because Grimes, who has three children with Musk, including X, has said multiple times that her young son “should not be in public like this” (or variations on the theme). Grimes also claimed she didn’t see one of her kids for five months while she and Musk were engaged in a battle for parenting rights and said her own “Instagram posts and modelling” were weaponised as reasons she shouldn’t have care of her children. Last year, Grimes’s mother similarly accused Musk of withholding her grandchildren’s passports so they couldn’tvisit their dying great-grandmother. There are plenty of phrases that seem to describe what Musk is doing here and “dad of the year” is not one of them.Anyway, I have to wrap this up now because I brought my kid to work today, too. That’s not for PR points, to be clear. It’s because I work in the living room and the child is off school. She hasn’t been wiping her nose on my desk but she has put Play-Doh in my socks.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskChildrenUS politicsParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

The frequency of her voice is piercing my brain. I am managing a queue of patrons: taking orders, making cocktails, trying to stay sane. I am trapped here for another four hours. Welcome to the world of bar work.Just shy of turning 50, I recently returned to the hospitality grind after a breezy 30-year “sabbatical”. My freelance writing work is temperamental, and while I live the work-from-home dream, tapping at a laptop from my lounge can also be lonely. Even as a misanthrope, I need contact with my fellow species. Due to crippling social anxiety, I prefer having a role to play at any social function. I’m great at small talk when also pouring a drink. Standing idly with a drink and talking? Not so much.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailSome shifts, the work drives me to despair: repetitious, arduous, thankless. But more often than not, the hours provide a humbling experience, a welcome respite from a million and one other woes. There’s something deeply honest about a hard day’s labour, the all-consuming physicality of it. For between 5 and 8 hours at a time, there’s simply no room for pondering my more existential concerns – someone needs a drink, andpronto!At one with my chore, I am at peace.In the yoga tradition, there’s a practice called karma yoga – a spiritual discipline of “selfless action performed for the benefit of others”. Any seeker feeling lost and looking for guidance will have collided with the suggestion tobusy themselves in service to others.Whether volunteering or community work, the act of giving is the remedy. While I’m paid to be here, I take joy in the job as an act of service. It’s not social work, but we do hear stories of rough days or difficult nights. A happy customer can make it all worthwhile.I’ve always been a messy person. The situation was grim – but could I really change?Read moreMiddle-aged workers in hospitality help to challenge ageist attitudes and outdated assumptions. We’re precocious enough to wield a snarl as required, but know how to spend it wisely. In theory, we help displace notions that the work is simple and only for penny-strapped students. The majority of people I know who have returned to the trade have arts practices, children or otherwise complicated lives. One assumption that works in my favour is customers mistaking my maturity for authority, meaning they’re more likely to treat me with respect.By my age, I’m rather accomplished at surfing life’s grievances and disappointments. Some might say I’ve mastered the art, having clocked my10,000 hours of dedicated practice. Years under the (expanding) belt have a way of putting the small stuff in perspective. So, when it comes to the downsides of hospitality most of it rolls off my back. I’m also less quick to judge – it’s a long, hard life after all.I felt a strange mix of emotionsduring a recent ruck with a customer. It was an interaction where the stress at having her card declined, mixed with a hint of shame, spilled out in an unhinged way. It’s the kind of behaviour you’d only allow yourself to do in front of a complete stranger. It was so raw, so human, that I couldn’t help but feel a strange tenderness in bearing witness to it.I’m not one to wade into generational culture wars, but I have to say the most difficult customers, generally speaking, aren’t the barflies or the drunk men that call me “sweetheart” – more often that not, it’sboomers. Some of them exude a belief that they know your job better than you do. Thehuffing and the puffing when things don’t go exactly as they think they should, paired with a complete lack of awareness about why certain processes exist – like waiting to be seated – can be galling.This demographic – and I’m generalising here – are often the quickest to judge, the fastest to outrage and the most likely to feel dissatisfied with an experience they’ve had a hand in creating. My job is to make you feel welcome and look after your needs, but your job is to recognise that hospitality workers aren’t vending machines. It’s a human interaction, an intersection of people who all share a planet. We’re not inconsequential strangers.When customers fail to acknowledge the humanity of the person serving them, the net result is a surly workforce and unhappy clientele. But ask any satisfied customer what made their experience good, enjoyable even, and it always comes back to the hospitality they received. The magic ingredient? The exchange isn’t purely transactional – it’s a relationship. Like all successful relationships, the more you put into it, the more you’ll get out of it.Beth Knights is a freelance screenwriter and writer in scripted television, digital media and printExplore more on these topicsHospitality industryOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The key culprit, in my opinion? Screen time.On a child’s first day at school, it’s normal to expect a few nerves. But they should be able to move around confidently, pick up stationery, make new friends, build a relationship with their teacher and start to feel part of a wider community. Instead, a recentsurvey reportedthat some children in England and Wales are unable to sit up or hold a pencil. I have seen kids racked with separation anxiety and unable to form bonds. Upset and confused, they miss instructions and hold back or lash out. To a busy teacher this looks like a lack of ability, or a disruptive child to be managed.Children are simply being set up to fail.For a while, it seemed as if the pandemic might have been the culprit for delayed development. Lockdowns undeniablyhad an impacton the development of children raised during that periodas they were unable to play outside and interact with others, but five years on, it would seem that this was a short-term issue masking a much longer-term trend.Lockdowns compounded habits that had already begun with the introduction of the first touch-screen phones. More and more parents relied on smartphones to work, organise their lives, shop, and keep in touch with friends and family. Burnt-out and distracted, they spent less time actively parenting. In turn, they handed their kids a device to keep them entertained. The result has been children growing up with less physical activity and face-to-face social interaction.Imagine spending a year immobilised in a cast – your muscles would weaken and your movements would become awkward. Now, think about children missing foundational years of muscle development, when practice should be natural and constant, because, instead of moving, children have been incentivised to sit quietly with a device.Children need opportunities to run, play, climb and explore. They need obstacles to move their bodies around, tunnels to crawl through, beams to balance over, and hula hoops to jump between. Every muscle and joint should be used as they develop balance and posture. This helps to forge the deep brain-body connections required for coordination and spatial awareness.Cognitively, children are struggling because they are not having quality interactive time with their caregivers. Acohort studyof Australian children aged 12 to 36 months found a negative association between screen time and parent-child talk. With fewer adult words spoken, there was a reduction in child vocalisations and the back-and-forth conversations crucial for language development and social skills. Devices are also having a behavioural impact, withstudies showinga link between excessive screen time and emotional reactivity, aggression and externalising behaviours in children.Labour gave us Sure Start to tackle child poverty. Now it should hike tax to keep it | Polly ToynbeeRead moreEven more worryingly, these outcomes are not being distributed equally among children; they affect those who already face significant disadvantages due to economic and racial inequality.Research revealedthat Dutch children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have higher screen time and astudy from the USexamining sociodemographic factors found that Black children reported higher levels of various screen time activities compared with their peers. Interestingly, the researchers behind the US study made an association between limited access to safe recreational spaces and increased screen time. Our environments shape us, and it is clear that children need access to safe play spaces where they can experience socially interactive and physical play.Some children are simply more vulnerable when starting school than others. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, children and families, especially those with other disadvantages, would benefit from targeted parenting programmes and support. The main lesson I would give to parents is this: when screen time is used it should be interactive, with engaging discussions about the content to enhance learning and connect on-screen lessons to real-life situations, promoting a child’s cognitive and social development. We cannot turn back the tide of technology, but we can use it more mindfully.Kathryn Peckham is an early childhood consultant, researcher, author and founder of Nurturing ChildhoodsExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionEarly years educationChildren's healthChildren's techMobile phonesChildren's rightsChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

Google searches for the term have risen in the past year, as wellness influencers and podcasters have waxed lyrical about its supposed benefits. Distinct from its use in a parenting or psychology context (which can incorporate mindfulbreathing exercises), grounding or “earthing” involves walking barefoot outdoors or lying on the ground to realign oneself with the electric charge of the Earth.What is grounding?The surface of the Earth is slightly negatively charged. Grounding, so the claim goes, allows electrons (also negatively charged) to flow into your body, which would otherwise be blocked by insulating materials such as rubber-soled shoes. The ostensible benefits include, but are not limited to: improved sleep, metabolism and blood circulation; reductions in inflammation and in cardiovascular disease risk and pain; and relief from pre-menstrual syndrome.Grounding takes its name from a legitimate concept in electricity. Karen Livesey, an associate professor of theoretical physics at the University of Newcastle, describes it this way: “When you deliberately take an object that has possibly an excess negative or positive charge, and you connect it to the Earth so that the charges all equalise out.”“The object ends up with the same charge density that the Earth has,” she says.We’re constantly building up positive and negative charges on the surface of our bodies – take static electricity, for instance. “If you’ve got woollen socks on and you walk across the carpet, that rubbing between the socks and the carpet transfers charge, and you can develop quite a strong positive charge,” Livesey says. “You touch a doorknob, and suddenly that charge transfers to the ground.” The shock you feel results from the charge being neutralised.Negative charges from the Earth could, in theory, penetrate the body, but typically excess charge remains on the surface, Livesey says. “What we’re seeing in the literature is no causal link [explaining] why having a buildup of charge could adversely affect our health,” she says.Now is the time to unplug and reset. Next year we enter a more dangerous world – but for now I need the silence of nature | Paul DaleyRead moreNo dubious wellness trend is complete without someone turning a buck on it, so for those who live in cities or are otherwise precluded from regularly shoving their toes in the dirt, there is an assortment of conductive items people can plug into the grounding sockets of electrical outlets to get the same purported effects.You can stand on grounding mats, sleep with grounding mattress covers and sheets, and even wear grounding socks – a ChoiceShonkys winnerlast year. The socks, which come with a cord that effectively tethers a wearer to the wall, presumably do not yield great improvements in mobility.What does the evidence say?The flow of charge from one place to another is an electric current, measured in amperes. To put grounding into perspective, Livesey says appliances in our homes draw a maximum current of 63 amps. In comparison,one studyfound that a sleeping person connected to the Earth via grounding bedsheets produced a current of up to 10 nanoamps – that is, more than 1bn times smaller. “These tiny currents are almost undetectable,” Livesey says.Playing devil’s advocate, let’s say electrons from the Earth do make it into your body when you dig your heels into some sand. What effect would they have? One claim is that electrons from grounding can neutralisefree radicals, the reactive molecules that cause damage to cells. It’s a claim that sounds good but doesn’t stack up.“The concept that electrons flow through the body and neutralise oxidative stress is really quite a vague concept,” says Prof Judy de Haan, who leads the cardiovascular inflammation and redox biology laboratory at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne.“Not all free radicals are charged particles, so the idea of neutralising something which isn’t charged doesn’t always make sense. Indeed, in some instances the addition of electrons may exacerbate oxidative stress and cellular damage.”De Haan says the body has its own natural mechanisms for dealing with oxidative stress, such as antioxidant enzymes.The few scientific papers published on grounding have a “lack of scientific rigour”, De Haan says, with small sample sizes and poor study design. “When clinical trials are conducted, the important thing is that the researcher and the patient are both unaware of what the treatment might be,” she says – a feature known as double blinding, which reduces bias.What do the experts recommend instead?One thing grounding proponents have right is that there is solid evidence that spending time in nature – shoeless or not – is good for physical and mental health.“The benefits of nature contact are ample and myriad,” says Prof Thomas Astell-Burt of the University of Sydney. Longitudinal research he has led with Prof Xiaoqi Feng at the University of New South Wales found that people living in leafier city neighbourhoods are at lower risk of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as facing a lower risk of psychological distress, loneliness, sleep insufficiency and dementia.Prescribing nature: the restorative power of a simple dose of outdoorsRead more“We’re consistently seeing a 30% landcover of parkland and especially tree canopy being the bare minimum to observeconsistent benefitsacross health behaviours and mental, physical, and social health outcomes,” Astell-Burt says.“Just being in nature, or a view of it, can help us feel less stressed and better able to concentrate on things that matter to us,” he says. Green spaces “provide attractive settings to keep physically active, solo or with others, and opportunities for solace and respite”.De Haan says: “Walking in nature – of course that’s going to be beneficial. I don’t know whether touching the earth with your bare feet is going to make the difference.”So by all means go outside and, as the kids say, touch grass. Just know that any improvements in your sense of wellbeing aren’t likely to be from a negative charge from the planet below you.Donna Lu is Guardian Australia’s science writerAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The pessimists worried about the decline of multilateralism giving way to a “multi-order world” in which like-minded autocracieswould start to cluster,making the search for global peace and prosperity ever harder.The reality looks much worse. Donald Trump’s US is now subverting the very idea of liberal democracy in order to undermine it, both in the US and, as has become painfully obvious, in Europe too.At the Munich security conference, the US vice-president, JD Vance, accused Europe ofabandoning the values of democracyby erecting firewalls to exclude the far right from government; of fearing its peoples, and of restricting free speech. This was to a mainly European audience eagerly expecting Vance to address the big security questions of our time, from Ukraine and Russia to China and the Middle East. His assault on European democracy left the room dumbfounded and seething. His chilling suggestion that the waging war against disinformation amounts to war on democracyfelt like a genuinely shocking moment.Vance’s extraordinary assault, and his electoral interference on behalf of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland in Germany just days out from a general election (he had earlier met the AfD’s co-leader Alice Weidel) have little to do with democracy. Rather he was outlining the Mega (Make Europe Great Again) project in support of the far right across Europe. The strategic goal is clear: a Europe in which the nationalist far right is empowered is a divided Europe, far easier to subjugate by imperial powers, be that the US, Russia or China.If Trump’s goal is the neo-Nazification of Germany, then that ties in with the Russification of Ukraine, the first under the banner of “free speech” and the second as an invocation of “common sense”. Trump and Putin share an imperial vision of the world, which includes an imperial “peace” for Ukraine. It is imperial because it will be decided – just as at Yalta in 1945 – by empires; the US and Russia, perhaps with China’s help, but without Ukraine. It is also imperial because it concedes to Russia’s imperial ambitions for a sphere of influence, which Trump shares, as made clear by his approach to Canada, Mexico, Panama, Greenland, and, in fact, Europe as a whole.What we are also learning is that rather than a reformed multilateral order, or even a more chaotic multi-order world, we are moving into a phase in which there is no order at all. It is a world in whichinternational courts are sanctioned, international institutions thrown under the bus, international law systematically violated andinternational aid eviscerated. China will try to step into the void by talking up multilateralism, cooperation, predictability and free trade, as the Chinese minister of foreign affairs, Wang Yi, did in Munich. But China is most likely to be motivated to capture the spoils from a disaffected Europe betrayed by the US.During a panel discussion at Munich with the Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, I referred to the dangers of a world devoid of any rules of the road. He rebutted this by saying that India quite liked the transactionalism baked into this survival-of-the-fittest scenario. He had travelled to Munich after having accompanied the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, in what was, for them, a successful visit to Washington, in which Modi and Trump agreed on gas, weapons and more.There is a certain (perhaps understandable) glee among many in the global south, who see Vance’s election interference in Germany as Europe getting a dose of the medicine that it has shoved down the throats of many countries in the global south, having lectured them for decades on democracy and rights. And yet no nation, large or small, whether in the global north or south, will thrive in a world without international institutions and internationally agreed norms, even if those rules have been violated for years. A fractured Europe will only be poorer, more insecure and less free in a world devoid of meaningful laws and institutions.In response to Trump’s gratuitous gifts to Putin, Emmanuel Macron convened Monday’s emergency summit of Europe’s defence powers. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, warned that the choice for European leaders was between Brussels and Moscow: the time had come for a European army.This is all welcome, but every decision from now on should be premised on the awareness that what is at stake is not “just” a repeat of Munich 1938, in which Ukraine is sold out to Russia, just as France and Britain did to Czechoslovakia to appease Nazi Germany. The ominous spectre, after Vance, is that of Poland in 1939, squeezed and then attacked by Stalin’s Soviet Union and Hitler’s Germany, both intent on imperial expansion. Europe as a whole this time (starting with Ukraine) is under attack militarily by Putin’s Russia and politically by Trump’s America. China is waiting in the wings to partake in the feast.The sense of urgency and the call to action should not be about merely pleading pathetically for a seat at the negotiating table on the war in Ukraine. Only Ukraine and Russia should be at that table. Neither should European governments bend over backwards to reassure Washington they are ready to pick up the bill on whatever the US and Russia agree. Nor should Europe’s focus be on how to retain US interest by increasing spending on US weapons or gas.What Europeans (Ukraine included) must agree fast among themselves is what they want, what their red lines are, and what actions they are ready to take collectively for Ukraine regardless of what the US and Russia stitch up. Sanctions, military support for Ukraine, the use of Russian frozen assets, accelerated EU membership and a European deterrence force in the event of a truce are all options. More broadly, Europe will need to make itself more capable and less dependent on the US for defence. Temporarily exempting defence investments from EU fiscal rules, establishing new EU borrowing for defence, increasing European investment bank lending for defence or setting up a defence bank among the willing and able European governments will have to be considered.Europe should neither pick fights with the Americans nor focus on pleasing them. But European governments must now act on the assumption that they are alone in a world dominated by malign imperial powers. A Europe in which the far right takes power, as Trump and Putin would like to see, is one in which European integration would cease to exist. After years of discussing how the transatlantic partnership against threats from Russia could be strengthened, we find ourselves in a world in which we are not just abandoned by the US to defend ourselves, but attacked by it.Are our leaders brave enough to out-Trump Trump?Yanis VaroufakisEconomist, politician and authorJD Vance, the US vice-president,hastold Europeansthat their values are no longer America’s values. Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, added that Europeans “can’t make an assumption that America’s presence will last for ever”. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has confirmed that Europe will not have a seat at the table when the end of the Ukraine war is negotiated.Shellshocked, European leaders are stuck at the first stage of grief – denial. They will remain adrift as long as they stay there, and fail to grasp that Donald Trump has a rational economic-cum-geostrategic plan (albeit one that is detrimental to Europe’s interests).Starting with his economic weaponry, Europeans need to realise that Trump does not naively believe that his tariffs will, magically, eliminate the US trade deficit. He knows that in the short run the dollar will rise. His tariffs are a negotiating tool to get foreigners to revalue their currencies, to swap their holdings of short-term for long-term US debt, and to magnetise European chemical and mechanical engineering conglomerates (eg BASF and Volkswagen) from a stagnating Europe to a boisterous United States.Moving on to Ukraine, Trump’s team has made two things clear. First, they see Russia as a diminishing power that could never threaten Nato countries but which was given a temporary kiss of life by the transition to a war economy, triggered in turn by Nato’s planned expansion right up to the Russian border (through Russian-speaking areas in Georgia and eastern Ukraine). Second, they reviled how enthusiastically Europe helped push Russia into China’s embrace.In this light, it is easier to understand why the Trump administration is cutting Europe out. And why it adds the ideological veneer of taking Europe to task for betraying its own values, for example the right to free speech and the cancellation of Romania’s elections on, admittedly, shaky grounds.And now? One option Europe has is to carry on alone, attempting to arm and fund Ukraine’s attempt to push Putin back. It would bankrupt an already insolvent Europe, it would not help Ukraine and it would inevitably force a humiliated Europe back under the US’s thumb.A second option is to out-Trump Trump: to undermine Washington by rejecting any deal that gifts Ukraine’s resources to the US, meanwhile signalling to Moscow Europe’s openness to a new security architecture that involves a sovereign Ukraine in a role similar to Austria’s during the cold war. That would be tantamount to turning a dismal crisis into an opportunity for Europe to liberate and to re-energise itself. Alas, I cannot see our present crop of leaders seizing it.This was a declaration of alliance with the European far rightRokhaya DialloFrench journalist, writer, film-maker and activistJD Vance’s speech in Munich took Europe by surprise, but nothing in its content is new. His words were loaded with references that resonate with rightwing populist movements across Europe.Concerns about so-called censorship and threats from within mirror the rhetoric of the main nationalist European figures: from Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán,accusing an enemyof “hiding” itself, to Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,suggestingthat media outletsintentionally misrepresenther political choices – or Marine Le Pen, the head of the French far right, warning againstinternal threatsto French identity, particularly from immigration.These words being said on European soil by a US official also represent the institutionalisation of what was a central part of Trump's first term. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is alongtime advocateof forging a transatlantic rightwing nationalist alliance, forcing together US rightwing populism with European nationalist movements to create a common front against globalism, liberal elites, and multiculturalism. One of Bannon’skey strategieswas to use “free speech” as a rallying cry against what he calls the “liberal totalitarianism” of the EU and US Democrats.Invited by several key European figures, he was aguest speakerin France at the 2018 congress of Le Pen’s National Front (now National Rally). Facing the crowd he presented anti-racist critiques of the far right as an attack on freedom of speech, telling them: “Let them call you racists, let them call you xenophobes, let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honour.”Vance’s explicit support for Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) not only marks a significant shift in traditional US diplomatic stances, but also validates a party whose prominent memberstook part in a clandestine meetingwith neo-Nazis and other extremists where they discussed a plan for implementing remigration. That plan entailed the forceddeportation of millions, targeting not only asylum seekers and foreign residents but also German non-white citizens.Vance’s “threat from within” are those whose identities defy his image of Europe and those who are determined to push hate speech outside of the public sphere. That should frighten anyone who cares about human rights.Progressives must call out this inversion of realityShada IslamBrussels-based commentator on EU affairsJD Vance’s warm embrace of Europe’s far right should finally put paid to EU policymakers’ tedious talk of shared transatlantic values, and shatter complacency about the subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which the EU has been drifting ever more to the right on immigration, free speech and political exclusion.Vance is right in pointing out that European democracies face internal risks, but he is wrong in his analysis. The dangers we face come from Vance’s xenophobic far-right friends and allies and their toxic messages of hate and division, not from progressives. In fact, European progressives should speak out more loudly, clearly and forcefully about building inclusive societies and against the hate-mongers. Perhaps being insulted by Vance will spur them to do so.Europe’s reality is the opposite of the one outlined by Vance. Far from the far right being ostracised and silenced, mainstream parties’ “firewall” against partnering with it is crumbling.Meanwhile, whether they are in power in EU states such as Hungary, the Netherlands and Italy or providing backing to ruling centrists in countries like Sweden, hard-right parties are setting the EU agenda. In too many cases, European governments have been moving further away from their internal and external commitments to human rights – although they still talk about “European values” to countries in the global south. This has not surprisingly prompted charges of double standards and led to a loss of EU credibility.Vance portrayed European migration policies as weak. The charge is laughable. The reality is that the EU has been shifting steadily toward tougher migration controls, including through theEuropean pact on migration and asylum, passed in 2024, which strengthens border security and speeds up deportations. Once-taboo policies such as the establishment of “return hubs” for refugees and asylum seekers, unlawfulpushbacks by Frontexand the weaponising of Islamist-linked terrorist attacks for political gain are now mainstream in the EU. Building an ever-strong “Fortress Europe” has not, however, stopped the rise of far-right parties, which continue to spout anti-Muslim hatred and gain traction by calling for even stricter measures.True, there are valiant but ultimately ineffective EU attempts to curb hate speech on social platforms and in European media. Sadly, here too, while free speech is often defended in principle, there are also governmental crackdowns on pro-Palestine demonstrations,journalists have lost their jobsover their criticism of Israel’s destruction of Gaza after the October 7 Hamas attack and Germany has shut down cultural events and evendeported activistsfor expressing pro-Palestinian views.The EU should respond forcefully to Vance’s criticism by going back to its original commitments to equality, inclusion, human rights and the rule of law. Too much ground has already been ceded to Vance and Donald Trump’s friends and this is no time to retreat.The peril Germany is facing may concentrate mindsJohn KampfnerAuthor of In Search of Berlin, Blair’s Wars and Why the Germans Do It BetterDuring his first term in the White House, Donald Trump reserved a special place in hell for Angela Merkel’s Germany. He loathed everything she, and it, stood for: its energy dependency on Russia, trade dependency on China and military dependency on the US. Most of all, he resented the then-chancellor’s deliberative politics and the popularity they enjoyed at the time. She disdained his visceral vulgarity. Germans were discomfited by him, but believed that once he was gone, they could retreat into their comfortable shell.Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was the first shock to the system. The Munich security conference of this past weekend will go down as an even bigger moment. Germans are now forced to realise that the US will no longer defend it; some are beginning to wonder whether the superpower on which they relied might even have become an adversary.Theelections next Sundaywill go a long way to determining whether Germans have woken up. Will they finally appreciate the need to use hard power to defend the post-1945 settlement that gave their country a moral purpose?All the mainstream candidates expressed fury atthe actions of the Trump team in Munich, both the hostile speeches by the vice-president and others, and the endorsement of the AfD – with Vance meeting the far-right party’s leader,but not the chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democrats and chancellor-in-waiting, accused the Trump team of “interfering quite openly” in the election: “We will decide for ourselves what happens to our democracy.” It was a sobering moment, suggesting he may now understand the folly of his recent parliamentary gambit when he accepted AfD support to try to force through a tough migration bill.The peril Germany is facing – with Trump on one side, Putin on the other – may concentrate minds. Merz’s new government will have three competing priorities: to bring order to the asylum system, radically modernise the economy and beef up defence spending.  The scale of these challenges may strengthen his hand in negotiations to form a new coalition with either the Social Democrats or the Greens, or possibly both. All the parties will have to show a new resolve and sense of common leadership, characteristics that were sorely lacking in the outgoing government.They know that now they have nowhere to hide. If they fail to make progress over the next four or five years, the AfD, aided and abetted by Trump and Elon Musk, will be in pole position for the next elections.The continent is torn between denial and hysterical overreactionLorenzo MarsiliPhilosopher, activist, author and director of the Berggruen Institute EuropeFor years, European countries have behaved as geopolitical ostriches, hiding their heads in the sands of military and diplomatic impotence. Today they tremble as if war had already reached Berlin and Paris. The result is paralysis – a continent torn between denial and hysterical overreaction.What would a balanced response to JD Vance and Donald Trump’s explosive declarations about Europe look like? It would be one fit for objectives and fit for the future. Europe’s objectives are deterrence of foreign aggression – on its soil and on that of partner countries such as Moldova or the western Balkans. These objectives, however, do not include global military projection to drive regime change in other countries. They also do not include preparation for conflict with China, whatever course the US may take: as the US security umbrella shuts over Europe, so does American leverage in determining European policy towards Beijing.Europe’s longer-term interest is to avoid having to scramble for an ad hoc and embarrassingly insufficient response each time a security crisis breaks out – whether this is about meddling, piracy,cyber-attacksor aggression against it, or about supporting the UN in peacekeeping missions internationally.Combining its immediate objectives and its future interests leads to one clear solution: Europe needs a common military force that is effective but of limited size. An effective force is one that is well supplied and trained, that has joint procurement and an industrial production capacity to match. A limited force is one that is sufficient to deter aggression, but insufficient for military adventurism, and that does not imply swapping the welfare state for the military state. A common force, finally, is one that is ready to be deployed without incessant haggling between participating states, as one army and not as a hastily assembled coalition of national jealousies.Who should establish such a force? The pragmatic answer is whoever is willing, without requiring the paralysing unanimity demanded by EU treaties. It should be open to, or at least be in a close relation to, non-EU countries such as the UK and Ukraine. Many of Europe’s most celebrated achievements began as parallel treaties between an avant garde group of nations.It becomes clearer every day that if peace is to emerge in Ukraine then European troops will need to be part of the solution. They should not be deployed merely to guarantee European states a minor seat at the table of the negotiations or because Trump and Vance order so. They should be deployed to form the basis of a common, effective, but limited European army that is fit for objectives and for the future.Ultimately, this is not merely about establishing a European military force, but establishing a European security regime crafted and owned by Europeans, less vulnerable to the whims and tides of US policy.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyEurope's turning pointEuropeUkraineRussiaJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

According to the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, the four major banks have been quick to confirm that they will pass on the “full benefits” of the decision.Such a tiny cut might not feel like much to those saddled with large debt. Remember, the cash rate rose from just 0.1% in April 2022, adding thousands of dollars a month to mortgage repayments. But it’s important to remember that, only in November, the RBA was still“not ruling anything in or out”. In other words, a rate rise was still being debated. This phrase was finally removed at the December meeting, giving confidence that a rate rise was finally off the table, but certainly not guaranteeing a rate cut any time soon.2:22Treasurer Jim Chalmers hails RBA's first rate cut since pandemic as federal election looms – videoIndeed, the RBA has been very cautious – some might say overly so – in its assessment of the different risks facing the economy in 2024. They were supported in this view by some economists, albeit a minority, as recently as last month. Again, in November last year, the RBA said it did “not see inflation returning sustainably to the midpoint of the [inflation] target until 2026.”Today, they tell us “inflation is expected to return to the 2–3% range a little sooner than we thought.” In fact, underlying inflation is now expected to be in the target zone by June this year, a full year ahead of the forecasts published in theNovember Statement on Monetary PolicyWhile mortgage holders, renters, and the federal government will be embracing today’s news, there remains the question: what next? Those expecting rates to head south towards levels seen during the depths of the pandemic will be deeply disappointed. The RBA itself today said it “remains cautious on prospects for further policy easing,” so how might we interpret that?RBA slashes interest rates to 4.1% in its first cut since the early days of the pandemicRead moreThe path of rates in the year ahead will depend on a couple of things. Firstly, and obviously, the path of the economy and inflation in the year ahead will dictate the timing of any future rate cuts.But, just as importantly is where the RBA sees what’s known as the “neutral cash rate”. That is, the rate at which monetary policy is neither too tight nor too stimulatory. A Goldilocks rate, if you like. Unfortunately, this neutral rate is not fixed and possibly not even precisely knowable. This means a little guess work is involved: if the RBA cut too far too fast, they risk losing the very hard-won gains of 2024 and letting the inflation genie escape once again. Go too slowly, and an already weak economy risks stagnation and a significantly weaker labour market than we’ve seen so far.The bank has been at pains to point out that there remains a great deal of economic uncertainty in the year ahead. One could argue that this is always the case, but it’s certainly fair to say that the US election and growing trade tensions over US president Donald Trump’s tariff policies are casting a very long shadow over growth and inflation prospects both in Australia and around the world. Australia is doubly vulnerable, both through tariffs imposed on us directly, and those imposed on China which will likely reduce demand from Australia for those imported goods.Guardian Essential poll: Labor’s policies appear unknown to voters as major parties neck and neckRead moreOn the other side of the equation, the labour market has been remarkably resilient, with unemployment still at just 4%, chiefly due to government spending offsetting a weak private sector. Today, the RBA has reduced its expectations for peak unemployment to just 4.2%, down from 4.5%. This is an incredible achievement when we consider what has happened in previous periods of rate rises.Weighing up the risks for the year ahead, it feels as if the RBA is now conceding that the balance may have been tipped towards the downside. With monetary policy described in today’s release as still restrictive (that is, above the neutral rate), it’s reasonable to expect further rate cuts will be discussed at each meeting this year.Financial markets expect rates to head slowly towards 3.5% by the end of this year. That is, another three cuts of 0.25 percentage points. Mortgage holders will be desperately hoping that the pundits are right.Nicki Hutley is an independent economist and councillor with the Climate CouncilExplore more on these topicsReserve Bank of AustraliaOpinionInterest ratesAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

Great art should spark debateMon 17 Feb 2025 21.01 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 02.36 ESTShareDespite the perceived outrage at Khaled Sabsabi’s depiction of Hassan Nasrallah in his 2007 work You,Australian arthas long made subjects of outlaws and questionable figures. And it is all the richer for it.On Thursday the shadow arts minister and self-described defender of free speech Claire Chandlerasked Senator Penny Wong:Why is the Albanese government allowing a person who highlights a terrorist leader in his artwork to represent Australia on the international stage at the Venice Biennale?Without seeing the work, Wong said:I agree with you that any glorification of the Hezbollah leader Nasrallah is inappropriate.Within 24 hours, Creative Australia’s board announced Sabsabi and the curator Michael Dagostino, the nominated artistic team for the Australian Pavilion at the 2026Venice Biennale, had been scratched.Thenews sparked shock resignationsat Creative Australia, private funding retractions and widespread outrage across the Australian and international arts sectors.Tony Burke says he called Creative Australia chief executive before board meeting when Biennale selection rescindedRead moreThe work in question, You, isn’t related to Sabsabi’s proposed 2026 Biennale work. It is an experimental video artwork which engages with the complexities of the 2006 Lebanon war and how Sabsabi, who was born in Tripoli and migrated to Australia in 1978, may have experienced this war remotely via news feed.The work features images of the now-deceased Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. It resides in theprestigious collectionof Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art.A double standardA number of prominent Australian artists have depicted outlaws and controversial figures in their work. So how were those works received?Let’s look atSidney Nolan’s Ned Kellyseries as an example. These 27 acclaimed paintings depict the notorious bushranger Edward Kelly’s final days in 1880. Nolan painted the series between 1946 and 1947, in the aftermath of the catastrophic second world war.The works can be understood as an effort to investigate homegrown violence in Australia’s history, wherein the outlaw is a metaphor used to explore conflicting migrant/settler cultures among the bright and dusty central Victorian landscape.Similarly, the late Australian painter and 2000 Archibald prize winner Adam Cullen did not meet much controversy when his 2002 portrait of the convicted violent criminal Mark “Chopper” Readwas installedat the Art Gallery of NSW. That same year, Cullen illustrated Read’s children’s book,Hooky the Cripple.Cullen is revered for depicting violence and darkness in Australian culture. His works reside in most state and national collections.Art thrives through diverse perspectivesThe Marri Ngarr artist Ryan Presley’s 2018 series Blood Money revises Australian banknotes to feature historical First Nations figures andforms partof the Reserve Bank of Australia’s art collection.Works in the series include the First Nations colonial resistance fighters and outlaws Jandamarra (1873-97), Woloa (1800-31), Pemulwuy (1750-1802) and Dundalli (circa 1820-55).These individuals waged violence against the crown and were classified as enemy combatants in their time. Yet it’s fair to say they make compelling and appropriate subjects for Presley’s art, which helps us better understand Australia’s complex and violent history.The Iranian-born Australian photographer Hoda Afshar’sAgonistes(2020), an award-winning portrait series with accompanying video, features various Australian whistleblowers, including theWitness K lawyer Bernard Collaeryand the incarcerated Afghan Fileswhistleblower David McBride.Each figure depicted in Afshar’s portraits has faced punishment and persecution by local authorities, in part due to Australia’s weakwhistleblower protection laws.Sabsabi is a distinguished Australian artist whose Biennale proposal won a rigorous open tender to be exhibited in Venice 2026. Spanning 30 years, his work examines spiritualism, optimism and the intricate beauty of a migrant Australian experience that’s unique to western Sydney.If artists are to be cancelled for making works that spark “divisive debate”, as Creative Australiahas called it, there won’t be much art left to see.Ella Barclay is senior lecturer at the Australian National University’s school of art and design.

But while all eyes are on the horse race, there is less focus about the actual form the next government will take.The Guardian Essential Report joins the plethora of polls and models tapping the national mood (spoiler alert: it’s close). But as I’ve argued previously, focusing too intently on future voter intent risks missing the drivers that will actually determine the election.Beyond the cliches that the election is a referendum on the cost of living and that the major parties are alike on many key issues, there are genuine differences emerging around the scale, ambition and role of government, how it should be funded and by whom.The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is drawing inspiration from Elon Musk’s crypto-meme inspired department of government efficiency (or “Doge”) as he scythes the US government with his calculated disruption to the workforce, includingencouraging workers to resignand purging any program that sits outside the president’s ideological filter.Dutton has taken a similar approach withthe appointment of referendum-buster Jacinta Nampijinpa Priceto a “government efficiency” shadow ministry that is desperately seeking programs to defund and workers to cut.While theCoalitionrefuses to give a clear number of positions to go, it has consistently catcalled Labor for creating 36,000 new public-sector jobs in office. This week’s report shows that the Coalition has some work to do to land that proposition.To what extent do you support or oppose public service job cuts on the scale of 36,000 jobs?Australians appear sceptical about wholesale public-sector job cuts, although we found big variations across age and gender. Dutton will try to bluster his way through the campaign with vague promises to preserve “frontline” services but any meaningful intervention to reduce the public-sector headcount will require substantial pain.Underpinning these policies are three articles of neoliberal faith: that the public sector is inherently inefficient; that cutting jobs won’t have a material impact on citizens’ lives; and that people will vote for a tax cut over anything else.Add to this Trump’s populist strain that provides extra ballast: the government is not to be trusted because it acts in the interests of elites not you.Dig beyond the ideology and the idea of painless job cuts begins to unravel: Labor’s alleged jobs spree included thousands of new workers in Centrelink, the NDIA and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which had been run down to the point of incapacity bythe previous government’s hiring freeze.Of course, these public-sector jobs and government services do not exist in a vacuum: unless we want to move to an entirely user-pays system of essential services, like the US health system (notoriously one of the world’s most expensive and ineffective), they need to be funded by taxes paid by citizens.At this point the cost of government becomes personal. While most people think the amount of tax being charged for services is about right, they think the distribution is all wrong, with those who have the resources to legally minimise their contributions through complex arrangements such as the use of trusts and other concessions.For each of the following groups, do you think they currently pay too much, not enough, or about the right amount of tax?This is where the rubber hits the road for progressive representatives: how to make the case to voters that paying tax leads to better collective outcomes in services and infrastructure?After decades of highly effective neoliberal messaging that tax is some sort of theft from the individual, this is no easy task but one thing is certain: you don’t get there by adopting conservative framing like “relieving the tax burden”.Rather it starts with articulating the purpose of government and being honest about the resources required to provide people with support and opportunity and be upfront about the choices we need to make to deliver these.Per Capita’sCommunity Tax Summit, to be held this week in Melbourne, is an attempt to recast these contradictions, starting with the grown-up proposition that we get the society we are prepared to pay for.The key question posed by the summit is what kind of country do we want and expect Australia to be? Is it one in which we collectively contribute to ensure that our fellow citizens today, and our children and grandchildren in the future, can live secure, peaceful, safe and productive lives, fulfilling their potential and raising healthy, happy families?Or is it one in which we abandon the great social gains of the postwar liberal-democratic state and fall back to a basic “survival of the fittest”, individualist mentality that essentially declares that it’s every man for himself?Per Capita’s Annual Tax Survey finds 60% of people would personally be willing to pay higher taxes for stronger health and aged care systems. This is reinforced by our poll, which finds a majority calling for increased funding on key social policies.For each of the following services, would you like to see them receive more, less, or the same amount of government funding?As the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr famously observed: taxes are the price we pay for a civilised society.While there are legitimate debates about the distribution of who pays, particularly when the tax treatment of wages is so much higher than is that of income from assets, lowering the tax base is actually an argument to dilute the effectiveness and reduce the role of the state.While the frontrunners in the horse race may appear the same, the good news is the election does provide a stark choice: an economic approach committed to investing in people and delivering long-overdue reforms in energy, housing, education and the care economy; or a winding back of government that leaves citizens subject to the whims of the market.Taking the axe to government should be an informed choice. With Trump’s America currently disembowelling itself, at least we are getting a glimpse of the costs before we potentially embark on our own cycle of self-flagellation.Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company.

Stars Stephen Graham, Malachi Kirby and Erin Doherty talk thievery, brawling and broccoliAndy WelchTue 18 Feb 2025 12.02 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 12.17 ESTShareStephen Graham is red-faced and fidgeting in a London hotel alongsideMalachi Kirbyand Erin Doherty, his co-stars in A Thousand Blows. I explained how my partner had initially dismissed the gritty period drama on account of all the brutal boxing bouts. But after seeing a glimpse of an extremely hench, shirtless and sweating Graham, she decided that she probably would be able to join me in watching after all.“I don’t know what to say,” says Graham, as Kirby and Doherty tease him. “If that’s what it takes to get bums on seats, I’ll go with it.”I’m just going to be honest – there are a lot of twats in this industry. Do you know what I mean?The physical transformations – Kirby says he lost his “lockdown belly” and he looks like a mean, lean fighting machine in the show – took them about six months, training five days a week and eating a diet of chicken, rice and broccoli. Graham, who admits he is an “obsessive person”, continued the training long after filming wrapped. “It’s now part of my life,” he says.If you thought Graham was menacing as Combo in This Is England or as Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire, just wait until you see A Thousand Blows. He stars as Sugar Goodson, an undefeated champion in the world of illegal boxing in Victorian-era London.View image in fullscreenDreamer ... Malachi Kirby as Hezekiah Moscow.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney+Sugar’s dominance is threatened by the arrival of Hezekiah Moscow (Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), best friends from Jamaica, seeking a better life in Britain. Hezekiah, younger and fitter than Sugar, is also more than his match in the ring, which sends Sugar into a jealous rage.Doherty, 32, meanwhile, plays Mary Carr, the pistol- and knife-wielding leader of the all-female gang of thieves the Forty Elephants. Best known for playing Princess Anne inThe Crown, Doherty sees the Forty Elephants as akin to the suffragettes. Like their more famous sisters, the Elephants are also seeking emancipation – but using different methods.The series was created bySteven Knight, the man behind Peaky Blinders and SAS: Rogue Heroes. Like those shows, A Thousand Blows is loosely based on reality. Goodson, Moscow and Carr were all real people, while the shoplifting gang operated in London’s Elephant and Castle area from the 1870s onwards.You can see every penny of Disney’s budget on screen. It was filmed at The Story Works, a nine-hectare complex in south-west London. For the duration of the shoot – which saw two six-episode series filmed at the same time – A Thousand Blows built a fully functioning slice of Victorian London.“I’ll never forget walking on to that set for the first time, realising I could go into all the buildings,” Kirby says. “They built the pub, everything.” He was so taken with the atmosphere that he would often go to set on his day off to take even more of it in.Graham says he has only ever seen this scale and attention to detail on big-budget sets he’s worked on in the US, while Doherty adds that the mix of animals walking around the streets and muddy puddles covering her dresses with dirt almost removed the need to act. “We were just plonked in it and pressed play.”“I did feel we were doing something special,” Kirby says. “I’ve never been so excited by a job. Usually, I’m terrified that I’m going to have to find a cave to hide in after I’ve finished filming something.”That does seem unnecessary, given that the 35-year-old’s CV includes the lead role of Kunta Kinte in the 2016 remake of Roots, the Black Mirror episode Men Against Fire, and the Mangrove episode of Steve McQueen’s 2020 anthology Small Axe, which won him a Bafta for his portrayal of the racial justice campaigner Darcus Howe.View image in fullscreenLeader of thieves ... Erin Doherty as Mary Carr.Photograph: Disney+“Honestly,” he says, “I genuinely think that if something I’m in comes out, I’m not going to work again. I was depressed after I watched myself in Small Axe. I’ve just accepted that I’m never going to see myself like an audience does. I’m always going to look at it through the perspective of whatever it is that’s going on in my head. But with A Thousand Blows, I felt butterflies throughout the entire process.”The show was co-produced by Matriarch Productions, the company Graham and his wife, Hannah Walters, founded (they are both executive producers of A Thousand Blows, along with Knight andDavid Olusoga, among others). Graham says they go out of their way to ensure a “no twats” policy on set.“I’m just going to be honest, there are a lot of twats in this industry, do you know what I mean?” he says, sounding more scouse as he relaxes into our conversation. “There are loads of egos and I really don’t like that. The industry should have changed and with the ethos of our little company we are trying to move it in the right direction. I want people to skip to work.”The cast did what research they could on the real-life history of their characters. Details are sketchy – in Hezekiah’s case, complicated by the fact that he went by numerous names – but there is a startling photograph of the real Moscow, fists held high, that formed a great deal of Kirby’s understanding. The existence of the photograph, an expensive item in the late 19th century, suggests that he was a man of a certain standing, while newspaper cuttings of his boxing bouts hint at a formidable talent.Graham felt the weight of history when his character’s great-great-granddaughter visited the set with her daughtersIn the case of Mary Carr, there is a little more to discern, but Doherty says she tried to ignore certain facts. “It just forms a backbone. Like I know she was arrested for a certain crime on a certain date,” she says, “and I know the Elephants carried out this heist on this date. I found it very freeing having these little bits of information, then it was up to me to flesh it out.”Graham felt the weight of history when Goodson’s great-great-granddaughter visited the set with her daughters. “They had a look round and I met them,” he says. “She couldn’t really tell us anything about him, but I felt the connection, and that meant I have an obligation to try to play him as honestly as I possibly can.”A Thousand Blows may be set in the late 19th century, but its central themes are just as familiar in 2025. Themes such as race, gender, class, poverty and migration drive the drama, although its approach is nuanced. For example, in the opening episode at least, no one mentions the colour of Hezekiah’s skin, so much so that viewers may wonder if this is going to be a colour-blind cast period drama.“There was excitement about being in a show set in the 1800s and playing a black man from Jamaica that hasn’t got chains on him and is not a servant,” says Kirby. “You don’t really see that a lot. He’s a dreamer, which does not mean he’s just a young man dreaming of becoming a lion tamer.”View image in fullscreenA time of divisions … Doherty and Graham.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney+“This was one of the key elements Steve [Knight] wanted to get across,” Graham says. “We have this perception that there weren’t many black people in London in those days, and if there were, they were enslaved, or being exploited. But Steve is so fastidious with his research, and he learned that it wasn’t so much ethnicity that divided people in the East End, but class.”Away from their fights in the ring, Sugar and Hezekiah’s interactions allude to them having overcome similar hardships a continent apart. The show suggests that if they weren’t such foes, the characters might be firm friends. Sugar, Graham says, “sees Hezekiah as an equal, but he’s fearful” – that his status as king of the ring is under threat. “That’s where racism really lies, in the deep insecurities that the racist person has.”I ask if they took any mementoes from the set after shooting wrapped. Doherty said there is something special that she wants to keep once she’s done playing Mary, a ring that looks like an heirloom. As much as she thought about taking it home, she ultimately decided not to tempt fate, while waiting to see whether there will be a series three and four.Kirby says he stopped keeping items of his characters’ clothing some time ago as it was becoming “unhealthy” and leaving him unable to detach from the role. Instead, he opted to retain a characteristic of Hezekiah’s. “I took his fight. It was something that I personally needed at the time.”Graham was given an image by the set designers drawn in the style of a Victorian boxing poster, but with his face rather than the real Sugar. “I turned 50 when we were on this job” – he’s now 51 – “so they made the poster and every single person signed it …” he trails off, tears forming in his eyes. Blushes and tears in the space of an hour – talk about range. “Why am I getting like this?” he says, laughing. “So that’s now hanging in my den. It means a lot. It’s a very special thing.”A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ on 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevisionStephen GrahamDisney+Peaky BlindersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, she says, it’s time this under-appreciated art received proper recognitionLyndsey WinshipTue 18 Feb 2025 10.53 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 13.59 ESTShareEllen Kane is on a roll. When we speak, the choreographer and movement director has two shows running,Ballet Shoesat the National Theatre, andNatasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812at the Donmar. She has just finished Why Am I So Single?, the follow-up from the writers of Six, the smash hit about Henry VIII’s wives, and she’s in rehearsals for the revival of Dear England, James Graham’s funny and stirring depiction of Gareth Southgate’s tenure as England manager. If you watched all those shows in a row, you would have no idea the same person had a hand in them all, such is the art of the movement director, a job that many may not even realise exists. But it’s an essential one.“Outside actually directing a scene, everything that moves on the stage is usually done by me,” says Kane, chatting backstage at the National. That means any dance, obviously, but also scene transitions, characters getting from A to B, and working with actors on how they connect with the audience. She helps make visible a character’s emotional experience. “So that we, the audience, can feel it,” she says. “I love to feel. I can watch something and appreciate it, ‘Oh that’s beautiful.’ But do I leave moved?”What is striking about those shows is how caught up audiences are in their energy – and part of Kane’s job is to shape that energetic arc, to make sitting in the theatre a visceral experience, as well as an intellectual one. In Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 the characters are at crisis point, tackling love, infidelity and the meaning of life. “Huge topics of human existence,” says Kane, “so the vibration of the person dealing with those things is large, right? We’re not just going to tell you about it, because that’s not how we live those experiences.” She doesn’t work by giving the performers exercises or moves to do, but by dissecting the text. “I adore finding the right energy for each beat, the sharp turns and corners you can take.”View image in fullscreen‘There are not many working-class people at this level. Now there will be even fewer’ … Ellen Kane.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianOnDear England, one daunting job was to help actors morph into well-known footballers. Kane didn’t work much with Joseph Fiennes on his impressive Gareth Southgate. “Joe did that himself,” she says (Gwilym Lee will take on the mantle in the revival). But to hone the squad – Harry Kane, Harry Maguire, Marcus Rashford et al – she and co-movement director Hannes Langolf studied hours and hours of footage of the players, analysing mannerisms and tics. She brought in footballer Lee Dixon to teach them about penalties, drills and formations, and absorbed all of that into the show, generating the spirit of a match without ever passing a ball.“Rupert Goold, the director, is a huge fan of football and he said, ‘Let’s bring in the ball.’ And I was like, ‘Ooh, that’s so dodge!’” She laughs and cringes. “Because you’ll never replicate the real thing. If there’s no ball, all they can feel is the tension in the situation, and our job is to heighten the tension.”Choreography in theatre and film is an underappreciated art. Alongside movement director Polly Bennett, Kane is working with Equity to set up a choreographers’ network and tackle their low profile in the industry. “You know,” she says, “why aren’t there Oscars for choreography? Why aren’t there Baftas? Why aren’t we being credited?” Kane’s work on the film ofMatilda the Musicalis all over social media, for example (sample comments: “The choreography for Matilda is AMAZING”; “THIS MUSICAL WAS TOO SICK YALL GOTTA WATCH IT”), but her name is rarely attached. They are wrangling with IMDb over getting a proper credit on films, rather than being lost among the “additional crew” at the bottom of the page.View image in fullscreen‘I love to feel. I can watch something and appreciate it. But do I leave moved?’ … Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812.Photograph: Johan PerssonNot that Kane is out for glory. She’s just passionate about what she does, even if she never really planned this career. Growing up in (pre-gentrification) Hackney, London, there was the odd after-school dance class and a randomly chosen dance GCSE, but when dancers from Lewisham College came to perform at her school, she recalls: “I was just so moved by it. I was, like, ‘I’ve got to do that!’”She went to Lewisham, which in the 1990s ran an inspiring dance course, full of late starters who’d never done a ballet class, many of whom have gone on to influential careers. That course is no more, and Kane laments that the decimation of the arts in schools will leave no pathway for others like her to get into the industry. “There are not many working-class people at this level. Now there will be even fewer. How do we get there if there is no exposure, no access?” You can’t argue it’s a superfluous subject, she says. “Dance changed the trajectory of my life. It has to be valid.”When she went into dance training, Kane was adamant she would never do musical theatre. She performed contemporary dance with Richard Alston’s company and others. But she began choreographing as assistant to Peter Darling on Billy Elliot, and now at 50 she’s really hitting her stride, with two big musicals coming up, Nanny McPhee andPaddington. “I’m just loving my life,” she says, “and grateful that I’m given the opportunity to make these stories come alive.”Ballet Shoes is at the National Theatre, London, until 22 February; Dear England, is at the same venue,10 March-24 May.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreDanceMusicalsNational TheatreAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While it didn’t make the UK charts, the album earned critical acclaim and a dedicated audience on streaming, drawn to its examination of race, mental health and working-class life in north-west London.Bashy originally broke through in 2007 with Black Boys, an anthem for racial pride that celebrated successful peers like Dizzee Rascal and Kano while rejecting stereotypes about young Black men: “No we ain’t hooligans / Just young and talented nubians.” He released his debut album, Catch Me If You Can, in 2009, and while there were handful of mixtapes in the following years, it took until 2024 for him to release a follow-up album.Bashy: Made in Britain – videoIn between, he has had a successful acting career, with roles in TV shows such as Top Boy, Them and 24: Legacy, and films such as Brotherhood and the Oscar-winning short Skin.Another artist with two awards at the Mobos, held this year at Newcastle’s Utilita Arena, was British-Nigerian vocalist Darkoo, who won best female act and song of the year, for Favourite Girl. She continues to build on the early success of 2019 hit Gangsta and a No 1 in 2021 as part of the multi-MC remix of Tion Wayne and Russ Millions’ drill hit Body. Favourite Girl has racked up tens of millions of streams both in its original and a remix with Nigerian star Rema, and other recent songs such as Focus On Me (All the Sexy Girls in the Club) and the Davido-featuring Right Now have been performing well.Also with two wins was Odeal, who picked up best newcomer and best R&B/soul artist, after winning a major following for his heart-on-sleeve vocal style. The singer was originally born in Germany and raised across Nigeria and Spain before settling in the UK, and put out a steady stream of music in 2024 including the EP Sunday at Zuri’s and the mini-album Lustropolis, featuring a collaboration with US star Summer Walker.Darkoo (feat Dess Dior): Favourite Girl – videoNigerian singerAyra Starralso picked up two in the overseas categories, for best African music act and best international act.Central Cee was named best male act, following the release of his long-awaited debut albumCan’t Rush Greatness, which cemented him as the most popular UK rapper globally – it reached No 1 in the UK but also No 9 in the US, an unusually high placing there for a UK MC. In the other rap categories, Scorcher won best grime act and Pozer picked up best drill act.Elsewhere at the ceremony, which featured live performances from Bashy, Darkoo, Odeal, Pozer and more, former Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis was given the Paving the Way award. The Impact award was given toVybz Kartel, the dancehall vocalist who last year was released from a Jamaican prison after 13 years, after his sentence for a murder – which he consistently denied – was quashed.Mobo awards 2025: full list of winnersBest male act: Central CeeBest female act: DarkooBest newcomer: OdealAlbum of the year: Bashy – Being Poor Is ExpensiveSong of the year: Darkoo – Favourite Girl (ft Dess Dior)Video of the year: Mnelia – My Man (directed by Femi Bello)Best hip-hop act: BashyBest grime act: ScorcherBest drill act: PozerBest R&B/soul act: OdealBest media personality: 90s Baby ShowBest African music act: Ayra StarrBest performance in a TV show/film: Jacob Anderson as Louis in Interview With the VampireBest electronic/dance music act: TshaBest gospel act: AnnatoriaBest jazz act: Ezra CollectiveBest producer: JulsBest Caribbean music act: ShenseeaBest alternative music act: Alt Blk EraBest international act: Ayra StarrMOBO Paving the Way award: Denise LewisMOBO Impact award: Vybz KartelExplore more on these topicsMobosAwards and prizesRapHip-hopR&BPop and rockGrimenewsShareReuse this content"

His ease and aptitude on stage is evident here yet he is still a revelation, lighting up this play about a king’s misrule and downfall. As the less performed opening of Shakespeare’s history quartet of “Henriads”, it is an exploration of power, reflecting on the superannuated concept of a king’s divine rule and its unseating after a rebellion by exiled cousin, Henry Bullingbrook.Nicholas Hytner, as director, smooths away most of the play’s creakiness with a pared-down production that has the pace and intrigue of a thriller. It is muscular in its look and Bailey singularly shines, his luminosity putting the others slightly in the shade.He is a whimsical monarch, puffed up and explosive in his tempers, snorting cocaine and, with a shrug, signing over John of Gaunt’s wealth to himself on his uncle’s deathbed. Yet still you feel for him as he speaks of his absolute, divine entitlement, even as Bullingbrook aims his artillery gun at him. In his panicked, deposed state, he is a self-mythologiser – Jesus to Bullingbrook’s Judas.View image in fullscreenRoyal kiss … Olivia Popica as Queen Isabel and Bailey in Richard II.Photograph: Manuel HarlanA play with abundant beauty to its verse (“This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,” sighs the ailing Gaunt, played efficiently by Martin Carroll), its lyricism becomes slightly muted, though never by Bailey, whose words glitter with feeling. Royce Pierreson’s Bullingbrook is a man of action but you do not get beneath his skin. Phoenix Di Sebastiani, as the allegedly traitorous Mowbray, is spirited,while Christopher Osikanlu Colquhoun as the Earl of Northumberland bears gravitas.A modern-dress production, men in suits look like bankers or accountants overseeing a corporate tyranny in Richard’s court, carrying paperwork and strategising in the bar.There is potent physicality at the start, amid the soulless bureaucracy. Richard squares up to others, nose to nose (you wonder if Bailey will go in for a kiss, likeDavid Tennant’s Richard in 2013) but there are only swaggering face-offs.Bob Crowley’s set design has a gestural opulence, with dangling chandeliers, but it stays minimal, with a single element such as a bed or table arrangement rising from below. The scene in which Richard is forced to renounce the throne is turned into a legal inquiry, he the defendant in a modern courtroom. Bruno Poet’s lighting creates much of the effects, such as the blasts of battle and the shadow of Richard’s prison bars at Pomfret Castle.View image in fullscreenAmanda Root as Duchess of York and Vinnie Heaven as the Duke of Aumerle in Richard II.Photograph: Manuel HarlanIf the grip of the first half of the production slightly loosens by the second, it remains engaging. The background music, coming on to heighten moments, has the generic sound of a film score, and the near empty stage now leaves the drama slightly more unmoored.The final image of Richard in a body bag is stark and powerful, setting the scene for the violence to come, with the crowned Henry swearing repentance. A Shakespearean cliffhanger, of sorts.AtBridge theatre, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreRichard IIWilliam ShakespeareJonathan BaileyNicholas HytnerreviewsShareReuse this content"

How The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’s score was stitched back together for its first releaseA soundtrack of wildlife, drones and saucepans ensured the 1974 film became truly horrifying. Its co-creator recalls the can-do spirit that made it happenAlex DellerTue 18 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 16.22 ESTShareThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre arrived much like its hulking antihero, Leatherface: without warning and with a sickening blow to the skulls of unsuspecting audiences. Despite its bare-bones production and lack of actual gore, the 1974 movie carved a new path for horror film-making, and key elements were the eerie sound design and abstract score: perfect matches for the film’s red-raw storytelling and stark imagery. But despite its enduring influence, the soundtrack has never had an official release until now.Put out by Waxwork Records, it has been painstakingly stitched together – rather like Leatherface’s horrific mask – from the original recordings, and it is startling: a cloying series of drones, scrapes, clanks and groans that draw a jagged line to genres like industrial, noise, dark ambient andmusique concrète. “We really wanted the mind of the viewer to do some of the work rather than it being ‘here’s the Leatherface theme,’” says Wayne Bell, now 73, who originally composed it with director Tobe Hooper. “We loved the idea that our score tested the edge between sound and music. That boundary was a wonderful place to hang out.”As well as the score, Bell was part of the team who captured the film’s on-set sound, and created the incidental sounds that fuelled the film’s dread-filled atmosphere. “The low-budget films I worked on in the beginning were all up-from-the-bootstraps, shoestring kind of stuff where we had to improvise and be inventive,” he says from his Texas home. “I’m glad I came up that way.”By the time he started working on Chain Saw aged 21, Bell already had form: he had worked on Hooper’s warped hippie flick Eggshells and a hit radio show, and sound and music were part of his upbringing. His father was an accomplished fiddle player; “There was piano in the house and I was expected to learn how to play it, which I sort of did,” Bell says drily. “It was a core aesthetic: music is valuable. Your life is less without it. It established music as an important part of your environment as opposed to just sound that comes out of the radio.” Bell’s father had lost his sight early in life, and during family TV time Bell became attuned to the relationship between sound and image. “If the music, dialogue and sound effects didn’t make clear what was happening, he’d want to know,” says Bell. “So I tuned in to what the soundtrack is telling you – and when it’s not telling you anything.”Bell met Hooper in the summer of 1969, through a friend who was working on a film about folk act Peter, Paul and Mary. “Tobe was co-owner of a film production company,” says Bell. “I graduated from high school on a Friday and was in at this film studio the next Monday – the first thing I did was paint the walls.” Bell had been experimenting with recording and editing sound since middle school, and Hooper noted his abilities during Eggshells’ all-hands-on-deck production. This made Bell a natural choice for Hooper’s next feature, which initially laboured under the working title Head Cheese.Having worked with Ted Nicolaou (later a horror director himself) to capture Chain Saw’s live sound, Bell joined Hooper in post-production, creating a library of sound effects: creaking doors, caved-in skulls and pig squeals, the latter provided by Bell’s father. “At a certain point Tobe said, ‘You know, we could do the score ourselves,’” recalls Bell. “There wasn’t the money to hire musicians or a composer, so it was kind of, ‘No solution? No problem!’”View image in fullscreenOn set for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974, with Wayne Bell furthest right, holding a directional ‘shotgun’ microphone.Photograph: courtesy of Tim Harden/TCMBell assembled a grab-bag of equipment: cymbals, a much-tormented upright bass and a lap-steel guitar, as well as wildlife calls, toy instruments and a saucepan courtesy of Hooper’s then-girlfriend, Paulette Gochnour (whose spare room also served as a makeshift studio). Despite a musical education encompassing everything from opera and Latin jazz to the 13th Floor Elevators, Bell says there were no specific guidelines for the soundtrack, not even the avant garde composers it is somewhat reminiscent of. “I was aware of John Cage, Stockhausen and 12-tone serialism but that wasn’t on my mind at all,” he says. “Playfulness and a willingness to try odd stuff were the only real relations between us and Stockhausen. We weren’t thinking of ourselves in that mode, just that abstraction would work for the film.”True to its shoestring budget, the final film was completed on the fly with only Hooper able to attend the sound mixing in California. Hooper died in 2017 and the final assemblage was lost.The newly released soundtrack is “rebuilt from the original parts”, says Bell. “There were hours and hours of recordings, so it was difficult. Plus there was a lot of self-imposed pressure – I really wanted this to be what Chain Saw fans want to hear.”After Chain Saw, Bell’s career spanned sound, composition and voice work for film, TV and radio. He collaborated with Richard Linklater, produced a radio documentary on US politician Barbara Jordan and oversaw the session that became Stevie Ray Vaughan’s In the Beginning live album.“I’ve got this wonderful body of work and the one thing that people remember is Chain Saw,” Bell muses. “The fact that it’s beloved still baffles me a little. It used to baffle me alot.”The Texas Chain Saw Massacre original motion picture score is released 7 March on Waxwork Records.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicThe Texas Chainsaw MassacreHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The backlash lasted years: ‘I thought they’d never stop hating me’Though she didn’t support the president, the performance nearly destroyed her career. Not so for Snoop Dogg in 2025Andrew LawrenceTue 18 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 10.34 ESTShareThe Grammy-winning singer Chrisette Michele keeps her phone switched off, a habit that stems from her long stint in cancellation purgatory. Her brother barely got through last month to relay the news that Snoop Dogg had been DJing at a party for Donald Trump’s second inaugural, and many in the Black community were irate. Longtime fans were calling Snoop a sellout, she learned, and were unfollowing him online by thehundreds of thousands.Snoop remained defiant in the face of this controversy, which really peeved the hordes who well remember when Snoop was regulating Maga support in the music industry. That defiance “was the thing that resonated with me”, says Michele when I initially reach her the week after Trump’s second inauguration. “We live in a different era where you can say what you think and not feel like you might die.”In 2017, Michele performed at a Trump inauguration in a shocking break from the music industry’s anti-Maga stance. She was met with considerable backlash from fans and from industry peers including Questlove, the Roots drummer and Tonight Show bandleader. Despite Michele’s extensive success working with rappers Nas and Jay-Z, the decision to perform for Trump cost her future gigs and more opportunities to collaborate with industry heavyweights.Now thatsomemusic stars have hopped on the Maga bandwagon, she can’t help reflecting on the price she paid for making the worst decision of her career. “I just remember sitting in a hotel lobby next to my manager, who was my husband of two years at the time, in tears, thinking, ‘Maybe I’ll just become a professor,’” she recalls. “The constant gnawing and chewing and shouting at me was so difficult.”You wonder if the outcome might have been different if Michele had a catalog to rival Snoop’s, or even a song as big as Drop It Like It’s Hot. A native of Long Island, New York, Michele, now 42, came to prominence during the neo soul movement of the mid-noughties, following Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and India Arie. Michele’s satin voice, jazzy vibes and overall versatility made her a sought-after hip-hop balladeer by everyone from the Roots to Rick Ross – the latter of whom appeared at last month’s inaugural Crypto Ball alongside Snoop and Soulja Boy. In 2009, Michele earned a performance Grammy for her third single, Be OK, which also featured will.i.am. All the while Michele remained open about the pressures she felt around her body image, becoming a champion of the #BlackGirlMagic movement.View image in fullscreenSnoop Dogg performs in Los Angeles in December.Photograph: Frank Micelotta/Picturegroup/Rex/ShutterstockMichele didn’t enter the political arena; it landed on her in 2014, when Michelle Obama turned up for one of her shows outside Washington DC. She was not Michelle Obama that night, Michele recalls, “she was my homegirl. She came backstage and asked for a selfie with her mom and her aunt. She wore pink lipstick – like, happy, girlie pink lipstick. She knew all the words. She was a fan.”In 2016 Barack Obama added If I Have My Way, a groovy ballad from Michele’s debut album, to his summer playlist. Michele sang for the president at that year’s Democratic national convention and at his final White House state dinner, when the Obamas hosted Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. She takes patriotic duty seriously and eagerly. “When it comes to singing overseas for the troops or at the DNC, I don’t take it for granted,” says Michele. “I’m proud to be an American, always have been since I was a kid – and that’s a very difficult thing to say as a Black woman.”When Trump’s team invited her to perform at a 2017 inauguration event, Michele accepted – somewhat naively, as it turns out. She doesn’t support or particularly like the guy and was aware of the potential career ramifications. But she saw the gig as an opportunity to confront Trump and see if he kept the same racist, misogynistic energy in person. Even though there seemed to be some cover on the inauguration event’s performance lineup, which also included the gospel music stars Travis Greene and Tina Campbell (of Mary Mary fame), Michele, because of her more mainstream appeal, became the focus. Michele’s longtime supporters begged her to reconsider the gig. In response to reports that she was receiving at least $250,000 for her appearance – the true fee was closer to $75,000 – Questlove and Talib Kweli, both former collaborators of Michele’s, volunteered to pay hernotto perform – which hurt. “Honestly, I had to stop paying attention after a while,” she says.The music industry was in no mood to party with Trump when he ran in 2016. Eminem openly criticized his policies. Queen’s Brian May condemned his use of We Are the Champions at the Republican national convention. Elton John turned down an invitation to perform at his 2017 inauguration. But few artists were as stridently anti-Trump as Snoop, a social justice advocate who once characterized the gang violence he grew up around in Los Angeles as a trickle-down effect of Ronald Reagan’s economic policies. Snoop set the rules of engagement, pre-emptively denouncing the Black artists who would perform for Trump’s inaugural as “Uncle Toms” and “jigaboos” – derogatory terms that insinuate a deeper racial betrayal. His 2017 music video for the song Lavender, a heavy-handed Trump allegory, features a society of clowns that is ruled by a character named Ronald Klump, whom he shoots with a toy gun. The video outraged Marco Rubio and other Maga Republicans and had Trump musing about the reaction Snoop might have gotten if he had made a similar video about Barack Obama.View image in fullscreenChrisette Michele backstage in Georgia in 2022.Photograph: Prince Williams/WireImageBut Snoop’s tune changed in 2021 after Trump pardoned Michael “Harry-O” Harris, co-founder of the Death Row Records label that launched Snoop’s music career. (Harris had been serving a 25-years-to-life sentence for drug trafficking and attempted murder.) “I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump,”Snoop said last year. “He has done only great things for me.”At the Crypto Ball, Snoop was photographed throwing up hand signs with Bo Loudon, a young Maga influencer who is close with Barron Trump; Loudon captioned the picture: “Welcome to Maga, Snoop!” The endorsement effectively consolidated Snoop’s metamorphosis from Murder Was the Case gangsta rapper to ubiquitous pitchman to all-American mascot. Reacting to the Crypto Ball gig, The View’s Ana Navarro likened Snoop to a “trained seal”. Other rappers who have performed for Trump have suffered backlash even as Carrie Underwood and other music industry standard-bearers have capitulated to Maga. (After Nelly performed at a separate inauguration event, the administrator of a popular Instagram page dedicated to his wife, the R&B singer Ashanti, stepped down, citing disappointment with the Hot in Herre rapper – who is also unapologetic.)Michele processed the scenes of Snoop with Rick Ross and Soulja Boy at last month’s inauguration ball with wonder. “My initial reaction was, ‘Isn’t it nice to see Black men dancing in America so unapologetically?’” she says. When she faced criticism for her own performance, “I guess I wasn’t so masculine in my way of saying, ‘You don’t get to tell me what to do,’” she adds. “I just did what I thought was right. I didn’t shout at anybody and tell them not to say what they think.”In the main, the reputational damage to these men has been mostly cosmetic. For Snoop, the controversy has simply presented yet another occasion for him to play the part of America’s lovable scamp. Weeks after raising hackles at the inauguration event, he was back on stage for the NFL’s year-end awards show and for a television PSA that ran during the Super Bowl calling on viewers to “stand up to hate,”reigniting criticism of his inauguration appearance. Michele remembers arriving at a Super Bowl party at the Fountainebleau resort in Las Vegas as the ad was airing. “I’m still processing that commercial,” she jokes.Sometimes Michele thinks an overtly militant defense might have shortened her time in purgatory. “That was the most uncomfortable realization,” she says. “Like, if I’m not shouting and throwing my fist in the air, then it’s quite possible that I get ignored because I’m Black and soft. Look at Amber Rose. She spoke at the RNC, people were hard on her – and she just said, ‘Screw you,’ with that big, beautiful smile on her face. And people just backed up. The funny thing is: I don’t agree with her! I just watched it like, ‘OK, girl …’”Michele hoped to make a statement throughthe inauguration performance itself, but her messages were mixed. She sang a gospel song called Intentional, which calls for an unwavering belief in a divine plan – an argument evangelicals use to justify Trump support. She wore a maxi skirt replete with images of Black torture and subjugation by Jean-Michele Basquiat. In the end Trump didn’t make the performance, and she never got to meet him. By the time she walked off stage after the four-minute gig, “the death threats were starting,” Michele says. “I was afraid.”She thought she could make them stop if she just took a moment to explain herself – although, she admits, her first instinct was “to be completely silent and just go somewhere and mind my business for four years”. In an open letter pushed on social media, she said she intended her performance to serve as a “bridge” between Trump supporters and opponents. During an appearance on the Breakfast Club, Michele emphasized her Basquiat skirt again while reviewing the other rebellious nuances of her performance. But her attempts at subtlety were ultimately lost on the masses. “That was me overanalyzing everything, overthinking everything,” she says. “Because my parents are teachers, I want everybody to understand all the angles. My shouting came from insecurity, from needing people to believe that I did this for the right reasons.”By then the blowback against Michele was already fierce and unrelenting. She was dropped by her record label and by Spike Lee – who had one of her songs, Black Girl Magic, slated for the Netflix reboot of She’s Gotta Have It. Industry friends kept their distance. Her marriage eventually fell apart under the strain. The sneaker preacher Jamal Bryant called for a boycott of her music. He’d later apologize, but Trump’s camp never reached out to check on her. “Can you put a note in there asking them to reach out to Chrisette?” she asks me, laughing. “My team is waiting on a follow-up phone call.”View image in fullscreenChrisette Michele performs a song for the Obamas, Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, and Madam Ho Ching at the White House in 2016.Photograph: Getty ImagesBut it was the constant stream of death threats coming through her phone that really pushed Michele into depression and suicidal ideation. “We had security guards at my hotel doors,” says Michele, who also recalls being heckled on stage. “I wasn’t going to the grocery store by myself for years.” In October 2017 she shared that the fallout from her inauguration performance had caused her to suffer a miscarriage – and was further vilified for punctuating the news with a picture that was not ofheractual miscarriage. “That was me at my most panicked, the point where I came close to doing anything to get people just to be nice to me for one second,” she says. “I thought people were never going to stop hating me. I didn’t think this would go on foryears.”In a 2018 Facebook post, a year into Trump’s first term and just before the midterm elections, Michele posted a picture of herself between the Obamas and the Singaporean prime minister at the state dinner while calling on voters to rebalance the scales. (“When I look back at this moment it reminds me of what this country’s leadership should look like,” she wrote. “Diplomacy. Civility. Compassion. Love. Integrity. Gangsters don’t run this country. The people do.”) But it just became a reason for critics to come at her harder.Michele started treating her phone like a landline, switching it on every now and then for friends and family. “As a person in the public space, you think it’s your job to be connected all the time,” she says. “But it’s incredibly easy to disconnect.”But even as Black America disavowed Michele, many industry peers rallied around her. “Anita Baker was very vocal about making sure I had her number and about calling her if I needed anything,” she recalls. “India Arie did an entire interview explaining how I should be spoken to as a person, pulled me backstage and shook [the sense back into] me.

These are the people who really wanted to make sure that I knew they were there for me.”She carried on quietly for years – performing around the country and even launching a podcast called Inner Peace Examination, dedicated to self-reflection – until a curious thing happened: the political winds shifted. Trump stormed back from his 2020 defeat to win re-election, this time with backing from tech billionaires. Corporate America rushed to scrap its DEI programs in a fit of anticipatory obedience. Just last month Obama and Trump were observed chatting warmly to each other while sitting together at Jimmy Carter’s state funeral – as if they hadn’t been mortal enemies for the past 17 years.Ultimately, Michele wishes she could have been like Snoop and told her critics to kiss off, and she also wishes she had never taken the inauguration gig in the first place. It’s another nuanced position that could threaten her ongoing career recovery and land her in hot water all over again – but at least now Michele knows she’s built for tough times. “For about four or five years, I hated the wordresilient,” she says, “because it meant I got cancelled and got back up. But now I embrace it because it means you kept going, and people stuck with you and you’re here now.”Explore more on these topicsMusicDonald Trump inaugurationSnoop DoggDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But might the sonic update be a wise move?Stuart HeritageTue 18 Feb 2025 06.46 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 06.48 ESTShareThe second season of The White Lotuswas so rapturously receivedthat the third was always going to be a big deal. The new cast is probably the best yet, HBO has been carefully stoking the flames of anticipation since August and early reviews have beenpositively vibrating with praise. For a moment there, it felt like The White Lotus could do no wrong.Then it actually began and all hell broke loose. The problem? The theme tune. In seasons one and two, The White Lotus had the best theme tune on television.Aloha!, Cristobal Tapia de Veer’s season one title music, was a beguiling mix of tribal drums and a form of vocalisation that lived somewhere between throat singing and gargling. Season two’s theme song miraculously managed to improve on the formula, remixing the vocal melody into a trackthat was simultaneously more operatic and clubbythan the first. The theme tune won an Emmy. It was such a banger that Peloton instructors started playing it in class; you could never say that of something like Homeland.And yet the wheels have now apparently come off. As Sunday’s season three premiere aired, viewers realised that there was a new theme tune, and it wasn’t as good as the last two. Inevitably, Redditors took to their keyboards to express their undying outrage. “Not to be dramatic, but the new theme song has quite literally ruined my whole weekend,” whined one user. “My disappointment is immeasurable,” yelped another. X, meanwhile, reacted to the new theme tune with gifs of (in no particular order) a toddler throwing a tantrum, Kate Hudson being held back during an argument, Mr Blobby flapping his arms dejectedly on a staircase and Jennifer Coolidge looking stunned. Which, you have to admit, is a hilarious way to react to a show about dangerously entitled westerners who struggle to adapt when presented with a new experience.Which isn’t to say that it’s a bad theme tune. Once again composed by Tapia de Veer, the track could only have been scored forThe White Lotus. It’s percussive and weird, this time led by what sounds like an accordion, full of handclaps that build to a vaguely ravey climax. However, it is noticeably darker in tone to the previous scores, underlaid with an ominous hum. And then there’s the biggest crime of all: it’s fairly difficult to sing along to.As well written and acted as seasons one and two were, the main thrill of The White Lotus was joining in with the vocal line of the theme tune, which you could do by sticking out your tongue and waggling it from side to side as you sang. If you got it right, which took time, you ended up sounding a bit like thegoat from the Taylor Swift memesuffering from a terminal bout of hiccups. Which is cool, right? It’s impossible to dislike a show that just made you involuntarily warble with your tongue out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So if you’re a detractor, I get your point.However, I must disagree. First, changing the theme tune is probably good for the show’s longevity. The White Lotus is a drama with a schematic so well-worn – tourists go on holiday, tourists are awful, one ends up dead – that diminishing returns will undoubtedly creep in unless something is done to mix it up a bit. A new theme tune is a sign that the show is prepared to create unpopular opinions to secure its own future, which is encouraging. Also, Mike White has long said that the overarching theme of this season is death, so it makes sense for the theme tune to pull back on the whimsy a little. Perhaps, had he kept the tongue waggling, it would have been too jarring for the meat of the show itself.Last, and this forms part of my grand unified theory of the show, The White Lotus is and always has been a cumulative experience. Every season starts slowly, and builds to a point of abject lunacy. In season one it was a man pooping in a suitcase, in season two it was the fate of Jennifer Coolidge, and season three’s remains to be seen – but, if we know the show, it’s bound to be ridiculous and explosive.Either way, early on in each run, people complain that The White Lotus has lost its edge. It hasn’t. It just trusts viewers to be patient enough to wait for the good stuff. The same goes for the theme tune. It might be strange and jarring to hear something new at first, but give it time. Two months from now, I guarantee that you won’t be able to get the thing out of your head.The White Lotus season three is on Sky Atlantic in the UK and HBO in the US, and is on Foxtel and Binge in Australia.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Completely absurd, subversive and never, ever boring, it still deserves to be in the discussionTim JonzeTue 18 Feb 2025 05.22 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2025 09.15 ESTShareEmilia Pérez, then. It’s the film set in Mexico that angered a whole load of Mexicans. The film with a transgender lead that offended many trans viewers. And the film that was tipped to scoop up a bag load of Oscars – a whopping 13 nominations! – before everything came crashing down around revelations that the aforementioned lead had made some truly hideous comments on social media several years ago.From Academy darling to toxic mess nobody wants to touch with a 10-foot statuette in the space of one short Oscars campaign. And now you expectme– a white cis male who has never even been to Mexico – to tell you why Emilia Pérez should win the award for best picture? There’ve been easier gigs.Do I think that Emilia Pérez is the best film to come out in the last 12 months? Well, not exactly, no. But is it the wildest, bravest, silliest film? The one loaded with the most moments where you gasp “You can’t dothat!” at the screen? Almost certainly. It is, after all, a musical revolving around a cartel leader who undergoes gender reassignment surgery in order to escape a violent past. There are choreographed dance moves around a chorus of “Man to woman/From penis to vagina” and an impassioned duet between a lawyer who was enlisted to make this all happen and the transphobic Israeli surgeon who agrees to do it. And that’s just the first half hour. Pretty soon, said cartel leader is living a new life as the titular Emilia, now looking after her kids as their aunt and living with former wife Jessi, all of them in the dark that this was once their murderous druglord husband and father. “I didn’t want it to be true to life,” said directorJacques Audiardin the promotional Netflix material. Ha ha, you can say that again Jacques!Culture over the past decade has been so heavily guided by sensitive discussions around who gets to tell what story, that Audiard bowling up and riding roughshod over these new norms is tin-eared but also weirdly subversive. Set in Mexico but filmed in Paris? Telling a trans story through a cis writer? Audiard is asking us to consider if authenticity is the only thing that matters in storytelling.‘They chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her’: has the Emilia Pérez backlash gone too far?Read moreBefore the backlash there was a whole load of praise for Emilia Pérez and truly there is a lot to enjoy: in just over two hours the story encompasses film noir, telenovela, musical, melodrama and comedy (the extent of which is intentional I have no idea). It aims to tell a positive story about transitioning on the biggest of canvases. It is wildly inventive and ambitious. It is completely absurd and never, ever boring.The film reminded me of two other artistic statements in recent pop culture. Firstly, the novel Detransition, Baby, in which the author Torrey Peters also gleefully barrelled over the understandable tentativeness that has emerged around discussing trans experiences. The difference, of course, is that Peters is a trans woman with lived experience and not a 72-year-old straight white male. And yet I couldn’t help but note that some of the things Emilia Pérez has been criticised for – such as depicting latent male aggression rearing up in Emilia – were also explored in Detransition, Baby.The film also brought to mind Yorgos Lanthimos’s riotousPoor Things, another man’s taboo-breaking take on the female experience. (And it should be noted that Emilia Pérez looks at womanhood from many angles – the frustrated lawyer Rita watching a man take all the credit for her work, the beaten and raped wife hoping that her husband has been murdered.) Defenders of Poor Things argued that we should not discount the creative input of lead actor Emma Stone. Can that argument not be extended, to some extent, to the cast of Emilia Pérez? After all, a trans woman read the script, identified with and helped make this film what it is.All of these thoughts get tossed into the hot, messy brew that is Emilia Pérez, a wild, compelling mix of the divine and the ugly. The songs (written by French singer Camille) are beautiful, the lyrics clunky. The pace electrifying, but the frantic genre-jumping jarring. The musical elements are at times ludicrously inappropriate, at others weaved into the story with impressive subtlety. The message is both heartwarming – the desire to become who you really are, the quest for redemption – and clumsy. I watched it through all the emotions – and sometimes through my fingers. Why not throw caution to the wind and let this auteur’s reckless, radical statement triumph as best picture? After all, one thing is certain: there will never have been a winner quite like it.Explore more on these topicsFilmBest picture Oscar hustingsEmilia PérezAwards and prizesKarla Sofía GascónJacques AudiardfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the UK, where it is being distributed by Focus and Universal, its current total is $3.2m (£2.5m). Rest of the world earnings to date stand at around $13.4m (£10.6m) for a global gross of $31.1m (£24.7m).On his show, Maron pressed Corbet for clarification about payment for the film, to which he replied: “Yes. Actually, zero. We had to just sort of live off of a paycheck from three years ago.”A number of his lauded peers were in a similar predicament, said Corbet. “I’ve spoken to many film-makers that have the films that are nominated this year that can’t pay their rent. I mean, that’s a real thing.”Directors, he said, were not paid to promote their films, although distributors are believed to fund their expenses. “If you look at certain films that premiered in Cannes,” said Corbet, “that was almost a year ago … I mean, our film premiered in September. So I’ve been doing this for six months. And had zero income because I don’t have any time to go to work. I can’t even take a writing job at the moment.”Anora, Sean Baker’s sex worker romance, whichwon best casting and the best actress awardfor Mikey Madison at Sunday’s Baftas, took the Palme d’Or at Cannes last May. That film, which had a $6m (£4.8m) budget, has so far made $34.6m (£27.5m) worldwide.Corbet went on describe the press circuit as “a six-month interrogation,” and said he had taken part in 90 interviews over the past week.“It’s seven days a week,” he said. “It’s boundless. It’s constant travel, and you’re also working Saturdays and Sundays. I haven’t had a day off since the Christmas break, and that was also only four days.”Of the eight films other than Anora and The Brutalist nominated for the best picture Oscar this year, two have been blockbusters:Dune: Part Two, which took $714.6m (£567.1) from a $190m (£151m) budget, and Wicked, whose budget was $145m (£115m) and has so far taken $725m (£575.4m) – but is still showing at cinemas.Three others have commanded respectable box office earnings: Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown ($99m from a $65m budget), Conclave ($95.5 from a $20m budget) and The Substance ($77m from a $17.5m budget).Meanwhile Emilia Pérez is on $15m from a $22m budget, but enjoyed only a limited theatrical run before moving to Netflix, while Nickel Boys has charted a significant loss, making just $2.5m back of its $23.2m spend.Brazilian drama I’m Still Here is released in the UK this week but some time ago became the highest-grossing Brazilian film since Covid, making $25.4m from its $1.5m budget.As the heir of bank Itaú Unibanco, director Walter Salles is the second wealthiest film-maker in the world, after George Lucas, with an estimated personal fortune of $5.3bn.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe BrutalistFilm industryPodcastsnewsShareReuse this content"

But speaking on Hollywood Reporter’spodcast Awards Chatter, the actor said he was now attempting to be franker about his co-star’s alleged behaviour.“I just try to be more honest about it now and call it for what it is,” said Pearce, saying that he “broke down and sobbed” once he achieved more clarity on what had happened.But Pearce sought to minimise his distress compared with that of others who allegedly had more troubling experiences, saying: “Even though I probably was a victim to a degree, I was certainly not a victim by any means to the extent that other people have been to sexual predators.”He continued: “But I did that thing that you do where you brush it off and go, ‘Ah, that’s nothing. Ah, no, that’s nothing.’ And I did that for five months. And, really, I was sort of scared of Kevin because he’s quite an aggressive man. He’s extremely charming and brilliant at what he does – really impressive, etc. He holds a room remarkably. But I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.”Pearce said that through the film’s production in Hollywood, the only moments in which he felt “safe” were when Spacey’s attention was focused on another actor, Simon Baker.Once “things came to light in 2017”, said Pearce, he reassessed his times with Spacey and raised them with him, saying he subsequently “had a couple of confrontations with Kevin” that “got ugly”.Pearce’s rethink was precipitated by the accusations, made by the actor Anthony Rapp, that Spacey made sexual advances at a party in New York in 1986 when he was 14. Numerous other accusations followed.“I heard these stories about Kevin, sort of officially as news stories,” said Pearce. “And I was in London working on something, and I heard [the reports] and I broke down and sobbed, and I couldn’t stop. I think it really sort of dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had sort of either shelved it or blocked it out, or whatever. That was a really incredible wake-up call.”Of his appearance on an Australian talk show shortly afterwards, Pearce said: “I just blurted it all out. And of course then it all hit the press. I’m sort of in that weird position of going, ‘I don’t want all the focus on this. I don’t want it. But at the same time I don’t want him to get away with what he gets away with.’” He added, “I just try to be more honest about it now and call it for what it is.”Spacey was legallycleared of misconductand, respectively, sexual assault, in separate trials in the US and the UK and successfully defended himself against a lawsuit brought by Rapp.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People were crying – a lot of them live week to week; they might only have £10 left before their next pay.”The collapse of Royal Stafford, the latest in a long line of ceramics companies in Staffordshire to either close down or reduce capacity in recent years, has prompted calls for action to protect the industry.David Williams, the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, said: “It’s the pots that really made the city what it is; it’s in our DNA as a people, and the idea that we can lose the industry if we don’t put the measures in place to support it, is not OK.”Last week, the prime minister said the issue was not just one of jobs, but a “question of identity and a sense of place”, and that he would work with energy companies to try to improve the situation.View image in fullscreenThe Royal Stafford factory after its closure.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn the countryside of the village of Barlaston, a few miles south of Stoke-on-Trent, a steady stream of tourists file through the doors of the World of Wedgwood, a homage to the fine-china manufacturer founded by the potter and entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood in 1759.It is one of the biggest and most iconic brands in the area, and two decades ago, about 600 peopled worked in the factory. Now there are 75 producing about a third of the company’s output – 60% is made in Indonesia.“Made inEnglandis extremely important,” said Sjoerd Leeflang, Wedgwood’s vice-president. “But it’s tough to have UK production; costs are just very high. Since 2021, our energy prices have gone up 100% for gas and 30% for electricity … To absorb that level of cost increase is tough.“It’s very important to keep the craftsmanship alive. I see it as our role to protect the heritage of Wedgwood, which is important for the local economy but also the UK as a whole.“You can replace me, that’s easy; it’s much more difficult to replace a potter who has been trained.”View image in fullscreenSjoerd Leeflang at the Wedgwood factory.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAs well as rising costs, there is concern about who will become the future workers of these ceramics factories, with fewer young people developing the skills needed to take over the roles.Jon Plant is a co-founder of Moorland Pottery, which he set up in 1987 after struggling to find work in the first downturn of pottery plants in Stoke-on-Trent. He said: “We need to think about what opportunities we’re giving young people who come through …Perhaps their parents or uncles and aunties worked in [ceramics], and they’ve seen them all be made redundant. It’s seen as being on its way out.”He said rising energy bills had squeezed their business, but thought the picture was much more complicated than businesses being pushed to closure by high costs; he said innovation was key, and they had found success by specialising in bespoke and personalised mugs.“I would say there’s absolutely a future for the ceramics industry in Stoke. There’s some people doing incredible things, working and thriving here. But it can’t be as it has been. We can’t go back,” he said.View image in fullscreenJon Plant at Moorland Pottery in Burslem.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianRob Flello, the chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation and a former Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent South, said the ceramics industry was now much more widespread, and diverse, than the traditional potteries of Staffordshire.“There is a bit of a perception problem that ceramics equals gift and tableware equals Stoke-on-Trent,” he said. A “perfect storm” of high energy costs, cheaper imports and the cost of living crisis was pushing factories to the brink, he added.“We have seen over the last 30 years a decline in some pottery manufacturers. As we’ve seen in the glass industry and the steel industry, they are a fraction of what they were a decade ago or more,” he said. “But [ceramics] has a really strong potential future. We just need the government to stop hammering it and help it.”As Stoke-on-Trent celebrates the 100th anniversary of its city status, which was granted because of its importance as the centre of the pottery industry, many will be looking at what the future holds for the factories once so integral to the lifeblood of the area.“We’re proud to be the Potters, but it’s all going,” said Morley. “If it was the steel industry or the car industry, you’d hear more about it. But we’re no different. We’re still workers. And everyone needs a cup, a teapot, a plate to eat off at home.”Explore more on these topicsStaffordshireCeramicsJob lossesEnglandHeritagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, for its first visit to the Wigmore Hall in London, the Vienna-based chamber orchestra brought two programmes that focused on what was new a century ago, when, on either side of the first world war, the Austrian capital was the epicentre of modernism in music.In the second of Klangforum’s concerts, though, only the work that ended the concert,Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunairetruly belonged to that revolutionary movement. The first half had been made up of pieces by composers who were very much watchers from the sidelines of modernism, who borrowed some of its tendencies without fully embracing them.View image in fullscreenKaziboni at the Wigmore.Photograph: Wigmore HallFranz Schreker’sstrange little “dance allegory” Der Wind, for a quintet of clarinet, horn, piano and strings, from 1909, parades some strikingly original colours alongside moments of pure romantic kitsch, whileHanns Eisler’sDivertimento for wind quintet, composed in 1923 while he was still studying with Schoenberg, was one of the first works to adopt his teacher’s newly formulated 12-note technique, yet could almost be a lighter-weight, wittier version of Schoenberg’s own wind quintet. There was alsoBusoni’sBerceuse Elégiaque, in an arrangement for chamber orchestra that Erwin Stein made for Schoenberg’s Society for Private Music Performances, and which involved all 12 Klangforum players in reproducing the lusciously honeyed textures.Vimbayi Kaziboniconducted the Busoni, and also took charge of Pierrot Lunaire, in which the soloist was the mezzo-sopranoBarbara Kozelj, whose wonderfully lucid delivery of the text favoured thegesangend of theSprechgesangspectrum. The odd touch of winsomeness aside, her performance was wonderfully assured but not at all theatrical.The most vivid imagery came from the ensemble, especially the cellist Andreas Lindenbaum, who added real sepulchral gloom to the eighth movement, Nacht, and led off the grotesquerie in the 16th, Gemeinheit! (Atrocity). But all five instrumentalists ensured that every fleck of colour in Schoenberg’s feverish score registered, so that for once music and words seemed perfectly fused, just as they should be in what is one of the great precursors of late 20th-century music theatre.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

But despite the transformative subject matter, Ellen McDougall’s production has as much propulsion as a car in reverse.Skins actor Kaya Scodelario plays Lena, a former Mennonite and gifted coder, who is wrestling with the expanding consciousness of Logos, the software her company has developed. We meet her as she is preparing to be questioned by the workplace bigwigs who watch her from the upper level of Alex Eales’s two-tiered sciene-inspired set as if she is a caged animal. Lena and her lover, Sasha (Luke Treadaway) are being investigated after a security breach. For a fleeting second, the tension in McDougall’s direction is sky-high.But, that’s as far as East Is South goes in terms of sparking anxiety. Willimon’s writing is weighty and thick. There are references to religion, love, abuse and deceit, and the play attempts to answer the big, complicated question of what makes something human. But the pace of the drama slows and sags.Scodelario does her best with a soulless role and at one point she looks believably on the verge of tears. But the language of the play is peculiar. The romantic scenes between Lena and Sasha have no heat; the pair stand awkwardly beside each other as if they’re meeting for the first time. The interview scenes are void of any fire. If Willimon hoped to use his play to show AI as a potential threat to humanity, his scenes would need to have more fear sewn in.The risks Logos presents are nothing new; we already know that AI’s power is multiplying by the day, and that if this continues, it could possibly become free-thinking. All the emotional and moral issues Willimon poses feel well-trodden and are laid out plainly in his script.In 2025, there is an abundance of plays about technological advances, including the considerably more fascinatingMore Lifeover at the Royal Court. Next to such works East Is South seems unnecessary and uninspired. If you’re looking to be freshly frightened by AI’s perils in a drama, perhaps go to another theatre, elsewhere.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 15 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageArtificial intelligence (AI)TheatreHampstead theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The pianist Evgeny Kissin – last yearlabelled a “foreign agent” by the Kremlin – is commemorating the half century by immersing himself in Shostakovich’s chamber music.Kissin the piano soloist has been always technically dazzling and usually loud, so Kissin the chamber musician came as something of a revelation. Here was a true collaborative pianist – never just an accompanist, and often the dominant voice, yet always sensitive and supportive. In the wartime Piano Trio No 2 he took care not to overwhelm the two string players even though Gidon Kremer’s violin playing, so crisp in the hurtling second movement, often felt underpowered. At the beginning of the third movement, though, Kissin let loose a series of chiming chords, the ringing intensity of each seeming to grow rather than recede. It was a world away from the unearthly, barely-there harmonics from Giedrė Dirvanauskaitė’s cello with which the performance had begun – these two moments that outlined the parameters of a work of huge scope.The evening had started with a rare chance to hear the Four Verses of Captain Lebyadkin, setting words spoken by one of Dostoevsky’s more insufferable characters. Kissin gave the piano part plenty of character, but nothing could have upstaged the bassAlexander Roslavets, whose vivid delivery of words and assumption of the self-important captain’s character made each of the songs feel like a mini operatic scene.The Four Verses, premiered in 1975, was Shostakovich’s penultimate work; his swansong was his Viola Sonata, for which Kissin was joined by Maxim Rysanov, who spun long melodic lines that just kept on going. In the second movement, a nervy dance, Rysanov and Kissin built up waves of tension that Rysanov released as if bursting through a pressure valve. The final movement, with its obvious allusions to Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata and its less obvious quotes from all of Shostakovich’s symphonies, felt truly valedictory, the last words of a composer whose anger at injustice fired him to the end.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicDmitri ShostakovichreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox), a single mother, is summoned to her basement by the ringing of a bell. A barely glimpsed monster with a lugubrious but threatening voice demands that she feed him. They engage in a dialogue from which we infer this is something of a long-term dynamic, with the grim beast nibbling from her arm on a regular basis. She tells him she’ll need to go to the hospital if this carries on much longer; the abusive relationship parallels are not accidental. This monster is dangerous, but he’s also a parasite, standing in contrast to the horror genre’s typical one-munch-and-you’re-done type beast.Unfortunately, from this point on the drama sags. Fox’s performance is top-notch, but there are a number of plot points that don’t really stack up. That might not matter in a loopier story-world, but Little Bites is a horror movie where everything is fairly grounded, other than the actual creature. Chief among the dud notes is the unlikely idea that Child Protective Services would so aggressively hunt down a single mother on the flimsy grounds given here (seemingly amounting to the fact that Mindy’s child is staying with her grandmother).This kind of writing is frustrating, because it feels like another round of script drafts could have fixed things. Surely there is an opportunity for more insidious monster-related problems that give the legitimate appearance of something very wrong at home, such that horror icon Barbara Crampton, who plays the CPS officer, would have no choice but to plausibly intervene.The flaws are a shame because the casting is fabulous, including Crampton (Re-Animator), Chaz Bono (American Horror Story), and Heather Langenkamp (A Nightmare on Elm Street). Luckily, despite the narrative issues, the tension picks up again as the film oozes towards its climax. What could have been a real contender with a few relatively minor tweaks is still a serviceable morsel for those with the right kind of appetite.Little Bites is on Shudder and AMC+ from 21 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Johnson’s own debts to Shirley Jackson and Stephen King are acknowledged in the film with a quote from The Haunting of Hill House, “No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality”, and a visual quote from The Shining. It’s made in a style clearly influenced by the Greek new wave in which Labed made her name in films such as Attenberg and Alps.There’s an awful lot to grab the attention here: a story of an intense sisterly bond in a private shared world, a lot of set-pieces, big performances, dysfunctional violence and a hallucination involving lemurs. And yet I felt it didn’t really come together; this is an international coproduction in which something is lost in translation. The action takes place in Oxford and Yorkshire in the book; in the film it apparently starts somewhere in the UK as there is a preponderance of English accents (certainly among the main characters) although one scene is evidently set in the National College of Art and Design in Dublin. Then the action moves to rural Ireland with Irish accents.September (Pascale Kann) and July (Mia Tharia) are teen sisters born 10 months apart to Sheela (Rakhee Thakrar) an artist and photographer and now a single mum, who has perhaps encouraged their strangeness by posing them for weird portraits. Dominating, charismatic September holds submissive July under her spell, summoning her with a whistle; July has to steady herself by staring at her finger. The two girls are brutally bullied at school and September responds with violence; when she is excluded, Sheela takes them to their grandma’s cottage on the Irish coast and things become very strange.This is a movie that strains and contorts for its effects; the performances are strong – strong enough to carry the big twist – and Labed might have absorbedAgnieszka Smoczynska’s comparable film The Silent Twins, although that was unselfconscious and heartfelt in a way that this isn’t. It’s a film that feels actorly rather than real.September Says is in UK cinemas from 21 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsDaisy JohnsonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Emma is sick with a neurological condition that leaves her crushed by fatigue, prone to blackouts, unable to work. Hers is a disease “without concrete evidence, without affirmative scans or validated cause”, and she is constantly having to justify herself to her family – her mother, cruel stepfather Peter, stepsister and daughter – with whom she shares a tiny council house. “Everyone has their limits of what they can tolerate. It turns out that they couldn’t take me being ill. I can’t stand their lack of care. Why wouldn’t I become angry?” says Emma. When she falls for her handsome neighbour Adam, a doctor, her vague plans to get rid of Peter start to take shape – particularly when she learns more about Adam’s wife, Celeste, and the trouble Adam is in. “My illness doesn’t mean that I have to be relegated to a supporting role, the background character who dies at the end or fades away. I can even be the villain if I want to.” Bridges, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2020, writes in an author note that he had had enough of the “tired tropes” around sickness in fiction, from the “sickly sweet ill woman”, to the unwell person who is shown to be a fraud.Sick to Deathturns these tropes on their head: Emma is a force to be reckoned with, and although the plot does become increasingly tangled, this is deliciously dark and twisted, and a lot of fun.Fun is also at the heart of CL Pattison’sFirst to Fall(Headline) – if you’re prepared to suspend your disbelief and just enjoy this tale of murderous figure skaters. We open with a newspaper report about deaths “at the home of legendary German figure skater, Lukas Wolff” during an extreme blizzard. Wolff, we’re told, is famous “for a spectacular sequence of skating moves called ‘the Grim Reaper’”. Our heroine is Libby, a promising but poor young skater who jumps at the chance to go to Wolff’s training camp in the Bavarian forest. Wolff puts Libby and her fellow trainees through their paces, a harsh but brilliant taskmaster, until the blizzard descends, the mobile reception goes, and Libby’s fellow skaters start dying. Pattison is a great writer, Libby a brave and brilliant character, and it turns out that reading about tricky skating moves is more fun than I’d anticipated. Throw in a corker of an escape down an icy river and you’ve got yourself a winner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lauren arrives to pick up her daughter from university. It’s the longest she’s ever been apart from Evie – 10 weeks – but she was excited for her daughter to venture out into the world, “safe, shallow waters before the open ocean”. But Evie isn’t in the room where Lauren dropped her off; another student lives there. She isn’t answering her phone. No one seems to know who Evie is; everything’s being shut down for Christmas. And then a university official tells Lauren that Evie withdrew from her course more than a month ago. The police, and university, aren’t too worried: not everyone wants their parents to know where they are, and Evie is an adult. But “I know Evie would not have just disappeared from her life. Would not have missed a family Christmas, her little brother’s birthday, a chance to catch up with her friends from home.” So Lauren begins investigating Evie’s disappearance herself. Sometimes an excellent premise like this doesn’t quite deliver when it comes to the payoff. Here, Logan juggles a large number of narrative threads to explain what’s happened to Evie, and just about keeps them in check for an explosively enjoyable finale.There is another fabulous premise, and another dark female protagonist, in Snæbjörn Arngrímsson’sOne True Word(Pushkin Vertigo). I mean, who among us hasn’t felt like abandoning their partner on a deserted island for the night when they’ve been super annoying all day? That’s what plays out in this Icelandic thriller, in which Júlía does exactly that to her husband, Gíó, driving off in a temper in a motor boat to leave him alone in the middle of a freezing fjord in the midst of winter. When she has qualms a little later (“What had I done? What was I thinking?”), she motors back out to rescue him – but Gíó is gone. Júlía delays telling the police about his disappearance, and when she finally does, they don’t take it seriously until his coat is found on a beach. As suspicion builds about her actions, we start to realise there might be more to Júlía (and to Gíó’s disappearance) than she’s telling us. “Bread and water, a hard cot and a view between iron bars, that would be life for the foreseeable future,” she says as she’s questioned by police. “That is, if it’s a crime to temporarily abandon your deceitful husband on a deserted island.” A bestseller in Iceland,One True Wordis translated by Larissa Kyzer and is a lovely slice of icy winter chill.To orderSick to Death,First to Fall,The DaughterorOne True Word, click on the titles or go toguardianbookshop.com.

Here’s what to watch this eveningHollie Richardson,Nicole Vassell,Alexi DugginsandPhil HarrisonTue 18 Feb 2025 01.20 ESTShareStoryville: Gaucho Gaucho – Argentina’s Last Ranchers10pm, BBC FourThis black-and-white documentary is so artfully crafted by directors Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw that it feels more like a cinematic western drama. It follows the everyday lives of Argentina’s shrinking community of gauchos (cowboys and cowgirls) who preserve their traditions and fight to remain free in the modern world. There are no introductions or to-camera interviews, just mesmerising observations of cattle herding, family meals and horse-riding.Hollie RichardsonSort Your Life Out With Stacey Solomon8pm, BBC OneLeeds-based couple Ben and Lynda Brearley-Baird need a hand organising their three-bedroom home, which features mountains of useless items – including 619 pieces of wood. Stacey and her team of decluttering experts help them to let go of what they don’t need, giving them more play space for their young daughter.Nicole VassellThe Fear Clinic: Face Your Phobia8pm, Channel 4More clients are thrown in at the deep end to face their fears – starting with Jack, whose arachnophobia is tackled by confronting him with a creepy-crawly spider.

Smooth Donte, very smooth.Alexi DugginsThe Real Unforgotten9pm, ITV1In 1981, the body of 36-year-old Carol Morgan was discovered by her husband in the back of their convenience store in Linslade, Bedfordshire. Nobody was charged in relation to her death for decades. This two-parter, loosely inspired by the popular crime dramaUnforgotten, follows a police team’s six-year investigation into her cold case.HRMussolini: Son of the Century9pm, Sky AtlanticWith its talk of “the death of a century of democracy”, this drama about the rise of Benito Mussolini feels grimly timely. However, for all of his strong-arm tactics, this week the would-be dictator (a convincingly oily and sinister Luca Marinelli) is trying his hand at diplomacy, strategically courting parliament in order to subvert it.Phil HarrisonLive sportChampions LeaguefootballBayern Munich v Celtic, 8pm, Prime Video.The playoff second-leg tie.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Most women have come alone, though you wouldn’t know it.This weekend is a collaboration between two outdoor adventure companies: women’s trail running and hillwalking specialistGirls on Hills, andThe Adventure Syndicate, a trio of epic cyclists who put on madcap events on two wheels throughout the year. Both organisations frequently partner with Hostelling Scotland, and we’re staying at the newly reopenedBraemar Youth Hostel. Adding to the fun is yoga teacher Lindsay Warrack, and a hired sauna from Stravaig Saunas set up in the woods outside the hostel.‘It’s all about the camaraderie and getting to meet like-minded women. It’s very supportive and there’s a lot of peer learning.’Girls on Hills was launched in Glencoe in 2018 by outdoor instructors Keri Wallace and Nancy Kennedy as a way to address the gender disparity in trail running. Starting with just a couple of weekend courses, in 2023 the company delivered 98 events for women across the UK. Wallace says that since the pandemic there has been an increased demand for courses that include a social element.“It’s become a really big part of what we do,” she says, “it’s all about the camaraderie and getting to meet like-minded women. It’s very relaxed, sociable and supportive, and there’s a lot of peer learning.”View image in fullscreenA hostel makes a great base for the weekend.Hostels make great bases as they are cost effective and have a community-minded set up, say both companies (and Hostelling Scotland reports a real shift in its customer demographic, with more women using them for outdoor adventures). Braemar proves perfect for our gathering with an expansive catering kitchen, two dining areas and a big living room that’s nicer than many hotels. The excellent drying room makes light work of piles of wet shoes and soggy waterproofs.At the Hostel Hoolie, participants choose which activities to take part in, including morning yoga, full days’ hillwalking, trail running, or cycling, and evening sessions in the sauna. Everything is optional. On the first night there’s a meeting to learn about the activities and sign up. Walk leader Jess Williams says of her route: “It’s going to be wild, and we might not see anything.” Cycle leader, and the Adventure Syndicate founder, Lee Craigie makes similar promises: “It’ll be wet and cold and a wee bit grim in places.” The enthusiasm in the room remains undimmed.We cheer each other on as we take turns to dunk in the icy tin bath outsideThe dormitories are clean and warm with a mix of bunk beds and single beds. I bag a bunk in the smallest (sharing with only two others – the largest sleeps eight) tucked into the eaves of this former hunting lodge and sleep surprisingly well. The next morning after a yoga class I join the guided trail run, beginning with a session on winter kit and decision-making before we head out (key takeaways are the importance of navigation skills and having a plan to keep warm if someone gets injured – as well as plenty of snacks). From Braemar it’s a short distance to Linn of Dee where our 12km route winds through the native pinewoods of Mar Lodge Estate, snowy mountain tops sometimes visible between the trees. At the snow line we pull microspikes over our trainers and practise running up and down icy slopes, learning safe winter descending techniques. There’s a wide range of experience in the group, from ultra-marathon veterans to near beginners. The pace is relaxed and chatty, and the only race is for a seat by the fire at the bothy lunch stop.View image in fullscreenCycling through the snowy forest.Night falls early so the evenings are long and unhurried. There’s a strong presence in the local pub, Farquharson’s, with a fierce Connect 4 challenge. At the hostel, soup putters on the stove and new friends stretch out in front of the fire, with wine, books and knitting. In the sauna, the conversation is about strength training, triathlons and massage, and cheering each other on as we take turns to dunk in the icy tin bath outside. Stories are swapped of the different days’ activities, and future plans and routes are plotted.We’re challenging the notion that you start to fall off a cliff edge in your 30s, and post-menopause you’re invisible to societyAlice Lemkes, the Adventure SyndicateOver the course of the weekend I try things I’d typically shy away from, partner yoga for one, working together to ease into deep stretches, any qualms about personal space long discarded (I loved it). I also find myself taking an icy river dip with swim coach Penny Clay, the momentum of spirited women spurring me on, fuelled by joy and camaraderie.The increased demand for all-female community events is not about a lack of drive, Wallace is keen to stress. “It’s not all ‘girls just want to have fun’,” she says. “Women want to do hard things, we want to push ourselves.” The Adventure Syndicate’s co-director Alice Lemkes agrees: “Women want to challenge themselves, but it doesn’t have to always be within the traditional model of competition. We create an environment in which women can push their comfort zones and set new boundaries around their limits and their confidence.”View image in fullscreenAn evening in the local pub, with a Connect 4 challenge.The biggest growth area in the outdoors industry is women in their late 30s onwards, they report. While hillwalking, climbing and running are still mainly marketed to young people, both companies say their trips appeal to women who are a bit older and desperate to get out there and meet like-minded individuals.“We’re challenging the notion that you start to fall off a cliff edge in your 30s, and post-menopause you’re just invisible to society,” says Lemkes. “We’re also hearing from women in their 60s and older who’ve never done anything like this before. That’s also a really exciting demographic. It’s a mindset shift.Wild women: the rise of all-female outdoor activity groupsRead more“When women get together in the outdoors, the energy is just so incredible,” she adds. “It’s a lovely, positive, reinforcing loop. We want more of it, it’s so nourishing.”She’s right, I think, as a weekend packed with adventure, fun and community draws to a close. I definitely do want to come back for more.The trip was provided byHostelling Scotland,Girls on HillsandThe Adventure Syndicate.

When charred, cabbage develops a smoky depth that makes this soup wonderfully rich and comforting. In Spain, cabbage and chorizo have long been a winning combination found in all manner of hearty stews and rustic dishes. The addition of white beans not only makes this soup more satisfying and filling, but also gives it a gorgeous, creamy texture that helps to balance all the smoky notes going on. This is a simple and honest dish that’s full of warmth and great flavours.Smoky cabbage and white bean soup with crisp chorizo and paprika oilPrep15 minCook35 minServes4-61 savoy cabbage, cut into 8 wedges2 tbsp olive oilSalt andblack pepper175g cured chorizo, chopped into little cubes1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced4-5 sprigs fresh oregano1 tsp sweet smoked paprika½ tsp hot smoked paprika400g red-skinned potatoes, peeled and cut into 1cm pieces1½ litres chicken stock, or vegetable stock600g jar white beans, drained and rinsedFor the paprika oil3 tbsp olive oil½ tsp sweet smoked paprikaPut a large, heavy-based frying pan on a medium-high heat.

What can I do with the leftovers?Happily, the warming sweetness of coconut milk is welcome in all the things you want to eat right now, sitting at home in your thermals (Curry! Soup!), meaning leftovers are no bad thing. When Mandy Yin, chef-owner ofSambal Shiokin north London, is faced with this same predicament, it usually means coconut rice: “It’s so straightforward, too: just replace half the water you’d need to cook the rice with coconut milk.” Otherwise, the excess milk could make an appearance in stews, even bolognese, or creamed spinach, she adds: “Replace the cream with coconut milk and a dash of fish sauce, and that’sreallydelicious.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Coconut milk is, of course, a fundamental ingredient in Sri Lankan cooking. “You’ll findkiri hodi, a coconut milk-based sauce infused with garlic, turmeric and pandan leaf, in 90% of kitchens in Sri Lanka,” says Eroshan Meewella, co-founder ofKolambain London, and he recommends you do the same. “The turmeric and garlic balance the quite creamy, quite sweet coconut milk, and it pairs beautifully with rice or crusty bread.”Another way to work through what’s left in the tin is soup, especially if butternut squash or lentils are on the agenda. “You can jazz up a shop-bought one by melting coconut oil in a pan, then frying tempering spices [curry leaves, red chilli, mustard seeds, fenugreek] for a few minutes, and stirring that into the hot soup,” saysKaran Gokani, director ofHoppersin London. That will make it “nice and spicy”, then go in with a splash of coconut milk to mellow out proceedings to taste.Try this recipe and many more coconut-themed inspirations on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.And, of course, there are also curries. For a simple yet satisfying week night meal, Yin’s formula goes like this: “Blitz onions and chilli powder, then fry that down, and add coconut milk, cabbage, carrots, green beans or whatever vegetables you have.”Saiphin Moore, co-founder ofRosa’s Thai, meanwhile, leans towards a red curry, orchu chi. “Fry curry paste until it’s fragrant, then add half a can of coconut milk and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and cook until the mix turns deep red and the oil separates from the coconut milk.” Fry some fish – “salmon or sea bass works well” – then drizzle with the sauce. And if prawns are more your thing, Arun Tilka, executive chef atDishoom, heats mustard seeds, curry leaves, fresh ginger (julienned) and slit green chillies in oil. “Add chopped red onions, saute until translucent, then stir in powdered spices [turmeric, coriander, red chilli].” Stir in some tomato puree followed by the prawns and, finally, coconut milk: “Bring all that to a boil, then finish with lime juice and chopped coriander.”Coconut milk isn’t solely for dinner, mind. “I use it instead of milk in porridge for a tropical feel,” says Yin, who tops cooked oats with chopped tinned pineapple and brown sugar. “If you don’t want it quite so coconutty, use half coconut milk and half milk.” The white stuff also adds depth to desserts: “Thick coconut milk with a bit of jaggery [palm sugar] and salt makes a nice, rich sauce to pour over cakes or jelly,” Gokani says.Alternatively, he, says, head to the bar: “Freeze leftover coconut milk in ice cube trays, ready to blend into cocktails.” Piña colada, anyone?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.
