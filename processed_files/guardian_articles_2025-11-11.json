Bywhata country values. And it turns out that what a country values can change over time. Sometimes, though, there’s a sort of cognitive delay between the country you think you are in, and the country you’ve actually become. For example, you can keep selling yourself, to foreigners, as the country ofWilliam Shakespeareand Jane Austen, and luring busloads of tourists to Stratford-upon-Avon and Bath, and put a statue of George Orwell in front of the BBC, and imagine yourself a cultured and literate nation, which the rest of the world admires for its devotion to the written word – but if you then chronically underfund your cultural institutions, and treat your cultural workers with contempt, many people will suspect you of being full of it. And as the decades pass – and fewer and fewer Shakespeares and Austens and Orwells emerge from your little island – even more people will begin to suspect that in truth you do not value culture at all, and are in fact running a giant heritage museum in which the only cultural workers you respect are the dead ones.The British Library is our great national home of cultural workers. We go there to read and research, to learn and to grow, to write and to think, to inspire and create. Facilitating our work is a great army of library staff, who are also cultural workers. Without them, the library does not function, the books do not get read, the culture does not come to pass. And how are they treated? According to their union,they are offered pay deals so dire that many of them work multiple jobs and live in substandard housing. Seventy one per cent of respondents to a union surveyfind their salary insufficient to meet basic needs. Some workers report mental and physical health deterioration as a consequence of these poverty wages. When a massive cyber-attack on the library results in a major disruption of the service they are able to offer, they’re left on the frontline, to be shouted at by the very patrons they are attempting to serve. And when they then try to ask for a pay increase that is at least in line with inflation, they are told there is no money, while some of the six-figure-salaried executives are eligible forfive-figure bonuses. One of the other things we used to think about this country was that it had a bone-deep sense of fairness. Does any of that sound fair?Above and beyond the executives themselves is the problem of this government, whose funding of the library has failed to keep pace with inflation. In fact, in the latest spending review afunding cut of 1.4%was levied on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Meanwhile, this same government has earmarked £2bn over the next four years for theAI Opportunities Action Plan. There is no doubt much justified excitement around AI – especially in the realm of medicine – but a healthy country needs healthy minds as much as healthy bodies. A country is also its culture. Even the AI productivity tool the government recently created for its civil servants iscalled Humphrey, a name borrowed from a 1970s TV show written by a human being, the scripts for which you will find in the British Library. That’s the thing about culture: it persists. Culture is what people pass down. It brings shared meaning into our lives. There’s a reason we’ve placed a statue of Orwell striding into the future outside the BBC, rather than any past or present chief executive of the BBC. And what is engraved on the wall of that same institution? An Orwell quote: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”One of the things this government doesn’t want to hear is that what defines a nation – in its own eyes and in the eyes of others – is, in the end, not the size and scope of its military hardware, or even the wealth it amasses, but the culture it creates. In other places they know this. In France they subsidise their bookshops. In Germany, libraries are plentiful and well-funded, no matter their size. In England one of the most famous libraries in the world is treated as an afterthought, an embarrassment. A white elephant nobody knows what to do with. A long time ago, a very great British writer sat in the British Library – which was then housed in the British Museum – writing a little book called A Room of One’s Own, which became one of the primary texts in a worldwide movement called feminism. Virginia Woolf wrote the following: “There is in the British Museum an enormous mind. Consider that Plato is there, cheek by jowl with Aristotle; and Shakespeare with Marlowe. This great mind is hoarded beyond the power of any single mind to possess it.”It is this “great mind” that is housed in this extraordinary library. It is the heritage of all peoples, British or not, but because it is after all theBritishLibrary, within its collections you will find a particularly enriching and gigantic British section. And if you really want to know a nation, and to experience its collective mind, instead of tying tatty flags to lamp-posts you might want to get thee to a library, any library, but especially the British Library. In there, you will find the nation’s books, its songs, its film and TV scripts, its plays, its dictionaries, its history, its geography and psychogeography, and so much more – a mind-boggling variety of material. You will learn a lot more about this country than can be expressed by a red cross on a white sheet, and a lot more about the whole wide world than an AI summary could ever give you. And it will be delivered to you by an army of overworked, underpaid, too-often verbally abused library staff, who deserve so much better from Britain, from their government, from the executives of the British Library, and from all of us.Zadie Smith is a novelist.

So how did the author turn his story into a tragic masterpiece?Tue 11 Nov 2025 12.49 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 12.57 ESTShareWhen we meet the morning afterthe announcement of this year’s Booker prize, David Szalay, the winner, seems an extremely genial and gentle author to have created one of the most morally ambiguous characters in recent contemporary fiction. His sixth novel, Flesh, about the rise and fall of a Hungarian immigrant to the UK, is unlike anything you have read before.Szalay (pronounced “Sol-oy”) is often described as “Hungarian-British”, but that has offended Canadians this morning, he says. His mother was Canadian and he was born in that country, where his Hungarian father had moved a few years earlier. “I’m arguably more Canadian than Hungarian.” Now 51, he grew up in England, graduated from Oxford University, and lived in Hungary for 15 years. To make things more confusing, he is over from Vienna, where he now lives with his wife and young son Jonathan.Brexit will cause very deep changes in the psychology of this countryFor many years, Szalay has been critically acclaimed as “a writers’ writer”. In 2013 he was named one of Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists. There was always a sense that he deserved to be better known. In the past 12 months, he has had a baby and won theBooker prize. “It’s not a year I’m gonna forget,” he says, his voice scratchy from lack of sleep and all the talking he’s already had to do this morning.Last night was not his first experience of the agonising Booker ceremony. In 2016 he was shortlisted forAll That Man Is, an interlinked collection of nine stories about men of different ages, from all over Europe, which provoked controversy as to whether it counted as a novel. It was a “very, very stressful evening” he says. This time he decided “to sort of hypnotise” himself into believing that he hadn’t won. “I maybe succeeded almost too well,” he says. “I was eerily calm – and then when it did indeed happen, I was slightly shocked.”Flesh was born of the failure of a novel he had been working on for four years. Partly this was due to the pressure of the attention that All That Man Is had received. Also: “the central concept was wrong.” Szalay had written 100,000 words before finally abandoning it. “There was an enormous feeling of relief, as well as trepidation that I now had to start with something else,” he says. “To abandon two books in quick succession would start to seem terminal.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d tried to hypnotise myself’…Szalay with Queen Camilla at a Booker prize reception yesterday.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/ReutersHe wanted to write a novel that straddled England and Hungary, to reflect his feelings of being “emotionally marooned between the two countries”. He also wanted to write about “the physicality of existence”, he says. “Obviously, it’s part of every story, but it’s very rarely prominent as an idea.” He opened a new Word document and gave it the working title Flesh. The title seemed very “unliterary”, he says, and it made his editor nervous. But in the end, they all agreed it suited the pervasive unease of the novel and its central preoccupation – the body.The unforgettable opening chapter came first, almost as a short story. Fifteen-year-old István is living in a new town on a Hungarian estate with his single mother. A 42-year-old neighbour seduces him and an altercation with her husband ends in disaster. “I would certainly read the second chapter,” Szalay says. “So I then thought, ‘How can we move this on?’”Move on it does, at speed. István spends time in a juvenile detention centre, then as part of the Hungarian army in the Iraq war. Both these experiences happen off stage. The next time we meet him he is working as a doorman for a club in London. He then gets a job as a chauffeur for a preposterously wealthy man. He becomes preposterously wealthy himself. To tell more would be to give too much away. A lot of things happen to István, most of them very bad. “I didn’t want to be a coward. I didn’t want to shirk, or to leave out things that were quite extreme,” he says. “Obviously it’s totally contemporary in its surface, but underneath that, I did conceive it as something akin to a Greek tragedy, in which the hero has to be thoroughly put through the wringer in order to reach his point of catharsis.” The reader is put through the wringer too.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve been as matter-of-fact as I can’.’Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianSzalay’s subject, honed over six novels and 15 years, is masculinity: what it means to be a man today, with an inevitable emphasis on sex, violence and money. In 2025, these are not obviously Booker-prize-winning themes. For years, writers were desperate to be anointed “the new Martin Amis”, but now it would be considered slightly shaming. As he said in his speech on Monday, Szalay knew he was writing a risky novel. “One of the risks I was taking was to write about sex from a very specifically male perspective, and to try to do that as honestly as possible.” We see István smoke and have sex. Sometimes he eats. “It’s very difficult, notoriously, to write about sex,” the author says. “I tried to write about it as matter-of-factly as possible.” Sex and anger, he explains, are largely “non-verbal experiences” – and often the most intense challenge for a novelist, as “you have to deal with everything verbally, unless you leave a blank page”.It’s akin to Greek tragedy. The hero has to be thoroughly put through the wringerIstván himself is almost a blank space on the page. We have no idea what he looks like, although women are all too ready to sleep with him. (This is his curse.) We don’t know what he thinks or why he does things – and neither, it seems, does he. He is a man of few words. Never has “OK” been deployed so often (about 500 times, apparently) or so meaningfully in a work of literary fiction. “It’s one of the main aspects of the characterisation,” Szalay says. “I very specifically didn’t want a character who unpacked themselves for the reader, either reliably or unreliably.” The result is a triumph of relentless exteriority and brutal realism, at once tragic and comic in its banality.Wary of the novel being “pigeonholed” as just a treatise on men, Szalay edited out most of the overt references to masculinity. “I hope that it’s about much more than that,” he says. “I hope the book is very emotionally impactful – and that only works if it feels very real to the reader.” He succeeds. It is a feat of authorial magic that he manages to make us care so deeply about a protagonist who is so unknowable that at a crucial moment of moral reckoning, we are uncertain how he will behave.For all the novel’s fixation on the body, István exists in a specific historical moment. Spanning roughly the author’s lifetime, the novel mentions external events, from the Iraq war to migration from eastern Europe to west, and up to the pandemic, to show how our lives are shaped by political and socioeconomic forces beyond our control. “The end of communism, Hungary joining the EU, those two things completely transformed life for Hungarians,” he says. “Brexit will cause very deep changes in the psychology of the UK.”Szalay is very happy to call himself a European novelist. Having spent most of his writing career in Hungary and now in Austria, he describes himself as a “literary hermit”. He doesn’t really speak German, he says, and isn’t part of any bookish scene. In previous interviews, it is possible to detect his frustration at the sameness of much contemporary fiction. Certainly, he has no time for the traditional form. “That sort of Russian novel that begins with the main character’s grandparents, and slowly works up to their birth about 200 pages in – that’s probably not my favourite sort,” he admits. “I prefer more compressed or concise novels, books that don’t tell you everything.”It is no surprise to learn that Ernest Hemingway and John Updike were favourites when he was growing up. “Virginia Woolf is an influence, too,” he says. “I read equally as many novels by women as by men.” He is already halfway through his next book, which “partly” involves a female perspective, he says laughing.He had planned to spend this day in London with his wife. Instead, she is returning to Vienna and their baby while he stays on to talk about masculinity. It is the first time they have left their son with other people (his aunts). “I think this is probably a good moment to do that,” Szalay says. Winning the Booker is surely a good excuse for calling in the babysitters. “I really didn’t know how people were going to take the book,” he says of his win. “I’m proud that it has connected with so many people.”Flesh by David Szalay is published by Vintage (£18.99).

How convenient for foes of the most trusted news organisation in the worldTue 11 Nov 2025 11.05 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 14.10 ESTShareListen, I hate to ruin ayarn wallbut I don’t think it’s at all helpful to start framing the current crisis at the BBC as a giant conspiracy or coup by dark rightwing forces, and get stuck in the weeds of that. The fact is, the three mistakes that form the bulk of Michael Prescott’s explosive leaked memo about impartiality – the Panorama edit, issues with coverage of the transgender issue and bias in the BBC Arabic service – happened and are bad. Given their spectacular fallout and the highest-level scalps that have been claimed, the opportunity to now deal with them might as well be taken by what is, let’s not forget, the most trusted news organisation in the world.There is no news organisation in the United States that reaches more than 25% of people in a week. BBC News reaches74% of UK adults in a week. There is vastly more distrust of news brands in the US. We in Britain live in a country with a far less polarised news market than almost anywhere else, in a world where 70% of people don’t even have a free press. This is great, whatever you might be told by Nigel Farage – a political leader who’s gunning to be the next PM but still presents a nightly current affairs show on GB News like that isn’t a massive conflict of interest and we live in Russia or something. Thanks for dialling in, Mr Ethics!Alas, he won’t stop dialling in on this BBC story. You might recall that when supporters of Donald Trump’s total lie that the 2020 election had been stolen from him stormed the Capitol, Nigel offered asingle autofill-style tweetof condemnation. Imagine having a mere nine words to offer on violent scenes which called into question the peaceful transfer of power in American democracy, but at least 9,000 to offer, so far, on a bad documentary edit for which a telly producer and editor should have been promptly fired.But we are where we are, and the BBC is in a place where the US president is threatening to sue it for aDr Evil-esque$1bn. Not here, I don’t think, although British libel laws have long favoured claimants. The former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar won in our libel courts over match-fixing and bribery claims, despite there being a video of him regretting accidentallymaking a savein which he said: “I dived the wrong way and it fucking hit my hand. In the Man United game, do you know how much I lost? A hundred and twenty-five fucking thousand pounds in cash.” As I say, Grobbelaar won this case.But British libel law is based on the notion that someone’s reputation has suffered material harm. Were Trump to sue the BBC in our courts, the US president’s case against would presumably be based on the notion that he – a convicted felon found guilty on 34 counts offalsifying business recordsin a hush money case; a civil case loserfound to have sexually abuseda womanand been ordered to pay her $83m – had reputational damage done to him by the editing of a clip in a documentary that aired in another country, which no one noticed at the time, shortly before he won a landslide presidential election victory. Righto. Along with the fact that this only came to light just after the one-year UK libel limit had elapsed, you’d assume this is why Trump’s counselishinting at suing in Florida.0:42‘We should have acted earlier’: BBC chair Samir Shah on Trump documentary – videoThe Florida courts are a different kettle of fish. Florida is where Trump’s former friend Jeffrey Epstein got his plea deal so he could serve 13 months in an open prison then be free to sex traffic and abuse underage girls for another decade. Then again, Florida was also where Rudy Giuliani was ordered to pay $148m afterlosing a defamation actionto two Georgia election watchers. Then again, again, Trump on Tuesday pardoned Giuliani and other cronies for their effortsto subvert the 2020 election. What an endlessly intriguing legal system they do have over there.As for over here – Donald, youdon’t even go here– it’s genuinely nuts to hear politicians and commentators honking about how the next director general of the BBC has to be some cleanskin from the world of business. Sorry, what person from “business”? Wake up. In the old days, the second a DG had been defenestrated, you’d see lists of deeply keen runners and riders, heavily briefed by those throwing their hats in the ring. This morning the papers contain scant, half-hearted rundowns of potential candidates who in many cases everyone already knows wouldn’t want the job. People in the private sector don’t have to live in the eye of the firestorm, every day, and they get paid vast multiples more money. The only comparable level of flak in public life to running the BBC, outside of politics, is copped by tech bosses. Tech bosses get paid billions, effectively own their own companies and demonstrably could not give a toss when called out by politicians, because they are so, so much more powerful than them. Just over a year ago, Meta overlord Mark Zuckerberg declared that his previous willingness to apologise for errors was a “political miscalculation” and a “20-year mistake”. Yeah, maybe we should get someone from the “I’m done saying sorry” sector to run the BBC. Feels like a great fit. I’m sure they’d do it!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With these resignations, it has given in | Jane MartinsonRead moreAs for whoshoulddo it … I don’t pick the next director general – a baffling oversight – but if I did, I’d try to persuadeMark Thompsonback for a second, maybe enticingly time-limited stint in the role he has previously held, at an organisation whose strength and weaknesses he would be tough and clear-sighted about. Think of it as a one-last-job movie, Mr Thompson. The next DG is probably going to have to have significant news experience, given the circumstances of this current crisis, as well as a deep understanding of the BBC from both the inside and the outside, as Thompson certainly has from his time there, then as CEO of the New York Times and now CNN. Furthermore, Thompson has, bless him, now earnedAmerican levels of money, so might consider coming back to be one of the few hardmen left who could take on public service in these rapidly enshittifying times.But as I say, more and more high-calibre people are picking a quiet life over public service. And it’s harder every day to seem surprised. Be you a potential British politician or director general, why would you want to live under constant attack by bad-faith rivals who wish you out of existence? Why would you want your permanent coordinates to be in the eye of trouble? Why would you want to be subject to endless threats of violence on social media platforms whose proprietors explicitly couldn’t care less? Why would you not simply … do something else, for massively more money?This, not events at theBBC, is the much more widespread crisis in public life. The BBC just makes it more obvious because it’s the last place anyone still resigns from. You almost never see politicians doing it any more – they wait to be sacked, or butch out the most awful mistakes, and get away with it because there aren’t legions of better people to replace them. More and more, the nature of high-profile public service is repelling the best and the brightest. That is the great tragedy of our age – and the great opportunity for those who were never in it to serve the public in the first place.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBBCOpinionDonald TrumpTim DavieNigel FarageMark ThompsoncommentShareReuse this content"

Still dripping wet, he threw on clothes, grabbed his dog and rushed to the truck. The pair made it 3 metres and no further.“The whole parking lot across the street was jammed up. It was complete gridlock within three minutes,” he says. “I thought, ‘Oh shit, this is not good.’”In the downtown core of Tofino, a town on Vancouver Island, there are no warning sirens. But word quickly spread that people were fleeing the beaches. Panicked parents rushed to pick up their children from day camps. Restaurants in the Canadian holiday haven emptied.View image in fullscreenJustin Goss says the town was gridlocked after the tsunami siren went off in July.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The Guardian“We told everyone to get out fast,” remembers Brenna MacPherson. “We didn’t know how bad it was going to be.” Some patrons settled up, others left bills unpaid. Some wandered the street with cocktails in hand.Residents of this small town have long been braced for a deadly tsunami. When – not if – a tectonic plate snaps upwards, the resulting energy will convert to a wave moving at the speed of an airliner. As it reaches shallow water, it will advance towards the shore at 20 miles an hour (32km/h) – slower than an elite sprinter – but swap speed for size. A wall of water 20 metres (65ft) high is possible when it finally reaches land.This summer, on 29 July, the powerful but distantKamchatka earthquakein Russia that triggered sirens in Tofino amounted to little more than an eventual swell against the coast when the wave finally arrived hours later. Still, the false alarm forced residents to confront the town’s precarious geography – and an old question: how do you prepare for a disaster whose timing is completely unknown?Tofino is a sliver of thick forest flanked by miles of beach that absorbs the full catalogue of the Pacific’s unpredictable moods. It is connected to the rest of Vancouver Island – to food, medicine and fuel – by a single highway riddled with steep gradients, hairpin turns and rockslides.View image in fullscreenMeares Island is Tofino’s main source of drinking water.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianRoughly 60 miles (100km) offshore, the Juan de Fuca plate slides beneath the North American plate – a slow-motion collision where pressure builds over centuries. When it finally slips, it unleashes a “megathrust” quake. Similar ruptures have struck19 times over in the past 10,000 years– the last in 1700, when 600 miles of seafloor dropped 20 metres and a massive wave radiated in all directions.The disaster was captured in the oral history of Indigenous peoples living on Vancouver Island. Villages and forests vanished and rocks from the ocean appeared in lakes. In one Nuu-chah-nulth story, dating back hundreds of years, an orca – K’aka’win – was carried more than a mile from an inlet to Sproat Lake by a tsunami wave. The killer whale survived for nearly a month before it succumbed to the fresh water.View image in fullscreenFears that the Kamchatka earthquake in Russia could cause tsunamis across the world this summer were not realised.Photograph: NOAAKatsu Goda, a professor at Western University in Ontario who studies catastrophe modelling, recently travelled to Tofino to meet colleagues from Indonesia and Cuba as part of a broader project to develop response plans with local officials.On the morning of 3 October, nearly 40 people packed into a hotel conference room. At the tables were flood experts, sociologists, hotel managers, town councillors, firefighters and disaster-response staff all tasked with “community asset mapping” – an exercise in which the town’s weaknesses, which impede a speedy response to disaster, are identified.View image in fullscreenKatsu Goda, who studies risk modelling, meets other experts in a Tofino hotel.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianThe room broke out in muffled gasps when the soft-spoken Goda told attenders that an earthquake reaching 9 on the Richter scale was nearly 1,000 times greater than one measuring a 7. And yet when a quake of such a devastating magnitude strikes, officials and first responders have to ignore its effects because of the wave that arrives minutes later, the power of which will depend on tides, storms and whether the quake lifts or drops the land.An additional issue for Tofino is seasonal crowds. Its bohemian mystique and powerful waves have long been a lure for surfers. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to its lowest-lying areas on holiday. Under most earthquake scenarios, when the “big one” strikes, anyone near a beach has about 15 minutes to escape to higher ground. But those minutes are misleading, says Goda.“You might lose five minutes waiting for aftershocks. If it’s daytime, the journey is far easier than at night. And then you might be ready to leave, but then realise you need to find your kids.”View image in fullscreenRoad signs direct people towards higher ground should a tsunami strike.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianThe town is also vulnerable in other ways. Tofino gets all its drinking water from a nearby island. Climate change is eroding beaches and worsening storms that push water farther inland. “Atmospheric rivers” – the long, narrow areas in the sky that carry most of the water vapour from the tropics – and rockslides can overwhelm the lone highway. Last summer, fires reached perilously close to the road.And while the lure and promise of artificial intelligence has touched nearly every field, Goda says it remains a costly and impractical tool for those seeking accurate models of tsunamis.“To make a credible model, we need experience. And we lack the fundamental information because when it comes to tsunami, there is so little good data,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A storm the day before has piled bull kelp, shells and fresh driftwood on to the shore. Bundled tourists absorb the rugged seascape.Many visitors know of the possible tsunami – but most also anticipate having about an hour to get to higher ground. And this, for Hilary O’Reilly, is a problem.Canada races to build icebreakers amid melting ice and geopolitical tensionsRead moreAs Tofino’s emergency programme coordinator, O’Reilly faces the challenges of educating a community that bulges and shrinks with tourism. She must ensure guests who visit for a weekend getaway are also aware of the more literal escape routes, and find a delicate balance between fear and education for residents and their families.“My job is to give people control over that fear as best I can,” O’Reilly says.Most residents have signed up for a mobile phone notification service. Signs along the highway guide travellers to higher ground and the main beaches have sirens, with plans for more in town and the nearby First Nations communities.Tofino wants to build a vertical evacuation tower – a wave-proof structure that could accommodate thousands of people fleeing to higher ground. Similar towers have saved thousands of lives in Japan and Canada’s first tower is under construction inHaida Gwaii, an archipelago just north of Vancouver island. But the best sites for such a tower are also the most unstable, prone to liquefaction – a phenomenon that sees sandy areas mimic liquid during an earthquake.View image in fullscreenHilary O’Reilly, Tofino’s emergency programme coordinator, organises ‘high ground hikes’ for residents.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianAgainst all that, O’Reilly’s larger task is to grapple with the profound uncertainty of the unknown. The highways will probably buckle and crumple in an earthquake. But how many trees will litter what remains of the road, and how might that change the way people move when they are panicking in search of an escape route?Before it was an eco-tourism hub for affluent visitors, Tofino was an outpost for the fishing and logging industries – nicknamed Tuff City. The underlying ethos, say residents, is a hardiness and a resilience to thrive against the harsh geography. Residents are accustomed to power cuts and a patchy mobile service. Implicit in the town’s disaster plans is a recognition that success in the face of disaster requires a belief in human nature.“What will get us through a large disaster is a sense of community,” says O’Reilly. “People coming together when they’re needed is a lovely piece of humanity that emerges from unfortunate moments in the world. And we know this town will come together. Because it has to.”For a disaster that looms as a distant threat, it occupies a similarly abstract space in the town’s culture. O’Reilly organises a “high-ground hike” event for families to learn the town’s topography. Next to the house where Goss lives, tourists snap pictures of a sign warning that the area is within the tsunami flood zone. Shops have souvenir shirts for sale with a modified design: a surfer running towards the massive wave.“We know that it exists, but people don’t talk about it,” says Goss. “We’re not living our days in fear of a tsunami. But maybe we should think about it more than we used to.”View image in fullscreenA surfer enjoys a post-storm swell on Chesterman Beach.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/GuardianExplore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansCanadaAmericasCoastlinesEarthquakesTsunamisOceansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then they were quietly removedRelatives fear the move is part of ‘the same virus affecting the US’, as historians and politicians say it coincided with Trump’s DEI purgeSenay Boztasin MargratenTue 11 Nov 2025 08.25 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 14.52 ESTShareA white marble cross marks the final resting place of Julius W Morris, private first class in the US army, who died in April 1945.But at the cemetery where he lies in Margraten, a village in the south of theNetherlands, a new battle has begun over the quiet removal of two display panels about African American soldiers, like Morris.Relatives, local communities, politicians and historians have called for a permanent memorial to African American servicemen after it emerged that displays commemorating black soldiers had been removed.The move has sparked shock in the Netherlands, with critics of the removal, including a community that cares for the graves, demanding answers about why the black American soldiers have all but vanished from displays.The Netherlands American Cemetery near Maastricht holds the graves of 8,301 Americans who died liberatingEuropefrom the Nazis, including 174 African Americans.In 2023, the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), which runs the site, opened a visitor centre and last year added two panels: one on the million African Americans who enlisted but were “fighting on two fronts”, against the Nazis in Europe and against America’s racist segregation policies.Bas Albersen, spokesperson for the governor of Limburg, said on Monday the provincial government would be making an “urgent appeal” to the ABMC and US ambassador to return these panels. “The displayed panels represented a history that we can never forget and from which we can learn, especially now that differences in the world are ever more magnified,” he said. “They fought for a freedom that they did not have themselves.”View image in fullscreenRows of graves in the cemetery in Margraten.Photograph: Jair Mahazri/The Adopted documentaryDutch historians and politicians, as well as relatives of the soldiers, say the change coincided with the Trump administration’s targeting of diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Earlier this year, an article detailing the military career of Jackie Robinson, a baseball player widely considered an American hero, was removed from the Department of Defense’s website amid a purge of material considered to be DEI-related. Itwas later restored.“It upsets me,” said Raphael Morris, the nephew of Julius W Morris. “We’ve got all sorts of museums around the country honouring African Americans. And a lot of the displays have been taken down. I guess I didn’t realise that the cemetery there in Margraten could possibly be affected by the same virus that’s affecting the United States right now, with this current administration.”Kees Ribbens, a senior researcher at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, and a history professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam, raised the alarm in Dutch media. “I grew up in South Limburg but it was not until much later that I learned that the cemetery had been constructed by black Americans under difficult conditions, beginning in late 1944,” he said.He added that local historians had later uncovered more about the lives and treatment of black soldiers, like how they were often not allowed to fight with weapons and assigned support roles and the number of Dutch children of US black soldiers who never knew their fathers.Theo Bovens, a Dutch senator and chair of the foundation Black Liberators in the Netherlands, has requested a meeting with the US ambassador, Joe Popolo. “Of course, we are upset that the attention has disappeared from the current exhibition and we will ask for the ambassador’s support in person,” he told the Guardian.In formal questions to the provincial government, 11 local parties expressed their “shock” and proposed a separate site to remember these soldiers. “Removing the panels that commemorate the sacrifices of black American soldiers does not do justice to history and is improper and unacceptable,” they said.There is also confusion in the local community, where many generations have cared for the graves as part of an adoption programme. Jettie van den Boorn, 62, is part of a family that long ago adopted Morris’s grave. “It is land granted to America, so it is their good right to do what they like there,” she said. “But it is as though [the black soldiers] are forgotten, and that’s not good – we are completely against that.”View image in fullscreenThe grave of a US solder named Louis Smith, one of those adopted in the cemetery.Photograph: Jair Mahazri/The Adopted documentaryThe ABMC told the Guardian that one of the panels was still part of a rotation, but that the other had been retired. “The panel featuring Technician Fourth Class George H Pruitt is currently off display, though not out of rotation,” it said in a statement. “Based on internal review of interpretive content under ABMC’s previous secretary, the agency rotated out a single panel display in March which featured a quote from 1st Lt Jefferson Wiggins, an African American soldier who survived the war.”It said that four African American soldiers were featured in 15 servicemen panels on rotation, although they were not on show when the Guardian visited.Local organisations, meanwhile, stress that all of the sacrifices are remembered. The Foundation for Adopting Graves at the American Cemetery Margraten, which manages the adoption programme, said that it remembered everyone, whatever their sex, race or rank. “For all these years, the adopters have remembered and honoured ‘their soldier’ who between 1944 and 1945 made the greatest sacrifice they could make for our freedom,” said Frans Roebroeks, the foundation’s secretary.This sense of gratitude transcends modern-day politics, according to Rob O’Brien, the director of a documentary, The Adopted, which is being filmed about the relationships between local grave adopters and the dead soldiers’ families. “That community is totally impervious to political interpretation,” he said. “It doesn’t really matter what is going on in the world … putting flowers on a soldier’s grave, who you never even knew, telling their story over and over again, saying a prayer, Margraten’s adopters have been doing this for 80 years. And they will do it for another 80 more, because no one around here wants this to happen again.”On Monday morning, as the sun warmed away the morning dew, regardless of the political storm, fresh flowers lay at Morris’s grave.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsUS militaryRaceSecond world warEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A circular firing squad won’t help the government out of the hole we’re in,” one source said.View image in fullscreenStreeting, Rayner, Mahmood and Miliband with Starmer and the rest of his shadow cabinet at the launch of Labour’s 2024 manifesto.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty ImagesBut their warnings were also aimed at jittery Labour MPs, who have grown increasingly concerned about breaking manifesto pledges on tax, the potential for wipeout at the May elections and whether Starmer can successfully deliver change – and a second general election victory.Several close allies of the prime minister told the Guardian that any move to try to oust him would be “reckless”.They said Starmer would fight any subsequent leadership contest to see off rivals for the Labour crown. “Keir will not stand aside at this point, for Wes or anybody else,” one said.“The idea he’d walk away if somebody said the budget hadn’t landed well is nonsense,” a second added. They said he was determined to fight for change for the country, despite the many difficulties.Keir Starmer warned ‘time running out’ to repair faltering leadershipRead more“We have a challenging situation in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party]. We know everything is a bit febrile and everybody is concerned. But the consequences of a leadership challenge would be enormous and people need to remember that,” the first senior ally said.“If you chuck a leadership challenge in just 18 months into government you’d destabilise the markets, our allies and I don’t think the public would forgive us. The impact would be very serious. MPs need to think about the reality of what a challenge right now would mean.”No Labour prime minister has ever been forced out of Downing Street by their own MPs. “To do so at this point in the cycle would be the height of irresponsibility. The party would not recover for a generation,” they added.The second senior No 10 source said: “Lots of MPs are concerned about where we are but some are going so far as to think it’s a good idea to destabilise the party ahead of, or in the immediate aftermath of, the budget. That’s really risky.“Until we start delivering change, people are not going to start feeling positive about the government … I don’t see alternative path to a second term other than taking on Farage and delivering on our mandate.“This is about them feeling we’re behind in the polls and that they need to do something. But it would be a dangerous thing to do – very destabilising for the party, very reckless.”A third Downing Street source added: “Keir doesn’t realise this is existential for him. But it’s astonishing that MPs think that ousting him might be an answer – the public will just think we’re no different from the last lot.”Cabinet ministers said they believed Downing Street was hoping to fire off a warning shot to any Labour politicians with leadership ambitions not to act against the prime minister.“Wes is obviously on manoeuvres but it’s not about ousting Keir, it’s about putting himself in pole position if a vacancy should come about. He’s not the only one. But we’ve all seen the polling and are worried that we’re about to hand the country to Reform,” one cabinet minister said.“I doubt that anybody who replaced Keir could shift the dial in the country, especially if they also needed to make up for the level of chaos they’d create by changing leader.”After an abortive attemptat challenging Starmer’s approachearlier this autumn, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, is still believed to have leadership ambitions. Starmer’s former deputy, Rayner, has often been tipped as a successor but may opt to be kingmaker instead.Andy Burnham, the man who would be kingRead moreAn ally of Streeting said: “Of course Wes is the frontrunner but this is a kite-flying exercise from a paranoid No 10 who don’t talk to their own MPs. We know that whoever is seen to be wielding the knife won’t wear the crown.“There is nothing organised or imminent although everyone expects that something will happen if the May elections are as bad as everyone expects. They are so neurotic because they never leave Downing Street and because they put a load of inexperienced people in the whip’s office which nobody will talk to.”A spokesperson for Streeting, who is delivering a speech to NHS Providers on Wednesday, said the suggestion he was plotting was “categorically untrue”. They added: “Wes’s focus has entirely been on cutting waiting lists for the first time in 15 years, recruiting 2,500 more GPs, and rebuilding the NHS that saved his life.”Streeting has increasingly become a thorn in Starmer’s side since the election, in which he almost lost his seat to a pro-Gaza independent. He is understood to have spoken out in cabinet meetings against the government’s approach to welfare, digital ID and Gaza.One of Labour’s most powerful communicators, he has shifted away from the right of the Labour party on key issues, saying publicly that Starmer’s“island of strangers” speech, and attempts to cut winter fuel payments and welfare, were mistakes.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabour party leadershipLabourBudget 2025Wes StreetingAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

The businessman had gone to the special immigration appeals commission to appeal against the decision but it ruled that the ban should remain in place.Another company with links to the former prince, Innovate Global Ltd, also began the process of closing down, according to documents filed at Companies House.Last month, King Charles stripped his younger brother of his titles and honours and moved toforce him out of his 30-room Windsor mansionafter months of pressure over his ties to the convicted sex offender Epstein and the allegations made by Giuffre. He has always denied any wrongdoing.The removal process applies to the titles of Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh and the style His Royal Highness. The honours affected are Andrew’s Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. He had ceased to use the HRH style in 2022 but it had not been formally removed.It is understood that Andrew, 64, will move next year to a property on the private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, to be privately funded by the king.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also move out of the Windsor property and will make her own living arrangements.Mountbatten Windsor and Lancaster were both contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten WindsorMonarchyJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been claimed that Gibb pushed accusations of institutional bias that preceded the shock resignation of Davie and Deborah Turness, the head ofBBCNews.Their departures over the weekend followed accusations of bias made in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left that role in the summer.His memo was leaked to the Daily Telegraph last week and reported over the course of several days.It included criticism of the way Panorama broadcast edited footage of a Donald Trump speech, which has since led theUS president to threaten a $1bn legal action. Prescott made a series of other claims of a more general liberal bias on issues such as trans rights and Gaza.While the BBC has acknowledged failings, concern has grown over Gibb’s position on the board amid suggestions that he played a role in both pushing Prescott’s claims and in Prescott being awarded the advisory role. Both Gibb and Prescott have now been summoned to give evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport committee.Thanking staff for their support at the meeting, Davie reassured them that the narrative around the corporation “will not just be given by our enemies” after a week in which senior politicians have accused the BBC of systemic bias in its reporting.“I do hear everyone when we have to be very clear and stand up for our journalism,” he said. “We are in a unique and precious organisation. I see the free press under pressure. I see the weaponisation. I think we’ve got a fight for our journalism. I’m really proud of our work.”Staff watching Davie’s address tried to raise the issue of Gibb’s place on the board. “Why is Robbie Gibb still on the board,” asked one.“The board needs independent oversight free from political interference,” said another. “Until Robbie Gibb and any other political appointee are removed, we cannot possibly be truly trusted to be an unbiased organisation.”Another said: “I find Robbie Gibb’s continued presence at the BBC to be incredibly demoralising. It feels as if he is fighting against and undermining the work we’re trying to do.”MPs also called for Gibb to be removed. Labour MP Sarah Owen said it was time to review his place on the board.Anna Sabine, the Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson, said it was “obvious to everyone that this issue is being weaponised by those who want to undermine the BBC and who would profit from its demise”. “Serious concerns remain over the conduct of Sir Robbie Gibb during his tenure on the BBC board,” she said, backing his removal.Pete Wishart, from the SNP, also called for his departure.However, Conservative MP Sir Julian Lewis said the “crisis had nothing to do with Robbie Gibb” and was entirely down to the mistakes the BBC had made. A corporation spokesperson said Gibb was one voice on a board of 13 people, which had a “cross-section of views”.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said there was a “strict legal threshold that must be met before dismissal of a board member”, adding that she could not remove Gibb. She condemned attempts to launch a “sustained attack” on the BBC.Suggestions of a political effort to pressure the BBC from the right have been denied. In his letter, Prescott said his criticisms “do not come with any political agenda”.In the all-staff meeting, Samir Shah, the BBC’s chair, said any idea of a rightwing coup to destabilise the BBC from within was “fanciful”.“[Board members] have different points of view,” he said. “I wouldn’t want a board that’s guilty of groupthink, but the opposite of groupthink is different points of view. That makes the job of the chair challenging to try and organise and get consensus, but it’s important that people have a diversity of opinion on the board.”Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavieDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

They are fixated on their victims, know everything about them and will stop at nothing to maintain control.“When they are released, we know they are likely to return to harassing, stalking and abusing their victim. While these despicable behaviours may rightly see them recalled to prison, victims’ lives will likely have been put at risk in the process.“Re-releasing these perpetrators in as little as eight weeks sends the wrong message to victims and abusers. It tells perpetrators that they can continue their abuse with impunity and will embolden some of them to escalate their behaviour, which could lead to devastating consequences.”View image in fullscreenDavid Lammy is under pressure to amend the bill.Photograph: PRU/AFP/Getty ImagesUnder rules in place until July, the vast majority of offenders released on licence or parole who then breach the conditions of probation are “recalled” back to prison to serve the rest of their sentences, unless ordered otherwise by a parole board.Since July, emergency measures were introduced to ease overcrowding in prisons so that offenders serving one to four years who were recalled for breaching the licences were rereleased after 28 days.Under the bill’s reforms, the government is making the emergency measures permanent for nearly all offenders. Standard recall for most offenders has been dropped and replaced with a fixed-term recall of 56 days, skipping any need to appear before a parole board.A small number of criminals will be exempt, including terrorists and criminals who are subject to enhanced risk management with police, prisons and probation services.Jacobs called on Lammy to amend the bill so that any offender who is recalled to prison for a breach against their victim is held in prison until they are assessed as safe to be let out.“These enhanced checks would prioritise the safety of victims, keeping the most dangerous abusers in prison until their risk has been reduced,” she said.Crime statistics for the three months to March this year show a 36% increase in total recalls compared with the same quarter in 2024. Around 75% of recalls involved non-compliance with license conditions, and 23% related to further offending.Because the majority of domestic abuse crimes are not flagged past the point of conviction, it remains difficult to determine how many perpetrators of domestic abuse have been recalled and re-released, or the basis for their recall.The letter also accuses ministers of delaying the publication of a violence against women and girls strategy, despite a Labour manifesto promise to halve violence against females.“With the continued delays to the publication of the VAWG strategy and the expansion of schemes which reduce the time perpetrators spend in prison, many victims and survivors will rightly be wondering what the government is doing for them,” Jacobs wrote.Officials have said that the 56-day period will allow the probation service to undertake a thorough review of release plans and licence conditions before offenders are re-released.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The government inherited a justice system in crisis, days away from running out of prison cells which would have left the public and victims at significant risk.“This change was recommended by the independent sentencing review, increasing fixed-term recalls from the current 14 or 28 days so probation staff have more time to assess risks and put robust safeguards in place.“The most dangerous offenders will only be rereleased once assessed as safe and all offenders released face strict licence conditions and supervision.”Explore more on these topicsDomestic violenceWomenUK criminal justiceDavid LammyPrisons and probationShareReuse this content"

She wins £15,000.Holmberg’s portrait features the sitter, Mel, appearing lost in a daydream as cool light caresses her repaired skin.When Mel was two years old, her mother left her and her sister in the car while she went to make a quick purchase at a convenience store and when the mother returned, the car was on fire. Mel’s sister died while Mel survived with severe burns.Holmberg’s interest in photography was sparked at a young age by accompanying her father when he would develop his own prints and photos.The portrait of Mel is part of a larger series called The Outside of the Inside, in which Holmberg documents people with facial and physical differences. The NPG said the photographer paid tribute to the rich diversity of appearances and brought more visibility to the discrimination faced by those with physical differences.The judges commended Mel for its combination of compassionate approach and technical skill, noting how the lighting and thoughtful pose drew viewers to the sitter’s story.The £3,000 second prize went to Luan Davide Gray, a London-based fine art photographer, for We Dare to Hug, a black and white portrait of two men in their 60s sharing a tender embrace.View image in fullscreenWe Dare to Hug by Luan Davide Gray won second prize.Photograph: Luan Davide Gray/Taylor Wessing PPPThe image, which evokes sculpture through its composition and use of light and shadow, shows one man softly holding the other’s bare chest and gently kissing him on the cheek.Gray has a degree in visual communication from the University of Brighton and more than 20 years of experience as a hairstylist and creative image consultant.The NPG said the portrait, which is part of a larger series, Call Me By Your Name, captured a moment of mature intimacy that defied conventional representations of physical closeness.The £2,000 third prize went to Byron Mohammad Hamzah, an NHS consultant and photographic artist, for his portrait Jaidi Playing. Part of the series Bunga dan Tembok (The Flower and the Wall: The Stateless Youths of Semporna), the portrait depicts a child, Jaidi, whose head is cradled in the hands of another child.Hamzah has spent the past two years working as a volunteer art and photography teacher with an NGO based in Sabah, East Malaysia, that provides free schooling for stateless and marginalised youth, particularly from the Bajau Laut ethnic group.Jaidi is one of those children. The NPG said the portrait captured a moment of tranquility within a tumultuous and uncertain existence. The judges were drawn to the way the portrait pictured a moment of youthful connection while inviting questions from the details it excludes.View image in fullscreenThird place went to Jaidi Playing by Byron Mohammad Hamzah.Photograph: Byron Mohammad Hamzah/Taylor Wessing PPPThe £8,000 photographic commission to create a new work for the NPG’s collection was awarded to Hollie Fernando, a London- and Brighton-based photographer and director, for her portrait Boss Morris, from the series Hoydenish.The portrait explores the shift in gender equality within morris dancing. Boss Morris is a young, all-female morris side based in Stroud. The dancers are adorned in folkloric dress and make up as they huddle together for a group portrait. The judges commended the image for its striking and otherworldly qualities.The winning portraits will be on display at the NPG as part of the Taylor Wessing photo portrait prize 2025 exhibition, open from 13 November to 8 February 2026. The exhibition also includes a new portrait of the queer activist and advocate Lady Phyll, full name Phyllis Akua Opoku-Gyimah, by last year’s winner of the Taylor Wessing photographic commission, Jesse Navarre Vos.The 2025 judging panel included the photographer and educator Sunil Gupta, the art historian and curator Katy Hessel, the photographer Tim Walker, and Sabina Jaskot-Gill, a senior curator of photography at the NPG.Explore more on these topicsTaylor Wessing photographic portrait prizePhotographyAwards and prizesNational Portrait GallerynewsShareReuse this content"

This documentary about his fight with Conor Benn – the son of his dad’s great rival – charts a reunion. It’s heart-pulverising stuffLucy ManganTue 11 Nov 2025 17.00 ESTShareYou do not, I would hazard, expect to be moved to tears by a documentary about the Eubank family. But I suspect I am not the only one to find myself unexpectedly moved by The Eubanks: Like Father, Like Son, which follows Chris Sr and Chris Jr (also a successful boxer) as the latter prepares fora fight against Conor Benn, son of his father’s great 90s rival Nigel Benn, and tracing the rapprochement between the Eubanks after four years of estrangement.Eubank Jr has all his father’s gentleness and none of his eccentricity. He also has less of his need to be noticed, and the patience of a saint. He treats his father with such quiet respect – absorbing all his performative flourishes, and clearly trying to keep his mind’s eye and his heart fixed on Eubank Sr’s underlying love – that your own heart is semi-pulverised long before we get to the meat of the programme.The men’s estrangement began when Eubank Jr sacked his father as his coach. It was a wholly understandable decision – at least if you weren’t Eubank Sr. The son felt he had gone as far as he could in the sport under his father’s guidance and he needed people with new advice, new strategies, new ways to take him to the next level. He also felt that he needed to separate himself as a person as well as a boxer from the man who had, one way or another, dominated him until then.We see footage of Eubank Sr as his coach talking – performing, really – at various press conferences. “I hear people say I am stealing my son’s limelight. So someone else should be in my position? Who is more qualified than I?” Any teenager who ever complains that a parent is embarrassing them should watch it and never speak again.Asked about his son’s decision now, Eubank replies that he was “deeply, deeply, deeply hurt … Yes, it’s control. There’s nothing wrong with that. ‘Let him have his own career.’ That is such nonsense!” We are so used to the showboating celebrity that this sudden unvarnished honesty is quite disarming. More follows. At first, it is more evidence of the disciplinarian his son remembers at home: “I brought him up with the cane, I brought him up with the belt … I was fierce as a father.” As a coach: “He was under my spell. And my spell was sweet and loving.” But it gives way to something deeper as the pair recall Dad’s resistance first to his child getting involved with boxing (“I did not want him to suffer. I was fearful it was going to get him damaged”) and to the grudge match with Conor Benn. “He is my son and they are going to take him away from me becausehe will not listen,” says Eubank Sr, his voice shaking with the very specific anger that comes from parental terror.Eubank’s older son, Sebastian, died of a heart attack four years ago at the age of 29. “I think it consumed my father,” says Eubank Jr.“Sebastian, six years before he passed,” says Eubank Sr, “said to me: ‘You’re too extreme.’ I am extreme, because I love my children.” And it is this, we can see, that is behind his public disapproval of Eubank Jr in the days leading up to the Conor fight (“You’re a disgrace … The money will get you killed”), unhelpful though it is to his son as he prepares.On the day, however, and in a notably undramatic way, he turns up to support his son in the fight. Afterwards, you can see the pride outweighed only by relief that – although needing hospital treatment for the severe dehydration his father warned about – the boy has survived. It’s clear Eubank Sr hopes that this will be his son’s last fight and that his unprecedentedly unstinting praise (“Everywhere you go now – YOU’RE the superstar!”) is partly in the hope of making it so. “I’ve lost a son,” he says to camera, every vestige of artifice gone. “I will not lose another one. Iwill notlose another one.”It really is enough to make you weep, as the camera unobtrusively captures these men so loved by each other trying to connect, to understand and make each other understand, watching them reach out and pass each other, missing only by inches. But still close enough to matter, close enough to keep trying. “You will always be my baby,” says the father. “I will always be your son,” his child replies.The son, the child, the baby has a rematch with Benn on 15 November.The Eubanks: Like Father, Like Son aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionBoxingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs byJulia KochetovaSupported byAbout this contentTue 11 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 16.48 ESTShareIn a post office 10 miles (15km) from Ukraine’s frontline, in a suburb of the eastern city of Kharkiv, business is brisk on a chilly autumn morning – despite the ballistic missiles that had shaken the city at midnight, lighting up the sky with a false dawn of flames.The customer area is fitted out with phone-charging stations “and a small co-working space, which people can use during blackouts, since we have generators”, says the branch manager, 30-year-old Yaroslav Dobronos. There is also a changing room, in which a young woman is trying on, with a critical gaze, a new pair of jeans, before repacking them and sending them straight back.Behind the counters, a miscellany of parcels are waiting for customers to collect. Each is a fragment of life lived in all its normality and fragility in a frontline community.View image in fullscreenNova Poshta logistics hub in Kyiv, where packages are moved through a complex set of scanners and chutes before being loaded on to lorries for the journey to their destinationsThere are winter tyres, widescreen TVs, boxes marked Roshen (a chocolate brand owned by former president Petro Poroshenko), a folding bed, a car bumper, a package from an upmarket Ukrainian skincare brand, a bare-root tree, a set of rucksacks, a pram, a vacuum cleaner, a Russell Hobbs multicooker, and parts for Starlink (a satellite internet provider for use in remote locations). Out of one enormous, bulbous parcel pokes a fistful of camouflage net.We provide something of a peaceful life amid the war. In frontline areas, we are the last to leaveYaroslav Dobronos, branch managerUkraine’s main postal service is, like the country’s rail network, one of its most vital, reliable arteries: a matter of national pride for Ukrainians and incredulity for visiting foreigners.Nova Poshta,founded 25 years ago, is one of the chief reasons that Ukraine continues to function during a time of extraordinary violence and peril. It is affordable – it costs the equivalent of between £1.50 and £2.20 to send packages of between 5kg and 10kg within Ukraine – and it connects citizens across the nation and beyond, including those at the country’s most precarious, threatened edges.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop and left: Customer Kyrylo Stepanov sends car parts such as oil and filters by post; right: Starlink components will be delivered by Nova Poshta“We used to see our jobs here as just work,” says Dobronos. “Now we see that it’s really important. We provide something of a peaceful life amid the war. In frontline areas, we are the last to leave and the first to come back.”After thelightning counteroffensive in 2022, for example, Nova Poshta resumed working in the town of Balakliia in the Kharkiv region on 12 September, four daysafter it was liberated. In Kherson, on 12 November that year, it delivered lorries of humanitarian aidthe day after the Russian withdrawal. In such situations, the company sets up mobile offices until its premises can be deemed safe from mines, and repaired.View image in fullscreenA damaged building in northern Kharkiv, which once housed a Nova Poshta branch, October 2025When Nova Poshta leaves a place, by contrast, there is a sense that it’s the end of the line for a threatened community, one of its most tangible links with the outside world broken.That was the case in Pokrovsk earlier this year, when its three remaining staff shut the last branch asthe Russians pushed closerto the eastern Ukrainian city.“They worked in a city where there were no more supermarkets, courts, schools, water, gas and electricity, but until now there were a few small grocery stores and the Nova Poshta office,” wrote the company’s co-founder Volodymyr Popereshnyuk in a valedictoryFacebook postdated 18 February.View image in fullscreenSorting parcels at the Nova Poshta logistics hub in KyivNova Poshta drivers are still willing to deliver to cities such as Kherson, where vehicles on the roads in and out are cruelly targeted by drones. Near the frontline, workers are issued with bulletproof vests and helmets.Back at the customer desk in the Kharkiv suburb, battalion commander Anton Baev, 31, is waiting to send boxes of his girlfriend’s possessions to her new lodgings. A military psychologist, she had been recently ordered to a new posting. Baev is stationed with his troops nearby. “If I could get my entire battalion delivered by Nova Poshta, I would do it,” he jokes.View image in fullscreenAnton Baev, a battalion commander, used the postal service to forward his girlfriend’s possessionsMoving house by post is perfectly normal in Ukraine. “Almost every day we deal with house moves. We deliver furniture, fridges, motorcycles, everything,” says Dobronos.The postal service provides a lifeline of home comforts to military on the frontline. Weapons are prohibited: “I can’t send a mortar, though that would be nice,” says Baev. But, aside from perishable food andvarious hazardous items, more or less anything else can be sent and will usually arrive the next day if dispatched from within the country. “My mother sent me homemade pie, and it arrived on the frontline,” says Baev.As the morning drifts on, the air raid siren sounds. The branch is shut swiftly and without drama, then, some moments later, reopens again. Everyone is used to it. And in any case, in Kharkiv there is a fatalism around missile attacks. “The border is very close,” says Dobronos. “We don’t have much time or much hope for reaction.”The Kharkiv area premises have two above-ground “capsule” bomb shelters. Dobronos says: “During an air raid alert, we close the branch and people wait there if they need – inside we have meds, water, fire extinguishers, torches.“We know it works – when the Russians hit another branch with three Shahed drones, the capsule shelter survived.”View image in fullscreenManager Yaroslav Dobronos stands by the ‘capsule’ bomb shelter inside the Nova Poshta branchOne of the office’s more heart-breaking jobs, these days, is dispatching the possessions of fallen soldiers back to their families. “It’s always a weird experience,” says Dobronos. “Maybe you’ve seen that person in the branch, but you just don’t know.”During the day, little eddies of queues appear at the customer desks, but quickly disperse as the staff retrieve, or pack and dispatch, parcels at speed. In contrast to the meditative, slow shuffle to a counter in a busy UK post office, the monthly queue target in this branch is “zero”, and they have slipped only twice, according to a handwritten note on the office whiteboard.At one point, a young, smartly dressed man opens the small package he has received at the counter to reveal a ring set with a sparkling stone: an engagement ring for his girlfriend. He is planning to ask her to marry him a fortnight later in Paris – 1,500 miles and a world away from this suburb with its bombed-out high-rises. Maksym Kravchenko, 28, is an anaesthetist in one of the city’s hospitals.View image in fullscreenMaksym Kravchenko with the engagement ring delivered by Nova Poshta – he plans to propose to his girlfriend in Paris, far away from the frontlineDobronos points out his regulars, many of whom are sustaining businesses reliant on the postal service. Marharyta Klymova, 24, a veterinarian, is receiving some material for reconstructing her damaged premises – but she also regularly takes delivery of “meds, pills, liquids, catheters, syringes, everything. If you don’t receive the parcel, you can’t treat the animals,” she says. “I haven’t left Kharkiv even for a day. Now, business slowly but firmly goes up. There are a lot of stressed animals here.”Olena Marenych, 51, is sending back a hoodie she had ordered in the wrong size. “I’m super-happy here in Ukraine,” she says. “Home is better for me, though sometimes it’s scary.” Maksym Bilous, 33, runs an online shop selling Starlink parts: “I send them all over, but mostly to the east where fighting takes place; we adapt the equipment and install it in cars.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: Andrii Tomko with the textile bales he is posting to Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia; left: Olena Marenych with the hoodie she’s returning; and Olena Miroshnyk is sending out one of her gift hampersAndrii Tomko, 24, is posting huge bales of textiles to Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, as part of his family’s wholesale fabric business. A couple of times he lost parcels to fire when a Nova Poshta terminal was hit by a missile. But he had been compensated, he says.Olena Miroshnyk, 47, has a small business selling gift hampers; she is sending out several that day to customers in other parts of Ukraine. The full-scale invasion stymied her plans to open a shop; instead she has swerved towards an online business. “It’s very difficult. Last night was difficult. You invest a lot in a business, you risk a lot, but what can you do? We moved to Kyiv for half a year, then Poltava for half a year, but we decided to return – our own apartment is OK.”Vita Kramarenko, 53, has also returned to Kharkiv after two years as a refugee in Germany. “I realised Ukrainian services are best,” she says. “Despite the war, everything works and everything arrives, shelling or not. European services are a myth.”She is sending a set of curtains and curtain rails to her sister in Spain. “It’s very expensive to buy those things there, so I am sending them to her,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe logistics hub of Nova Poshta in Kyiv. A large sign points out the location of the bomb sheltersBefore the full-scale invasion, Nova Poshta operated only within Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova. Now, initially to serve the needs of the country’s millions of refugees, it has expanded to a further 15 European countries, including Spain and the UK, where it is calledNova Post.“Even in these tough times, it is a chance for us to become a European or global delivery company,” says Nova Poshta’s co-founder Viacheslav Klymov in an interview, saying that the company now provides next-day delivery between, for example, Warsaw and Berlin.But the difficulties of running an efficient postal service during a full-scale invasion are enormous. “The safety of our customers and staff is the biggest challenge,” says Klymov. Then there is the threat from Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, which has led the company to invest in becoming “energy independent” – essentially, installing generators in local branches and, at the large sorting depots, generating power from their own gas supply via co-generation plants. When cities are otherwise plunged into darkness, Nova Poshta can keep working.View image in fullscreenMarharyta Klimova, a vet, picking up a parcel at Nova Poshta in KharkivStaffing is also a challenge: 4,000 workers, or 10% of the staff have been mobilised into the army, according to a Nova Poshta spokeswoman. And there have been casualties, too: 22 civilian Nova Poshta employees have been killed in Russian attacks, and 218 after being drafted into the military.Wives, mothers, fighters, activists: the millennial women keeping Ukraine goingRead moreThe mobilisation of so many employees has provided an impetus to accelerate automation. In a vast sorting depot near Kyiv, 1.5m parcels are processed every day, largely through automated and robotised processes: after being delivered from the local post offices, packages are moved through a dizzying set of scanners and chutes before being loaded on to lorries for the journey to their destination cities.Klymov is speaking the morning after an attack had left much of Kyiv without electricity or water. Nova Poshta had put out a message apologising for a possible delay to deliveries – essentially because staff had had to take refuge in bomb shelters during the night. But the delay was expected to be counted in hours rather than days, and offices were open as usual.“The Ukrainian customer is a very strange creature,” says Klymov. “The Ukrainian customer doesn’t care about attacks, doesn’t care about an absence of electricity supply: the Ukrainian customer needs their delivery on time.”View image in fullscreenA hand-drawn doodle on a cardboard box stacked on a shelf at the Nova Poshta in KharkivExplore more on these topicsUkraine in depthUkrainePostal serviceRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

With or without Sue Perkins alongside her, the presence of Giedroyc makes any kind of chat/quiz/contest caper watchable. You can hand her virtually nothing and she’ll turn it into something welcoming and cheekily funny. To demonstrate this beyond dispute, E4 has come up with No Strings Attached, a profoundly silly piece of flim-flam that is objectively awful, and with any other presenter would be unbearable.The result of a commissioning process that can only be explained by severe staff/budget cuts, a complex blackmail situation or a rogue shipment of hallucinogenic cocaine, No Strings Attached proceeds as follows. A celebrity sits in an armchair opposite La Droyc. Each of them clutches a sheaf of paper, upon which is printed a piece of erotic fiction – written specially for the show by amateur writers who have previously churned out weird fanfic on the internet – where the celeb is the protagonist. As the famous-ish person reads aloud the story of their imaginary sexual escapades, Mel follows the text and reacts, encourages and guides. Lest this become visually stale, we cut regularly to puppets that are performing the actions described, in explicit furry detail.First up is Sam Thompson of Made in Chelsea, Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, Celebrity Coach Trip, Celebs Go Dating, Celebrity Ghost Hunt, The Celebrity Circle, CelebAbility, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! and I’m a Celebrity... Unpacked fame. His story fantasises that his friendship with fellow reality star Pete Wicks has turned physical, the carnal overtones of their appearance at a shirtless charity fencing match eventually brimming over into a different kind of swordsmanship – this causes a Romeo and Juliet-esque controversy in the celeb community, since one of these randy new paramours is from Made in Chelsea and the other from The Only Way is Essex, but Sam and Pete’s lust cannot be contained.In the studio, Sam and Mel have work to do, since the story is fairly comic and quite outrageous, without being very funny or properly filthy. But they soon strike up a rapport, starting with Giedroyc’s reaction to Thompson referencing 55 as the age of an old person, and continuing when he starts to dry up and Giedroyc suggests they have another gin and tonic, wielding a litre bottle of Schweppes herself. (No Strings Attached is one of those shows where you can imagine one of the crew being given the specific, crucial job of supplying just the right amount of booze to the host and guest.)On they go, with Giedroyc’s interjections bolstering the script’s more suggestive moments (“Have you got a very big tongue, Sam? You’d need quite a big tongue for that”), her flawless comic timing forever funnier than what Thompson is reading out: the way she reaches for a previously untouched bowl of peanuts just as he says “Their slick members brushed against each other” is the work of a master. The story, meanwhile, is a sort of half-parody, generally playing it straight and letting the ludicrous subject matter do the entertaining, but then sometimes reaching for a fully comic metaphor: “Sam feasted on Pete’s manhood like a hungry dog at a barbecue … suckling the water from his nipples like a thirsty piglet” being the climax of a scene set in a locker-room shower.Each episode runs to 40 minutes including the ad break, which is approximately 38 minutes longer than it takes for the novelty of the concept to wane, particularly since the puppets don’t add much beyond the gag of their nipples and genitals having been replaced with tufts of feathers. We are entirely reliant on Giedroyc’s indefatigable professionalism as she takes on the persona of a permissive, mischievous auntie, happily indulging the weak sauce of the material and finding fun just from being in the guest’s company. The other episode provided by E4 for review sees her bond effortlessly with Kerry Katona, joshing about her terrible Australian accent and the possibility of her earning a casting call from Coronation Street as Katona unwraps a tale set backstage at a TV talent contest, during which she romps with both Peter Andre and Mel B.None of the guests is likely to be top-lining No Strings Attached on their CV any time soon, and Giedroyc is much better in a good show than she is in a bad one, but nothing she’s in can be all bad. It’s unlikely you’ll remember No Strings Attached at all, not least because you might not make it through a whole episode, but if you do, she’ll be the reason.No Strings Attached is available on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMel GiedroycreviewsShareReuse this content"

The resulting film is never anything but likable and fun – though never actually disturbing in the way that it’s surely supposed to be and the ending is fudged and anticlimactic.Yet there’s plenty of enjoyment to be had. Wright accelerates to a sprint for some full-tilt chase sequences; there’s a nice punk aesthetic with protest ’zines being produced by underground rebels; and Wright always delivers those sugar-rush pop slams on the soundtrack, including, of course, theSpencer Davis Group’s Keep on Running. It’s a quirk of fate that The Running Man arrives in the same year asThe Long Walk,also from a King book: a similar idea, only it’s walking not running.Powell plays Ben, an honest, hardworking guy in a dystopian US run by a faceless corporation in the traditional manner. He can’t get work after being blacklisted for calling out unsafe practices but desperately needs cash to buy medicine for his sick daughter. His wife Sheila (Jayme Lawson) is moreover exploited at the club where she works as a waitress-slash-hostess, although King’s original novel is clearer about the distasteful things she needs to do to earn money. In despair, Ben signs up for a top-rated reality TV show called The Running Man; he has to go on the run across the US, hunted by professional killers, and if he can survive for 30 days, he gets a billion dollars. But all too late, he realises that these shark-like fascist TV execs aren’t going to play fair.The show’s wacky studio presenter Bobby T Thompson is played by Colman Domingo, and behind the scenesJosh Brolinis hard-faced producer Dan Killian, who has eerily white teeth. They are more or less familiar personae from the Hunger Games series, but the film alludes also to classic small-screen satires such as Sidney Lumet’s Network and specifically, I think, to Robert Redford’s Quiz Show, particularly in the early scenes in which we see all the lesser programmes that Ben could in theory go in for.Ben realises that he is being set up all along the way, misrepresented as a bad guy, and sneakily subject to recruitment overtures to join further franchise iterations of the show if he plays along with their lies. But wait. Killian is using AI for phoney videos showing Ben declaiming ugly contempt for the public: a level of digital fabrication that King never envisioned when he wrote it. And, if they can fake all that so easily, what is the point of getting anyone to go through all that real-life running at all?It’s an uncomfortable issue that the movie doesn’t entirely solve; as a result The Running Man sometimes feels retro-futurist and steampunky, though it is always watchable and buoyant. Wright has hit a confident stride.The Running Man is out on 12 November in the UK, 13 November in Australia and 14 November in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsAction and adventure filmsThrillersFilm adaptationsStephen KingGlen PowellreviewsShareReuse this content"

But why seek out horror on screen if you have so much of it in real life?Geoffrey MacnabTue 11 Nov 2025 11.16 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 11.17 ESTShareWhen Ukrainian horror movie The Witch: Revenge started filming in late 2023, the costumes for the Russian soldiers were sourced straight from the battlefield. “They were real Russian uniforms. The captured soldiers or the dead soldiers, they just took those uniforms and cleaned them, and we used them,” the film’s producer, Iryna Kostyuk, says, speaking from Kyiv. Having cleaned the uniforms, the film-makers then had to dirty them up again so they looked suitably lived-in. Some of the vests still had names written in them – and several had names crossed out, presumably because Russian soldiers had filched them themselves from fallen comrades. “It was quite a challenge for the [Ukrainian] actors to wear them,” the producer says.The movie, also known as The Konotop Witch, is about a witch who has renounced her powers but re-summons them after the Russians kill her fiance. It was a runaway hit at the Ukrainian box office last year, making $1.4m – a very big number for a country during a war, facing curfews and electricity cuts. It’s also the first in a horror universe cycle, called Heroines of the Dark Times, that Kostyuk is overseeing. Kostyuk and her team have now completed the second film in the series, The Dam. A zombie splatterfest, full of gore and severed heads, it follows a unit of Ukrainian soldiers, led by a female fighter codenamed Mara, who uncover a cold war era laboratory where Soviet scientists conducted nefarious experiments in the 1950s. Mara and her team face the inevitable battle with undead Soviet soldiers – but must also confront their own innermost fears, and learn to trust one another.View image in fullscreenThe Witch: Revenge.Photograph: FILM.UAIt all begs a question: why turn to horror movies when you have so much of it in real life anyway? Kostyuk says that spectators’ responses to movies change in wartime. In 2023, she producedan animated family fantasy feature called Mavka: The Forest Song, about a mythical green-haired wood nymph who guards the forests. Although she had been working on it long before the Russian invasion, Ukrainian cinemagoers interpreted it as a patriotic wartime allegory and it became the highest-grossing Ukrainian film ever, making a reported $21m worldwide.But, by 2024, Kostyuk says she realised the public mood had darkened. “People wanted revenge,” she says. That’s what The Witch delivers in spades. The film’s logline was: “This is a film where a Ukrainian witch kicks the shit out of Russians”, and it immediately resonated. For a western viewer, the film makes peculiarly grim viewing. After the invasion, Russian soldiers are shown raping and murdering before the witch casts her dark spells against them and they begin to die in ever more grotesque ways.Kostyuk says: “The Witch was supposed to be a scary movie. It’s quite visual, quite graphic. But for Ukrainian audiences, it was not scary. They would look at those guts being splattered of the Russians and would be satisfied.”View image in fullscreen‘You choose locations and then you deal with it. It is high, high risk’ … The Witch: Revenge.Photograph: FILM.UAIf you are not Ukrainian, The Dam is an equally disconcerting experience. At certain moments, it plays like an eastern European answer to Shaun of the Dead, with enjoyably cheesy decapitations and absurdly bloody, over-the-top VFX. You think it must be tongue in cheek – but then you remember it was made in the middle of a very real war, about which there is nothing funny at all.And how does Kostyuk account for the films’ feminist overtones? According to her, it’s as much to do with the market as anything else. “Right now, the theatrical audience inUkraineis female-driven because lots of males are at war. There are not that many men left to go to the cinemas … but I think it also has to do with the fact that Ukrainian mythology is so rich, and it always has to do with the female side.”View image in fullscreenMade in the middle of a very real war … The Dam (2025).Photograph: FILM.UAKostyuk hopes that The Dam (which is being presented internationally for the first time at the American Film Market this week) will appeal beyond Ukrainian borders, both to horror fans and to any of us in the west worried about Russian expansionism. “That’s where Putin wants to take Russia now, back to the Soviet imperialist mindset, back to the USSR. We’re fighting the remains of that mindset and trying to stop it spilling out of the metaphorical bunker.” A third film is in development, about a policewoman fighting rightwing neo-Nazi vampires.Ask Kostyuk if it’s safe making such movies and she dismisses the question as no longer even worth asking. “Now that we are in the fourth year of war, I don’t think that the factor of safety applies any more when you are choosing your locations. You choose locations and then you deal with it. It is high, high risk.”However, it is true to say that audience demand is changing all the time. Last year, Ukrainan cinemagoers thirsted for revenge. Now, they crave escapism. Tales of the undead are less in vogue and The Dam has done modest business since its Ukrainian release last month. Nonetheless, Kostyuk is undaunted. She has recently overseen a live-action version of Mavka, called The True Myth, shot in Ukraine’s forests and lakes during wartime and delivered bang on schedule despite the constant air raids. If anyone is a heroine of dark times, you can’t help thinking that maybe Kostyuk is one herself. After all, making zombie movies and family adventures in the middle of an invasion takes a very special kind of gumption.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsUkraineFeminismRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, there are countless shakes on the market – including one by a Michelin-starred chef.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ialways thought my first foray into Michelin-starred culinary territory would involve sitting in a fancy restaurant feasting on some perfectly seared scallops or a magnificent rack of lamb doused in a richjus. Instead, I’m in a fitness studio – with Doja Cat blaring through the speakers – watching my “Michelin-starred” shake come together in a blender. Inside is a scoop of vanilla protein powder, the flesh of a guanabana (a tropical fruit with a spiky exterior that tastes like a cross between a mango and a banana) and some almond milk. Saffron foam is sprayed into a plastic cup and sprinkled with some blue spirulina before the pale protein mixture is poured on top.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The resulting shake, which was developed by the Michelin-starred chef Miller Prada for Hermosa, a luxury protein powder brand sold in Barry’s, a chain of fitness studios, is like a drinkable lava lamp, with white, blue and yellow swirling softly in the cup. According to Erika Tamayo, the founder of Hermosa, it has only one comparison. “Everyone says that it looks like Vincent van Gogh’s Starry Night,” she says. Before I’m allowed to taste it, she spritzes a coffee-scented liquid on the lid and then tells me how to drink it to get the “full Michelin experience”. Place the straw about midway in the cup and suck (it should taste like an ice-cream), before shoving it down full-throttle to get a hit of the “mood-enhancing” saffron.So, pomp aside, how does it taste? Pretty good. The texture is smooth and creamy (unlike the many gravel-textured protein shakes I’ve downed before) and the guanabana provides a subtle sweetness. Would I get it again? Maybe. The main thing holding me back is the hefty £11 price tag – though this seems to be the going rate for a fancy shake.View image in fullscreen‘Everyone says that it looks like Vincent van Gogh’s Starry Night’ … the ‘Michelin-starred’ shake.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“We made this shake as a statement. People are now understanding that health is luxury, and everyone is investing in it,” says Tamayo. She is not the only one creating “statement” protein shakes in the UK. Elevate, which calls itself a “nutrition-focused beverage outlet” in central London, sells an £8.90 cacao shake packed with 21g of protein that promises to “support mood and bring a gentle, uplifting boost”. Similarly, Soho House members can treat themselves to a new suite of colourful, “protein-based smoothies”, priced at about £9 each, with names that wouldn’t go amiss on a cocktail menu: “The Berlin”, “The Shoreditch” and “The Beach House”.These visually attractive, nutrient-packed health drinks really took off with the viral rise of the LA-based luxury wellness grocery stores Erewhon. While shoppers there can feast on a singlestrawberry imported from Japan for $20(£15.20), or guzzle a bottle of “hyper-oxygenated” water for $26, it’s the mega-viral smoothies, which can cost more than $20 a pop, that have catapulted the brand to social media stardom. Most of them aren’t protein-based, but their striking look (perfect for an Instagram snap) and use of ingredients that can apparently give you glazed skin or even cognitive support have inspired a new flock of imitators. They have become so popular that some of the biggest stars in the world, including Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo and Bella Hadid, have lent their names to limited-edition Erewhon smoothies. And Erewhon has raked inhuge profitsas a result: $171.4m in 2023, the last year for which figures are available, despite only having 11 locations in one US state: California.For Tamayo, taste, presentation and spectacle are key to standing out in the protein powder market, which has never been bigger (globally, it has been valued at $24.8bn,according to the market research firmResearch and Markets). As well as its Michelin-starred shake, Hermosa sells “grass-fed whey protein” in an amber glass jar (containing 14 servings) for £38.Protein is booming across the board. A YouGov survey carried out earlier this yearfound that25% of UK adults regularly drink protein shakes, including 37% of 25 to 34-year-olds. The industry has grown so big, in fact, that there is now a shortage of whey, the once-discarded liquid byproduct of cheese-making that has become an ingredient used in most protein powders; it has alsosoared in price. So how did the world go wild for protein shakes?Bob Hoffman would chuck Hershey’s chocolate into each batch of his protein shakes until they tasted edibleMost protein powders and shakes sold today sound as if they were taken straight from a dessert menu (chocolate, Biscoff and even matcha) but, in their first iteration, they resembled more of a meaty “sludge”, says Hannah Cutting-Jones, a food historian at the University of Oregon. The first protein-based product sold to consumers dates back to 1865, when a German scientist, Justus von Liebig, invented a meat substitute, marketed as Extract of Meat, which consisted of jars of “melted-down beef hides and carcasses”.It was recommendedthat consumers drink a “small wine-glassful” two to three times a day. “To call it a protein shake would be very generous,” says Cutting-Jones, but it was the first product “touted as having a lot of protein”. The sludge was eventually turned into solid cubes and became a home cooking staple under a more familiar name, Oxo.View image in fullscreenMost protein power is made from whey, which has soared in price.Photograph: Andreas Hauslbetz/AlamySoon after, protein products found a foothold among men seeking to buff up. From the late 1890s, Plasmon, a boxed milk protein powderplastered with imagesof Greek gods and muscular men, was sold across the UK and Germany. It was endorsed by the bodybuilder Eugen Sandow, who would go on to produce his own product: Health and Strength Cocoa, the world’s first chocolate protein powder. But Cutting-Jones says protein shakes really took off after the second world war, when food technology underwent a revolution. “They freeze-dried things, they turned milk into powder, and dehydrated eggs and cheeses to get them as lightweight as possible for rations boxes,” which, she says, normalised getting our nutrients from powders.The protein industry saw its first major success in the 1950s with the introduction of Super Hi-Protein shakes, developed by the then-head coach of the US Olympic weightlifting team, Bob Hoffman. “This is probably the earliest example of a shake that would resemble anything like [what] we have today,” says Cutting-Jones (except that, instead of the nutritionally fine-tuned powders we’re used to, Hoffman would chuck Hershey’s chocolate into each batch until it tasted edible). By 1960, the product had achieved more than $1m in sales, Cutting-Jones says. The 1970s saw protein shakes making their first significant forays beyond the gym, with two popular diets, the low-carbohydrate Atkins diet and the all-liquid Last Chance diet, where those looking to lose weight fast were advised to consume nothing but protein shakes. So many Americans signed up to the latter diet, 2 million by some estimates, thatthe New York Times suggestedthat “sipping [a supplement] instead of martinis” was now customary at cocktail parties. It fell out of favour when theUS government investigatedwhether starvation-related deaths could be attributed to it.View image in fullscreen‘We made this shake as a statement’ … chef Miller Prada and Erika Tamayo with the Miller Prada x Hermosa shake“People were starting to connect protein with weight loss in the 70s and 80s,” says Cutting-Jones, which was a “really key turning point for protein shakes”, though they still, for the most part, remained a bodybuilding staple. In the early 00s, this began to change. Up to that point,dieters were toldthat their ideal body could be achieved by avoiding fat. This longstanding assumption was shattered whenstudies found thatpeople consuming a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet lost more weight than those on a low-fat, low-cholesterol, low-calorie diet. TheAtkins diet returnedand protein grew in popularity.According to the Economist, global sales of sports nutrition products, most of them protein-based, doubled from 2007 to 2013, to £260m. Cutting-Jones says that from this point onwards, protein has “really been off to the races” because it could be marketed to everybody. UK-based MaxiMuscle, which went from £8.6m in sales in 2004 to £80m by 2010, broadened its appeal by releasing a product line aimed at women in 2006, and in 2012it launchedan advertising campaign for “real men”. This showed an office worker lifting a car in one hand and drinking a shake in the other. By 2011,its products were stockedin major supermarkets, including Tesco and Sainsbury’s.Social media was the next foot on the protein pedal. The prevailing message, usually delivered by ripped (male and female) fitness influencers, was: “You’re going to be able to look like me if you buy this protein powder,” says Cutting-Jones, who calls it “a marketer’s dream come true”. MyProtein, which was set up in 2004 with a £500 overdraft before soaring to itscurrent valuationof at least £400m, became the influencers’ brand of choice in the 2010s, but love for the products was probably not the only reason for plugging its shakes. The firm has had a long-running brand ambassador campaign where, as of 2025, influencers with more than 10,000 followers can earn up to 8% commission on each MyProtein product sold.But how much protein do we really need? TheUK government saysthat men aged 19-50 should be eating about 55g of protein a day, roughly equivalent to nine eggs, and women in the same age bracket should consume about 45g, about the same as seven eggs. According to Dr Linia Patel, a nutritionist at Pure Sports Medicine, these recommendations are “more about preventing malnutrition” and, as a starting point, to thrive people should be “eating about 1g per kilogram of body weight, or 1.2g if they’re active”.Patel says protein helps us feel fuller for longer because it’s a “complex molecule”. This means that when we eat it, it takes “a little bit more work for our bodies to metabolise and digest it”, but there is such a thing as too much protein. Patel says going above 2g to 2.2g per kg of body weight consistently – as anyone on theall-animal-product carnivore dietmight, for instance – is probably too much protein, because it risks “displacing other key nutrients”, including fibre.View image in fullscreen‘Whole food sources such as meats, fish and eggs are packed with nutrients, minerals and compounds that supplements can’t replicate.’Photograph: Tatjana Baibakova/AlamyWhen it comes to finding the best way of consuming protein, she says, “Food first should be our priority” because whole food sources such as meats, fish and eggs are packed with nutrients, minerals and compounds “that supplements can’t replicate”. However, protein powders can have their place. “We need to use them as a tool, v being your go-to,” she says. She recommends going for an unflavoured powder as a regular option because “there’s lots of sweeteners and emulsifiers” in heavily flavoured options. And if you’re making a shake to replace a meal, adding ingredients such as Greek yoghurt, fruit or nut butters can help make it more “balanced”.It’s not just shakes and powders that have benefited from the protein craze. A2023 studyfound about 1,200 products making protein claims on UK supermarket shelves, includingcereals,cheeseand evenpancakes. Dr Ada Garcia, a public health nutritionist at the University of Glasgow, who led the study, says most of these foods met a nutritional threshold to be “classified as healthy”, but she cautions shoppers to pay attention to how these protein claims are phrased.The real science of weight loss with the US’s leading nutritional scientist – podcastRead moreUnderEU laws, which are still in place in the UK, for a product to be labelled a “source of protein”, the nutrient must make up at least 12% of its energy value. If something is labelled “high protein”, 20% of the product’s energy value must be provided by protein. Other phrases are more of a minefield. “There are things that manufacturers can say, for example: that a food provides a protein kick or a protein boost or is rich in protein. These claims are not regulated so they can add whatever amount of protein they like,” says Garcia.Protein mania shows no signs of slowing down, but at what point does it tip into an unhealthy obsession? Last year,the Grocer published a surveythat found 77% of people in the UK are looking to eat more protein, more than any other nutrient, including fibre (60%), probiotics (48%) and, unsurprisingly, fat (9%). “People are really nervous that they’re not getting enough protein, and I think a lot of social media influencers are really banking on that,” says Cutting-Jones.TikTok is full of videos of young people dry-scooping – where protein powders are eaten raw, without any liquid. Cutting-Jones says thisdangerous trend(health experts have warned that it can cause choking or infection) shows how things have “spiralled” out of control when it comes to tracking our nutrients. “We shouldn’t replace all the other facets of what food is by counting our every calorie and macronutrient intake. We’re not robots – food is about being human,” she says.Explore more on these topicsNutritionFitnessHealth & wellbeingFoodDiets and dietingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Less widely known, though, is the involvement of the US psychiatrist Douglas Kelley, who spent more than 80 hours interviewing and assessing Göring and 21 other Nazi officials prior to the trials. As described in Jack El-Hai’s 2013 bookThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist, Kelley was charmed by Göring but also haunted by his own conclusion that the Nazis’ atrocities were not specific to that time and place or to those people: they could in fact happen anywhere. He was ultimately destroyed by this discovery, and what he saw as the world’s reluctance to heed it.The writer-director James Vanderbilt, whose script for David Fincher’s enigmatic serial-killer dramaZodiacsimilarly explored the real-life case of a professional being corroded by his pursuit of truth, has used The Nazi and the Psychiatrist as the basis of his new film, Nuremberg. Russell Crowe plays the preening, charismatic Göring, Rami Malek plays Kelley, and Michael Shannon is Robert Jackson, the American supreme court justice who was not only instrumental in mounting the trials but went head-to-head with Göring in court.The line ‘Hitler made us feel German again’ is haunting. Very reminiscent of a line we hear todayFor Malek, it allowed him to re-examine ideas about evil that had been on his mind since playing Safin – the man who killed James Bond, no less – inNo Time to Die. “When I was playing a Bond villain, I used to remind myself, ‘He’s an evil human being.’ Then I started to question those thoughts.” He wanted to believe in evil, he says, but his empathy kept getting in the way. “The banality of it all struck me as well as it did Douglas Kelley. It must have been quite jarring for him to know that this could happen at any time, under any political regime, and it wasn’t restricted to a group of men in that period. We see now, and will continue to see, that atrocity is able to rise furiously and vigorously in mere moments. Sometimes it is because we’re willing to turn a blind eye towards it.”View image in fullscreen‘Not supposed to be comfortable’…Michael Shannon and Rami Malek as the US supreme court justice and the psychiatrist who prosecuted Göring during the Nuremberg trials.Photograph: Scott Garfield/APVanderbilt recognised in this material a kind of real-life Silence of the Lambs quality, with Kelley drawn into a seductive dance with a psychopath. “One of the fascinating things about Göring was that he was funny, gregarious, charming,” says the film-maker. “He loved his wife and kids – which to me makes him even more terrifying. He wasn’t Darth Vader, you know? But he craved power and was comfortable with other people suffering so long as he could maintain that power.”Shannon witnessed his co-star’s electrifying charisma in the role. “Russell really took the note about Göring being a charming man,” he says. “Some of the people playing the other members of the Nazi high command didn’t even have lines but he always made them feel like a group. They came in together singing songs, with Russell leading them.”Crowe had been attached to the film since 2019, and Vanderbilt had already been working on it for five years by then. But before it began shooting, another Holocaust movie emerged that adopted a radical new approach to the subject: the horrors in Jonathan Glazer’s Oscar-winningThe Zone of Interest, which is set largely in the house and garden adjacent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, are heard and hinted at but never shown.“I saw The Zone of Interest while we were in pre-production,” recalls Vanderbilt. “It’s a great film. I loved its point of view.” How concerned was he that it might leave the more traditional Nuremberg looking archaic, or even obsolete? “I think there’s room for different approaches,” he says. “Our film is a little bit more classical. A friend of mine calls a certain type of film – and The Zone of Interestisn’tone of these – ‘spinach movies’. You know: you have to eat your vegetables, do your homework, take your medicine. I worked hard to not make Nuremberg feel that way.”Shannon believes audiencesshouldtake their dose of Nuremberg, however. “It ought to be mandatory viewing,” he says. “Everybody should see the film, and everybody should think about what happened, because it has huge relevance to what’s happening now. But also, it’s a piece of entertainment. And that’s a strange thing, to make a piece of entertainment about such a serious subject. It’s a movie in the grand, old-fashioned sense of the word.”View image in fullscreen‘You have to imagine what you can’t see’ … The Zone of Interest.Photograph: A24He, too, admires The Zone of Interest. “It puts the audience in a position where they have to imagine what they can’t see,” he says. “That’s when you’ve truly engaged them.” But whereas Glazer’s film shows next to nothing, Nuremberg takes the opposite tack: it includes a five-minute excerpt from the documentary footage of the concentration camps that was projected during the trials.Shooting the scene in which that is played in court left Shannon feeling queasy. “While I was being filmed watching the footage, I was very uncomfortable with the idea of quote-unquote ‘acting’. I didn’t want the camera on me. Something about it seemed kind of profane, and yet I understand why it is in the film. You’ll notice I introduce the footage and then they don’t cut back to me. I think that’s a reflection on how uncomfortable I was. They probably said, ‘Let’s not cut back to Shannon. He looks funny.’”When I relay this to Vanderbilt, he laughs and denies any such thing. “Michael was brilliant. And we’re not always supposed to be comfortable when we’re doing our work, right? I asked the cast not to watch the footage from the camps ahead of shooting because I wanted them to be fresh on the day. We brought in a real projector. We had 300 extras in court. I went in and said, ‘This is going to be a tough day, but I think it’s very important for the story we’re telling.’ We had a moment of silence, then rolled the film. I don’t want to say that no acting was required, but you’re seeing a lot of real emotions in those faces.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not least the moment when Göring says admiringly of Hitler that he “made us feel German again”. Vanderbilt denies any intentional echoes of a more recent US political slogan. “I wrote that line in 2014,” he points out. Maybe so, but he also chose to keep it in the script even once the Maga movement had gained not only adherents but ubiquity. “Sure. Look, I understand the desire to relate it to today, and I’m not saying people shouldn’t. I’m not trying to be vague. I just think that all good drama speaks to us about where we are now.”It’s understandablethat Vanderbilt should not want to deter Trump supporters from seeing his film. Malek, though, is less circumspect. “‘Hitler made us feel German again’ is a haunting line that is shattering in its simplicity,” he says. “And it’s very reminiscent of a line we hear today, which ends with the same word.” He is conspicuously not repeating the Maga slogan to which he is referring. However: “I think everyone reading your newspaper will know exactly what I mean.”View image in fullscreenSupervillain … Malek in the Bond movie No Time to Die.Photograph: Nicole Dove/© 2019 Danjaq, LLC And MGM. All Rights Reserved.Shannon goes even further. “The danger exists outside of this movie,” he says gravely when I ask whether giving so much screen time to Göring is playing with fire. “The danger is all around us. We are suckers for this charm. It’s going to be our downfall, it seems. We’d rather be entertained than taken care of. It’s tragic, really.”He describes the experience of life in the US today as “a nightmare. America is a nightmare right now. The country is mentally ill. It needs help. There seem to be delusions of grandeur and self-loathing in equal measure. It gets grimmer every day. I’ve never seen such dysfunction in my life. It’s really embarrassing.”At the end of the film, Kelley is reprimanded for bashing the US while promoting his book about the Nazis. Perhaps the publicists for Nuremberg will be tearing their hair out when they hear Shannon’s remarks. “I’m sure anybody who’s associated with promoting and selling this movie to the world is going to be horrified by everything I’ve said in this interview,” he agrees. “But I don’t really care.”Nuremberg is in UK cinemas from 14 November, and in Australian cinemas from 4 DecemberExplore more on these topicsPeriod and historical filmsRami MalekSecond world warNazismMichael ShannoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But it might just be its most dullStuart HeritageTue 11 Nov 2025 08.56 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 09.13 ESTShareIf there is one tried and true formula when it comes to television, it is this: when you run out of ideas, bring the kids in. This formula is why everything from MasterChef to The Great British Bake Off to Taskmaster has, at some point, bitten the bullet and introduced a junior version. And now it’s time forCome Dine With Meto join the gang.Which is probably a bit late, all said. It took five years for MasterChef to bring in a junior version, and just one for Bake Off. Meanwhile, Come Dine With Me is 20. To call it long in the tooth would be a profound disservice to long teeth.Come Dine With Me: Teens – for that is the title of the new series – just drives this point home further. The contestants who appear are between 16 and 19 years old. This means that they are all younger than Come Dine With Me. Not a single one of them knows what it is to live in a world where Come Dine With Me has yet to be invented. If that doesn’t make your skin sag and your bones creak, I’m not sure what will.Why did it take Come Dine With Me so long to bring in a teen version? The answer, you suspect, probably had something to do with its presentation. The thing that has always set Come Dine With Me apart from its army of imitators is Dave Lamb, who doesn’t so much narrate episodes as audibly roll his eyes at them. In its purest form, Come Dine With Me is raw footage of people doing their best to cook a nice meal while Dave Lamb calls them all idiots. And while that might be funny when your cook is a self-consciously wacky man from Tonbridge, it’s less funny when it’s an innocent teenager.Fortunately, on the basis of Monday’s first episode (of five; a longer run is planned in the near future), Lamb has toned down his Lambiness a little bit. He’s less of an attack dog here and, while this suits the age of the contestants, you can still sometimes hear him choke back on his instincts to be sarcastic.For example, one of the young contestants is Ben, a gym bunny who takes to kissing his own biceps whenever there’s a camera on him. Had Ben been 35, there is a very good chance that Lamb would have ripped him to shreds. But he is a teenager, and even when he admits to thinking that a beef wellington is a type of footwear (an open goal if ever there was one), the best Lamb can manage in response is a strangulated “I get your logic”.That said, maybe he’s just warming up. The joy of Come Dine With Me has always been watching it evolve over the week, with everyone’s quirks and flaws becoming more apparent as the episodes wear on. By Friday, there’s a very good chance that the teenagers will have worn Lamb down. There were even signs of it on Monday, with Lamb screaming “SHUT UP” when two contestants revealed that they had never eaten soup before.A bigger problem, though, is how dull it is to watch. You might put this down to the age of the contestants. They are, after all, blank slates to whom nothing interesting has ever happened; they have had nothing like enough time to build up the levels of resentment necessary to unleash a “What a sad little life, Jane” outburst.But possibly it’s bigger than that. Possibly the format has just ossified. This is far from the first spin-off that Come Dine With Me has attempted. Daytime Come Dine With Me begat primetime Come Dine With Me, which in turn begat Celebrity Come Dine With Me, then Couples Come Dine With Me, and then Come Dine With Me: The Professionals. For a while we even had Come Date with Me, which might as well have just been a gif of Dave Lamb eating himself.Come Dine With Me: Teens might spark to life eventually. One of this week’s intake is a catering student who dresses as Elvis, has no working knowledge of pop culture and brings tubs of Celebrations everywhere he goes. With a little coaxing and a creative edit, he might just blossom into a Come Dine With Me eccentric for the ages. But for now, it doesn’t feel likely. Let’s score it four out of 10 in the back of a taxi when it isn’t listening.Come Dine With Me: Teens is on Channel 4 now.Join Stuart Heritage and other Guardian journalists at a special live event hosted by Nish Kumar on 26 Nov.

It wasn’t until many years later that I discovered the truthByPamela GordonTue 11 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 09.24 ESTShareCraig was a runaway when I first met him. Missing from a local children’s home, he spent his days hanging out inNottinghamcity centre. He had just turned 13 and he was tall for his age, easily recognisable with his blond hair, but he seemed invisible to the authorities.No one was looking for him or the other dozen children who congregated on the market square. Most of them had absconded from care, some were dodging school. A few, like Craig’s mate Mikey, just didn’t bother going home. The youngest runaway, Mark, claimed he’d been missing from foster care for months and had spent his 12th birthday on the run. They were glad to have found each other and for a week or so they slept together in an alleyway. Craig organised bedding. He had picked up some tips from the experienced rough sleepers, he told me, as he collected cardboard he’d stored behind a bin. “Keeps the cold off your bones,” he said, without confidence. That was his first taste of being homeless.It was 1998 and I was in Nottingham filming Staying Lost, a documentary series for Channel 4. The number of runaways in the UK was at crisis point. A Children’s Society report estimated that 100,000 children ran away every year. Our series set out to follow some, like Craig, who survived on the streets, existing outside the system. We documented his life as he stumbled from one precarious situation to the next. On the face of it, he seemed unfazed by the chaos around him. He was often quiet, watching as street dramas played out in front of him. It was difficult to read what he was thinking and just how lost he felt.Once in a while, Craig would catch the bus four miles up the road to the 1970s estate where he grew up. I went there with him one day, half hoping I would find out the truth about why he’d ended up in care in the first place. Craig was pleased to show me round his “manor” as he called it. Teenagers cruised up and down on bikes that were far too small for them and there were trainers strung up over telephone wires. “Thrown up there for a laugh. There’s not much to do round here,” Craig admitted, although he seemed genuinely pleased to be back.We went into his mum’s. And if I was expecting some clues to his past the carefully wiped surfaces and dusted ornaments gave nothing away. The house was full, he explained to me. His sister and her baby lived there although his older brother had his own place now. His mum made me a cup of tea, but had little to say to her youngest son. According to her, he was “a nightmare” and his antics, as she called them, were too much for her. He’d had his last chance and she’d put him in care. No one could deal with him, she told me. It was unclear how much anyone had tried.Our visit was short lived. If he’d ever had a room, it was no longer available. In fact, there was no sign left that he’d ever lived there. No point in sticking around when you don’t feel wanted. So 13-year-old Craig jumped on the bus back to town and began the search for where he would sleep that night.The novelty of a cardboard mattress had worn thin and Craig started to seek out more sheltered places to hide. He called me once from a half-derelict squat near the station. A bloke called Jock was letting him crash in an old armchair but it was too noisy to sleep. Mates of Jock’s turned up unannounced at all hours, with unexplained bloody noses and unpredictable tempers.When the weather was OK Craig tried “camping out” on the Forest recreation ground but it was too “on top” as he called it. The nearby red-light district was busy and punters cruising past made for an uneasy atmosphere. Shadows slipped in and out of the headlights and Craig knew that girls from the children’s homes were working there. He’d heard stories of young boys selling sex in the public toilets. It was the 90s and exploited children were still prosecuted and labelled as “child prostitutes” or “rent boys”. After a couple of nights, Craig headed back into town.Every now and again the police would come across Craig in the town centre and take him back to the children’s home. Protesting half-heartedly, he would allow himself to be put in the back of the van. A few hours later he’d be back. Nobody at the home stopped him leaving. And nobody asked what he was running from.“He was trying to escape,” Jodie Young told me recently. “You risk something worse happening to you when you run off but you still feel anywhere’s better than care.” Jodie had been spat out of the care system herself and at 18 she was addicted to heroin, putting in long hours begging near the Midland Bank cashpoint. She became an unlikely protector of Craig and the others, letting them stay at the flat she shared with her boyfriend, Dave, and their jack russell, Penny. “I knew they were scared,” she said. “I wanted to give them somewhere safe.”A few years earlier, Jodie had spent some time at Beechwood House, the residential home Craig was missing from. If anyone knew why he had run, it was Jodie. Neither of them talked about life in the home. Whatever the truth was, they had an unspoken understanding to bury it. For a while, Jodie’s flat was a safe place. They had proper mattresses on the floor and sometimes bought Pot Noodles to eat together in the evening. Jodie warned the young runaways against heroin, although she was losing that battle herself. Above all, there was a feeling that everyone in the flat was in the same boat. They’d been let down by everyone whose responsibility was to care for them. It was up to them to look out for each other.By the time filming was coming to an end, this temporary stability was over. Jodie and Dave had been evicted, the little dog, Penny, taken away and the flat boarded up. Now 14 and a good foot taller, Craig once more found himself with nowhere to go. Even the police had given up taking him back to care. It felt like a dangerous crossroads, so I took a chance and suggested a visit to his mum’s. After an awkward start she grudgingly agreed that he could stay on the sofa for a while. Rules were laid down, promises made and a spare duvet was found. But I didn’t hold my breath. Things didn’t work out and soon enough Craig called letting me know he was on the move again.For 18 months, Craig had trusted us to film the reality of his life as a runaway, when suddenlyNottingham city council stepped inclaiming they were responsible for him and we had no right. They sought an injunction to stop the documentary from airing but after a gruelling few days being cross-examined in the Royal Courts of Justice, thejudgment went in our favour. Craig was entitled to have his story told and Staying Lost was broadcast in April 2000, when he was almost 16.I still hoped that things might turn around for him, but in the year after the film aired, the police started picking Craig up for minor crimes and before long he landed up in a young offender institution. I visited him during that first stint inside. He got me a cup of coffee from a machine in the corner of the visitors’ room. He had an idea of training to be a mechanic but first he’d have to find somewhere to live. He wasn’t sure how he’d manage that. He was almost a grown man by now, not a priority for housing. And statistics on the fate of care leavers were stacked against him. It wasn’t long before he knew his prison number by heart.At first he was still seeing how far he could take things. When he was about 19, he came up with the idea of robbing a small supermarket by pretending he had a gun in his pocket. The terrified cashier handed over the contents of the till and he legged it with the lot. But it wasn’t Craig’s style. He was back in the morning to turn himself in. “I just couldn’t get it out of my head,” he told a friend later. “I’d scared the life out of that woman and I couldn’t live with that.”Steven Ramsell first encountered him in 2004. “I have a memory of sitting opposite Craig in the old dingy Bridewell police station,” Ramsell, who is a solicitor advocate, told me. “He was one of the first people I represented. If you looked at the outer husk you’d see a shop thief, a pest. Yes, he’d commited a load of crime, but it was low level stuff, and it was the only thing he knew.” Craig drew the line at house burglary but had become expert at lifting phones and purses. By the time he was 25, Craig was a regular client and, according to Ramsell, almost incapable of functioning in modern society. “While I was out there I just did not know how to live normally,” Craig wrote to me in 2017 from HMP Nottingham. “I felt awkward and out of place all the time. It’s no excuse for the crimes I did. But I just don’t know where or how to start.”View image in fullscreenCraig in Staying Lost, a 1998 Channel 4 documentary.Photograph: Channel 4There were people who tried to help him in those early years. People who remembered him as a kid let him use the shower or get his head down for a few nights. Some let him stay longer. But then Craig would “pay back the favour” by filling the fridge with stolen food, the police would turn up at the door, patience would wear out, and he’d be on his way again. “Craig is his own worst enemy,” people would say.Over the next 10 years I often lost track of whether he was in or out. Then out of the blue I would answer my phone to an automated voice. “This call is from a person currently in a prison. All calls are recorded and may be listened to by a member of prison staff. If you do not wish to accept this call, please hang up now.” Then Craig would come on the line, explaining the complex mess of arrests and outstanding warrants, recalls and remand hearings that had resulted in him being locked up again. “How are you doing, Pam?” he would never fail to ask. And I would try to find little things to tell him, all too aware that he’d find it hard to imagine the life I led. He liked to hear where I’d been and how my family were and he knew I was relieved to hear from him.Often, he would ask me to send another DVD copy of Staying Lost. He was proud of the film. He always said it was the only thing he’d ever really finished. He tried to show it to prison officers and volunteers on the inside. I think he hoped that by watching it they would get some idea of how much he’d been through and that maybe one day someone would come up with the answer to how he could sort his life out. But officers were neither inclined nor equipped to ponder prisoners’ life stories. “You should make a follow-up documentary on me, Pam,” he’d often say. “That’d show people what it’s like, what happened to me next.” But TV had moved on. I was told by one executive that Craig just didn’t have a “TV face”.Time and again Craig would walk out of the prison gate with no address. He’d leave with the best intentions of going to see his probation officer. But those appointments were often fraught and filled with forms and applications he couldn’t handle. And they usually led to a dead end. So, he’d find a mate to stay with. Someone who was doing him a favour. I could sometimes hear the chaos of those places in the background if he called me. “It’s sound here,” Craig would reassure me. But things would soon unravel.I remember how often Craig lost his few possessions, left in a hostel or at a mate’s house. There was usually a stereo, a “really good one” that he’d not been able to carry. And always a pair of trainers he’d managed to leave behind, even though the ones he was wearing were ready for the bin. During one particularly freezing winter, his stuff was lost when he was transferred between jails and he was released into a bitter morning outside HMP Hull with nothing more than the regulation sweatshirt and trackies he was wearing. I’d called the prison and tried to ask them to find clothes for Craig but as usual it was impossible to get through. It was only thanks to the resourceful and dedicated chaplaincy team that someone was able to meet him at the gate with a coat and scarf from the lost property.No one wakes up in the morning and decides to become a heroin addict, Jodie once told me. And I’m certain it wasn’t a decision Craig made, but that’s what happened. During his longer stints in prison, he’d sometimes get on to a drug reduction programme and get clean. But drugs are easy to score behind bars, and all too often offered a way to cope. “I run back to the drugs,” Craig once wrote to me, “cos I know how to be a druggie, I know what I have to do, or have to act, where other situations I haven’t a clue. Things get too emotional for me. I even panic when I’m just attending appointments whether it’s the jobcentre or whatever I just panic in my head. I feel like I’m 13 years old again when I’m out.”By the time he was 33, Craig had 170 offences on his record and was spending less and less time on the outside. “He was institutionalised,” Ramsell told me. He’d been round the system so many times. Any support he got was never strong enough to spark a change. “There should be another option, but there wasn’t,” Ramsell said. “And Craig always knew what was coming. Back on the merry-go-round.” So, in the spring of 2018 the door of Nottingham prison revolved for Craig again and he was back on the wing.During the months that followed, Craig was in touch more than usual. At the time, Nottingham was one of theworst prisons in the country. It had recently been issued an urgent notification from the chief inspector of prisons – essentially, the institution has been put into special measures. The tensions that had simmered on the wings for years had finally reached boiling point. Officers and prisoners felt unsafe. Drugs, especially the noxious synthetic cannabinoid spice, were freely available. Over an 18-month period, 12 prisoners took their own lives.“I don’t even escape my problems when I’m asleep,” Craig wrote from his cell. “I live a nightmare in the days and when I sleep. I just don’t know if I can cope no more. My head is a mess and the days are just getting worse for me. I want a rest from myself.” His phone calls became desperate, and his letters got longer. I worried if I didn’t hear from him every day. Chaplain John Seeney was instrumental in getting Craig through that sentence. “We have to hang in there with Craig,” Seeney would say to me. Every Tuesday, Craig would ask to be let off the wing to attend the prison chapel where Seeney and the small multifaith team offered a place to talk and be heard. Craig was there without fail and even started writing some poems singing the praises of the support he’d found.View image in fullscreenCraig, as seen in Staying Lost, aged about 14, being taken back to the children’s home by police.Photograph: Channel 4And, as if by way of a small miracle, when Craig was released in early 2019, Seeney managed to negotiate him a room in a house connected to a church group in Ilkeston, a small town outside Nottingham. I travelled up on the train and he met me from the station. He’d been swimming, he told me, and he’d been to the library to try to learn how to use a computer. He had the key to his shared house on a long string and opened the door. He had milk in the fridge, and he made me a cup of tea. We spent a normal afternoon in the sunny back yard, and I still have a photo of him with a glimmer of hope in his eye.Before I got the train home, he took me to the church where he was volunteering, helping with their daily pop-in cafe. The other volunteers, who were much older, busied themselves with an antiquated tea urn and plastic boxes full of biscuits. There was a confusion about the “tea-towel rota” and Craig stepped up and offered to take his turn. A woman handed over a plastic bag full of towels and dish cloths with a slightly quizzical look in her eye. I remember worrying as we left the church hall about whether he had a washing machine or knew how to use it.A few weeks later, there was trouble. Rules for ex-prisoners are tough and trust is hard won. He ended up being chucked out for inviting “friends” round and throwing a kettle across an empty room. No more cups of tea. He was recalled to prison.We often talked about that afternoon, and I always said that now he’d managed to live in his own place once, he could do it again. But although he listened, I believe he knew his chances were running out.At 35, Craig was looking at a longer sentence than usual after the recall. On the positive side, it meant he might have access to some of the support that was unavailable during shorter stretches. A woman named Tara Tan had recently started working as an art psychotherapist in Nottingham, partly thanks to the efforts of the ever-resourceful John Seeney. The chaplain hoped that art therapy might be a good fit for Craig, helping him express things he couldn’t find words for. “He liked to use colour pencils,” Tan recalled. “He would colour in, and sometimes he would draw. But I think he used the space more for somewhere he could let out frustrations with no fear of judgment.”View image in fullscreenPamela Gordon with Jodie Young.Photograph: HandoutAt the start, Craig told me he didn’t feel anything but numb and that worried him. “I’m closed off emotionally to everything,” he told me on the phone. “That’s been as far back as I can remember.” Tan noticed this, too. “He found it difficult to open up for fear of being hurt more,” she told me. “You need to make sure you leave the sessions on a positive because you’re sending someone back to the wing knowing they’ll be locked up in their cell alone.”Then in July 2019, while Craig was working with Tan, the independent inquiry into child sexual abusepublished its investigationinto how Nottingham council had responded to allegations of sexual abuse from children in care.“For decades, children who were in the care of Nottinghamshire council suffered appalling sexual and physical abuse, inflicted by those who should have nurtured and protected them,” announcedProf Alexis Jay, chair of the inquiry. “Those responsible for overseeing the care of children failed to question the extent of sexual abuse or what action was being taken.”Beechwood House, where Craig had been placed between the ages of 13 and 14, received a special mention. Violence was common and sexually abusive staff members were allowed free rein. Children’s allegations were ignored. Beechwood had finally been shut down in 2006, seven years after Craig’s time there. It turns out that there had been an awful lot to run away from.The last time I saw Craig in person was in autumn 2019. He invited me up to HMP Nottingham for a ceremony celebrating the end of a training course he’d completed on staying straight. In the 12 sessions he had been taught skills for “a life free from offending and drug misuse”. Although I was a bit unclear about what magic key Craig had been given to help him avoid his past mistakes, it was a proud day. John Seeney was there, of course, and Tara Tan. The governor made an appearance, and cake was served on paper plates. An ex-prisoner gave a talk about how you could turn things around, about how much was possible if you tried hard and wanted it enough. I watched Craig step up to receive his certificate as he smiled, half full of hope.But over the next few years, fresh starts became harder and ended sooner. There was a sense that time was running out. Earlier this year, on 10 May, Craig spent another birthday behind bars. I heard from him as usual just before he was released.“Hiya Pam, it’s me, Craig here on the pen. Well now, I’m officially 41. Just 16 more days to go till I’m back in the big wide world. I just hope it stays that way and I can finally get my life turned round …”In that email he said he was hopeful of getting somewhere to live when he got out at the end of May. He’d had an assessment for housing a few days before and thought that with the council’s help, for once, he wouldn’t be on the streets again. And so the countdown began to another release, another clean slate. He promised to call when he got to probation to sort his benefits out. By then he’d know his new address, he said.It wasn’t a surprise when he didn’t call. After a week or so of not hearing from him, the usual worry began. I called a few people in Nottingham to find out if anyone had seen him. No one had. So, I waited for him to show up as he always had before. Waited for him to call, probably from someone else’s phone, saying that he’d messed up his appointments or that he had no money for the bus to get to probation. Or that he’d just been sleeping for days and that he was sorry.The call never came. On the night of 29 June 2025, Craig was found dead. A passerby found him slumped on some steps outside a house, the police told me. He was only a mile from the alleyway where he had slept rough as a 13-year-old.It’s not clear yet which new set of statistics Craig will be added to. He will definitely be counted in this year’s homeless deaths, which numbered 1,600 last year. And he might join the UK drug deaths total, which reached 5,565 last year, the highest number since records began in 1993. It’s possible that he was a casualty of synthetic opioids. The number of those deaths has almost quadrupled in England and Wales,from 52 in 2023 to 195 in 2024. Or perhaps the drugs that contributed to his death won’t be recorded at all. The Office for National Statistics admits that figures for drug misuse are more than likely undercounted. Whatever the case, statistics like this can only explain in the narrowest way why Craig died.I later found out that Craig had been released, that final time, into emergency accommodation, rather than the longer term residence he was hoping for. He’d been offered a bed through The Community Accommodation Service, which provides short-term housing for prisoners released with no fixed address. It’s a last resort when “nothing else has been achieved”, someone from the Probation Service told me. Craig had apparently burned most of his bridges with them. “He struggled to engage,” they said. “But there are a lot of unanswered questions.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HandoutI emailed Steven Ramsell and told him the news. “It was a sad day in our office,” Ramsell said when he called me later. He asked about the funeral and I told him that Craig’s immediate family had opted for a public health service, which would be arranged and paid for by the council. “A paupers’ funeral,” said Ramsell. “The final tragedy in a tragic life.”Craig’s cremation took place on 11 August. Not wanting it to go unmarked, John Seeney went and was allowed to say a few words. He told me he gave Craig’s coffin a little pat, as a goodbye from us all. Ten days later, Seeney and I organised a memorial for Craig inside Nottingham prison in the Chapel where Craig had found some sanctuary over the years. Jodie Young, Tara Tan and about 20 of the current inmates were there.Seeney had made an order of service on the chaplaincy printer. My photo of Craig smiling in that back yard in Ilkeston was on the cover. I brought in another photo of him from when he was 13. I remember the moment it was taken. Craig was talking about blackberry picking with another runaway. Even then, it had felt so distant from the life he was living. We stood it on the chapel altar in a glassless frame.A couple of the prisoners stood up and shared memories of Craig. One, Jayden, who remembered robbing crack houses with him, shook his head in amazement that he’d survived a chaotic life on the streets and Craig had not. We laughed as people recounted the wilder stories from Craig’s life, like the time he leapt off a bridge while being chased by police and fortunately landed on a passing train. He always maintained to the chaplain that God had scheduled it to arrive just in time.Jodie was too upset to speak. After 30 years of heroin use, she will mark her two-year anniversary of being clean this December. She works as a drugs peer mentor. “My heart feels like it’s been smashed to pieces,” she told me quietly. “What’s the point of me volunteering at drug services and helping save people’s life when I can’t even save the people I care about?”Craig used to say how he’d love to donate his body to science, how they’d learn a lot from him. “It’s just that I wouldn’t know anything about it, Pam,” he used to laugh. And it’s true that no stone is being left unturned to try to work out what combination of longtime drug use, poor health, despair or neglect killed him in the end. The postmortem is under way, and an inquest is planned. In an extremely unusual move, the pathologist has retained the whole of Craig’s brain to enable them to carry out a detailed examination. So many resources are being spent now that he’s gone.In the chapel, Seeney played some music, a kind of mystical South American track which felt strangely comforting and we sat in silence with our own memories. As we got ready to leave that afternoon and officers were called to take the prisoners back to the wings I thought about how Craig would feel to see us all here. That he’d never believe how missed he is.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignThe best stories take time.

It is hope that feels cautious, like it might dissolve if you breathe too hard. It is learning to live again inside a body that remembers grief.I am now officially in my third trimester, and each day brings small signs of life: a flutter, a roll, a hiccup, the steady rhythm of his heart. I am growing a baby I will meet, hold and raise. But I have also carried a baby I never got to meet. For 13 weeks, my body held her. It nurtured her, protected her, grew her placenta, still believing she was safe. And in a way, she was. My husband told me then: “She only ever knew love and warmth”, and that has never left me.That first pregnancy made me a mother. It changed how I moved through the world, my sense of self, and how I understood love; the kind that expands quietly and invisibly into areas of your heart that you didn’t know were there before. When we learned her heart had stopped, it was as though mine did too, at least for a while. My body continued to hold her, to love her, even in death. It’s called a “missed miscarriage”: the body holds on to and continues to nurture a baby whose heart has stopped beating. There was both cruelty and comfort in that: that my body did not fail her, but could not save her either.Pregnancy after loss means living in parallel timelines; one where life was interrupted, and another where it continuesThe day I brought her into the world was unlike anything I’d known. As part of the medical management of a “missed miscarriage”, I chose to take medication to help my body bring my baby into the world. I was at home with just my husband, guided only by waves of intense pain that rose and fell until they broke. It felt like labour, though no one called it that, and it feels unfair to do so. The world would mark this as a miscarriage; a clinical word for something that felt both sacred and unbearable. I brought her into the world through pain and love. She came quietly, and the world moved on. But I didn’t.No link between paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children, review findsRead moreToday, a year later, I will walk through the same hospital corridors, this time carrying a baby whose heart beats strong. I will bring him into the world surrounded by support, recognition and celebration. It will be called my “first birth”, though that doesn’t feel entirely true. I have already laboured once before, just without witnesses, and in a way that has no name and isn’t spoken about in society. This pregnancy feels both familiar and foreign; my body knows the path, but it also remembers where it led last time.There is a strange dissonance to carrying new life when you have known loss. Every appointment feels like both a promise and a test. Every heartbeat heard through the Doppler feels like a small miracle and a reminder of how fragile miracles can be. Love is no longer simple; it is layered with memory, stitched with what-ifs and almosts.People say things like “it was meant to be” but I can’t hold that thought comfortably. She was meant to be. And so is he. One doesn’t erase or justify the other. Both have meaning. Both are mine. I’ve learned that grief and love can coexist, not as opposites but as two currents running in the same river.Sometimes I think about how love changes shape. My love for her hasn’t faded; it’s deepened into something quieter, a pulse beneath everything. As my love for him grows, I find myself wanting to protect the space that belongs to her. They are not the same, and yet they are forever connected; two stories written across the same body.Pregnancy after loss means living in parallel timelines; one where life was interrupted, and another where it continues. It means joy tinged with fear, gratitude tangled with guilt, and hope that feels hard-won. It means understanding that love is not measured by outcome.Both of my babies have changed me. One taught me how to love without certainty. The other teaches me how to hope again. I carry them both – one in memory, one in movement – and they both belong entirely to me.Lauren Farrugia is a clinical psychologist with a PhD in psychologyExplore more on these topicsPregnancyOpinionChildbirthFamilyHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

All bets are offGaby HinsliffThey may lack Labour’s party machine, but Zack Polanski’s burgeoning popularity could have seismic consequences for British politicsTue 11 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 05.41 ESTShareWhen Zack Polanski won the Green leadership in September, hemade clearthat he was coming for Labour. At the time, his warning that “we’re here to replace you” still seemed faintly presumptuous, coming from a man who hasn’t even managed to get himself elected to parliament and whose party was only barely into single digits in the polls. Even battered and beleaguered as it was by autumn, Labour was still the big beast of the left: the only one big enough, anyway, to win a majority.Little more than a month on, pollstersare now talkingabout arguably the most underpriced wildcard in the 2025 pack, which is the prospect of the Greens overtaking Labour in the polls in the same way Reform overtook the Tories at the end of last year – not just in one rogue sample or outlier, but consistently enough to be credible.In themost recent YouGov poll, the Greens are still four points behind Labour. But that’s down from 12 points in August, just before Polanski was elected, and other polls have put them almost at parity. If both parties stick to their current trajectories – Labour drowning in pre-budget gloom and recriminations and the Greens surfing an optimistic wave of voters looking for a British equivalent to New York’s upbeat new socialist mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani – then the psychologically important crossover point could be only weeks away. Though polls are only ever a snapshot of a moment in time, revealing very little about the results of a general election that could still be four years away, that would nonetheless be a seismic moment.The two biggest obstacles to smaller parties breaking through are getting airtime, and convincing potential supporters that it won’t be a wasted vote. Like Nigel Farage before him, Polanski is good at making himself heard: his habit of saying bluntly out loud the things other politicians normally fudge has already made him big on TikTok, and is increasingly becoming his passport to TV studios. (According toanalysisby the PR consultancy Be Broadcast, he got many more broadcast mentions than the Liberal Democrats’ Ed Davey and almost as many as the Tories’ Kemi Badenoch between 1 September and 20 October: perhaps more surprisingly, the Greens also racked up the most positive, solution-focused coverage.) The real test, however, is whether he can convert all this into a sustained lead over Labour. For polling doesn’t just reflect reality; sometimes it can inadvertently accelerate it.Overtaking the Tories was what enabled Farage to claim that Reform really could win, that it had taken over from a collapsing Conservative party as the natural party of the right, and that it was safe for those previously worried about defecting to jump ship. It was the moment, in short, that the herd moved.It’s far harder for the Greens, with their four MPs, to claim the same kind of plausible dominance over a governing party with more than 400. But Labour’s achilles heel is its reliance on supporters who will grudgingly vote for them to beat Reform, but only because they don’t believe a more radical leftwing party could ever actually win. If enough of them start to conclude – rightly or wrongly, and given England’s longstanding electoral maths it may well be wrongly – that times have changed and the old constraints no longer apply, what then?Like Farage before him, Polanski is staggeringly underqualified for Downing Street – the highest elected office he has held is on the London Assembly – but he has the storytelling skills and creative political imagination that the more obviously qualified Keir Starmer lacks. He subverts questions about whether he’d serve in a Starmer coalition bycheekily arguingthat Starmer might not be around that long, and positions himself neatly one step ahead of where Labour seems destined, reluctantly, to end up. (If Rachel Reeves does deliver a soak-the-rich budget in November, expect Polanski – a longstanding advocate of wealth taxes – to claim credit for forcing her to the left.) His party conference speech,respondingas the Jewish leader of a zealously pro-Palestinian party to a Manchester synagogue stabbing which had happened only hours earlier, was strikingly deft and thoughtful for a relative novice.Of course, it’s Labour that still has the heft, the experience, the ground operation and the national network of candidates key to leading any leftwing alliance against Reform. But what they’ll lose, should that crossover point in the polls ever come, is the ability simply to assume seniority as of right. “We are not messing around,” Polanski warned, back in October. Evidently he meant it.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinionZack PolanskiLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Now is its chance to double down on reporting that serves the people of the UKRoger Mosey is a former head of BBC TV NewsTue 11 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTShareThe BBC is battered and sprawling on the canvas again. As a corporation executive, I lived through a number of these episodes:the Hutton reportinto coverage of Iraq, which resulted in the resignation of Greg Dyke as director general; and then theJimmy Savile revelations, which helped force out George Entwistle, even though he had nothing to do with the appalling crimes of history. Now Tim Davie hasresignedover the misleading editing of a Panorama programme, and the BBC’s enemies haven’t just scented blood: they have got it.There is only one response, and that is to get up and fight. As digital nonsense and lies swamp us every day, and tech billionaires in foreign countries decide what we see and hear, there is a stronger case than ever for British content and for journalism that serves the people of the UK – with some of those old-fashioned things such as honesty, accuracy and truth. Despite all the attacks upon it, and the whippings it administers to itself, theBBCis the country’s most trusted broadcaster. Its reach and its universality are why its foes hate it.But the BBC has to change, too. Some of its travails have been because sometimes it hasn’t been good enough. Its journalism is required byroyal charterto be of a higher quality and more distinctive than the market alone can provide; and that isn’t consistently the case. It has fallen for rookie errors – thefailure to identifythe family of the narrator of a documentary about Gaza, the indefensibleediting of Trump– that suggest a lack of managerial grip. Excellence, and the application of intelligence, are not consistent in BBC output; and recently the overwhelming number of puff pieces about Celebrity Traitors suggest a susceptibility in the newsroom for marketing mania with limp journalism.More challenging is the question of how it responds to the allegations of bias or being on the wrong side (however you define that) of the culture wars. Here the BBC is in a unique position, because it is the only media organisation in the UK funded by a compulsory licence fee – which is another reason why commercial organisations hack away at it. But with that requirement for everyone to pay for the corporation comes the obligation that the BBC should reflect all its audiences – nationalists, unionists, Reform voters in Clacton or Greens in Brighton.My own judgment is that the BBC has historically avoided a party political bias, but it has a well-meaning liberalism – it wants to be a force for good in the world – that can be inspiring to many but alienating to others. The BBC never truly understood the leave voters in the EU referendum, and over the years it has been nervous about providing a platform for opponents of large-scale immigration, thus ceding the territory to tabloid newspapers and GB News. It never got the forces driving Jeremy Corbyn, either.This reinforces that it is different from any other platform which leans one way or the other, and which may endorse political parties in an election campaign. Newspaper readerships were traditionally attracted to good journalism, certainly, but also by positions in a particular zone of the political spectrum with columnists and story selection to match. The BBC has to rely on its future funding from left and right and centre, and to navigate an editorial path through the massively more diverse and polarised nation that we have become.And that, I believe, is rather an exciting thing to do. A teeming public space where we can all meet and test ideas is something we’d need to invent if it didn’t already exist, and the virtues of a national conversation are obvious if you compare it with the anger-filled silos of social media. But with this comes obligations. You cannot start from the principle that some conscientiously held views are right and others are wrong; most acutely, arguments for trans rights and women’s rights must both be heard and not shouted down. Social progress over the centuries has been driven by open debate. In the even more disputed international reporting, the strengths and failures of the Israeli and Palestinian arguments must all be examined, and awkward facts can’t be avoided.That’s why debates about BBC bias so often miss the point. The rationale of the BBC should be to reflect the world as it is, to analyse it and to expose us to views we may disagree with or even find upsetting or distasteful. The time to worry is if everything we see or hear reflects our own perspective. It is why political interference should be implacably resisted, too: in the end, every politician just wants to hear more from their own party and it would like the questioning to be as docile as possible. Instead we should be hearing from every party in Westminster and subjecting them to grillings about how they respond to the concerns of voters. A current BBC sin is talking endlessly about Reform but not interrogating their policies. It is of a piece with broadcasters egging on Ed Davey tofall off sailboardsduring the election campaign as if those photo ops mattered more than his policies on tax and spend.So my proposal is to task the BBC’s journalism with working even harder to include everybody and every opinion that is within the law, and not to shirk from controversy. It doesn’t need yet more layers of regulation – just a commitment to public service and the accountability that admits when it gets it wrong. Directors general should not be judged and risk decapitation on the basis of individual mistakes. Instead, the best assessment is how the BBC tells us more about ourselves and each other and how we might live together in the future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there are many ways to honour the fallenTue 11 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 11.13 ESTShareAt the start of last week, I was thinking my regular Remembrance season thoughts – Are people wearing poppies earlier every year? – and by the middle of the week, I’d agreed to have a quick morning argument about poppies on the radio.David Lammyhad been caught in parliament without one, and roundly castigated. He had responded with sentiments to the effect that Remembrance Sunday was the most important day of the year; nobody found it more important than him; anyone who didn’t think it was important was not a patriot; and by sheer hideous happenstance, he had a new suit, and his poppy was on the other suit. Some of us were thus called on to adjudicate on remembrance, while the more agile wing of the commentariat was wondering how Lammy could afford a new suit.Anyway, my line hasn’t changed on this for at least 25 years. Wear a poppy, don’t wear a poppy, both are legitimate positions. Honouring the fallen is worthwhile. Finding all that performative honour a bit militaristic, and declining to have your love of country elided with celebration of war, even in a tinged-with-sorrow way, also worthwhile. You do you.The world around me has changed immeasurably in that time, however, and what was once a sidebar to the national debate is now a matter of rigid consensus. If you were a public figure seen not wearing a poppy, you would probably be proscribed as a terrorist organisation; in the best-case scenario, people would think you were simply incapable of any memory, maybe you had just come out of a coma. And this all seems a little extreme.It surprised me, when I heard the counter-argument to mine – from Simon Weston, Falklands veteran – that it was basically exactly the same. If people didn’t want to wear a poppy, fine, he said (I precis), just don’t go on and on about it.Anyway, Sunday came, I was bombing along the Thames on my bike, and I couldn’t figure out why I wasn’t allowed to cycle round Parliament Square, nor why all the crash barriers were down across Westminster Bridge. It wasn’t until I noticed a large number of people wearing medals that I clocked it; I’d spent so long arguing about poppies that I’d forgotten it was Remembrance Sunday. Obviously, I can’t speak for everyone; plenty of people did remember. But poppy-mania is all about the scrap, now, and actively blocks the one useful memory: choose harmony.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRemembrance DayOpinionDavid LammySecond world warcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet America’s poor are struggling to eatSteven GreenhouseWe may be in a golden age for the super-rich – but it doesn’t feel that way for the 42 million Americans who use SnapTue 11 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 14.10 ESTShareIt seems like an understatement to call this the New Gilded Age. Perhaps we should instead call it the Obscenely Over-the-Top Gilded Age, considering that Tesla shareholders just approved a $1tn pay package for Elon Muskand the market value of the chipmakerNvidia has rocketed above $5tn.Not only that, the 10 richest billionaires in the US saw their collective wealthsoar by $698bnover the past year, while Google’s former CEO,Eric Schmidt, reportedly paid $110mfor a 123-room mansion in Los Angeles to host events. And then there’s our billionaire president, who – when his family isn’traking in tens of millions of dollars through crypto– is obsessed with building a $300m, gilded-to-the-hilt ballroom, funded by fellow billionaires.While it no doubt feels like a golden age for Trump and the super-rich, it doesn’t feel that way for 42 million Americans who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food benefits. They just suffered through an alarming 10 days, with many saying they didn’t have enough money to feed their families because the Trump administrationmoved to haltSnap benefits for millions of Americans on 1 November.Trump told them in essence: Sorry, we don’t have the money to pay those benefits right now. That claim seems far-fetched considering that it costs the government$8bn a month to provide Snap benefits, while Trump had no problem finding$1.5tn to pay for big tax cutsfor America’s billionaires and millionaires in his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was beautiful for billionaires and millionaires, but not so much for everyone else.That this is a fabulous time for the wealthy and not so fabulous for most other Americans helps explain why Trump and the Republicans took a shellacking in this month’s elections. For millions of voters, one of the biggest concerns was affordability, the struggle that many face paying for housing, groceries and childcare. The New York City mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, made that his number one campaign issue, and his charismatic campaign helped make it a national issue – an issue that worked against Republicans because they control the White House and Congress.Voters also turned against Trump because he has failed to make good on one of his main campaign promises: to lower prices on day one. As president, Trump has hardly focused on reducing prices, while he’s focused largely on imposing tariffs on other countries – a move that’s raised prices for US consumers.Unfortunately, billionaire Trump seems way out of touch with the struggles of average Americans. Not only has heboasted about his new marble-and-gold bathroomand his planned Louis XIV-like ballroom, but he held a lavish, times-are-greatGreat Gatsby-inspired partyat Mar-a-Lago the day before his administration withheld Snap benefits for millions of Americans. If anyone needed a symbol of how out of touch Trump is, just look to thebikini-clad model dancingin a gigantic martini glass at the party’s entrance.“Trump was one of those that I was all for,” a West Virginia resident upset about the Snap cutofftold the New York Times Daily podcast. “But now, I feel likehe’s more about the money, and helping the rich, and not caring about the people that really do need help.”That’s a big reason Mamdani won. Far more than most politicians, Democratic or Republican, he comes across as “caring about the people that really do need help”. In this age of increased income inequality and $1tn pay packages, Mamdani wants to find money to help those who need help by increasing taxes on New York City’s billionaires and millionaires, many of whom have more money than they know what to do with. Nonetheless, some billionaires seemed to freak out because democratic socialist Mamdani was pushing an idea that American progressives and European social democrats have long pushed for: increasing taxes on the wealthy to help create a fairer society. Mamdani has called for a2%-a-year tax increase on those earning over $1m a yearto help make bus rides free and to make childcare universal and free (or at least far more affordable).Describing his philosophy, Mamdani said: “When we talk about my politics,I call myself a democratic socialistin many ways inspired by the words of Dr King from decades ago who said, ‘Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.” Mamdani was referring to a1961 speechby Martin Luther King Jr.Many of God’s children are hurting, and Mamdani made clear he cares about them.In his victory speech, he talked of “those so often forgotten by the politics of our city”: Trinidadian line cooks, Yemeni bodega owners, Senegalese taxi drivers, and Uzbek nurses.In last year’s campaign, Trump promised to battle for forgotten Americans, but he largely seems to have forgotten them. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act contained big cuts in Medicaid and Snap benefits – programs that millions of “forgotten Americans” rely on. Trump seemed to forget them once again during the government shutdown, when his administration said it couldn’t find money to finance Snap benefits even though the US Department of Agriculturehad previously said the money was there.Ever since the GOP got thumped on election day, Trump has focused more on affordability, mainly by lying about it (although he did get some pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices for weight-loss drugs).“We just lost an election,they said, based on affordability,” Trump said. “It’s a con job by the Democrats.”Even though inflation has increased since Trump returned to office, he said: “We are the onesthat have done great on affordability… Every price is down,”except beef. There, Trump was again untethered from the truth; in the 12 months before September 2025,coffee prices rose 18.9%, beef 14.7%, bananas 6.9% and sugar and sweets 6.7%.Some other prices, including gas and eggs, have declined somewhat. But Trump also boasted that energy costs had fallen, eventhough electricity prices jumped 10.5%during his first eight months back in office. Americans shouldn’t forget Trump’s campaign promise: “Under my administrationwe will be slashing energy and electricity prices by halfwithin 12 months, at a maximum 18 months.”Once again showing how truth-challenged he is, Trump boasted that the price of Walmart’s Thanksgiving dinner has declined by 25% from last year. But he failed to mention thatthis year’s Walmart dinner excludesmany important items from last year, among them sweet potatoes, pecan pie and muffin mix.No one should be fooled when Trump claims that prices are down and that he’s fighting hard for affordability. Nor should anyone be fooled when Trump says he’s fighting for forgotten Americans. (Trump seems to be fighting farharder for crypto billionaires.)It’s Mamdani, not Trump, who’s fighting for forgotten Americans, fighting for those struggling to make ends meet. According to the Census Bureau,40% of US adultssay they have difficulty making ends meet each month. If Trump and the Republicans were truly fighting for forgotten Americans, they would have quickly found the $8bn to continue Snap benefits during the shutdown. If Trump and the GOP truly cared about struggling Americans, they would have quickly backed the Democrats’ demand to extend Obamacare subsidies to 22 million people and prevent their premiums from soaring. In that way, Trump and the GOP would have prevented the shutdown. And if Trump and Republicans truly cared about struggling Americans, they would join Mamdani in trying to make childcare affordable for every family.If Democrats hope to win in 2026 and beyond, they should focus their message on two things: first, that they’re fighting day in and day out to make life more affordable for average Americans and that they’re eager to tax billionaires more to help make necessities like housing, healthcare and childcare more affordable. Second, that while they’re fighting for affordability, Trump is fighting for his tariffs, his gilded ballroom and sending troops into America’s cities – none of which does a thing to help the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskNvidiacommentShareReuse this content"

We should copy its tactics to defeat fast fashionNicole LipmanThe dirt-cheap clothing company has opened its first permanent store in Paris – and politicians and workers have united against itTue 11 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 11.25 ESTShareParis is the fashion capital of the world – a paradise of couture and craftsmanship stretching back centuries. The city’s very name connotes luxury and glamour. But last Wednesday, 5 November, a sprawling Shein outlet opened on the sixth floor of the BHV Marais, the historic department store directly across from Paris’s city hall. It’s the Singapore-based ultra-fast-fashion store’s first permanent bricks and mortar retail space, and the first of several permanent outposts Shein plans to open in France in the near future. Many Parisians aren’t happy about it.Shein – launched as SheInside in 2011 in Nanjing, China – is the reprehensible paragon of the ultra-fast-fashion industry. The company sells clothing (and home goods, toys, stationery, cookware, blankets, pet supplies and more) at an unfathomable scale: today’s “new in” page alone lists more than 1,300 items, from shiny gold shirts in its “Manfinity Mode” category, to plunging, plus-size swimsuits under the sub-brand “Slaysola”. Nearly everything on the site ismade of plastic, designed for single-use disposability, and it’s all shockingly, disturbingly cheap.Shein is an economic affront to France’s fashion industry and labour market, and the French government has been going after the company for years. In 2023, at theurging of two French MPs, the French branch of the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched an investigation into Shein’s human rights, labour law and environmental violations, finding in 2025 Shein failed to uphold OECD standard in these areas. (Sheinrejected claimsit had breached any EU legislation, and questioned the neutrality of the investigation). In 2024, the French lower house of parliament approved a bill penalising fast fashion companies for environmental impacts; this June, the Senatepassed a modified versionof the bill, singling out Shein and other ultra-fast fashion companies as particularly egregious offenders. In the past three months, France hasfined Sheinnearly €200m for consumer protection violations and “misleading discounts”. (Shein contests the fines.)Most significantly, last Wednesday – motivated by the discovery of both “childlike” sex dolls and weapons for sale on Shein’s website – France’s prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, moved toblock the company’s e-commerce entirely. Immediately, the government suspended all Shein deliveries and flagged more than 200,000 packages for customs investigation. Deliveries wereresumed by the weekendafter Shein removed the offending products, although the PM noted that “Shein will remain under close surveillance by state services.” The concurrent timing of the attacks on Shein’s e-commerce and the new BHV Marais storefront seems intentional: it’s a strategic and effective approach designed to hobble the company at all points.The presence of Shein in France is more than an economic affront – it’s a cultural one, too. Shein stands in direct opposition to values the French stereotypically hold dear: artistry and durability, sustainability and chicness. BHV Marais staff, bolstered by support from the major French trade unions,have staged numerous strikesand demonstrations in recent weeks, and several independent retailers have pulled their products from the department store in protest. More than 100,000 French citizenshave signedan online petition opposing Shein’s presence in the city. And on opening day, protesters with anti-Shein signs wereforcibly removedfrom the store by police. The French fear Shein’s impact on the economy and labour markets, but also what the brand stands for: dirt-cheap clothing, at the expense of ethics.Yet for all the protests, fines and resistance, there’s a reason Société des Grands Magasins (BHV’s owner) has leased its retail space to Shein: it knows Shein’s shoddy, ultracheap and unethical clothes will sell.Sheinis the fifth-largest clothing retailer by volume in France, celebrated as an accessible retailer for trendy fashion. Behind the rows of protesters on Wednesday carrying signs reading “SHAME ON SHEIN” stood hundreds of Parisians, waiting patiently in line to enter Shein’s new, permanent, super-cheap emporium. They left carrying bulging shopping bags of polyester sweaters and shimmering going-out tops, muted pastel workwear and plastic, faux-leather winter coats. Most likely, they felt they had scored a bargain.Behind those low prices are enormous, insurmountable costs. There arethe coststothe environment. There are the costs to garment workers: paidpennies to toil,unendinglyin factories that supply Shein products the world over. There are thecosts to independent designers, whose work has regularly been ripped off by Shein. And there are the social, cultural costs, too: the lesson that clothing is worth so little, and the expectation that our garments are temporary.France’s regulatory attacks on Shein – and labour’s decisive, united opposition to the company – are powerful, necessary measures. By making it harder to purchase from Shein through corporate regulation, we can discourage the growth of ultra-fast fashion and limit its power in the market. Social pressure, led by workers arm-in-arm with consumers, may be an even more powerful weapon – when buying from Shein is widely considered shameful, no one will want to be caught in a Slaysola bathing suit.Still, the fight against fast fashion is ultimately a slow one. To truly defeat Shein, we must radically re-evaluate and reorient our relationship to clothing. We must learn to love the clothes we already have. We can dampen the environmental impact of textile manufacturing by committing to buying only secondhand. We must learn to mend things and invest care in our clothes, instead of disposing of them at the first signs of damage. Along the way, we must fight for better working conditions and better pay for garment workers everywhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mr Infantino did not hold back in lauding the president’s peace-making prowess,commenting: “Now we can really write some new pages. Pages of togetherness, of peace, in a region which really, really needs it.”News that Fifa is to launch its own annual peace prize, with the inaugural award to take place in Washington next month, would therefore seem to point to only one outcome. To use a metaphor from another sport, it surely looks like a slam dunk for the man Fifa’s presidentdescribesas a “winner” and “close friend”. As Mr Infantinotoldan American business forum on the day he announced the prize: “We should all support what [Mr Trump is] doing because I think it’s looking good.”The rest of us can be excused for wishing that Mr Infantino was spending less time on inappropriate Maga networking and self-aggrandising stunts, and more on addressing criticism of how he is performing in his day job. Ahead of this summer’s men’s World Cup, the sports academic and Guardian US columnist Leander Schaerlaeckens has justlyaccusedFifa of being “fully focused on monetizing the sport, no matter the collateral damage”. Recently unveiled ticketing arrangements for the tournament, which will take place in the US, Canada and Mexico, more than bear that judgment out.Apeing the superlative-laden bombastic style of his new best friend in politics, Mr Infantino haspredicted“the biggest, best and most inclusive World Cup ever”. The first of those claims is literally true, since Fifa’s desire to maximise receipts has led it to increase the number of participating teams from 32 to an unwieldy 48. The second is unknowable until the games are played. The third – at least for fans actually wishing to attend some matches – is cobblers.Fifa’s decision to adopt dynamic pricing for tickets means that the price of a family day out at a game could run into thousands of dollars. Supposedly discounted tickets for group stage games are vanishingly thin on the ground, and the decision to remove a cap on resale value saw a $2,030 ticket for theWorld Cupfinal relisted the next day for $25,000. Fifa, naturally, takes a cut from sanctioned mark-ups.Under Mr Infantino, Fifa has become the eagerallyof super-rich sportswashing states such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, with the latter given a clear run at the 2034 World Cup. The relentless quest for new sources of income has also led to theoverloadingof the football calendar with the overblown Club World Cup. This summer promises to be a Trump-endorsed masterclass in monetisation, allowing the US market to let rip and accelerating the uber-gentrification of the world’s most popular sport.In September, New York’s Arsenal-supporting mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, launched a “Game over greed” petition,condemningthe ticketing strategy as an “affront to the game”. He also lamented the fact that – unlike at the last three World Cups – no tickets are being set aside for local residents. A noble intervention, but sadly a doomed one. Just like his idol in the White House, Mr Infantino only starts listening when money is doing the talking.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The failure to observe this iron law of politics is behind the sense of constant crisis engulfing Rachel Reeves. The current chancellor’s problem is one of her own making. She designed her fiscal rules with so little wriggle room that even small changes in economic forecasts – such as revisions to GDP – mean thather numbers stop adding up. That, in turn, starts chatter about budgetary “holes” and the need for tax rises and spending cuts – despite no change in the economy.In politics, as in digging, it helps to know when to put down the spade. Ms Reeves could end this drama by relaxing her fiscal rules. Or better still, replacing them, as the economist Tim Leunigsuggested, with a 250-word summary of Britain’s economic position at the budget, and the effect of the government’s proposals. Instead, she has framed her decision to break an election promise not to raise income tax as unavoidable. Shetold BBC radio: “It would, of course, be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.” But this is not true. She’s blaming her rules for cuts they don’t require.Labour’s fiscal rules were changed last October to allow full-throated public investment. There is no trade-off between tax rises and capital spending. Ms Reeves’s income tax hikes reassure markets – but she has better news for voters on spending. Shewantsto use £3bn of the extra tax revenue to fully reverse the two-child benefit cap. This would be the right thing to do – lifting about 350,000 children out of poverty. But more needs to be done. Withunemploymentrising and investment weak, theUK is running below capacity. If households, firms and exporters won’t step up, the state must – or the economy will stagnate.No chancellor has raised the basic rate of income tax sinceHealey in 1975. The reason is obvious: about two-thirds of Britons would oppose income tax hikes. Raising income tax is risky – people see it in their pay packets, unlike VAT rises or threshold tweaks. However, research byPersuasion UKshows that the electoral penalty for raising income tax or national insurance is smaller than that for failing on public services, energy bills and child poverty. This, Persuasion UK says, is especially true with Labour 2024 voters as rebuilding the public realm was key to the party’s electoral mandate. What is required is a positive argument, not a defensive one. The smartest strategy is to refocus on the cost of living – for example, by spending tax receipts to lower energy bills – while stressing fairness: everyone chips in, but the richest most of all.Even better, Britain should look at its history and invite investors to swap short-term gilts for longer-dated bonds at modest fixed rates. A voluntary conversion would be attractive when interest rates are falling. Ms Reeves could argue that this is not a sleight of hand but responsible stewardship of the public balance sheet. In 1932, the then chancellorNeville Chamberlainpulled off a similar feat:cutting debt costsby 0.6% ofGDPand bolstering spending by the equivalent of £17bn a yeartoday. That would be enough to deliver on public services in the long term and give something back to voters in the short term. Healey’s advice still stands: stop digging holes and start laying the foundation for a different politics.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Thanks to a cumbersome, top-heavy structure, in the event of a crisis, inertia rapidly sets in as warring factions fail to agree action, thus losing control of it altogether as it spills out into the wider media.Layers of editorial oversight also undermine trust and infantilise those whose judgment matters most, the programme makers.When I joined Channel 4 in the 1990s, the organisational chart was a model of simplicity: a director of programmes with two controllers and a team of commissioners for each content area – total transparency about who was responsible for which programme.There was nowhere to hide. Crises were sorted out in the blink of an eye. A slimmer, flatterBBCwould work better for everyone and save a shedload of licence fee for more and better content.Peter GrimsdaleFormer BBC and Channel 4 executive, Dulwich, LondonAs your leader (10 November) rightly says, Britain must stand up for the BBC before it loses the power to tell the truth. The line from Deborah Turness – the head of BBC News who resigned along with Tim Davie – that BBC journalists should “pursue the truth with no agenda” sounds noble, but is flawed. Everyone and every institution has an agenda – the purposes and responsibilities that guide action.In a post-truth, attention-driven world, impartiality cannot mean detachment. The right goal is to pursue the truth with the deliberate agenda of accuracy, fairness, proportion and service to the public good. When broadcasters deny having any agenda, they leave truth undefended against those whose loud or manipulative ones dominate – as the latest attacks from President Trump and his allies show.Anthony LawtonChurch Langton, LeicestershireI presented theBBC Radio 2 folk showfor many years, and did so proudly. I still think the BBC is the finest public broadcasting service in the world and the people I worked with – techies, producers, directors – all worked for the love of their craft and the institution they were part of.I wish I could say the same for the management, who were often “safe” placemen and -women, many of them with no real affection for the BBC. It was just a job, well paid and powerful. Couple that with the rabid hatred that the right have for anything that dares to speak truth to power, and add the current populist cadre of Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage et al, and I’m not sure that, without a massive push from those who care, the wreckers can be thwarted.Mike HardingSettle, North YorkshireIn the US, we have watched every one of our once reliable news sources first pulled down, then abused, and finally sold off. The same is now happening to the BBC – it is going to face constant attack until it becomes a shadow of what it was. Who will this benefit? The war of media control is what we in the US have lost, and what you in the UK seem to be willing to lose. And for what?Larry MarchantGlen Allen, Virginia, USI cannot be alone in thinking that the BBC has strong grounds to countersue President Trump and his press secretary. To call the BBC “100% fake news” and its journalists “corrupt” looks, on the face of it, defamatory.

As a Mancunian, I feel anger and shame at the complicity of our city’s commercial links with the United Arab Emirates,reported to be funding the Rapid Support Forces(RSF), which are committing war crimes in Darfur.I work as a medicolegal report writer at Freedom from Torture and have borne witness to the awful impact of the Janjaweed militia (which has morphed into the RSF) on people from Darfur.TheManchesterAmnesty group has been campaigning for the release of the Emirati human rights activists Ahmed Mansoor and Mohammed al-Roken for more than 10 years and has been met with a wall of silence from Manchester city council.We are now supporting Manchester4Sudan, an amazing group of the Sudanese diaspora asking the same questions, now more urgent than ever, about the links between our city and the UAE.Ronay poses the question ofManchester Cityfans’ complicity owing to their lack of protest. I recognise that this is not easy, but there is no reason to stop supporting the club – your voice is far more powerful as a fan and there are many ways to act.Newcastle United fans have led the way by setting up a group campaigning for human rights in Saudi Arabia (NUFC Fans Against Sportswashing).Alternatively you can join our Amnestygroup, donate to Human Rights Watch or, best of all, support Manchester4Sudan.Kathryn FletcherManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

You could thus amaze your friends and family by apparently killing a creature and then restoring it to life.The programme suggested that this might be why all but the youngest members of the family seem so unconcerned – they already know the plot. Still, not much fun for the bird.Harriet MonkhouseManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It isn’t radical enough, 7 November). Maths is not merely about learning facts and formulas – it teaches children how to solve problems, to identify patterns, to think and express arguments logically, and to interpret data and recognise when they’re being misled. It teaches resilience and the confidence to keep trying when their first attempt at a solution isn’t quite right. These are all important life skills for any young person to develop, and cannot be replaced by calculators. There are many problems with the education system, including with the way maths is taught, but dismissing maths as useless for most people only demonstrates a lack of understanding of what the subject actually involves.Kayleigh WardBurton upon Trent, Staffordshire“A teacher tells me that, with calculators, all the maths 99% of school leavers need can be taught to them in a day,” writes Simon Jenkins blithely.Mathematicsis the scientific study of numbers, shapes, patterns and quantities, and the relationships between them. It uses logic and abstract reasoning to analyse and understand structures, space, and change (to use just one definition plucked from the web). That is, it is a way of thinking needed to understand anything but the most trivial about the world we inhabit. Pray tell me how you manage that, in a day, on a calculator.Richard MonteithTabernas, SpainExplore more on these topicsMathematicslettersShareReuse this content"

Even a draw would leave France set fair going into their final game inAzerbaijangiventhey lead Ukraine by three points and have a goal difference superior by five. AnIcelandwin in Baku on Thursday coupled with a France victory over Ukraine would move Iceland second on goal difference before they face Ukraine on Sunday in Warsaw.

Wales are assured of a playoff thanks to the Nations League but must finish as runners-up to avoid being among the bottom seeds and having an away semi-final. Winning in Liechtenstein on Saturday and at home to North Macedonia on Tuesday would guarantee second for Wales.

Every player trained in an intensive session on Tuesday – Ben Stokes doing one session in the nets against spin, one against seam, and another bowling – with no fitness issues reported.This means that while the debate about England’s preparation will rumble on, the one over the identity of their first-choice No 3 may soon be settled, with Trescothick strongly hinting that Ollie Pope has seen off the challenge of Jacob Bethell to keep his place, where he has batted in 32 of England’s 35 innings since the start of 2024.Trescothick said he was “presuming” that England would choose “the same No 3 we’ve had for a period of time”, adding: “We’ve not really chopped and changed a great deal. It’s definitely not going to change dramatically before the start of an Ashes series.” He said uncertainty is something that “nobody enjoys”.Regarding the team’s continuity of selection, Trescothick said: “We’ll know in time how it will come out. We don’t know at this stage if it will make a difference or not. If you’re planning ahead, if you were to notch in a few things, one of those would be the consistency of the team you’re going to go with. It feels a little bit more happy for everyone to pretty much know where [they’re] going to be.“Something that Brendon [McCullum] and Ben have both wanted and championed is consistency of team selection. When people call for change, they stick with the process of what we believe is right. If we continue to do that, it will definitely help us.”Challenged on whether this was effectively confirmation that Pope would be in the team when the Ashes begin at Optus Stadium in Perth next Friday, Trescothick said: “I can only say we are a very consistent team in what we’re trying to do. That is going to be the structure of what our batting lineup will be.”View image in fullscreen‘The players get a feel out in the middle, mentally they get more attuned, then away you go ready for next week,’ said Marcus Trescothick.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAEngland’s approach contrasts with that taken when they played the Lions before the 2021-22 Ashes. On that occasion two matches were scheduled but both were significantly affected by rain. When action eventually began both sides named 13 players, 78 overs were bowled by eight bowlers, and while four wickets were taken, nine players batted with three of them retiring not out to give others an opportunity to spend some time in the middle. Bad weather will not be an issue this week, with the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia giving a 0% chance of rain on two of the three days and only 5% in the evening of the other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once you go into any preparation game, you want batters to get runs and bowlers to get wickets. Of course that’s not going to be possible, because if bowlers are getting wickets then batters might not be getting runs. That’s the way prep games are. The players get a feel out in the middle, mentally they get more attuned, then away you go ready for next week.”One person whose position is under no threat is Joe Root, who goes into the series as the world’s No 1 Test batter having scored centuries in three of his last five innings, all during the home series against India this summer. But his record in Australia is under scrutiny: none of his 42 scores of 90 or more have come in this country, where he averages 35.68, well below his career figure of 51.29, and it is the only place where he has played more than three times without scoring a century.“The way he’s gone in the last couple of years will probably explain that he’d be very comfortable with what he’s trying to do at the moment and how he’s playing his game,” Trescothick said. “We’ve seen Joe really grow massively in the last three seasons under Brendon and Ben, [with] the style of play that we’ve had. His game has gone to the next level, hence the reason why his ranking is what it is. You’d be very surprised if he doesn’t carry on in that same sort of vein.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamThe AshesAustralia sportCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two goals from Catarina Macario, a finish from Wieke Kaptein, a double for Sam Kerr on her return to the starting lineup and an unfortunate Lisa Ebert own goal moved them up to second at the halfway stage of the league phase.It was the perfect night for Kerr who was making her first start for the Blues in 692 days. It has been a long road back for the Australian but with goals in the WSL and now the Champions League, she is starting to gain momentum as she builds up minutes and confidence. There was also a welcome back to the lineup for Naomi Girma, who missed the start of the season with a hamstring problem, while Lauren James got a 15-minute cameo as she made her return from the ankle injury she picked up in the Euro 2025 final.Reid setback for Arsenal highlights mounting concern over ACL injuriesRead more“It’s really positive especially when coming to a time where it’s really busy,” Sonia Bompastor said. “We are going to play every three days with big games coming, so it’s important to have the depth and the quality.”It was the kind of free-scoring performance Bompastor has been waiting for this season. Despite their unbeaten run in all competitions, Chelsea have struggled to put games to bed. Their manager had told them to avoid “overthinking” before this encounter in which they were heavy favourites. It worked – the visitors created 43 chances, with 19 on target and had 75 touches in the opposition box.“We were able to apply the gameplan,” the manager said. “We created a lot and we got some great goals. It’s always good for the individual and team confidence to be able to do that.”The disparity between the two sides was evident. While both have dominated their domestic leagues in recent years, the difference in resources, investment and experience is stark.Quick GuideWCL roundup: Weir rescues Real Madrid while Lyon stay perfectShowThe Scotland forward Caroline Weir scored a dramatic late equaliser asReal Madriddrew 1-1 withParis FCin the Women's Champions League.The Spanish side were heading for their first defeat in the competition this season after Lorena Azzaro's 41st-minute penalty gave the visitors the lead.

Brekken picked up the ball 40 yards out, nutmegged her opponent, drove to the edge of the penalty area and fired into the top corner.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.St Pölten have endured a tempestuous start to their season. Sitting second behind Austria Wien domestically, they have had a baptism of fire in the league phase, falling to heavy defeats at the hands of Atlético Madrid and OL Lyonnes. A change at the helm followed with 47-year-old Laurent Fassotte replacing Lisa Alzner at the end of October.Despite their inconsistent form, St Pölten were welcomed on to the pitch by a drumroll of their vociferous fans who never stopped singing in spite of Chelsea’s dominance.Bompastor had called for patience from her players as they faced an organised defensive block but their superiority in all areas eventually paid off. Chelsea were particularly dangerous down the right. It was from this area that the breakthrough came as Ellie Carpenter sent a low ball across goal for Kaptein to turn home.View image in fullscreenWieke Kaptein receives the adulation of her teammates after opening the scoring for Chelsea.Photograph: Christian Bruna/Getty ImagesThe visitors continued their pressure but were made to work for their second goal. Kerr somehow could not prod the ball over the line while Girma had a comical finish disallowed for offside.They eventually got their reward just before the break when Johanna Rytting Kaneryd turned over possession and found Macario in the box. The American placed a low shot past the impressive Carina Schlüter into the far corner to double the score.Quick GuideSkinner defends Earps before Manchester United returnShowMarc Skinner will welcome the return of “good person” Mary Earps to Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday. United’s women play at Old Trafford in the competition for the first time but there will be a spotlight on Paris Saint‑Germain’s goalkeeper after her criticism of the England manager, Sarina Wiegman, and Earps’s successor as the Lionesses’ No 1, Hannah Hampton, in her autobiography.Skinner, who managed Earps at United for three years, said: “Me and Mary have always had a good relationship. So I’ll say nothing but good things. I’ve not read the book. I don’t know anything about it – I’m hearing snippets, of course. I’m always one of those [who thinks] you have to be careful what you say but Mary believes in it. So that’s her truth, she has to speak it.“From our perspective, we’ll welcome her as somebody on the opponents’ team in this game. But also always pay tribute to what she has done when she was at Manchester United. I know Mary’s a good person, so I look forward to the challenge of trying to beat her and her team on Wednesday.”Earps also writes in the book about her decision to leave United last summer at the end of her contract, citing a lack of urgency from Skinner and the club to tie her to a new deal. Skinner said: “There are moments where she might speak about the urgency, but also the club will have their own view and opinion on that.“I wasn’t in those conversations. She can tell me how she feels in that instance. I will feed back to my superiors who make that conversation, but it didn’t happen in that moment. She didn’t sign a contract and we move on.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.St Pölten had registered their first shot on target just before the break when Carina Brunold tested Livia Peng from distance and the hosts became more adventurous as they looked to push out and relieve the constant pressure on their defence. Sarah Gutmann got on the end of their best move of the game, making a strong run into the box, but she was ultimately unable to find an end product.Chelsea, however, were ruthless and extended their lead a minute later. When Alyssa Thompson was felled by Izabela Krizaj in the box, Macario stepped up to confidently convert from the spot. Thompson then had an effort ruled out for offside. Both coaches rang the changes but it did little to disrupt the visitors’ flow with Kerr and Sjoeke Nüsken both coming close.The icing on the cake came for the visitors when Kerr finally got her goal before they welcomed James on to the pitch for the first time this season. The England international was instrumental in their fifth with the unfortunate Ebert turning her delivery into her own net, before Kerr struck again from close range. It was a victory that set Chelsea up perfectly before the visit of Barcelona to Stamford Bridge next week.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenSt PöltenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There’s always going to be a certain group of people that will always try to bring that forward.”Djokovic said he believed that Sinner, a regular practice partner, “didn’t do it on purpose”, but he went on to question how the Italian managed to serve his time without missing a grand slam.“There is the lack of transparency, the inconsistency, the convenience [of] the ban coming between the slams, so he doesn’t miss out the others – it’s just it was very, very odd,” added Djokovic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was the hairstyle, the low socks, the sense of adventure about his midfield play. As Scott puts it, the club’s manager, Nigel Pearson, gave him “a lot of freedom to go out and almost do what I wanted”.It changed after he made his £25m move toBournemouthin the summer of 2023; there was a greater need for tactical discipline, for defensive responsibility. He became more of a No 8. So, less like an early years Jack Grealish, who is now on loan at Everton from Manchester City.But as Scott reflects on his excellent form across the early months of the season, which has led to him winning his first call-up to theEnglandsquad for the World Cup qualifiers against Serbia at Wembley on Thursday and Albania in Tirana three days later, there is one bit of the nickname that will never change; the part relating to Guernsey, where he is from, which goes deep into his DNA.Anthony Barry: ‘The England jersey should feel like a cape, not body armour’Read moreThe 22-year-old stands to become only the third Channel Islander to play for the England men’s team after Matt Le Tissier, another son of Guernsey, and Graeme Le Saux, who is from Jersey. There is also Scott’s stepsister, Maya Le Tissier (no relation to Matt), who has 10 caps for the England women’s side and was a part of the squad that won the European Championship in the summer. What binds them is what they like to call the islander mentality.“For me, it just means we are fearless,” Scott says. “I think when we get an opportunity … because they’re tough to come by back home, it’s tough to get to the mainland. I feel like we take them when they come around.”It talks to difficulties of a logistical nature. When Scott was on Southampton’s books between the ages of eight and 12, he would fly in from Guernsey every Friday with one of his parents for training and matches, staying in a hotel, returning on Sunday night. He often came over with Maya, who is now at Manchester United; in those days, she played for Hampshire.It also speaks to an ability to overcome setbacks and there have certainly been a few of those for Scott, most recently the injuries that scarred his first two seasons at Bournemouth. The biggest one was to his knee last October which ruled him out for four months.At least Scott had made it as a professional by then. When he was released by Southampton and later, before he turned 14, walked away from a year-long spell at the Bournemouth academy – he was not getting the game-time or enjoyment – it was difficult to see a future for him in football. “When I got released by Southampton, it was pretty upsetting,” he says. “It felt like I’d committed four years of my life to this and for it to be blown away … it was heartbreaking.”View image in fullscreenAlex Scott has established himself as a Premier League-level No 8 since joining Bournemouth from Bristol City in 2023.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersScott’s salvation was Guernsey, being back at home where he could live a more normal teenage life with his family and friends. He played for a local team and rekindled his love of the game. What was less normal was what he did at 16 – he played men’s football for Guernsey FC in the eighth-tier Isthmian League Division One South East, becoming the club’s youngest ever player. When he excelled over the first half of the season, Bristol City came calling, offering him a scholarship in January 2020.Scott says there were times when he could not see himself as a professional footballer and he was a little lost. “I went to college for half a year [while he played for Guernsey], doing a sport course,” he says. “I didn’t know what else to do. I failed PE at school. I wasn’t great at school. There was nothing on my mind that I really wanted to do.”As an aside, how does a future Premier League player fail GCSE PE? “The written coursework,” Scott replies. “I was no good at that. I passed English and maths, though, so that’s most important.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then, in this past summer, he starred alongside Elliot Anderson in midfield as the under‑21s retained their European title.View image in fullscreenAlex Scott is aiming to make an impact on England’s senior side after experiencing glory with the age-group teams.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesThomas Tuchel was so impressed by Anderson’s performance in the final against Germany that he called him up for the senior camp in September, believing he could be the solution in the No 6 role. Anderson has since started in every England game. Scott is in the squad as a No 8 and it will plainly be difficult to dislodge Declan Rice. His focus is purely on showing what he can do: being brave, which comes as standard, and continuing to make people proud, including Maya, who has been on the journey with him.“My dad is with her mum,” Scott says. “We’ve grown up together and we’re very close. We speak most days. I couldn’t be prouder of her. She can help me out with advice. It’s nice to have someone around who has experienced it and been around the Lionesses and England, in general.”Scott has another connection to the women’s game via his namesake, the female Alex Scott, who has just been named as an I’m A Celebrity contestant and is one of England’s most-capped players. “I saw something the other day that said I’d done well getting called up and going on I’m A Celebrity at the same time,” he says with a smile. Scott is all business about seizing his moment.Explore more on these topicsEnglandBournemouthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Failing to drop struggling Salah | Barney RonayRead moreThe offside law allows for referees to penalise a player, even if they do not touch the ball, if they are adjudged to be interfering with an opponent by “making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball”.Speaking on Referees Mic’d Up, the regular TV review of officials’ recent decisions, Webb was challenged by the presenter Michael Owen, with the formerLiverpoolstar saying he was “strongly of the opinion” that the goal should have stood.Webb, in unpacking the officials’ thinking process, admitted that “only Donnarumma truly knows if he was impacted by this”, but said there was enough contributory evidence to lead Kavanagh to take the action he did, with Robertson’s ducking out of the way of the ball a key action.“It’s not unreasonable to understand why they would form that conclusion [of disallowing the goal] when the player is so close to the goalkeeper, the ball’s coming right towards him, and [Robertson] has to duck to get out of the way of the ball,” Webb said. “They form the conclusion that it impacts Donnarumma’s ability just to dive towards the ball and make that save.”After Owen suggested that Robertson’s decision to duck actually appeared an attempt to avoid having an impact on the play, Webb said: “That action could still cause hesitation from the goalkeeper. Goalkeepers work from reactions that make it possible to pull out some incredible saves. And that’s the judgment formed on the field.” Oliver could have overturned Kavanagh’s call only had he thought the referee had made a “clear and obvious” error.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Importantly, Silva moves to the left away from the flight of the ball and the ball goes straight over the keeper.”Explore more on these topicsVideo assistant referees (VARs)Howard WebbLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

It is not yet clear if this will still go ahead. McFadden said the court had been informed of the action the government was taking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some said they only discovered their state pension age had increased by several years after giving up work.The PHSO spent years investigating, and eventually found the DWP guilty of maladministration in the handling of the changes.For decades the state pension age for women was 60. An increase to 65, phased in between 2010 and 2020, was included in 1995 legislation but in 2011 the coalition government sped up the process. As a result, the state pension age for women increased to 65 by November 2018 and to 66 by October 2020.The PHSO had said that paying out to all of the approximately 3.6 million women born in the 1950s at its recommended level of between £1,000 and £2,950 each would cost between £3.5bn and £10.5bn. However, it added: “Not all women born in the 1950s will have suffered an injustice.”Angela Madden, the chair of Waspi, said: “Today’s announcement is a major step forward. We are seeking legal advice as to what this means for our judicial review.”Explore more on these topicsState pensionsPensionsWomenInequalitynewsShareReuse this content"

Its claims have been vehemently denied by Serbian war veterans.“Sarajevo Safari was the starting point,” said Gavazzeni. “I began a correspondence with the director and from there expanded my investigation until I collected enough material to present to the Milan prosecutors.”Gavazzeni claimed “many, many, many Italians” were alleged to have been involved, without providing a figure. “There were Germans, French, English … people from all western countries who paid large sums of money to be taken there to shoot civilians.”Gavazzeni added: “There were no political or religious motivations. They were rich people who went there for fun and personal satisfaction. We are talking about people who love guns who perhaps go to shooting ranges or on safari in Africa.”He claimed the Italian suspects would meet in the northern city of Trieste and travel to Belgrade, from where the Bosnian Serb soldiers would accompany them to the hills of Sarajevo. “There was a traffic of war tourists who went to there to shoot people,” he said. “I call it an indifference towards evil.”Gavazenni said he had identified some of the Italian individuals alleged to have been involved and who are expected to be questioned by the prosecutors in the coming weeks.Probably the most high-profile deaths by sniper fire were Bošco Brkić and Admira Ismić, a couple documented in the film Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo, who were killed by a sniper in 1993 while trying to cross a bridge. Their bodies remained in no-man’s land between the Bosnian and Bosnian Serb positions for several days. Photographs were published widely and became symbolic of the randomness and inhumanity of the war.The main street running into Sarajevo, Meša Selimović Boulevard, was nicknamed “Sniper Alley” because it became extremely dangerous but could not be avoided as it was the way to Sarajevo airport. Trams and buses had their windows shot out and all around there were sniper warning signs.Nicola Brigida, a lawyer who helped Gavazzeni prepare his case, said: “The evidence accumulated after a long investigation [by Gavazzeni] is well substantiated and could lead to serious investigation to identify the culprits. There is also the report from the former Sarajevo mayor.”Explore more on these topicsBosnia and HerzegovinaItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve been visiting schools for 20 years and I’ve seen anxiety levels rocket.”Cottrell-Boyce said he feared that platforms such as YouTube gave “theillusion of choice, but because it’s algorithmically driven, you default to more and more of the same”, while AI was “ossifying what we’ve already done”.He added: “You can’t take that much out and put nothing in and expect the thing you’re feeding off to survive.”Greg Childs OBE, director of the Children’s Media Foundation and a veteran BBC children’s producer, agreed that the children’s TV industry was “broken” and that UK production companies were “going to the wall”.Noting that 62% of viewing by under-16s was on YouTube and only 22% on broadcast TV, he said the former had “captured the eyeballs, imaginations and interest of a nation – but they haven’t replaced the system that existed before, which is a curated system of content”.He added: “Children’s wellbeing is damaged or not fostered by the algorithmic recommendation systems; they’re falling down rabbit holes of all sorts of content.”He said YouTube did not provide any upfront investment to fund new shows, and that the “creator economy” did not exist for children’s TV due to its advertising rules.As a result, people who made children’s content received 80-90% less in revenue than other creators, despite the Children’s Media Foundation estimating that YouTube made £700m from children’s advertising in one year, he said.YouTube needed a “form of regulation and ratings system” and the government should force the platform to act in the public interest if it does not do so voluntarily, he said. “The algorithm is capable of change … We would like Google and YouTube to become part of society rather than apart from society,” he added.Childs urged the government to commit to funding children’s TV through a renewal of the “very successful” young audiences fund, which was closed in 2022. This could be part-funded through a streamers’ levy, which would cover YouTube.He further suggested that platforms should use AI to rate content and enable parents to curate what their children watch by instructing the algorithm to prioritise “public service content”, “BBC content” or “content of value”.Childs also said that the only children’s TV funder in the UK was the BBC – ITV failed to produce one children’s TV programme last year – and that he feared shows such as Doctor Who were in jeopardy and successes were harder to sustain, noting that Paddington had been sold off to Canal+.He said that any new funding approach should emphasise collaboration with the platforms rather than confrontation, summarising its spirit as: “Come on, you great big beasts controlling us, come join us and make it better for kids.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenTelevisionYouTubeArtificial intelligence (AI)Entertainment TVnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, Storm Babet claimed seven lives across the UK, led to more than 10,000 people being evacuated from their homes and caused in excess of £450m in property damage. Extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, and experts have linked some of the damagecaused by Storm Babettothe climate crisis.My mum rang me to tell me there was water coming into the house. She sounded fine, she wasn’t panicking, just wanted to let me know so I wouldn’t worry. But when I rang her back later, the telephone was dead.When we eventually got into the house the next day, I found the phone downstairs near her body. It was floating in the water next to her; the flood waters had come in a torrent in less than two minutes from ankle to waist height.View image in fullscreenPaul Gilbert stands in the doorway of Tapton Terrace, Chesterfield, the house where his mum lived and where he was born.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianMy mum,Maureen Gilbert, had lived in her house in Tapton Terrace, Chesterfield, for 83 years, her whole life. I was born there 49 years ago. These houses have been up standing for 120 years, and in all the time my mum lived there, we had never had any floods until 2007, when the water probably got up to about 4ft. But this time there was nearly 6ft of water in the house.I had visited her in the morning, after the flood alert was made, and left about 12 noon. I wasn’t unduly worried; I glanced at the river levels as I left.By 1.20pm she rang me when I was home to tell me there was water coming in. I said to her: “Are you upstairs?” She said she was just getting her stuff together to go upstairs. I told her to flip the electrics off and go upstairs; she has a kettle and everything up there, and I would ring her back after some calls I had to make.View image in fullscreenThe village of Sandiacre, Derbyshire, submerged after flooding caused by Storm Babet in October 2023.Photograph: HDM Entertainment/SWNSI made a telephone call to sort out my daughter coming home from school as she was being released early. Then I rang Mum back – it was really just a few minutes later but the phone was dead.It took me six hours to get across Chesterfield back to the terrace. It was chaos, water everywhere, the roads were gridlocked. It was 6.45pm when I got back to her house.The water level was the highest I have ever seen it; higher than 2007. It was fast-flowing, rising over 8ft over Mum’s back door.But there was no way to get into the house, no way I would have survived if I tried. The fire and rescue service said there was a risk to life to get into the house. They were in the water but they were all buoyant, treading water to try and reach the property.We recovered her body the following day from the downstairs of the house; the phone was nearby. Because the body had been in the water that long, it was impossible to put a time of death on the record. So they put down her death as that day; 21 October 2023, the day she was recovered.But I know she definitely died the day before; after my last call with her.View image in fullscreenGilbert in the back lane behind Tapton Terrace. The flood water was over the stone wall behind him and to his left in photos.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianWe have just had the inquest into my mum’s death. It was scary when I walked in, seeing all these agencies that were involved: the police, ambulance, three fire brigades, theEnvironment Agency, the council. They all arrived with multiple barristers lining the room and I was there on my own. I was scared but I thought they must be scared of this, too. We are talking thousands of pounds for lawyers each day for these agencies.All these lawyers argued against the coroner producing a “prevention of future deaths” report at the end of the inquest. When the coroner explained to me what one was, I thought, I can see why they don’t want this.But for my mum’s sake, it had to be written. I know my mum would want answers about what happened. I know she would want to try and stop it happening to anyone else, that’s the main thing.About the seriesThis is climate breakdown was put together in collaboration with the Climate Disaster Project at University of Victoria, Canada.Read more.Production teamAnd the report, it warns that because the agencies have not put in flood defences which were recommended 20 years ago, it warns that other people could die, especially the elderly and vulnerable.The agencies are all fighting between each other. The Environment Agency has said there is no affordable way to protect these houses. They have passed it on to the council.We have got friends and family still living there. There are other elderly people in the terrace; there is a guy who is a year or so younger than my mum, and another man in his 70s who is in ill-health. People are just always waiting now, every time it rains they panic.The agencies see it as just 26 houses; they are not important. They think there is no point doing anything to protect this one small street of 26 houses, when they have to look at protecting a whole town. They say there is no cost-effective way to protect the houses, they are suggesting they should be sacrificed.We sold my mum’s house at auction in the April after she died there. None of my kids wanted it. I didn’t want it after finding her there. So it was sold. A young family lives there now.Design and development byHarry FischerandPip Lev."

The bellowing, heaving and trampling of 350 impatient zebu cows behind a wire perimeter marks a break with centuries of herding tradition inSenegal, west Africa. Rather than roaming freely across the country’s vast grasslands, shepherds tightly pack the herd together, confining them to graze in short, intensive bursts before being moved to a new plot.Ka, the village chief of Thignol, is spearheading the first pilot of “mob grazing” in Senegal, aiming to mimic, on a much smaller scale, how wildebeest flow across the Serengeti, moving to protect themselves against lions and cheetahs. The idea that intense grazing can regenerate grasslands rather than accelerate their decline has been controversial. Initially, proponents argued it could help to solve the climate crisis throughstoring carbon in regenerated grasslands– a claim with little scientific basis. But there is some evidence that the method can boost biodiversity and grassland health in dry areas such as Senegal.Ka felt he had little choice but to experiment. The verdant paddock before him will soon be unrecognisable, turning desert-like after the rainy season ends. His community’s grass is running out faster than ever before, making their cows thinner, less productive of milk and harder to sell for meat.“The richness of our community is based on our animals – if they suffer, so do we,” says Ka.A third ofSenegal’s pastures are degraded– sparse, patchy grass, bare soil, few trees – due to overgrazing and erratic rainfall caused by climate change, says Dr Tamsir Mbaye, who leads the Pastoralism and Dryland Centre in Senegal. Across Africa,75% of drylands, or nearly two-thirds of the continent, are in a poor state, according to the UN.This pilot is showing early, but promising, signs of regeneration. After 18 months, Ka says he has witnessed the return of species of grass, insects and saplings not seen for decades.Ordinarily, Ka’s son, Sadibou, shepherds the family’s cattle and sheep freely over rangelands punctuated by ancient baobab trees and wispy acacias. This scattered approach is a key contributor to degradation, says Joaquín Cadario, an agronomist at Action Against Hunger, an NGO supporting the pilot.This freedom to roam means animals select grasses they prefer, wiping out some species. Once their favourite grasses disappear, they eat young trees, killing them before they mature.“Look around, there’s only old trees here,” says Cadario. “If you had a village with just old people, it will die out at some point. It’s the same with trees.”For the experimental 127-hectare (314-acre) plot, Ka and 10 neighbouring families have formed a community herd of approximately 350 cows and 2,000 sheep, moving them through a football pitch-sized plot of pasture every day. Ideally, concentrated together, they will only munch what is in front of them while their hooves tear up the thick crust of dry soil, creating space for new species and increasing water absorption, essential for adapting to climate change as droughts grow longer. A recent test found the experimental plot absorbed 60% more water.Once grazed, the ground is rested for a year, giving the grasslands time to grow back and trees to mature. Despite the initial positive signs in the Senegal pilot, scientists say that mob grazing is no magic bullet, and there is a fine line between regenerating and damaging grasslands.“The scientific line on mob grazing is that it’s so nuanced,” says Dr Cecilia Dahlsjö, a senior researcher at the University of Oxford’s Leverhulme Centre for Nature Recovery. Myriad factors – geography, herd sizes, rest period, rainfall – determine whether the approach boosts or degrades biodiversity, she says. “Mob grazing can be beneficial for biodiversity, soil water absorption and structure, but if you go too far, it can be detrimental, and the soil can become too trampled and compacted.”Likewise, Craig Morris, a livestock lecturer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in SouthAfrica, said context was key, but semi-arid grasslands such as Senegal’s “have the greatest promise” for mob grazing, where pastures are degraded and rainfall scarce.Aid cuts in a Senegalese town risk taking away control from its ‘warrior’ womenRead moreKa’s mob has attracted intrigue. Herders from the 80,000-hectare reserve where he lives, further afield in Senegal and even neighbouring Mauritania, have visited the plot to see the results. But whether this approach can scale will depend on leaders such as Ka, who can mobilise large groups. Another pilot only 19 miles (30km) away failed when herders ignored the rest rules owing to a lack of community buy-in.Ka promises that local herders will show up. And the next morning, the mob of 350 cows and their owners congregate before the perimeter. Young shepherds in elegant robes and sleek sunglasses enjoy a respite from solitude to joke together and play music on a Bluetooth boombox.At 10am, the animals surge in, hoovering up fresh pasture, as the shepherds whistle and hoot to keep them tightly packed. Moustapha Ka, Ibrahima’s brother, strolls over to show off a fibrous, green plant – one that he used to see when he was young.“These are small changes,” he says. “But in five or six years, more species of plants, insects and trees will come back.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingSenegalAfricaAgricultureConservationDroughtWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But at a rare protest anger and frustration were rifeHannah Ellis-Petersenin DelhiMon 10 Nov 2025 22.42 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 23.15 ESTShareAs afamiliar smoky evening hazegathered over Delhi, the crowd began to assemble in their hundreds. Mothers and children, students, retirees and environmentalists were all united by a basic but desperate demand: the right to breathe safely in India’s capital.“Delhi is not a liveable city any more, it’s a death trap,” said Radhika Aggarwal, 33, an engineer who joined the protest on Sunday.“As I stand here, I’m breathing air that I know is killing me. But we see nothing but a failure by the government to do anything to stop this and clean up the pollution. No policies, no real action. So I’m here to fight for my city.”For the past decade, Delhi has held the inglorious title of being theworld’s most polluted city. Pollution season has become as normalised as the monsoon, as it rolls over the city in a suffocating smog that begins in October and can last for more than four months.In the past weeks, Air quality index (AQI) measurements have regularly soared to more than a hundred times higher than is deemed safe by global heath bodies and residents routinely describe the city as akin to a gas chamber.Pollutionnow kills more people in Delhi than obesity or diabetes.13:28Life and death on India’s toxic trash mountains – videoThe seeming inevitability of the pollution, and the failure by successive state governments to do anything about it, means it has often been met with apathy by residents. But on Sunday, as a rare protest against the increasingly woeful air quality erupted in the Delhi’s political centre, anger and frustration were rife.The call for Sunday’s protest had been to gather atIndiaGate, the country’s famed memorial to its fallen martyrs. But in the days prior to the protest, the police had made hundreds of calls and homes visits to those amplifying the protest to pressure them to call it off, even threatening legal action against them; the latest crackdown on any form of dissent in India.Saurav Das, 26, was among those who received police pressure, after he put out a call for action against pollution on social media. Though young and fit, he had recently been diagnosed with allergic bronchitis, due to the filthy air.“We wanted to gather peacefully at India Gate to send a message, loud and clear, that people are fed by failed policies and government apathy that have failed to combat air pollution,” said Das. “Instead we were met with unnecessary brute force.”On Sunday police shut down India gate to prevent the protest and within hours, officers had aggressively cleared the nearby site, detaining almost 100 protesters at police stations until late into the night, with elderly people, mothers and children among them. The next day, a police case was filed against the organisers.Chart on air pollution in 2024The reasons the capital is left to choke every winter are well documented; a lethal mix of emissions from tens of millions of cars,fires set by farmers in neighbouring states, plants that burn the city’s waste, coal fired power plants and smaller fires set by people just to keep warm. The cold weather, and lack of winds and rain, ensures the smog smothers Delhi and much of north India.Yet state and national government policies to tackle the root causes remain largely absent. Instead, those who can, seal themselves indoors with expensive air purifiers or escape to the mountains and beaches of other states, turning clean air into Delhi’s most luxury commodity – one unaffordable to most the of the city’s 30 million residents.View image in fullscreenA flock of birds flies past a tree on a smoggy morning amid ongoing air pollution in New DelhiPhotograph: Adnan Abidi/ReutersOn Sunday, much of the protester’s ire was directed at the Delhi government. In February, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which also runs the national government under prime minister Narendra Modi, won the Delhi state elections, stirring hope among residents it might finally trigger substantive anti-pollution policies at both state and national level.Instead, the new BJP state government not only went to courts to allow “green” fireworks to be allowed during Diwali celebrations – contributing to one of the city’smost polluted festival seasonsin years – but has also beenaccused by opponentsof attempting to fudge the city’s pollution data, either by halting reports from the city’s air quality monitoring centres or by spraying water on the air pollution monitors to bring the numbers down. The BJP denied tampering with pollution figures and called the accusation “politically motivated”, blaming the previous government for the ongoing pollution problem.The BJP’s multimillion rupeecloud seeding experiment– an attempt to make it rain using chemicals, in order to bring down pollution levels – proved a failure.“I can’t breathe in this city any more, I can’t take a walk without getting a terrible headache,” said Sofie, 33. “It feels like there aren’t enough masks in the world to make this air breathable.”Many among those gathered at the protest were mothers accompanied their children and signs were held aloft with messages such as “breathing is killing me”. The nearby central secretariat and parliament buildings had been rendered almost invisible by the evening’s opaque brown smog as the city’s AQI touched 500 – the healthy level is 50.“Any other city breathing this air would have declared a health emergency by now,” said Gopesh Singh, 58. “How many more millions of people have to die for the government to act?”Explore more on these topicsIndiaPollutionSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Representing an increase in unemployment to 1.8 million, the official jobless rate was last higher in January 2021, during the height of the Covid pandemic.UK retail sales growth slows as shoppers await Black Friday and budgetRead moreSuren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “These figures suggest that the UK’s labour market is suffering from pre-budget jitters, as businesses already weakened byApril’s rise in national insurancelook to cut recruitment further in anticipation of another difficult budget.”UK unemployment in July to September was the highest in more than four yearsConcerns over the strength of the jobs market prompted City investors to bet that the Bank would be more likely to cut interest rates at its next policy meeting in December. The pound fell by 0.3% against the US dollar before recovering ground, while the odds of a post-budget cut in borrowing costs increased from about 60% to 75%.The FTSE hit a record high of 9,899, driven by hopes of the US government ending its 53-day shutdown and predictions that a cut in borrowing costs could bolster Britain’s economy.Threadneedle Streetkept rates on hold last week, but opened the door to a cut as early as next month after signalling that inflation had peaked amid a slowdown in the economy.Reeves is expected to raise taxes in the budget on 26 November to plug a shortfall in the public finances of up to £30bn. However, the chancellor has been warned that doing so could hit jobs and growth in a repeat of her first autumn budget.Business leaders have warned the chancellor’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions and increase in the national living wage from April has led to job cuts and sapped hiring demand, hitting part-time employment and jobs in the hospitality, leisure and retail sectors in particular.Martin Beck, the chief economist at WPI Strategy, said: “The prospect of new tax rises in the upcoming budget poses further risks to employment, particularly if the chancellor again looks to raise taxes on businesses. But this time, Rachel Reeves is more likely to target earners rather than employers.”Ministers have grown increasingly alarmed over the jobs market slowdown – including a dramatic increase in youth unemployment, amid a jump in the number of young people who are not in employment, education or training (Neet) to almost 1 million, the highest level in a decade.The government this weekappointed the former Labour health secretary Alan Milburnto lead an independent review of the role of mental health issues and disability in youth unemployment.A separate review by the former boss of John Lewis, Charlie Mayfield,warned last weekthat young adults were one of the key cohorts affected by an “economic inactivity crisis” hitting Britain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the past year, the biggest falls in payrolled employment were in the wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, and IT sectors.Highlighting the worsening slowdown in the jobs market, annual growth in average weekly earnings dropped by more than expected to 4.8%. City economists had forecast an unchanged reading of 5%.The secretary of state for work and pensions, Pat McFadden, said: “Over 329,000 more people have moved into work this year already, but today’s figures are exactly why we’re stepping up our plan to get Britain working.“We’ve introduced the most ambitious employment reforms in a generation to modernise job centres, expand youth hubs and tackle ill-health through stronger partnerships with employers.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Marks sentenced him to six months in prison, suspended for 12 months, plus 300 hours of unpaid work.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Aninakwa, who denied wrongdoing, was convicted of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of patients.Photograph: Emily Pennink/PASpeaking outside the Old Bailey, Jane Figueiredo said her daughter had been confined to a “death trap” that was “a fatality waiting to happen”.Rather than being given the “compassion, care and support” she needed, Figueiredo was “failed horribly and experienced a litany of failures which crushed her spirit and ended her life”, her mother said.Jane Figueiredo added that her daughter’s pleas for help were not taken seriously and were “regularly shut down, silenced”. She said: “People behind the locked doors on mental health wards are some of the least seen and heard people in our communities and society. And their voices are all too easily dismissed, used against them or silenced.”In his televised sentencing remarks, Marks described Figueiredo as a “beautiful vibrant young woman” who was “hugely talented” and had an “extremely” attractive personality. He added: “Her death at such a young age in the circumstances in which it occurred is a terrible tragedy.”The judge said the accessibility of plastic in the communal toilets was a “very serious problem”, adding: “I am in no doubt that there was a complete failure to adequately assess and manage the risk that this posed.”Keeping the communal area temporarily locked while Figueiredo was on the ward would not have posed a problem beyond one of “inconvenience”, the judge said. Marks added that Aninakwa had also failed to address the “major concerns” of Figueiredo’s mother that should have “rung major alarm bells”.He told the defendant: “You knew that she was suicidal – she was the only patient on the ward that was. Your negligent breach of duty went on for weeks.” The judge took into account the 10-year delay in the case in his decision to suspend Aninakwa’s jail sentence.Nearly 150,000 aged 90 and above wait 12 hours in England’s A&Es each yearRead moreFigueiredo was first admitted to the Hepworth ward in May 2012 with a diagnosis including non-specific eating disorder and bipolar affective disorder. During her time on the acute psychiatric ward, the trust failed to remove plastic items from the communal toilets or keep them locked despite repeated suicide attempts.Aninakwa, who was subject to a performance improvement plan, had also failed to ensure incidents of self-harm were recorded, considered and addressed, jurors heard. The trust and Aninakwa, of Grays in Essex, denied wrongdoing but declined to give evidence.The investigation into Figueiredo’s death began in 2016 but charges were not brought until September 2023. NELFT was cleared of corporate manslaughter and Aninakwa was found not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Then, in February 2024, detectives noticed a long-dormant bitcoin wallet flicker to life, and a manhunt began.For over a month, police tracked the mastermind of one of the UK’s largest money-laundering cases – from a lonely bungalow on the shores of Loch Tay to a red-tiled house outside Glasgow, and finally to a quiet Airbnb in suburban York, where the 46-year-old was arrested in late April alongside four Malaysian nationals working illegally as her domestic staff.On Tuesday Qian was sentenced to 11 years and eight months in prison, alongside her associate, Malaysian national Seng Hok Ling, who received four years and 11 months. The bitcoin seized from her London home – more than 61,000 of them, worth billions of pounds – is now the subject of civil proceedings to determine what will be returned to victims in China.“The scale of your money laundering is unprecedented. Your motive was one of pure greed,” Judge Sally-Ann Hales KC told Qian at Southwark crown court on Tuesday.“Bitcoin pioneer Ms Qian, once the world’s largest female BTC holder, accepts her conviction and the mistakes that led to it,” said Qian’s lawyer, Roger Sahota.“She never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent … She is deeply sorry for the distress suffered by investors.”When Qian and Ling were convicted in September, the value of the bitcoin was priced at more than £5.5bn, according to Metropolitan police officers. It is understood that the value is constantly changing, and is currently priced at about £5bn. It has been described as the UK’s largest cryptocurrency seizure.Qian’s sentence caps a decade-long criminal career spanning continents. She first appeared on the radar of Chinese authorities in 2012, linked to smaller pyramid schemes in Anhui and Jilin provinces. Then, in her early 30s, she was investigated but never convicted.Soon after, she launched a bigger scam: a vast crypto investment scheme run through a Tianjin-based company called “Blue Sky”, purportedly dealing in electronics. Already on the run, Qian operated in the shadows and was known to her staff as “sister Hua”. She lured victims with glossy promotional videos and promises of massive returns – a clip called Britain Nice Life featured sweeping shots of London.Those were the early days of crypto, and scams were proliferating in China and worldwide. “The investment opportunity at the time might have seemed relatively realistic given the crypto environment, but it had devastating effects for everyone involved,” said DS Isabella Grotto, who led the investigation into Qian.Qian defrauded more than 128,000 victims across China. Families pooled their savings and lost everything. “I was forced to sell my house. Now I have no fixed abode,” wrote one victim in a testimonial to the Metropolitan police.Another wrote: “My wife divorced me. I was mentally broken.”By the time Qian fled China in July 2017, travelling overland on a moped to Myanmar, she is estimated to have swindled 40bn yuan – roughly £4.3bn – most of which she converted into bitcoin. She first arrived in the UK from Malaysia in the autumn of 2017, carrying a St Kitts and Nevis passport under the alias “Yadi Zhang”.This was the start of nearly seven years on the run. Qian spent almost £92,000 on designer jewellery and women’s clothing at Harrods. She travelled through Europe, staying at the Ritz Carlton in Berlin and visiting Stockholm, Copenhagen and Kutná Hora. In her diaries, she dreamed about meeting a European duke, or using her money to become the ruler ofLiberland, a microstate on a disputed floodplain between Croatia and Serbia.But the fear of Chinese authorities was constant. Qian avoided travelling to countries that have extradition treaties with China. Later, she forbade her domestic staff from using devices made by Huawei or Xiaomi. (The four people found with her had been made to sign contracts with fines of up to £10,000 if they revealed information about her or “family members”.)With her associates – Jian Wen, a former takeawayworkersentenced to six years and eight months, and Ling – Qian strategised on how to turn her bitcoin into assets. They attempted to buy homes in the UK and Italy before successfully buying two properties in Dubai in 2019.That drew the attention of UK police: in 2018, Wen attempted to buy a £24m London property, triggering a suspicious activity report. From there, the dragnet started to close. Police raided their rental house, then a safety deposit box containing laptops and crypto wallets containing the bitcoin in November 2018.When Qian was finally found in York in April, she was carrying more than £60m across four additional crypto wallets, plus false passports and cash. She pleadedguiltyto fraud charges on the first day of her trial in September.But the years before she was apprehended were full of close scrapes and retail therapy. While Ling, her facilitator, nervously Googled “How much is considered money laundering in Malaysia,” and “What are the sentences for money laundering in the UK,” Qian continued to spend.“See you in jewellery street,” she wrote to Wen after asking her to arrange the conversion of four bitcoins into cash one day in 2018. “Obsessed with jewellery,” wrote Wen.Will Lyne, the head of economic and cybercrime at the Metropolitan police, said: “Many people lost their life savings, and the emotional and financial impact was devastating. Today’s outcome is a step towards justice for those victims.“Money laundering enables and supports serious criminality across our communities, and organised crime groups increasingly use cryptocurrency to move, hide, and invest the proceeds of serious crime.“Developments in technology are exploited by criminals, but also provide opportunities for those seeking to stop them. Every cryptocurrency transaction leaves a trace.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeBitcoinCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

These actions have contributed to a public health catastrophe, according to Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation.“Such practices in Gaza, but also in other armed conflicts such as Sudan, constitute violations of international law, and have been documented as patterns of behaviour that constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, that in the case of Gaza in particular, are an important part of a genocidal strategy,” said Arrojo.“Israel has systematically used water to displace and segregate the Palestinian population in their own territories, illegally occupied since 1967, as part of its strategy of apartheid and progressive colonization,” he added.In the occupied West Bank in April, a group of Israeli settlers in the village of Bardalah destroyed irrigation pipelines on Palestinian-owned properties, while on the same day, other settlers damaged a water pipeline in the nearby village of Khirbat.In July,Israel killed at least 10 Palestiniansat a water distribution point in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, six of them children, injuring another 16 amid critical levels of famine and dehydration that forced people to travel long distances in search of food and water. The attack is part of a growing pattern that has left more than 1,000 Palestinians dead while trying to access basic food and water aid.In July, a group of UN experts warned that Israel was using“thirst as a weapon to kill Palestinians”.The Middle East has become a hotspot for water-related violence in recent years, but incidents are surging globally amid climate catastrophe, poor governance and escalating conflicts over access to land and water sources.In 2024, there were a record 420 water-related conflicts globally –a 20% rise on 2023, which was also a record year, and a 78% increase over 2022. Another 160-plus attacks were documented in the first half of 2025. The violence included attacks on dams, pipelines, wells, treatment plants, irrigation systems and workers, as well as public protests and cross-border disputes over access to water, and the use of water as a weapon of war.In Madagascar, security forces armed with teargas, tanks and rubber bullets quelled almostdaily youth-led protests overthe government’s failure to address widespread power outages and water shortages, until a coup usurped the president in October.The rising trend in global water-related conflictsIn September last year, a brother and sister on their way home from fetching water at night were fatally shot in Matswale, among many places in South Africa where water shortages are worsening.Pakistan has seen a spike in water-conflicts this year, including a wave of protests in Karachi over the construction of six new canals on the Indus river, which left scores of protesters and police injured.The new data shows an increase in violence against environmental and community activists defending freshwater resources, especially in Latin America, as well as rising cyber attacks targeting water utilities. Recent surveys of water agencies in the US and UK revealed hundreds of attempted breaches targeting systems that manage operations of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure and equipment.The UNrecognizesaccess to safe, acceptable, affordable drinking water as a fundamental human right, yet more than 2 billion people, about 25% of the world’s population, still lack access. Cutting off or denying people access to safe water violates international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions, constituting a war crime.The Pacific Institute’s tracker is the most comprehensive open-source database of water-related violence in the world, documenting incidents dating back over 4,500 years and contains more than 2,750 entries identified from news reports, eyewitness accounts and other conflict databases.Overall, water-related violence has been rising steadily since over the past two decades but has surged in recent years as growing scarcity exacerbates old conflicts over land, ideology and religion, economics and sovereignty, and new ones erupt, according to theWater Conflict Chronology. Only 24 such incidents were reported globally in the year 2000, compared with more than 160 incidents in the first half of 2025.Israeli assaults in occupiedPalestineand Russia’s war with Ukraine have accounted for a significant chunk of the recent rise in assaults on water, irrigation and sanitation supplies, accounting for 12% and 16% respectively of all global incidents in 2024.Kalush, a city of 65,000 situated in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in western Ukraine, was left without water and power on 25 December 2024, Christmas Day, aftermajor shelling by Russian forces.In August this year,Ukraine National Newsreported that Russia had shut off water to some homes in the occupied Donetsk, allegedly as punishment for refusing to accept Russian rule.Ukrainian forces have also damaged Russian civilian and military water supplies. In July, they reportedly struck a water pipeline supplying Russian military facilities in Vladivostok, in Russia’s far east, cutting off drinking water to garrisons.Water conflicts have spiked in recent years between Israel and Palestine and Russia and Ukraine“The growing number of violent incidents involving freshwater resources underscores the urgent need for international attention,” said Peter Gleick, senior fellow and co-founder of the Pacific Institute. “Ensuring access to safe, affordable water for all and safeguarding civilian water systems in accordance with international law are critical to preventing further expansion of violence.”The Israeli government did not respond to request for comment.Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestineWaterMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The report said Frehley, 74, suffered facial fractures near the eyes and left ear and also had bruising on his left abdomen and thigh area and his right hip and upper thigh.Ace Frehley obituaryRead moreKiss, whose hits included Rock and Roll All Nite and I Was Made for Lovin’ You, were known for their theatrical stage shows, with fire and fake blood spewing from the mouths of band members dressed in body armor, platform boots, wigs and signature black and white face paint.Kiss’s original lineup included Frehley, singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, tongue-wagging bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss. Frehley’s is the first death among the four founding members.Frehley inspired a generation of guitarists and performed on Kiss’s first nine albums. His death was announced by his family last month, with his loved onesdeclaringthemselves collectively “completely devastated and heartbroken” and his death almost incomprehensible.“Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace’s memory will continue to live on forever!” the family statement said, in part.Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters – Frehley was known as Space Ace and the Spaceman. The New York-born entertainer and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow and shoot fireworks.Born Paul Daniel Frehley, he grew up in a musical family and began playing guitar at age 13. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.Kiss were especially popular in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to become a marketing marvel.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsKissnewsShareReuse this content"

Users who had already downloaded the apps appeared to still be able to use them.Both apps were still available for download from their official websites. The apps have not released public statements about the removals.In a statement toWired, Apple said: “We follow the laws in the countries where we operate. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only.”In accordance with the country’s laws, Apple operates a separate app store in China. Several popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram and other western social media platforms are unavailable to Chinese users. International dating apps such as Grindr and Tinder are also blocked.Founded in 2012 in China, Blued is the country’s most popular dating app for gay men. It has more than 40 million registered users worldwide. In recent years, it has diversified into other services such as livestreaming, but it is still primarily considered an app for gay men.In 2020, Blued’s parent company acquired Finka.Homosexuality is legal in China. But after decades of opening and liberalisation, open displays of LGBT identity have beenpushed further underground. LGBT civil society organisationshave been forced to closeand Shanghai Pride, the country’s biggest pride event, was suspended in 2020. In September, a horror film wasdigitally alteredto turn a gay couple into a straight couple for its release in China.A founder of an LGBT community organisation, who asked to remain anonymous over fears about his safety, said he was “extremely shocked” to see Blued and Finka removed from the app stores.“The living space for sexual minorities has been shrinking over the past few years … but hearing this news now, it caught me off guard that online spaces are also shrinking,” he said.“Don’t apps like Blued contribute to social stability and harmony? Why remove them from app stores? I find it difficult to understand their underlying thinking,” he added.It is not clear why the apps were removed or whether it is to be a permanent move. But internet users immediately expressed their concern.One WeChat user wrote that Blued “made countless people realise for the first time that they weren’t alone; it brought a group from the margins to being seen”.The Cyberspace Administration of China could not be reached for comment.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificAppleLGBTQ+ rightsAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its purpose is to stop the Republican People’s party (CHP), which came first in the last local elections, and to block its presidential candidate,” Özgür Özel said on X.The arrest of İmamoğlu, themain political rivalof Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was met with outrage from the CHP and prompted demonstrations across Turkey. It was the country’s worst street unrest since 2013.İmamoğlu faces allegations that include espionage and faking his university degree, which could lead to him being banned from running for president.According to the indictment, which names 402 suspects, İmamoğlu allegedly headed a crime network over which he exerted his influence “like an octopus”.In an address to parliament on Tuesday, Özel said İmamoğlu would be the party’s candidate in the next presidential vote.“Can someone be both an electoral fraudster, hold a forged decree and be a thief, a terrorist and a spy all at the same time?” he said before the indictment was released.“If you accused an innocent person of just one of these crimes, it would be a great injustice. But when you put all of them on one person, it’s a major crime … But his only crime is running for the presidency of this country,” he said.Also in the indictment, prosecutors said they had filed papers with Turkey’s top appeals court against the CHP, which observers said could pave the way for the party’s closure.In a separate statement, the Istanbul prosecutor’s office confirmed it had informed the court about certain irregularities but denied reports it was seeking to have the party shut down.The CHP has been under increasing pressure since it won control of Turkey’s largest cities in local elections in March 2024. Sixteen of its mayors have since been jailed.An Ankara court dismissed a case in October challenging the legitimacy of the outcome of the party’s 2023 leadership primary, saying there was no legal basis for removing the current leadership from office.The move could have unseated Özel, who is facing a number of lawsuits including one for insulting the president.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It also reported that second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5tn yen (£12.2bn), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.SoftBank also sold part of its stake in T-Mobile, as it assembled funds to bankroll its AI investments.Asked about the timing of the sale of the Nvidia stake, the chief financial officer, Yoshimitsu Goto, told reporters that because SoftBank’s investment inOpenAIwas very substantial, the company had to use its existing assets to finance new investments.“This year our investment in OpenAI is large – more than $30bn needs to be made – so for that we do need to divest our existing portfolios,” Goto said. “We did not have a specific [reason to sell] in October and it was nothing to do with Nvidia itself.”Shares in Nvidia, whose high-powered chips are in hot demand to power AI datacentres, fell by 3.5% in morning trading in New York after SoftBank’s announcement.Other tech shares also slipped, pulling the Nasdaq Composite index down by 0.85% in early trading. Arm, the Cambridge-based chip designer, fell 5.1%, as did the computer memory and storage developer Micron.Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said: “People are looking for clues that the tech rally is close to the top, and SoftBank’s profit-taking in the chip giant is significant.“Investors typically sell out of positions when they believe the valuation is too rich, the growth prospects for the company are less attractive than before, or they’ve found something better to back and need cash to make that investment.”Nvidia’s market value had soared during 2024 and 2025, helping to fuel concerns in recent months that an AI bubble was forming. At the end of October itbecame the world’s first $5tn companybut has since fallen back from that high.Mould suggested SoftBank had topped up its war chest for the next wave of AI-related investments by cashing in its stake in Nvidia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Barcelona, where my diet has transformed at least half my body into ham.Who will dominate the autonomous vehicles market?We are on the verge of the global arrival of self-driving cars. Next year, major firms from both the US andChinawill deploy their robotaxis to metropolises around the world, in major expansions of their existing operations. These companies are posturing in the press like male birds fighting for the same mate; the dance sets the stage for the global competition to come.On the US side, there’s Waymo, Google’s driverless venture. The company has invested billions of dollars in Waymo in the past 15 years. The company opened its robotaxi service to the public in June 2024 in San Francisco after years of testing and has been rolling it out steadily since. Now, vehicles are very visible in most of Los Angeles, and they are going to Washington DC, New York City and London next year.On 2 November, the Chinese internet search giant Baidu issued a challenge to Google. Baidu announced that its autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Apollo Go, regularly conducts the same number of rides as Waymo: 250,000 each week.Waymoreached the milestone in the spring.The majority of Chinese electric vehicles, even without self-driving software, cost a fraction of those made by US companies. Building each Waymo vehicle costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, expertsestimate, though the exact figure is not known. The CFO of Pony AI, a leader in autonomous vehicles in China, told the WSJ: “Our vehicle’s hardware cost is much, much lower than Waymo’s.”Google now needs to convince future customers that it is the higher-quality option to achieve a return on its billions of dollars of investment in Waymo.Google is using a discrepancy in transparency as a point of differentiation. There is far less publicly available data on Baidu’s cars, which raises questions about the trustworthiness of its safety record. Baidu itself claims its vehicles have suffered “not a single major accident” in their millions of miles of driving. Google pointed out in a statement tothe Wall Street Journalhow extensive its disclosure to US transportation authorities has been in a story about the success of Chinese self-driving companies.But Apollo Go, which has let its taxis loose in Dubai and Abu Dhabi as the Gulf statescourt tech deals of all stripes, isn’t Waymo’s only challenger. The wheels of WeRide, another Chinese autonomous vehicle company, have touched down in the United Arab Emirates and Singapore. All of the significant players in the Chinese market areexpanding in Europe, Reuters reports. Cars made by the firm Momenta and deployed by Uber are slated to start driving in Germany in 2026. WeRide, Baidu and Pony AI also have plans to begin robotaxi service in various European locales in the near future. Many more people are about to see self-driving cars in the course of their daily lives.After the first question of self-driving cars – can we make one that works? – the question now becomes: who will dominate the market?Read more:Driving competition: China’s carmakers in race to dominate Europe’s roadsThe week in AISam Altman’s bet: can OpenAI’s profits keep pace with industry’s soaring costs?‘It shows such a laziness’: why I refuse to date someone who uses ChatGPTWhat we lose when we surrender care to algorithmsEU could water down AI Act amid pressure from Trump and big techGoogle plans to put datacentres in space to meet demand for AIElon Musk’s faithful vote to make him $1tn richerView image in fullscreenMartin Rowson on Elon Musk’s new pay package.Illustration: Martin Rowson/The GuardianTesla is not doing well. The impending expiry of a tax credit for electric vehicles in the US brought a rush of buyers to dealerships for several months, and still the company reported a 37% drop in profits in late October. The weak earnings add to a string of weak quarters for the EV maker.Despite Tesla’s performance, Tesla shareholders voted to payElon Musk$1tn over the coming decade if he can boost Tesla’s valuation from $1.4tn in market value today to $8.5tn. If he reaches that and other goals, he will earn the largest payout in corporate history.The result of the vote was announced at the annual shareholder event in Austin, Texas, with more than 75% of investors voting in favor of the plan. Chants of “Elon” erupted in the room at the news of its approval.Though the pay package ties him to Tesla for a decade, Musk has rarely focused his attention on one company. Nor has he turned away from politics.

On X, he proclaimed that the UK would fall into civil war and western civilization would collapse.The social and financial backlash to Musk’s politics has not quelled his public embrace of the farright, and in characteristically stubborn fashion, he has begun flaunting his affiliations more openly while suggesting that being labeled racist or extremist is now meaningless to him.Read more:How Tesla shareholders put Elon Musk on path to be world’s first trillionaireCan you defeat a datacenter?View image in fullscreenA Google datacenter in Santiago.Photograph: Rodrigo Arangua/AFP/Getty ImagesThe datacenters that power the artificial intelligence boom are beyondenormous. Their financials, their physical scale and the amount of information contained within them are all so huge that the idea of stopping their construction can seem like opposing an avalanche in progress. Silicon Valley’s biggest firms are spending hundreds of billions as fast as they can.Despite the scale and momentum of the explosion of datacenters, resistance is mountingin the United States,in the United Kingdomand in Latin America, where datacenters have been built in some of the world’s driest areas. Local opposition in all three regions has often focused on the environmental impacts and resource consumption of the gargantuan structures.Paz Peña is a researcher and fellow with the Mozilla Foundation who studies the social and environmental impact of technology, particularly datacenters and particularly in Latin America. She spoke to the Guardian at the Mozilla Festival in Barcelona about how communities in Latin America are going to court to pry information away from governments and corporations that would much rather keep it secret.

From the moment you saw her bright little face in Upstairs, Downstairs, you knew she was going somewhere because people just loved her. You don’t often find that: people can admire you, but to be immediately loved as she was is unusual. I think that was half her secret – knowing how to love and be loved.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins and Julia Mckenzie in the Shirley Valentine film.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarPauline shared so many traits with Shirley: crispness mixed with warmth, kindness and generosity, being very down-to-earth – and very funny. She just had everything for that role. She was born to play it.She didn’t do a lot of technique, although she was very experienced and a thorough pro on set. You didn’t get technique thrown at you – you got Pauline thrown at you. Which was just what you wanted.Then in 2010 she guest-starred on an episode of Marple. We were shooting the scene in which I had to give a long, convoluted speech saying who killed who and where and why. I had a bit of a meltdown. I lost track of my lines and we had to stop the scene – which had never happened before.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins in Marple episode The Pale Horse (2010).Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockI was murmuring to myself: “I’ve gotta give this up, I’ve gotta give this up.” Pauline was very calm and said: “Sit down, have a cup of tea, relax, and then we’ll go again.” It really helped me and stuck with me – her humanity and compassion.I remember an evening we spent together socially after that. She and my husband had a long chat about work. He asked her what her favourite roles were to play, and she said: “Well, something a bit sexy, really.” And she did bring that to roles, too – especially Shirley Valentine. She was very sweet. My thoughts are with John and their family. The care they showed her was unbelievable. She really was much loved.‘Her restraint and economy were what made her so funny’Jonathan PryceView image in fullscreenPauline Collins and Jonathan Pryce in Dough.Photograph: TCD/Prod DB/AlamyI first worked with Pauline 50 years ago at the Old Vic. I was 28 and making my London stage debut inComedians. Pauline was already an established TV star and a warm, sincere and hugely talented actor. What I remember most is her kindness and the laughter. She had a great sense of fun and, during the run of Engaged, while delighting the audience, she could also reduce her fellow actors to fits of giggles with just a look.As an actor she showed restraint and economy, which made her so funny and so compelling. Her honesty always shone through. I was hugely fond of her and 40 years later got to work with her again in the film Dough. She was still as generous and witty and lovable as ever. I am so sad for John and her family, but so glad I had the chance to know her.Explore more on these topicsFilmTelevisionTheatreJonathan PryceComedy filmsAlison SteadmanComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was even a recent music forum in California calledDeath to Spotify.So the timing is fortuitous for a growing number of independent streaming and music community platforms, such as Nina Protocol, Coda, Subvert, Lissen, Vocana, and just last week a new one launched in the UK: Cantilever. “More people are definitely looking for alternatives,” says Nina Protocol’s chief executive Mike Pollard. “We strongly believe the future of music is independent.”Each of the new platforms have unique identities. Nina Protocol uses an open public network, where artists set their terms and keep 100% of any revenue from downloads; the collectively owned Subvert is intended to be an alternative to Bandcamp, where music files are bought and sold. Cantilever takes inspiration from curated film streaming platforms such as Mubi, offering a limited and rotating number of albums at a time (currently 10, but up to 30).What unites them is curation, a sense of community and an artist-friendly, anti-corporate model. “We think a lot about the dignity of releasing music,” says Pollard. “I don’t think these algorithm-driven reasons for why something’s getting played are very dignified: are you just something that sounds like something they already like? An artist may say, ‘one of my songs did well onSpotifybecause it was put in the most popular sleep playlist’. But maybe the 500,000 people who listened to that track weren’t even awake! And how many of those people know your name, care about you or would buy a ticket to a show?”View image in fullscreenCantilever founder Aaron Skates.Photograph: Courtesy: Aaron SkatesMany of these new services also have written articles and editorial, intending to offer contextual deep dives for a more focused listening experience. “It’s like a music magazine you can listen to,” says Cantilever’s Aaron Skates, an ex-record label worker and music writer who has launched the streaming platform. Skates has managed to pull in an impressive list of independent labels to work with too, such as Warp, Ninja Tune, Domino and Beggars Group labels such as Rough Trade, 4AD and Matador.By having a smaller roster of artists, it means they receive more money. “The pool is far less diluted,” Skates says. “We’re paying out a maximum of 30 artists for all subscriber revenue, versus the 100m tracks on Spotify. Also, we pay on a user-centric basis, so that means your fee will only ever go towards the music that you actually listen to.” Skates gives me an example: if Cantilever was to get 10,000 subscribers at £4.99 a month, that would result in albums on the service receiving £2,000-3,000 each, which he says is “roughly the equivalent of a million Spotify streams”.Spotify says in a company response that it “welcomes and celebrates choice and new perspectives,” but claims: “The narrative that the current system is failing artists is not supported by the facts; more artists are earning more than ever. Rather than just re-dividing the current pie” – through models like Cantilever’s user-centric one – “Spotify is focused on growing it for everyone, increasing the total royalties paid out year after year.”So, is all this new activity rooted in a revolt against the big companies? “I’m wary about saying that it is anti-Spotify,” says Simon Wheeler, director of commercial strategy at Beggars Group. “Perhaps more a disillusionment with the complete commoditisation of music. There’s always a swathe of new entrants to the market, but there’s more coming up that are talking about trying to provide an alternative. The tone of that conversation has changed.”Wheeler does not view these startups as major competition, though. “Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, none of them are going anywhere anytime soon,” he says. “So it’s more like: let’s try and bring something in which is offering something a bit different.” Skates echoes this: “Cantilever is not in any way competitive towards current major DSPs [digital service providers],” he says. “It’s a totally different thing. I don’t expect anybody to cancel their subscription and just have this – it’s an additional thing that tries to give additional value that wasn’t there before.”View image in fullscreenA view of Nina Protocol.Photograph: NinaPollard, on the other hand, “can see a world where Spotify doesn’t exist in the future,” he says. “Where people realise the options given to them aren’t the ones that best serve them.” Although the numbers aren’t quite showing this yet, with Spotify revealing an additional five million paying subscribers in this year’s third quarter report, that’s not to say the interest in alternatives isn’t rising. The five-person team at Nina Protocol is struggling to keep up with inbound interest and Skates says despite only launching a week ago, the interest and listener numbers for Cantilever have “surpassed my expectations”.Pollard suggests there is a wider cultural sea change beginning to take place, one that leaves him hopeful of a brighter future for music culture in the streaming era.Mood Machine by Liz Pelly review – a savage indictment of SpotifyRead more“There’s a growing awareness of how slop-filled everything is getting,” he says. “People are wanting a little more control of what they consume.” He gives the example of users leaving X, formerly Twitter: “They realised, ‘Shit, I don’t need to be here any more.’ Then you understand what it feels like to be more intentional about your choices, instead of just being on everything that you’re told you need to be on to exist. I think people are waking up.”Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingMusic industrySpotifyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The belated third entry Now You See Me: Now You Don’t swells the ranks of its tricky magician thieves to nearly Ocean’s Eleven numbers, then winds them through a heist plot that ultimately has the illusory spontaneity of a pop artist in the midst of a 30-show residency. It’s glitzy, fun fakery that fades quickly unless you’re an inexplicably hardcore fan.Train Dreams review – Joel Edgerton superb in Malickian story of trees, grief and railroadsRead moreThose fans will recall that it’s been nearly a decade since the most recent adventures of ringleader Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), card trickster Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), and escape artist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) at the behest of The Eye, a secret magician society that sends particularly skilled illusionists on righteous, spy-like missions. Actually, it’s been even longer for Henley, who wasn’t in the 2016 sequel unforgivably titled Now You See Me 2, apparently saving its more obvious moniker for this three-quel (and therefore squandering the opportunity to call the new one Now You Three Me). But the estranged quartet calling themselves the Four Horsemen are tricked into a testy reunion when a message from The Eye brings Atlas to the doorstep of a younger trio of similarly gifted magicians: Bosco (Dominic Sessa), June (Ariana Greenblatt), and Charlie (Justice Smith). Their task: steal an enormous diamond from money-laundering arms dealer Veronika Vanderberg (Rosamund Pike), a mission mostly in sync with the new kids’ proclivity for wealth redistribution, albeit more neatly traditional in its choice of evildoer.So Pike brings the star count to eight; a few other familiar faces that may or may not nudge the movie’s ensemble close to a Soderberghian near-dozen of stars. Now You See Me: Now You Don’t could use a Soderbergh-like touch behind the camera, someone with a flair for pulling off scams so sly and presentationally appealing that their absurdities may as well be actual magic. Instead, it has director Ruben Fleischer, an Eisenberg pal from two Zombielands who also made the weightless smashes Venom and Uncharted. In other words, someone about as good as his material allows. As in the previous Now You See Mes, the film-makers (including a small army of credited screenwriters) prefer nudges and excited backslapping to sly winks. This means that the mechanics of the broader heists are ultimately explained, however unconvincingly, while smaller tricks that are supposed to testify to the Four/Eight/However Many Horsemen’s more specific skill sets might as well emanate from the Fantastic Four. (How does everyone arrive at a mysterious safe house already prepared to outdo each other in an impromptu magic-off?)That’s the real perpetual danger of a Now You See Me movie: that the charmingly silly idea of magicians using their illusions to pull off elaborate heists will become overblown into its own Fast & Furious/Mission: Impossible/any given superhero saga. Forced into comparison with the best of any of those, it’s pretty low-rent stuff. Thankfully, the actors seem specifically delighted to be in a series that doesn’t require a lot of fake gravitas, just straight-enough faces when someone intones that in these troubling times, we need magic more than ever. Eisenberg probably deserves an award for making it through usable takes without a cutting remark – at least about the movie at hand. Atlas remains a good vehicle for his smarter-than-the-room prickliness, even when the room is demonstrably dumb.The movie’s mild attempts at generation-gap clashes don’t really land; at one point, Merritt chides a younger for a blasé, inexpressive word choice, but in what universe would a Woody Harrelson character blanch at use of “bummer”? Thankfully, there’s not too much of this three-way X-Y-Z battle – could be fun, but if you’re going to do it, do it right – and the newbies, especially pint-sized Greenblatt in a police-station fight scene, are just as likable as the veterans. Maybe that’s because Now You See Me: Now You Don’t still has newbie energy itself. Despite the franchise being nearly old enough for a legacy sequel, there’s a light musicality to its various feats of showmanship that makes it feel like a scrappy upstart. So does the perpetual feeling that it might disappear in a puff of smoke.Now You See Me: Now You Don’t is released in cinemas on 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsJesse EisenbergWoody HarrelsonIsla FisherAction and adventure filmsRosamund PikereviewsShareReuse this content"

While some might have called this an unfair comparison to one of cinema’s most legendary figures, for a then 31-year-old M Night Shyamalan, it was a childhood dream come true. The Indian-born, Pennsylvanian-raised film-maker had whetted his cinematic appetite on the images of Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and for better or worse, would find himself chasing that same level of stratospheric fame in the early days of his career.Despite the initial acclaim ofThe Sixth Sense, though, Shyamalan’s reputation and audience goodwill would soon begin to nosedive as his idiosyncratic directing style rubbed against the grander ambitions of his movies. But after a temporary exodus from Hollywood and a retreat to his roots in independent cinema, Shyamalan finally returned to studio film-making in 2021 with the release of Old, a masterful high-concept thriller that rekindled the director’s longtime fascination with family, parenting and the mystifying possibility of the unknown.Unfolding over the course of a single day, Old follows a group of several families and strangers who realise the secluded cove they’ve travelled to for a supposedly idyllic vacation is in fact ageing them by several years in a mere matter of hours, with any attempts made to leave the beach resulting in a dizzying blackout.M Night Shyamalan: ‘A new generation is discovering my movies. Don’t talk about the endings!’Read moreWith an eerie sense of isolation hanging over the proceedings – no doubt a result of the film’s Covid bubble shoot in the Dominican Republic – Shyamalan spends a good chunk of the first act hammering out the story’s key players. Prisca (Vicky Krieps) and Guy Cappa (Gael García Bernal) are in the midst of separating when they decide to take their two young children on what might be their final family holiday, after it’s recently discovered that Prisca has a slow-growing ovarian tumour. They are soon joined at the beach by a host of other peculiar personalities riddled with their own ailments, including schizophrenic surgeon Charles (Rufus Sewell), his hypocalcaemic trophy wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee) and perhaps most amusingly, haemophilic rapper Mid-Sized Sedan (Aaron Pierre).View image in fullscreenAaron Pierre as the haemophilic rapper Mid-Sized Sedan – part of an ensemble of peculiar and ailment-riddled holidaymakers.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyWhile the picturesque locale provides some momentary reprieve for the Cappa family, it doesn’t take long for hijinks to ensue. Shyamalan wastes no time in exploiting his ensembles’ afflictions, crafting a series of heart-racing sequences that demonstrate how the beach’s supernatural powers are exacerbating their individual maladies. After the accelerated passage of time causes Prisca’s tumour to rapidly grow in one horrifying scene, Charles must lead the group in removing the lump from her body while suffering from his own mental episode that has been aggravated by the intensified ageing.It’s all familiar territory for Shyamalan, who often exposes his characters to inexplicable events in order to shed light on their personal dilemmas. Whether it be the mysterious crop circles in Signs or the superpowered individuals of the Unbreakable-verse, his films brim with difficult truths coated in genre tropes. In Old, watching a child morph into an adult and seeing their body falter in minutes taps into the deeply human illusion of ageing as a slow, creeping process that we ignore over time until it becomes undeniably real.View image in fullscreen‘Taps into the deeply human illusion of ageing as a slow, creeping process’ … Old.Photograph: Universal PicturesOf course, it wouldn’t be a true Shyamalan movie without one of his signature plot twists, and when the coin finally drops in Old – courtesy of a cheeky cameo from the director himself – the film broadens out to question how far society is willing to go in the name of progress. While there are echoes of The Twilight Zone, Cronenbergian body horror and indeed the sentimental sensibilities of Spielberg throughout its run time, Old retains a voice that’s uniquely Shyamalan’s: earnest, ambitious and unafraid to be abrasive. In a landscape crowded with franchise fare and IP slop, it reaffirms his role as a film-maker who swings big – and just like his childhood idol, one who is able to withstand the tides of change.Old is available to rent in Australia, the UK and the US.

By contrast, this Caravaggio is a much more orthodox art-documentary treatment of its subject, playing to the strengths that the EoS films have built up over the years: beautifully crisp and detailed closeups of the work, well-informed and articulate talking-heads, and a nicely judged overall approach that is intelligent but not indigestible.To be fair, this particular artist is well worked territory, so to spruce things up, the joint directors, David Bickerstaff and Phil Grabsky, cut in sequences with a monologuing actor, Jack Bannell, in character as Caravaggio. The aim is to fill in the void of the painter’s personality, of which, outside police and court reports, very little is known. Bannell certainly gives it his all and, tricked out in full beard and makeup effect facial wound, definitely looks the part – alarmingly so when the film cuts toa shot of David with the Head of Goliath, which gruesomely contains Caravaggio’s own features on the severed head. It’s not a totally successful device: there’s occasionally something of the one-man-fringe-play about it, but in its favour it gets across the trigger points in Caravaggio’s life, particularly the final few years when legal troubles forced him to regularly move, from Rome to Naples to Malta, and back again.Of course, the main issue is how well the film makes sense of its subject’s life and work, and this Caravaggio is well up to scratch; it’s tough, of course, to probe every corner of such a titan’s output, but there’s interesting material here on the step-by-step progression of Caravaggio’s early career, as well as his seemingly committed Christian faith. LikeKen Burns’s three-hour treatise on Leonardo(currently on BBC iPlayer), Caravaggio makes room for explicitly religious commentary, something that has not always been a given in the secularised art-criticism world, even when the work is obviously deeply Christian. It is perhaps a reflection of the times we are living in, but it is undeniably a benefit to the understanding of the art itself.Caravaggiois in cinemas from 11 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsCaravaggioChristianityReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

An elegant, brutal taste of the Wuthering Heights OST(Atlantic)Featuring a lugubrious monologue from the Velvet Underground legend, its jagged strings are more reminiscent of that band than anything on BratAlexis PetridisTue 11 Nov 2025 06.22 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 14.50 ESTShareWhen Charli xcx says her first new material in more than a year is “something entirely new, entirely opposite” to the sound she pursued onthe era-defining Brat, she isn’t joking. Taken from the soundtrack to director Emerald Fennell’sforthcoming adaptation of Wuthering Heights, the darkly gothic House bears almost no relation in sound or mood to the contents of Brat: it was, she says, inspired by John Cale’s description of the sound of his old mob the Velvet Underground as “elegant and brutal”.Alwaysskilled and generous at collaboration, here Charli xcx cedes two-thirds of the track’s vocal to Cale. He delivers a monologue – oblique and initially conversational, it turns increasingly ominous – in a voice that’s rich, sonorous and, to a certain kind of music fan at least, immediate recognisable. Weathered by time at age 83, it’s still audibly the same voice that recounted Lou Reed’s grisly short story The Gift on White Light/White Heat 57 years ago.Charli xcx: House ft John Cale – videoMoreover, something of Cale’s musical spirit seems to infect the whole track: it isn’t clear whether he actually plays on the song, but regardless of who’s behind the music, its droning strings, shards of jagged feedback-like noise and the sheer quantity of distortion that cakes its final minute all seem to call back to his time with the Velvet Underground. So, in a less direct way, do the agonised howls that xcx unleashes at the song’s conclusion: Cale was always the Velvet Underground member most interested in disrupting their music with unsettling noise, unleashing a series of demonic hisses during The Black Angel’s Death Song and dragging a chair across the studio floor before pushing it into a pile of metal plates a minute into European Son. And the Velvet Underground aren’t the only inspiration here – when the track’s beat belatedly kicks in, you sense the influence of Nine Inch Nails.How it fits into Fennell’s take onWuthering Heightsremains to be seen, although you could, at a push, link the lyrics of Cale’s monologue to the twin fates of Catherine and Heathcliff. Alternately creepy and cathartic, it might just as easily have come from another of xcx’s forthcoming cinematic roles, director Daniel Goldhaber’s movie based on the notorious 1978 mondo horror Faces of Death.Indeed, given how music of a horror film bent leaps up the charts around Halloween, she might have missed a commercial trick not releasing House a couple of weeks ago. But perhaps that would have been too gimmicky, and in fairness, House doesn’t need a gimmick to work. It’s powerful, striking and rewarding: a sharp left-turn into fertile new territory.Explore more on these topicsCharli xcxJohn CalePop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fosse, who is also a poet and an essayist, and one of the most widely performed playwrights in the world, follows his own path. A case in point: Septology (2019-2021), published across three volumes, running to more than 800 pages, containing a single sentence. Forget formalism, though; his fictions, often set in fjordic Norway, are disintegration loops, quiet and incantatory, emotionally overwhelming.At fewer than 120 pages, Vaim, his first new work since winning the Nobel, is a wisp of a thing. Divided into three sections, each narrated by a different character, it begins with Jatgeir sailing on a small boat from the small town of Vaim to the big city of Bjørgvin. His mission is to buy a needle and thread to fix a missing button. It’s a long journey and, not just at one shop but at two, he gets royally ripped off, being charged far over the odds for a single spool. He huffs and seethes, but says nothing to the storekeepers themselves. What a hick, we might think. What a chump.Jatgeir, part Prufrock, part sitcom sadsack, lives alone in the house of his dead parents. Its curtains are beige, his hair is greying, occasionally he trims his beard. Far from rich, he is invisible to the women around him. He often finds himself harking back to Eline, the “secret love of my youth”. When he named his boat after her, the locals had giggled and she had moved away. How surprising, then – absurd, even – that on the night of his sewing thread humiliation, he is roused from his sleep by Eline calling his name. She’d like him, she says, to rescue her from her fisher husband. Back to Vaim they sail.This could be quite the romance, were it nota Fosse novel. The story stops, is picked up by Jatgeir’s only friend – the religiously minded Elias – only to stop again. This time the narrative baton is passed on to Frank, the husband Eline had left in the first section. Eline herself, though central to everything that happens, is elusive. More about her may emerge later (Vaim is the first volume in a planned trilogy), but all that’s revealed here is that she had been “such a silly girl”, left home young and worked for a rich family. Her ability to make men do her bidding is unnerving, a species of sorcery; she seems spectral, a figure from medieval dream poetry.Ambiguity mists the whole novel. Jatgeir wonders if Eline is a mirage, describes their encounter as “incomprehensible, inconceivable”, reflects on how “a dream is a dream and reality is reality, but in a way reality has always been, yes, no, no not like a dream, but reality has had something dreamlike about it too probably my whole life, reality is in the dream the way the boat is in the water”. Scenes take place in the gloaming, when day commingles with night. There are mysterious knocks on doors, talk of ghosts, even mention of an institution that often appears in Fosse’s fiction: a madhouse.How can prose that is so simple – cushions are ‘nice’, work is ‘trusty’ – pulse with such feeling?The characters are blurry and dissolving, too. Eline, whose name looks close to Elias, wasn’t born Eline. Jatgeir, whose name isn’t Jatgeir, can’t remember if a niece is called Gudrun Anna or Anna Gudrun. The men, tending to the passive, are likened to “old maids”; the female characters are purposeful and “masculine”. Meanwhile, time is bent and inscrutable – bar a fleeting reference to a car, the book could have been set 100 or more years ago. Invocations of yesteryear and the old days abound, but it’s often left unclear if what’s being alluded to actually happened far more recently.Fosse has spoken of his fiction as “mystical realism”. For all the roaming metaphysics and magnificently recursive, hypnagogic rhythms of this one-sentence novel, it’s those passages grounded in the everyday that pop – scenes featuring meatballs and rice pudding, comparisons between American and European suitcases, Jatgeir admitting that for much of his life he had felt closer to boats than to any woman. (His own he treats with masturbatory care – “I laid my hand flat on a board of the boat and gently rubbed my hand back and forth along the board and then I sat there and I sort of half-dozed off”.)“All was strange”: that’s what Jatgeir hopes will be written on his tombstone. It’s also the abiding feeling upon finishing Vaim. How can prose that is so simple – cushions are “nice”, work is “trusty” – pulse with such feeling? How can it be so littoral, incarnating the light and spray and tidal tempos of these seascapes with such power? And how can a novelist make a reader feel so lost and so found at the same time? It is strange. A strange miracle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When he runs out of victims, the young Persian queen Shahrazad volunteers but stalls her own murder by telling the king one captivating tale after another – and those become the stories we’re reading.AsJeanette Wintersonputs it in her new book – a dizzying whirligig of memoir, history, philosophy, politics and self-help, loosely tied to commentary on the Nights – Shahrazad’s feat of creativity “refuses the present emergency – the contrived drama of a powerful man”. The echo of life in the Trump era is deliberate; for Winterson, the means by which Shahrazad changes her predicament holds out hope for a progressive politics currently losing ground to “radical-rightwing thuggery”. “A better story starts with a better story,” she writes. “Reason will not win the day. Without imagination nothing changes.”Each chapter opens with a pithy retelling of one of Shahrazad’s tales, spritzed with 21st-century idiom (“The Vizier … has no manosphere where he can vent”), before giving way to wide-ranging reflections on anything and everything, from the history of eugenics, to 13th-century Mali, to the awfulness of the trouser suits “preferred by some CEO types and lots of female politicians”. As opinions on matters big and small fly past, the tone evokes by turns a party political broadcast, Radio 4’s Thought for the Day, an old friend setting the world to rights. “A global economy that works for the many is not a childish dream … There’s always enough money for a weapons factory.” A brisk analysis of the misogyny of Mozart’s Così Fan Tutte concludes that it’s pointless to cancel dead artists (“We’re not marrying them”). At one point, Winterson tells us that compassion is wasted on sex offenders: “There is such a thing as evil, and we should not excuse it or forgive it.”It feels thrillingly direct, even when her views are run of the mill: the internet fosters division because “millions of followers … cluster round ideas rotten at the core – like flies on a carcass”, while smartphones lull us into photographing our lives without actually seeing anything. “I am sure people are addicted to falling in love because it’s one of the scant times when we really do look and look and look,” says Winterson, writing of how a new lover sharpens our perception; but the best remedy, she suggests, is art, which lets us “get closer to ourselves”, unlike the dopamine mill of TikTok (“a miserable way to live”).More unorthodox is Winterson’s embrace of big tech’s potential to redefine selfhood, a subject previously addressed in her essay collection 12 Bytes (2021) and her sex-robot novel Frankissstein (2019). The metaverse enables “the you that is not met, or served, in the usual world”. Nanobots in our bloodstream, like silicon chips in our brains, let us be “no longer dependent on a body, or what a body depends on” – which doesn’t mean not being human, “unless you think being human begins and ends with biology”. As for sentient AI, bring it on: “Our game of thrones will be over … What would a non-biological entity want with gold, cars, private jets, guns and land grab?”It’s hard to reconcile this with the general thrust of her politics, though the idea that fallen humanity might learn a thing or two from a disembodied redeemer perhaps bears the trace of Winterson’s evangelical upbringing, written about elsewhere and revisited here. Her adoptive mother hoped she’d be a missionary, and maybe there’s a trace of that, too, in the infectious urgency of this freewheeling disquisition.For Shahrazad, art makes the difference between life and death, and it’s never not been essential, Winterson argues. “Who comes home, after a long day hunting and gathering just to stay alive, and settles down to paint pictures on the wall? Humans! And first we had to make the crayons. So don’t tell me art is a luxury.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This week sees the start of previews for Ivo van Hove’s production of Miller’s first Broadway hit, All My Sons, which has had half a dozen major revivals over the past five decades. Indeed, you could argue that Miller is more honoured here than at home. On his death it was said in the Times Literary Supplement: “He was mourned in England as a revered contemporary, in America as a figure from a bygone age.”Why this division? One answer, supplied by All My Sons, is that Miller analysed the American psyche while being steeped in European tradition. It is difficult to discuss this particular play without giving away the plot. It is, however, an open secret that it hinges on the unproven accusation that Joe Keller, as a wartime manufacturer of aircraft engines, allowed faulty cylinder heads to be dispatched to the air force knowing they could endanger life.Immediately this makes one think of Ibsen. In The Pillars of Society,rarely seen these days, a wealthy shipowner allows his detested brother-in-law to go to sea in a rotten vessel only to discover that his own son is also on board. In his brilliant book on Miller’s plays, Christopher Bigsby also references The Wild Duck and sees in Joe’s son, Chris, an embodiment of the flawed idealist comparable to Ibsen’s Gregers Werle. But Bigsby hits the nail on the head when he says that Miller, exactly like Ibsen, blends the tragic and the comic and shows the present for ever haunted by the past.View image in fullscreenPresent haunted by the past … Bill Pullman, Colin Morgan, Sally Field and Jenna Coleman in the 2019 production of All My Sons at the Old Vic.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhile Miller is clearly indebted to Ibsen, he is also a profoundly American writer. I once had the temerity to ask him, in the course of a public interview about his autobiography, Timebends, whether he had ever considered relocating to Europe since at home he had endured political persecution and critical hostility. I remember Miller looking faintly aghast at the idea and stressing his commitment to his native land.No American critic has written better about this than Harold Clurman who, in his review of the original 1947 production of All My Sons, made a vital distinction between a play’s material and its meaning, and saw in Miller “a moral talent with a passionate persistence that resembles that of the New England preacher who fashioned our first American rhetoric”.Given that All My Sons is Ibsenite and American, how does one stage it? Looking back at three past productions, I am struck by their social realism and strong performances. Michael Blakemore’s 1981 production, also at Wyndham’s, stressed the play’s folksy back-yard humour and was expertly played, with Colin Blakely lending Joe a stocky muscularity and Rosemary Harris investing his wife, Kate, with the look of a blooming martyr.View image in fullscreenStark … Mark Strong, centre, in A View from the Bridge by Arthur Miller at Young Vic in 2014, directed by Ivo van Hove.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHoward Davies, who had first directed the play at the National in 2000, did an even better productionin the West End in 2010with David Suchet, like Blakely, stressing Joe’s back-yard bonhomie and Zoë Wanamaker subtly suggesting that Kate was as swathed in pretence as her husband.Arthur Miller: ‘My legacy? Some good parts for actors’Read moreMore recently, in 2019, Jeremy Herrin directed itat the Old Vicwith two American actors in the lead: Bill Pullman as a strenuously self-justifying Joe, and Sally Field, encasing herself in her cardigan as if it were a protective shield, as a superb Kate.So what can we expect from Van Hove? Given that in his celebrated 2014 Young Vic revival ofA View from the Bridgehe dispensed with Red Hook realism to stage the play in a stark black box, I doubt we will get an Ohio back yard that looks as if it were a Norman Rockwell cover for an American magazine. With Bryan Cranston as Joe, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Paapa Essiedu as Kate and Chris, we can also expect a fresh take on the Keller family. But, however it turns out, I hope the production recognises that Miller is a deeply American moralist with a bias to the European past, from Aeschylus to Ibsen.All My Sons is atWyndham’s theatre, London, 14 November to 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreArthur MillerWest EndIvo van HovefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that’s enough about Birmingham. There’s plenty more where that came from in Death to the West (Midlands), an adroit solo debut from the self-styled “amusing Arab”, the son of Middle Eastern incomers now addressing in standup his complex sense of belonging. The whole show balances his Brummie and his Iraqi identities, with reference to his stereotypical immigrant dad, his growing up during the second Iraq war, and – finally – visiting his so-called homeland as an adult.It’s an extremely polished introduction to Al-Habib and his talents; perhaps a little too smooth and slickly engineered, wanting some grit in its machine. A factor in that may be its flirting-with-formulaic familiarity as a second-generation narrative. Which isn’t to doubt the truth and emotional significance to our host of the stories he tells of feeling shame at his Iraqi background when the country was at war with the UK and of trying to pass as white British to fit in. If any of this sounds tormented, it certainly isn’t in the telling: Al-Habib’s touch couldn’t be lighter as he cracks wise about Margaret Thatcher’s contraceptive value, Jack Grealish as a Brummie archetype, and how his father learned to love Jewish people.In the former Footlights man’s hands, this stuff twinkles like sunlight on the Tigris (or should that be the Grand Union Canal?), as he joshes us about Islamic terrorism and the imminent Muslim takeover of the UK. Ballast is provided by one traumatic story of his father’s life under Saddam (later deployed as an unlikely cautionary tale at a UK theme park), and elsewhere by incidences of everyday racism directed at the seven-year-old Hasan and towards his stoical dad – whose relationship with his son is sketched here in an understated but eloquent filial portrait. It’s an adept and enjoyable show, finally, about what belonging looks like for a man suspended between the Middle East and the West Midlands.AtSoho theatre, London, until 15 November.Explore more on these topicsComedySoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is an investment in imagination, in our shared experience – and in inspiration and joyTue 11 Nov 2025 09.32 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 09.34 ESTShareDurham is a small, beautiful city in the north-east of England that sits in a region of rising poverty and inequality. About 45,000 people, a cathedral, a castle, a university and streets that glow every two years when theLumiere festivalfills them with light and art.Since 2009, Lumiere has brought more than 250 artists from across the world to work in this extraordinary city.Ai Weiweiin the Cathedral’s Chapter House.Fujiko Nakayaon the riverbank.Chila Kumari Singh Burmanin the market square. The festival has reached more than 1.3 million people, drawn £43m into the local economy, and involved nearly 14,000 people in community projects. It worked because it was free, exciting and good. A rare combination.And now it’s over. After 15 years, the lights go out on Lumiere Durham. And with it goes one more piece of the UK’s cultural fabric.The arts sector is crumbling. We’ve lived through decades of neglect. The system that’s meant to support it is broken. Artists are exhausted, Arts Council England follows policy rather than shaping it. Government investment in ACE has fallen by 32% in real terms since 2010. Its main grant-giving platformcollapsed and was out of actionfor four months this year. When Jaguar Land Rover suffered a cyber-attack, the Treasurystepped in with a £1.5bn loan. When the Arts Council site went down, the government offered technical advice but no cash.View image in fullscreenBlinding … Ai Weiwei’s Illuminated Bottle Rack in 2023.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesLocal authorities are broke too. Years of central funding cuts have left them with impossible choices. Social care or sculpture? Bin collections or ballet? We all know what gets dropped when those are the choices.And as we head towards the autumn budget on 26 November, little has been said about what support will be offered to the arts. Industry bodies and campaigners are warning that the coming budget could be a tipping point. Without targeted investment, many organisations will not survive the next financial year. Business rates relief for cultural buildings is due to end. The Shared Prosperity Fund, which replaced EU regional support,is winding down. Local authorities, already on their knees, face further real-terms cuts.Meanwhile, UK Research and Innovation spends less than 2% of its budget on the arts and humanities. Trusts and foundations around the country are closing or turning away new arts applicants. And yet the governmentfinds half a billion poundsfor three major sporting events – the Euros, the Tour de France, and the European Athletics Championships – and another £400m for “grassroots facilities”. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: “Sport tells our story in a way few other things can.”I would strongly argue that it’s the arts that tells our story. It helps us understand who we are and it’s what has always connected us, across time and place. In Durham, for a few nights every two years, the streets are filled, not with division or anger, but with light, laughter and quiet awe. People stand side by side, strangers together, looking up. That’s what art can do.So why has Lumiere ended?It would be easy to blame the new Reform-led council in Durham. But the previous LibDem/Tory coalition started the process. And this government has just cut bursaries to trainee teachers in humanities subjects. The truth is, there is no political party that will commit to the kind of investment needed to keep a living art and culture ecology alive, despite the huge returns in financial and culture value.So where does the real fault lie? With all of us. With the arts community that has failed to convince politicians and the Treasury that art is not a luxury but a public service. And with the wider public who don’t make this an electoral issue.The numbers are there in spades. The arts and culture industry contributes more than £10bn annuallyto the UK economy and£2.8bn each year to the Treasury through taxation, alone.View image in fullscreenCommunal pride … I Love Durham by Jacques Rival in 2019.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAYou can and should count jobs, exports, return on investment and audience numbers. But you can’t count what it feels like to stand in a crowd and be moved, you can’t quantify wonder, inspiration or joy. That’s what we’ve lost.We talk about “funding” as if it’s a favour. It’s not. It’s investment in imagination, in shared experience and in our national story. We invest in trains, hospitals, and clean water because we know they’re essential. Art is essential too.The budget later this month could show whether the government understands that, or not. Sector leaders are calling for a new national arts recovery plan. Not charity but public investment on the same footing as sport or science. Even a small commitment would send a signal that culture matters, that it’s part of how we rebuild our economy and communities.That argument appears to have been lost long ago with Whitehall. But not, it seems, in Durham. People there understood. They came, year after year, in the rain and the cold, to stand together in the light, unified by art. Now the lights are out and what are they left with? Flags and banners?And unless something changes, Lumiere won’t be the last to go dark.Explore more on these topicsArt and designFestivalsArts Council EnglandArts fundingArts policycommentShareReuse this content"

Victims often feel they’ve made a terrible mistake and are at fault – but really, they’ve been expertly groomed by criminalsAnna MooreTue 11 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTShareIn total, over two and a half years, Elizabeth gave £100,000 to “Sam”, the “man” she met online, who she thought she loved and loved her back. She emptied her savings account, pawned her late mother’s jewellery and took out bank loans. She became so overdrawn that she could barely afford food and lived mainly on soup.She had sent this money, for all sorts of reasons, to a man she’d never met. The first was a $500 Amazon voucher because Sam, a consultant, was out on an oil rig and needed to buy a manual. Later, the rig required a new part; then the tanker transporting the oil ran into problems, too. She gave money to Sam’s daughter who was trapped in an abusive marriage. Finally, when Sam became ill, Elizabeth was contacted by his doctor and began paying Sam’s medical bills. “When this doctor messaged to tell me that Sam was in a coma, I remember thinking he had such a strange, unprofessional turn of phrase,” says Elizabeth. “He said, ‘I’m sorry to spill the beans.’” She breaks into laughter. “A doctor! How could I have been so gullible?”The scam ended in August last year only because Elizabeth’s adult sons confronted her and broke the spell. Next came crashing waves of shock, along with shame, anger, fear and a strange, searing grief. “I was mourning a person that didn’t exist,” she says.I’m often asked: who falls for this? The answer is: anyone who’s humanShe still feels all of these emotions, which is partly why she now laughs. (“If I didn’t laugh, I’d never stop crying. Then I’d be no good to anyone.”) But she also laughs because, in hindsight, the stories she’d been spun now seem absurd. How could a sharp, funny, intelligent woman who had worked for years in the travel industry and spoke three languages have fallen for them?Elizabeth, 67, asks herself this question daily, butthe latest warningsfrom Lloyds show she is one of many. Over the past 12 months, romance scams reported by the bank’s customers aged over 55 rose by 52%.More than £106m was lostto romance fraud in the UK over the last financial year – and this only covers reported cases.According to Dr Elisabeth Carter, a criminologist and forensic linguist at Kingston University, London, asking how someone could have “fallen for it” is to misunderstand the crime. “Even now, despite the numbers, warnings around romance fraud are along the lines of ‘don’t be fooled’,” she says. “We don’t tell people not to fall for a mugging or a sexual assault. It blames the victim for somehow being negligent.”In fact, says Carter, romance fraud is far closer to grooming and abuse than it is to theft or burglary. “The methods used are intimately aligned with those we see in coercive control and domestic abuse,” she says. “The victim’s reality becomes so distorted over weeks, months or years that the decisions they make seem rational and reasonable. I’m often asked, ‘Who falls for this?’ The answer is: anyone who is human.”View image in fullscreen‘He wanted to know everything about me and I opened up like a giant elevator.’Composite: Guardian Design/Juanmonino/Getty ImagesVictim selection“There’s no broad ‘vulnerable’ category, but there are situational vulnerabilities that we can all fall into across a lifespan, such as being bereaved, losing a job or moving to a new area,” says Carter. All these might make someone more stressed and distracted, and more open to an online connection.In Elizabeth’s case, she had left an abusive partner of 37 years, finally moving into her own home with her youngest son who was in his 20s. She was in the early stages of recovery when she met “Sam”.“I certainly wasn’t looking for anyone,” she says. “I was on a Facebook site about dogs when this person started chatting to me about the weirdest thing. He said that rabbits were eating his daughter’s plants. I sent him the Amazon link to a type of wire mesh. I accepted his friend request and he later sent me a picture of the mesh being put up and thanking me.”Love bombing and trauma bombingTheir rapport felt instant. “He got my sense of humour,” says Elizabeth. “I’m quite sarcastic and he’d bat that back at me. I love that. It’s all my birthdays at once.” Sam claimed he was half American, half Norwegian, based in Texas. He constantly sent photos of himself, an attractive, bearded, grey-haired man going to work, eating dinner, living his life. “He sent poems and memes. He wanted to know everything about me and I opened up like a giant elevator. I had so much to say about my ex, so he learned my vulnerabilities.” (A year later, when Sam said his daughter needed funds to escape an abusive husband, of course Elizabeth helped.)The attention was intoxicating. “When I needed dental work, he was messaging in the waiting room, bigging me up. Someone was actually being kind. I’d never had that before. I was spellbound.” Sam seemed vulnerable, too. “His wife had cheated on him,” says Elizabeth. “She was now with this other man, travelling the world.” Trust was important to Sam. He wanted to know if Elizabeth had ever been unfaithful. Would she hurt him too?This trauma bombing is key, says Carter. “Slowly, reticently, they reveal things that make themselves look really vulnerable after initially seeming very capable,” she says. “It puts the burden of responsibility on the victim to keep the fraudster safe. It makes them misunderstand the power balance. They feel responsible for the fraudster’s feelings, determined not to let them down at any cost.”View image in fullscreen‘Any time I heard the phone ping, I’d be like a puppy.’Photograph: Tero Vesalainen/Getty ImagesSam “overshared”. “He told me all his life plans in huge detail, sending me work contracts, and then when he took out a loan and remortgaged his house, he showed me all that, too. When he went for a job interview in California, he shared his location as he wanted me to see where he was. When he didn’t get the job, I’d feel all his disappointment. He seemed like a hard-working man with big ambition, stretched to the limit.” His financial pressures began to feel like Elizabeth’s. “I felt part of it, and responsible for his life.”After six months of messaging, and the occasional short call, Sam messaged, “I feel like a whole thing is happening here but I don’t want to scare you?” Then he wrote, “I love you. Is that too much too soon?”“My God, I was elated,” says Elizabeth. “I’d never heard anybody say that and mean it.” All this had happened without any requests for money.Sleep deprivation“Any time I heard the phone ping, I’d be like a puppy,” says Elizabeth. “If it was 2am, we could still text for four hours. I had him enabled so he was never muted, whatever time it was. If I woke at dawn, I’d be a demented beast, checking my phone.”“It feels romantic, but sleep deprivation really degrades your cognitive ability to think clearly and make good decisions,” says Carter. “Victims don’t ever complain, as it feels like someone can’t get enough of you – but it leaves no room to think clearly about what’s going on, or even to talk to other people.”Scripting, hyper-intimacy and isolationSam crept into every corner of Elizabeth’s life. He sent her music. “So many songs. The first was Sara Bareilles’ I Choose You. I started listening to her albums on a loop.” She loved online games such as Word Chums – so Sam downloaded them and they played together. Food was another big topic. “He’d go on about me eating, worried that I wasn’t eating enough,” she says. “He’d tell me what to eat and send recipes and pictures of his meals.”Elizabeth sent him pictures, too. “Because of my last relationship, Sam was always telling me that I apologised too much,” she says. “So we had this thing that every time I used the word ‘sorry’ in our messages, I had to send a photo as a forfeit. The awful thing is that he has a catalogue of photos of me now. Some in my pyjamas, one in stockings and suspenders.” There was barely a moment that didn’t involve Sam. “I even started learning Norwegian,” she says.“You’re not in the real world, you’re in this pretend, amazing world. I still lived with my youngest son and he’d joke about how I’d talk to him for five minutes, then get this hazed look and zone out – because there was always something going on with Sam.”“A lot of this is scripting the most basic things we do,” says Carter. “Eating. Sleeping. Our daily habits. Those are being controlled really early on. It’s a short leap from ‘Eat this meal’ to ‘Sendan iTunes voucher’.”It also isolates the victim. “It prevents anyone from stepping in with a reality check,” says Carter, “and when the demands for money start, it stops victims from seeking advice elsewhere.” Fraudsters typically urge victims to keep the relationship secret, often saying that no one else could ever understand it. Sam didn’t do this – but still, the relationship’s intensity separated Elizabeth from her support system. “My sons were pleased I’d met someone after everything their dad had put us all through,” she says. “They made me promise never to give him money. I said of course I wouldn’t – so when I started to, I kept it secret.”Dream building“Ultimately, the plan was that when he came off his last job on the oil rig, I would fly to America to live happily ever after,” says Elizabeth. “It’s terrible. I’d recently become a grandmother but I was happy to leave my family on the flip of a coin.”View image in fullscreen‘When he disappeared, I’d absolutely panic.’Photograph: Pla2na/Getty ImagesThis final dream, this finishing line, propels romance fraud forward. “Everything is moving towards being together,” says Carter. Fraudsters do all they can to make it real – planning holidays, sending links to the best hotels, asking victims to house-hunt for their future home. They might escalate language, using terms such as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ for one another. “For the victim, everything they do, any money they give, is moving them towards that end point,” says Carter.Gaslighting and withdrawalSometimes Elizabeth raised questions. “Something wouldn’t make sense, like another request for money, or it could be something else. How was he spending so much time in a certain country without running over his visa? If I questioned anything, he’d turn it back on me so brilliantly.” (“I thought you trusted me?” “How can you say this?”) She wondered if the problem was her. Had her previous relationship made her paranoid and suspicious?More harrowing were the times Sam disappeared offline for days. “I’d absolutely panic – my life just emptied.” According to Carter, this tactic guarantees future compliance: “After all the incredible love-bombing, they withdraw it and that silence feels terrifying for victims. What’s happened? Is it over? What did they do wrong? When the fraudsters return with some story about urgently needing money, the victim happily gives it. Anything to stop them disappearing again.”End stage“On some level, I’d realised it wasn’t right long before my sons intervened,” says Elizabeth, “but the brain is weird. I almost convinced myself that it was going to be OK as that was easier than admitting the enormity of it, the money I’d lost.” Her son found some of the paperwork in her bedroom and called his brothers. “It was a huge shock to them, but they couldn’t have been more supportive,” she says. “They made me see the truth, and they said, ‘All we care about is you.’”Although Elizabeth wasn’t able to get any answers from “Sam” by confronting him (by this point he was supposedly in a coma), in Carter’s experience, the end stage of a romance scam can be truly chilling. The mask slips. “They don’t have to be nice any more,” she says. “Just like in an abusive relationship, when the abuser realises they are losing control, the threats can really escalate to ‘Now you’re going to suffer’. They’ll message saying, ‘I’ve got 15 of your naked pictures and four of your videos and I’m sharing them with everyone you know unless you send money,’ or ‘I’ve got your home address. Follow my instructions or I’ll burn your house down.’”In the immediate aftermath, these possibilities terrified Elizabeth. “As well as feeling devastated and ashamed, I was a nervous wreck,” she says. “I saw a man sitting in his car outside my house and convinced myself he was one of the scammers. My son had to get a baseball bat while we spied on him through the window. He finally drove off, completely oblivious. The fact that somewhere someone has those pictures will haunt me for ever.”Experience: I’m a scam hunter who got scammedRead moreElizabeth reported it to the police, who told her that this was most likely the work of a criminal gang in another country, and the chance of a prosecution and conviction was very low. Her monthly Victim Support meetings with other victims of romance fraud have been a lifeline, she says. “Every time you think you’ve heard it all, someone comes with a story that shocks you all over again,” she says.She did manage to get a large sum of the money refunded by her bank, though not all of it. “As for my own recovery, I’m right at the beginning,” she says. “I still ruminate on this every single day and don’t know if I’ll ever stop. The scammers are sick. They’ve got no soul. But they are very, very clever.”How to stay safeCarter says that all the advice about not giving money to strangers “doesn’t work with romance fraud. To a victim of grooming, this person isn’t a stranger.”She suggests making sure you keep having conversations about your relationship with friends and family. “Grooming works on the person that’s in it, but not on those on the outside.”Do some detective work, too. “Independently find two other pieces of information that corroborate what you’ve been told (for example, about where someone is based and what they are doing). Reverse-image-search all the pictures and videos you’re sent, and the prose as well. You can cut and paste the messages. Find the person online. If you can’t, they aren’t real. Everyone has a trace.”Finally, remember that if you are being told to lie to your bank, “or being made to feel that your bank is against you, that is a red flag. The point when you are contacting your bank to transfer money is when you’re in arm’s reach of help, the last port of call before you’re rescued. Tell the bank the truth.”Victims are encouraged to report toAction Fraud(0300 123 2040), the national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime.

Experts shared what parents should know about introducing food allergensMadeleine AggelerTue 11 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 14.28 ESTShareAccording to apaperpublished in the Journal of Pediatrics this month, the number of peanutallergydiagnoses among children has dropped over 40% since 2017.The reason?Foodallergy guidelines have undergone a sea change in the past decade.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, parents were urged not to introduce their children to peanuts – one of the mostcommonfood allergens – until the child was at least three years old.But in 2015, ablockbuster paperin the New England Journal of Medicine known as theLeap(Learning Early About Peanut allergy) study found thatintroducing the food to babieswhen they were just a few months old could reduce a child’s risk of developing the allergy by over 80%. Public health guidelines shifted and in2017the Prevention of Peanut Allergy Guidelines recommended introducing peanut protein to infants.“A common misconception about food allergies is that delaying the introduction of allergenic foods may help prevent them,” says Dr Stanislaw Gabryszewski, an attending physician at the Children’s hospital of Philadelphia and one of the paper’s co-authors. “We now have strong evidence showing the opposite – that introducing peanuts and other common allergens early in infancy can actually reduce the risk of developing an anaphylactic food allergy.”So how do allergies work? And how can parents cautiously introduce their children to food allergens like peanuts? We asked experts.What are food allergies?“When someone has a food allergy, their body makes antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE), directed against the food allergen,” explains Dr Hemant Sharma, the chief of allergy and immunology at Children’s National hospital.Soy, oat, almond, rice: which alternative milk is healthiest?Read morePut another way: the body mistakenly identifies the food as something harmful and produces protective proteins (IgE), which bind to the food allergen and try to flush it out of the body. This results insymptomssuch as hives; itchy skin; swelling of the face, lips or mouth; vomiting; diarrhea; difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath.Food allergies are the result of “a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors”, says Gabryszewski.Allergiescan run in families, but there can also be external influences, he explains.The most common food allergies in children are milk, eggs and peanuts, Gabryszewski. “Most children tend to outgrow their milk and egg allergies, but peanut allergy tends to persist,” he says. In adults, some of the most common food allergies are peanuts, tree nuts and shellfish.How common are peanut allergies?Before the 1990s, peanut allergies were rare. While they are still not hugely common, numbers doubled in the late 1990s and early 2000s. According to one 2009paper, the rate of peanut allergies among children in the UK rose from 0.5% to 1% between 1989 and 1994 to 1996, and US rates increased from 0.4% to 0.8% between 1997 and 2002.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’The increase was enough to prompt what some called a “peanut panic”. As peanuts and tree nuts account for thevast majorityof deaths due to food allergies, many schools and airlines instituted peanut-free zones.Recent studies have found thatabout3% of US adults have a self-reported peanut allergy. And according to the charity groupAnaphylaxis UK, about one in 50 children and one in 200 adults have a nut allergy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Children with eczema and egg allergies are at a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy and the guidelines suggest parents of higher-risk children may want to speak to a specialist first.There are no exact guidelines about the amount and regularity of exposure. “An age-appropriate amount introduced ‘early and often’ is generally recommended,” says Sharma.To prevent choking, experts say babies should be able to control their head and neck, and swallow food rather than let it dribble on to their chin before they try to eatany solid food. Even then, whole peanuts are a choking hazard for babies, and peanut butter can be difficult for them to swallow. Gabryszewski suggests thinning peanut butter in water or breast milk, “working towards about 2 tsp a few times a week”. McNairn also recommends Bamba peanut butter puffs, puffed peanut snacks that dissolve in the mouth.While introducing any allergen to a child, McNairn says guardians should watch closely for signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives or vomiting. Mild symptoms including a rash or hives can usually be treated with an antihistamine, according to theChildren’s hospital of Los Angeles. But if the child is vomiting, coughing or having difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately, either by getting a doctor on the phone or going to an emergency room.Beans, beans, the magical fruit: how healthy are they really?Read moreIf after several exposures to the food, the child has no negative reaction, they can probably tolerate it. It is also important to continue exposing them to the food, McNairn says. If a baby is exposed to a food and seems to tolerate it, but then that food is removed from the diet, “they could become sensitized to it,” she explains.For this reason, McNairn recommends parents prioritize introducing their children to food that they regularly eat and have in the home. “If you’re eating communally at a dinner table, the baby’s going to want to eat what you’re eating,” she says.Gabryszewski notes that early introduction does not necessarily prevent a food allergy. More research is needed on both prevention and treatment of these allergies, he says, but he is still optimistic about his recent study’s findings.“This is a heartening indication that our growing emphasis on early introduction has been accompanied by a reduction in peanut allergy,” he says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingFoodAllergiesChildrenParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 11 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareI’ve accidentally bought too many boxes of dried lasagne sheets. How can I use them up?Jemma,by emailThis is sounding all too familiar to Jordon Ezra King, the man behind theA Curious Cooknewsletter. “It’s funny Jemma asks this,” he says, “because I was in this exact same situation earlier this year after over-catering for a client dinner.” The first thing to say is there’s no immediate rush, he adds: “It sounds obvious, but you can keep the boxes for a long time.” Fortunately for Jemma and her shopping mishap, however, lasagne sheets are also flexible, and their shape doesn’t have to dictate what you do with them.With this in mind, soupy things are good to get on the weekly dinner rotation, be thatpasta e cecior minestrone, the latter being the go-to of choice for Mattie Taiano, chef and co-owner withRavneet GillofGina’sin Chingford, Essex: “Just bash up the lasagne sheets with a rolling pin and chuck in all the bits.” Theo Randall, chef-patron ofCucina Italiana at the InterContinental London Park Lane, meanwhile, would break the pasta lengthways and cook it in boiling salted water: “Add that to a ragu-like sauce with some of the pasta cooking water and a generous knob of butter. Just make sure you cook the pasta and sauce together for at least three minutes, so they combine in texture and flavour.”Ezra King and Randall’s next port of call would be the delicate silk handkerchiefs of Liguria in north-western Italy. “If you were to make the pasta yourself, you’d essentially be making lasagne sheets anyway,” Ezra King says. Traditionally, these pasta squares are layered up with pesto formandilli de sea, for which Randall cooks lasagne in boiling salted water before lifting them into a large frying pan with a ladleful of the cooking water. Add some (ideally homemade) fresh pesto, then cook, tossing, and serve topped with grated parmesan and black pepper.Jemma could also stuff and roll her boiled lasagne sheets into cannelloni, Gill advises, and be as adventurous as she likes with the filling (think squash and chard, or spinach, sausage and ricotta). But it would be wise not to dismiss lasagne itself completely out of hand, Ezra King says: “The bolognese version dominates people’s imagination, but lasagne is much more of a framework.” That line of thinking can “set you free”, he adds, be that by roasting pumpkin to layer between pasta sheets with bechamel (“swap the usual nutmeg for sage”) and maybe fonduta. “If you go farther south in Italy, they put little meatballs in there, or hard-boiled eggs,” Ezra King notes. “There are no rules to lasagne, which is kind of cool.”If time is a concern, meanwhile, there are a few tricks to getting it on the table faster. “A good one is to mix the ragu and bechamel together, so you’re not having to spoon them in individually,” Ezra King says. “After all, once baked, they’re going to blend into each other, anyway.”If all else fails, meanwhile, Gill would be inclined to get a bow on those boxes: “You could always give them away as presents,” she says.

This was one idea I saw around, and I am sorry that I can’t credit the person who came up with it, because it is really clever. The premise is that you make a fish pie inside a jacket potato skin, having scooped out the potato and mixed it with the fish pie filling. It’s perfect for this time of year, when you may want to eat something warm, standing up, outside.Baked potato fish piePrep15 minCook1 hr 30 minServes42 large baking potatoesNeutral oil, for rubbing the potatoesSalt andblack pepper50gunsalted butter1 onion, peeled and finely diced1 celery stalk,finely diced½ fennel bulb, trimmed and finely diced200mlvermouth200gcreme fraiche300gskinless cod fillet, diced200gshelled prawns1 small bunch of chives, choppedSqueeze of lemon juice50gcheddar, gratedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Rub the potatoes with oil, season well on the outside and bake for an hour and 15 minutes, until a knife easily penetrates the flesh. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, then add the onion, celery and fennel. Sweat, without colouring, for about 10 minutes, until soft, then add a pinch of salt and the vermouth, and boil until the vermouth has almost all evaporated.Add the creme fraiche, let it melt into the pan, then, when it is simmering, stir the cod and prawns into the sauce. Cook for a minute, then take off the heat.Cut the cooled potatoes in half lengthways and scoop the flesh into the fish mixture. Stir to combine, then add the chives and a squeeze of lemon, and check the seasoning.Put the halved potato shells on a baking sheet and fill them with the fish mixture. Cover with the grated cheddar, then put under a hot grill until the cheese melts. Serve in a napkin with wooden forks.This recipe is an edited extract from The Sportsman at Home, by Stephen Harris, published by Quadrille at £30.

I contactedVirgin Mediato get our phone and broadband account transferred from her name to mine.Its website said I could make changes to the package at the same time so I asked to be moved to a deal at half the cost.I was told I would have to cancel the existing contract and wait 14 days before signing up to a new deal. This would leave me with no internet connection andunable to work from home. The other option was to transfer the existing package to my name and change it after 30 days. I chose the latter.Thirty days later, I signed in to the app, only to be greeted by my late wife’s name which was upsetting. A webchat referred me back to the bereavement line. I had to explain once again that my wife had died. I was told I couldn’t be transferred to the cheaper package as the system hadn’t yet updated to my name. I was promised a callback in three days. It never came.Three weeks later the webchat again referred me back to the bereavement line to repeat the whole process. Again I was told the system hadn’t updated. It’s now three months since I first contactedVirgin and I’m paying twice as much as I need to. I cannot face callingits bereavement line and having to explain once again that my wife has died.GP,ElyCorporate incompetence or callousness? The two amount to pretty much the same thing when you’ve been strung along for as long and painfully as you have.Quite apart from the anguish of having repeatedly to tell strangers that your wife has died, you have been left paying £69.21 for your old, now unwanted contract, instead of £33.99 a month for the package you had requested.Virgin called you within hours of my contact and blamed new staff for giving you wrong information. It transpires you should have been able to close the old account and start a new deal with potential service interruption of an hour, not 14 days.A spokesperson said: “We apologise for the delay in resolving his query. We’ve now agreed a new package at a lower monthly cost.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

It was breakfast time and I wanted a drink, but the long menu of fruit juices was baffling. Apart from pineapple (abacaxi) and mango (manga), I’d never heard of any of the drinks. What arebacuri,buritiandmuruci? And what aboutmangaba,tucumãanduxi? Even my phone was confused.Uxi, it informed me, is a Zulu word meaning “you are”.But then I started to recognise names that I’d heard on my six-week voyage from the Andes to the mouth of the Amazon. There wascupuaçu. I’d picked one of those cacao-like pods in a Colombian village about 1,900 miles (3,000km) back upriver. And even further away, in Peru, there wasaçaí: a purple berry growing high up on a wild palm. The Amazon, it seems, is vast and varied, but also remarkably similar along its astonishing length.Belém and islands map, BrazilMy six-week Amazon adventure had begun with a conference on sustainable tourism in Peru. It was 2023 and Belém, on the other side of South America, had been declared the location for theCop30conference. Determined to cut down on air miles, I set off downriver, heading towards Belém, using public river boats, all the time seeking out people who were working to preserve this incredible environment. I did night walks with guides who blasted powdered concoctions up my nose to make me “alert” (not that kind of concoction – herbal stuff). I swam across the river (then enjoyed lots of electric eel stories) and repeatedly had the disorienting experience of not knowing which country I was in. Until I reached Manaus, I met only a handful of visitors, but I was always wondering about tourism and its potential role in the Amazonian future.The idea that tourism might help in the battles against the climate crisis and biodiversity loss is one fraught with problems. Flying is the most CO2-intensive way of travelling. Tourism is a luxury. Surely the only way to save the planet is to stop privileged outsiders flying around the globe, especially for self-indulgent rainforest tours?The ranching life for these people is brutally hard and unrewarding. They want a way out, but are trapped in a cycle of deforestationOn the Mamori, a tributary of the great river in central Brazil, surrounded by the smoke from forest fires, I was given a salutary answer to this by a schoolboy. “My father is a rancher,” he told me. “We burn the forest to get grass to feed our cattle. In emergencies we can also sell the cleared land, but not the jungle. That’s worthless. But I don’t want to be a rancher, I want to be a tour guide.”View image in fullscreenAn old port area of Belém.Photograph: Ricardo Lima/Getty ImagesWhen I later met his school teacher, he confirmed that other local teenagers felt the same. “To be honest, this generation don’t want the hard physical work of clearing land; they’d prefer tourism jobs. The problem is we don’t get many visitors and never see any NGOs or nature projects.” The ranching life for these people is brutally hard and unrewarding. They want a way out, but are trapped in a cycle of deforestation.Açaí is making good money for small farmers. They can grow it around their houses mixed in with other treesBack in Belém, having downed my juice, I moved on through the market, looking for food. My local guide was Junior who recommended the local favourite: fried fish and açaí berry sauce. “Açaí is making good money for small farmers,” he told me. “They can grow it around their houses mixed in with other trees.”In the Peruvian village where I had first come across açaí, the people explained that the fruit had only ever been an “emergency” wild food for them, but they were happy to find that it now commanded good prices. Their old way of life, hunting river turtles, had ended because of declining numbers and a government ban. Poaching inside the national park had been the only alternative until açaí saved them.Junior and I went off to explore the various river islands beyond the Belém waterfront, heading for the tiny green atoll of Ilha do Combu. The little wooden ferry took us up a narrow creek lined with abundant vegetation and watchful kingfishers where we met Charles, who runs a small handicraft shop and sells his own açaí. “It goes with anything,” he told me. “We can eat it with fish or make ice-cream.”View image in fullscreenIlha do Cumbu, off Belém.Photograph: Kevin RushbyWe walked through mixed groves of palms, cacao and dozens of other tree varieties. Up above, scarlet macaws clattered around and a family of giant fruit bats complained about the noise. This productive mosaic is a way to provide income and benefit nature. I picked up a beautiful seed the size of an egg. “Rubber,” said Charles, “We do collect it, but not in commercial quantities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hailed as a wonder product, it started an exploitation stampede. Fortunes were made. At Iquitos, 2,700 miles upriver from Belém, merchants imported bottled drinking water from Belfast and sent their laundry to Lisbon.View image in fullscreenHarvesting açaí berries involves having a head for heights.Photograph: Kevin RushbyFor most Amazonian people, however, rubber was a disaster. Forced into ever harsher labour conditions, tribes became dispersed and broken, their languages and cultures mangled. After seeds were smuggled out to Asia in 1876 – via Kew Gardens, where they were germinated – the boom ended, but the aftermath was bitter resentment and suspicion.Açaí has not had the same impact, but is not without controversies. Overblown hyperbole about superfoods has dented its reputation. On Ilha do Combu, however, Charles wasn’t worried. Local demand was strong and prices good.Next day, I took the ferry out to Ilha Cotijuba near the mouth of the river. The Amazon had one last novelty to impress me with. On the far side of the island I found a small cafe on a beach. The owner, Lena, served a delicious lunch: river fish baked in banana leaves, a pineapple ceviche and a dessert with some pale green berries that I’ve never seen before.“Like açaí,” she told me. “But different.”Hidden away on those islands, the Amazon still holds secrets.The trip was provided by sustainable tourism specialistSumak Travel, which offers tailor-made trips to Brazil and the rest of Latin AmericaExplore more on these topicsAmazon holidaysBrazil holidaysFood and drinkSouth America holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Central heating turns living rooms into deserts, leaving once lush calatheas with brown, crispy edges. Misting can increase humidity, but the effects are short-lived.The hackAn electric humidifier delivers a steady mist to boost humidity around your plants. You simply fill the tank with water and let it run for a few hours a day, so humidity levels feel more like the tropics than Trafford.Houseplant clinic: what’s wrong with the leaves on my rubber plant?Read moreHow it worksUnlike pebble trays or misting, humidifiers provide consistent, measurable results. Plants lose less water through their leaves, meaning less stress and more energy for growth. In theory, it should prevent the dreaded crispy-edge syndrome entirely.The testI tried a tabletop unit next to my prayer plants. After two weeks, the difference was visible: no new brown tips, glossier leaves and fresh growth. Downsides? Refilling the tank, cleaning to avoid mould, the low hum, and electricity use. Cheaper models can break quickly, and larger ones can be pricey.The verdictIf you’re serious about tropical plants, a humidifier is a solid investment. It isn’t essential for hardy species such as sansevierias or ZZ plants, but for drama queens such as calatheas, it can be the difference between barely surviving and thriving.Explore more on these topicsHouseplantsHouseplant hacksGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According to Yehia Tandina, the mayor of Timbuktu region, she was abducted in a market on Friday by unknown gunmen.At dusk the next day, “the same men brought her back to Independence Square in Tonka and executed her in front of a crowd”, Tandina told the Associated Press. The mayor said Cissé, who is believed to have been in her 20s, received death threats before her death.No one has claimed responsibility for the killing butJama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), a group linked to al-Qaida, is known to patrol Tonka, which is about 90 miles from Timbuktu.“This young woman simply wanted to promote her community through her TikTok posts and encourage the Malian army in its missions to protect people and their property,” said a report on state TV.How al-Qaida-linked jihadist group JNIM is bringing Mali to its kneesRead moreThe conflict in Mali began in 2012 when an uprising by Tuareg rebels was hijacked by jihadist groups linked to al-Qaida and later Islamic State. Despite French-led interventions and a UN peace mission, violence spread southward as insurgents exploited local grievances, corruption and weak governance.The military took control of the country in back-to-back coups in 2020 and2021, after which tensions with western allies deepened. The junta expelled French and UN forces, accusing them of interfering over human rights issues, and turned to Russia for support,including from Wagner mercenaries.The army has failed to end the insurgency, despite its promises to improve security, and tensions have developed within its ranks.“The power grab only deepened its divisions, splitting the army between privileged loyalists of the regime and those sent to the frontlines,” said Rama Yade, senior director of the Africa Centre at the Atlantic Council thinktank. “Coupled with the departure of international forces from Mali, this fragmentation led to abandoned positions, weapons falling into the hands of separatists, and jihadists expanding their hold over the rural north.”Sahel-based jihadists are extending their reach. Can a fractured region push back?Read moreThe jihadists have tightened control over key supply routes from neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire, Mauritania and Senegal. Fighters from JNIM have imposed a fuel blockade since September, crippling transport and leaving hospitals struggling, and the government has been forced to shut down schools indefinitely. In Bamako, the capital, and other cities, queues stretch for miles for increasingly costly fuel and food.France, the US, Germany and Italy have issued warnings to their citizens to leave Mali urgently on commercial flights, saying the roads around the capital were unsafe.Although the junta is holding on for now, analysts and observers say the fall of the regime is likely within weeks or months.In a statement on Sunday, the African Union “expressed deep concern over the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Mali”, calling for urgent international coordination and intelligence-sharing to help the junta restore stability.The worsening insecurity has led to a spike in kidnappings: five Indian workers were abducted last Thursday near Kobri in western Mali. On Sunday, JNIM claimed responsibility for the abduction of three Egyptian nationals and demanded $5m to release them.This article was amended on 11 November 2025. An earlier version incorrectly described Mariam Cissé’s death as an actual execution, which is the carrying out of a legally authorised death sentence.Explore more on these topicsMaliSahelAfricaAl-QaidanewsShareReuse this content"

The Congo basin rainforest, to the east, is the largest rainforest after the Amazon.Rebholz hoped to extend the protected area across the region. “I was very hopeful that we could do a good job,” he told theBureau of Investigative Journalismand the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa.The Mangrove Marine park is home to manatees and endangered sea turtles, and is where the River Congo finishes its 3,000-mile journey from the highlands of Zambia to the Atlantic Ocean. It was designated protected in 1992 and subsequently recognised under theRamsar conventionof conservation. It is subject to strict regulations, although those restrictions can be lifted for certain people in certain circumstances, “provided that these remain compatible with conservation objectives”. The inland area allows for some fishing but nothing that would “disturb the natural environment”.Waiting for the all-clear: how medics and villagers rallied when Ebola returned to DRCRead moreSo Rebholz was shocked when, patrolling the park a few months into the job, he came across what appeared to be an industrial-sized palm oil plantation, and an expanse of tens of thousands of palm trees. Rebholz says he asked his deputies: “What exactly is this?” and they told him that it belonged to the company of the former president Joseph Kabila, who had spent almost two decades in power before stepping down in 2019 after a series of deadly protests.The plantation that Rebholz had stumbled across is large enough to be seen from space. Clearly within the boundaries of the park, in what should be a wilderness, are neat rows of the tell-tale star shapes of palm trees covering more than 400 hectares (988 acres). As of summer 2025, it was still thriving. A mapped document dated 2023 states that it was created by the department of forestry management, marking out the plantation: “Land appropriated by a private plantation of palm trees belonging to the former head of state within the Marine Mangroves park, which considerably reduces the park’s surface area,” and local people confirmed the land grabbing: “It still belongs to Kabila … His base is here”. Rebholz says that as well as violating the park’s protected status, the plantation robs large mammals of a vital habitat and that buffaloes have almost disappeared from the area.View image in fullscreenMangroves trap and store carbon dioxide, making them a crucial buffer against the climate crisis.Photograph: Estela Costas/TBIJ/PPLAAFRebholz had also spotted on satellite images an illegal logging port owned by Congo Dihao, a Chinese group closely linked to a logging company called Maniema Union, as identified by a recent study commissioned by international and Congolese conservation agencies, which has been linked to one ofKabila’s most brutal enforcers, General Amisi. Farther west he found another illegal port, this one for oil. An oil industry executive told him the traffic accounted for nearly a third of fuel sold in Kinshasa.But after Rebholz demanded that a commission of inquiry be set up, he says “the reprisals came thick and fast”. On 2 February 2023, he says seven hooded men armed with machetes and guns broke into his house in the middle of the night. They dragged out Rebholz, his wife and his young son. Then they put the gun to Rebholz’s head and faked his execution. “All this happened in front of our little boy,” he says.Two of the men led his wife away to the couple’s bedroom. They raped her while her husband and son were under gun point in the other room and threatened to kill her if she resisted. Looking back, Rebholz says: “I didn’t know she had been raped until they left because she was sure that if she had yelled and cried, I would have got mad and got shot, cut into pieces.”At some point the men left. The bandits said they had come for Rebholz – a “white bastard” – and knew about his role at the Mangrove Marine park. Sitting in a hotel in Paris several months later, he shakes his head. “So they were there for me, but the worst happened to my wife.” He says his wife is “as well as she can be” and his son’s nightmares have started to ease.This was not the first time violence had followed a finger being pointed at power; in 2021, after a Congolese NGO published a report alleging that a farm owned by Kabila encroached on a national park in eastern DRC, the NGO received a summons to the magistrates court for defamation. The night the case was dismissed, “a commando unit of about 15 people climbed over the fence and broke into my house”, Timothée Mbuya, president of the NGO, told the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers inAfrica, a Paris-based anti-corruption group. “They threatened my family with kalashnikovs and assaulted some of them. They pointed a gun at my wife and children and searched the entire house, saying that when I was found, my body would be taken to the morgue.” No investigation into the attack took place.It remains unclear who carried out the attack on Rebholz’s family. He filed a complaint, but no investigation ever took place, and he left the country with his family. But first he wrote to DRC’s environment minister – copying in president Felix Tshisekedi – to lay out the environmental destruction he had discovered in the park and the people he believed responsible for it.They included Cosma Wilungula, who as former director general of the Congolese Institute for NatureConservation(ICCN), was ultimately responsible for the Mangroves park; Augustin Ngumbi, DRC’s representative to the high-profile international wildlife protection agency CITES; and the former president of the DRC, Joseph Kabila.Ngumbi said he was not informed of Rebholz’s allegations about the environmental issues within the park at the time and that they were “pure fabrication”. Wilungula said the allegations were “false, misleading and politically motivated” and that he had left the ICCN before Rebholz started as director of the park. He said Kabila’s company never posed a threat to the park and that the former president had helped combat poaching there.Former DRC president Joseph Kabila sentenced to death in absentiaRead moreKabila, Amisi, the ICCN, and representatives for the DRC government, did not respond to requests for comment. Congo Dihao said it owns a legal port for which it has all the necessary authorisations. It said Maniema Union is not affiliated with its company.View image in fullscreenKabila last month was tried in absentia by the DRC government on charges of treason, crimes against humanity and corruption, and found guilty.Photograph: Jospin Mwisha/AFP/Getty ImagesRebholz looks back on his time at Mangrove Marine park with resolve. “Of course, I regret what happened to my family,” he says. “But I don’t regret the experience. I hope this will have served some purpose.”The US government subsequently said Ngumbi and Wilungula would be ineligible for entry to the US “due to their involvement in significant corruption” related to wildlife trafficking. Both denied the allegations and said no evidence had been provided to back them up.Kabila, meanwhile, was last month tried in absentia by the DRC government on charges of treason, crimes against humanity and corruption, and found guilty. Human Rights Watch has criticised the trial as “a political vendetta”.Rebholz appears grimly vindicated. “I hope that by denouncing what happened, I can raise awareness of the issues at stake at both a local and international level, so a more responsible vision [for the park] can emerge.“I hope it can contribute to a brighter future.”To read the full story at the Bureau of Investigative Journalismclick hereExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentDemocratic Republic of the CongoWetlandsAfricaDeforestationConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

A part of our identity was lost with it. People are hurting,” Gordon told reporters.Scientists say that breaching 1.5C would lead to several irreversible changes, like melting ice caps driving faster sea level rises of the kind that supercharged the winds driving Hurricane Melissa.

That campaign has includedairstrikes on boatsthat have so far killed at least 76 people in South American waters since September.Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in astatementreleased by the US navy that the arrival of the USS Gerald R Ford, with “more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of tactical aircraft aboard”, will “bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities” in the region.“These forces will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations,” he added.Many analysts see the attacks on boats and the growing military buildup as a way topressure Maduroto step down afterstealing last year’s election.Maduro has accused the US of “fabricating a new war” and said the naval deployment represents “the greatest threat our continent has faced in the past 100 years”.On Tuesday, before the US navy confirmed the carrier’s arrival, the Venezuelan regime announced a new phase of its military deployment against what it called the US “imperial threats”, with state television broadcasting footage of military leaders giving speeches across several states.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials said nobody on the ground was injured.Wurm was the founder of Ignite the Fire, a Cayman Islands-based Christian ministry that supports the empowerment of youth in the Caribbean. He had made multiple trips to Jamaica in recent days to deliver humanitarian relief in the aftermath ofHurricane Melissa, the devastating category 5 storm that made landfall on 28 October.Accordingto a postto his personal Facebook page on 2 November, Wurm, an experienced aviator, had only recently purchased the plane. “It can carry a lot and it is a very reliable aircraft. Perfect for the mission to bring relief goods into Montego Bay and the plane is ready just in time,” he wrote.Two dead after small plane on hurricane relief trip to Jamaica crashes in FloridaRead more“We are in absolute shock and disbelief,” said Sean Malone, the director of Crisis Relief International (CRI), an aid agency with which Wurm had been working, in avideo statement on Facebook.“When this hurricane happened, he didn’t hesitate – he sprung into action and did what he could with what he had in his hand. He saved lives and he gave his life for the people of the nations that were on his heart.”Undated video accompanying the statement showed the plane on the ground in Montego Bay, with workers unloading boxes.Ferrin Cole, CRI’s team leader inJamaica, said partnering with Wurm and his daughter had been “an honor”.“He kept showing up over and over, repeatedly flying in supplies that we couldn’t get anywhere else,” Cole said. “Here in Jamaica, he just kept landing and we would unload his plane – he would give us these huge hugs and pray for us.“He just delivered a bunch of medical supplies, water filters, screws for roofs, so many things that this community has needed. He wanted us to know Jesus, that was his reason for helping people.”A statementon Ignite the Fire’s Facebook page called Serena Wurm “a beacon of empathy and hope, inspiring all with her commitment to humanitarian work” – and said she was following in her father’s footsteps.“Alex leaves behind his beautiful wife, Candace, and two children, son James, 17, and daughter Christiana, 20,” the statement added.Recovery operations at the scene of the crash were continuing on Tuesday after crews worked overnight to try to locate and retrieve wreckage of the plane, a 1976 King Air that can seat up to 12 people.According to FlightAware, a flight-tracking website, the plane traveled regularly over the last week between George Town, Cayman Islands, where the Wurms lived, and Montego Bay and Negril airports in Jamaica. It landed in Fort Lauderdale on Friday.The bodies of the victims, believed to be the only persons onboard, have not yet been recovered, officials said. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board will look into the cause of the crash.Explore more on these topicsFloridaPlane crashesHurricane MelissaJamaicaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.A huge outbreak has made Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphereRead moreMeasles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it’s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the WorldHealthOrganization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.“It’s a deeply disheartening development. It’s a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it’s an embarrassing development,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. “No country with the amount of resources of Canada – or other countries in North America even – should lose their measles elimination status.”Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, theAmericasbecame the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada’s loss.Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada’s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.“As a region, we have eliminated measles twice,” Barbosa said. “We can do it a third time.”In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.Explore more on these topicsCanadaHealthAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the groups hadsuccessfully targeted the United States.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“Salt Typhoon’s intent was espionage – they penetrated the United States’ telecommunications system to gain access to the nation’s communications through a strategic spying operation,” Burgess said.“We have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well.”Why did China hack the world’s phone networks?Read moreBurgess said Volt Typhoon’s intent was to compromise American critical infrastructure networks to “pre-position for potential sabotage”.“The penetrations gaveChinathe ability to turn off telecommuncations and other critical infrastructure,” Burgess said. “And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well.”Burgess did not say which Chinese units had allegedly targeted Australian infrastructure and whether they had gained access.“Once access is gained – the network is penetrated – what happens next is a matter of intent not capability,” Burgess said.“I don’t think we – and I mean all of us – truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating this could be.”Burgess said targeted infrastructure assets among western allies also included transport, water and energy networks.The Chinese embassy was contacted for a response.The Chinese infiltration of US telecommunications systems late last year by Salt Typhoon was described asthe worst hack in American history.The hack infiltrated dozens of US telecoms companies and implicated the data of senior political figures – including the president-elect, Donald Trump; the incoming vice-president, JD Vance; and Kamala Harris, the defeated Democratic presidential candidate.Earlierthis year, Burgess said the “espionage-enabled sabotage of critical infrastructure” could cost the Australian economy more than $1bn. He estimated the cost could rise to $6bn if the disruption lasted for one week.Burgess also outlined previously unreported instances of alleged espionage targeting Australian corporations.The director general accused unnamed “nation state hackers” of stealing commercially sensitive information from a major Australian exporter, providing a significant advantage in subsequent contract negotiations.“In another case, they stole the blueprints of an Australian innovation and mass-produced cheap knock-offs that nearly bankrupted the innovator,” Burgess said.“A visiting academic with links to a foreign government broke into a restricted technology laboratory and filmed its contents.”Burgess also told the forum, organised by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, that his agency was “tracking a troubling increase in anarchist and revolutionary extremism, often targeting industry”.“Since October ’23, anti-Israel activists have increasingly used disruptive tactics such as arson, vandalism and violent protests targeting companies accused of providing weapons components,” Burgess said.“Rapid advances in technology are incubating and accelerating these security concerns.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsAustralian intelligence agenciesAustralian security and counter-terrorismChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Users who had already downloaded the apps appeared to still be able to use them.Both apps were still available for download from their official websites. The apps have not released public statements about the removals.In a statement toWired, Apple said: “We follow the laws in the countries where we operate. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only.”In accordance with the country’s laws, Apple operates a separate app store in China. Several popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram and other western social media platforms are unavailable to Chinese users. International dating apps such as Grindr and Tinder are also blocked.Founded in 2012 in China, Blued is the country’s most popular dating app for gay men. It has more than 40 million registered users worldwide. In recent years, it has diversified into other services such as livestreaming, but it is still primarily considered an app for gay men.In 2020, Blued’s parent company acquired Finka.Homosexuality is legal in China. But after decades of opening and liberalisation, open displays of LGBT identity have beenpushed further underground. LGBT civil society organisationshave been forced to closeand Shanghai Pride, the country’s biggest pride event, was suspended in 2020. In September, a horror film wasdigitally alteredto turn a gay couple into a straight couple for its release in China.A founder of an LGBT community organisation, who asked to remain anonymous over fears about his safety, said he was “extremely shocked” to see Blued and Finka removed from the app stores.“The living space for sexual minorities has been shrinking over the past few years … but hearing this news now, it caught me off guard that online spaces are also shrinking,” he said.“Don’t apps like Blued contribute to social stability and harmony? Why remove them from app stores? I find it difficult to understand their underlying thinking,” he added.It is not clear why the apps were removed or whether it is to be a permanent move. But internet users immediately expressed their concern.One WeChat user wrote that Blued “made countless people realise for the first time that they weren’t alone; it brought a group from the margins to being seen”.The Cyberspace Administration of China could not be reached for comment.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificAppleLGBTQ+ rightsAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

He also played Hanbei opposite Mifune’s Sanjuro in Kurosawa’s 1961 samurai film Yojimbo, regarded as one of the director’s greatest works.A year later, Kurosawa reunited his leading men in Sanjuro, the sequel to Yojimbo. The film famously ends with a sword fight in which Sanjuro slices through Hanbei’s torso with lightning speed, unleashing acascade of blood– a display of graphic violence that shocked audiences at the time. Kurosawa later denied claims that the geyser of blood had been caused by a malfunctioning prop. Whether it happened by accident or design, the scene had an enduring influence on action films and video games.View image in fullscreenNakadai performs during a rehearsal in Tokyo in May 2025.Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/Getty ImagesBorn into a working-class family in Chiba, east of Tokyo, in 1932, Nakadai decided to take up acting as an alternative to a prohibitively expensive university education, enrolling in acting school in the early 1950s.One of his first major film roles – reportedly the result of a chance meeting with Kobayashi when Nakadai was working as a shop assistant in Tokyo – was an uncredited part as a prisoner in Kobayashi’s 1953 war drama The Thick-Walled Room – the start of a partnership that would last three decades.In later life Nakadai, whose stage credits included Death of a Salesman, Don Quixote, Hamlet and Macbeth, helped nurture young actors with his wife and fellow actor, Yasuko Miyazaki, with whom he opened the Mumeijuku school in Tokyo in 1975.In 2015, Nakadai was awarded the Order of Culture –Japan’s highest honour for contributions to the arts and science – by the emperor. The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Nakadai had performed on stage as recently as this year.Explore more on these topicsFilmJapanAkira KurosawaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

That analysis was open to public submissions, which closed on 10 November. It is up to individual states and territories to implement their own road rules.Labor senator Helen Polley said any move to reduce the speed limit would be “a complete overreach”.“I think that it is unnecessary to change [the default limits], what we need is continued driving education and we need to continue to maintain the condition of our roads,” she said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailSeveral Nationals members have lambasted the proposed changes. The shadow infrastructure minister, Bridget McKenzie, said the government should make a clear statement that “it will not be forcing cuts to speed limits on communities”.“Regional communities are completely opposed to a Labor government in Canberra which has cut and cancelled funding to regional road projects telling them speed limits must be slashed to as low as 70km/h,” she said.The deputy Nationals leader, Kevin Hogan, said in parliament last week the move would have “serious consequences for productivity and freight costs across regional communities”.The analysis is part of the National Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030, agreed to by state, territory and commonwealth governments in May 2021.The plan aims to reduce road fatalities by 50% and reduce serious injuries by 30% by 2030, and cut fatalities and serious injuries to zero by 2050. The latest analysis states the country is not on track to meet those goals and needs further government intervention.The proposal to reduce default speed limits on regional roads was canvassed earlier, in the 2018-2020 action plan, released in May 2018, while Barnaby Joyce was deputy prime minister.Regional Victorian Labor MP Rob Mitchell said it was “hypocritical” the Nationals were railing against the changes, first proposed under the Coalition government, though he agreed a change to the speed limit was not necessary for sealed roads.“I don’t think it’s a smart decision to do it on every non-[sign]posted road but I think it’s a consideration for unsealed roads,” he said.Tasmania already has 80km/h default limits for unsealed roads.Western Australian Labor senator Glenn Sterle called on the government to abandon the proposal and labelled it as “rubbish” when speaking to ABC radio Pilbara on 7 November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have to clear the decks,” he said. “You’ve asked me my opinion and this is rubbish. This is ridiculous.”Australia’s road fatalities increased 10% between 2020 and 2024 from 4.28 fatalities per 100,000 people to 4.72. The report states a reduction in the urban default speed limit from 60km/h to 50km/h in the 1990s and 2000s has been estimated to have reduced fatalities by 50% in Victoria, by 37% in Western Australia and 26% in South Australia.However, the analysis states the share of fatal and serious injury (FSI) crashes that occur on default limit roads are unknown. It models several scenarios: if 10% of FSI crashes occur on default speed limit roads and the limit was reduced to 90km/h, 95 lives would be saved and 1,444 serious injuries avoided over a 10-year period. If that limit was reduced to 70km/h, 286 lives would be saved and 4,644 serious injuries would be avoided over 10 years.The infrastructure and transport minister, Catherine King, said the consultation “does not constitute government policy”.“This was a National party idea, which the National party are now campaigning against from opposition,” she said.“Any such changes to the speed limits would need to be implemented by states and territories who set them.”Explore more on these topicsTransportAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The archetypal undecided voters Victorian Labor is desperate to win overRead more“There’s a real sense of a want of belonging by a lot of these children, which motivates their involvement,” she said.“But they don’t have the capacity … for this consequential thinking, because obviously and legitimately, their brains are just simply underdeveloped.”The state’s opposition leader, Brad Battin, said the premier had no credibility and that Victorians can’t trust her to deliver what she promises.“Today’s announcement is the premier chasing another headline with no plan to follow through and deliver,” Battin said.Victoria has been in the grip of surging crime rates, with criminal offences spiking by 15.7% in the year to mid-2025, fuelled by thefts, home invasions and repeat youth offenders.About 1,100 youths aged between 10 and 17 were arrested a combined 7,000 times, according to the latest crime statistics, as Victoria police declared children were quickly turning to extreme violence.Queensland implemented its tougher “adult crime, adult time” laws in response to a 17-year-old teenager fatally stabbing Emma Lovell in a home invasion in 2022.That legislation allows for youth offenders to face a mandatory life sentence for serious offences such as murder, with a minimum of 20 years before parole.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Punishing trauma is not the answer.”The Victorian announcement follows the state government backing down on plans to ban face coverings at protests.Allan previously signalled ablanket ban on face masksand balaclavas at protests but on Tuesday said police would be able to order the removal of masks if they suspected a protester was committing or about to commit a criminal offence.Explore more on these topicsVictoriaYouth justiceVictorian politicsCrime - AustraliaHuman rightsIndigenous AustraliansJacinta AllannewsShareReuse this content"

Its claims have been vehemently denied by Serbian war veterans.“Sarajevo Safari was the starting point,” said Gavazzeni. “I began a correspondence with the director and from there expanded my investigation until I collected enough material to present to the Milan prosecutors.”Gavazzeni claimed “many, many, many Italians” were alleged to have been involved, without providing a figure. “There were Germans, French, English … people from all western countries who paid large sums of money to be taken there to shoot civilians.”Gavazzeni added: “There were no political or religious motivations. They were rich people who went there for fun and personal satisfaction. We are talking about people who love guns who perhaps go to shooting ranges or on safari in Africa.”He claimed the Italian suspects would meet in the northern city of Trieste and travel to Belgrade, from where the Bosnian Serb soldiers would accompany them to the hills of Sarajevo. “There was a traffic of war tourists who went to there to shoot people,” he said. “I call it an indifference towards evil.”Gavazenni said he had identified some of the Italian individuals alleged to have been involved and who are expected to be questioned by the prosecutors in the coming weeks.Probably the most high-profile deaths by sniper fire were Bošco Brkić and Admira Ismić, a couple documented in the film Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo, who were killed by a sniper in 1993 while trying to cross a bridge. Their bodies remained in no-man’s land between the Bosnian and Bosnian Serb positions for several days. Photographs were published widely and became symbolic of the randomness and inhumanity of the war.The main street running into Sarajevo, Meša Selimović Boulevard, was nicknamed “Sniper Alley” because it became extremely dangerous but could not be avoided as it was the way to Sarajevo airport. Trams and buses had their windows shot out and all around there were sniper warning signs.Nicola Brigida, a lawyer who helped Gavazzeni prepare his case, said: “The evidence accumulated after a long investigation [by Gavazzeni] is well substantiated and could lead to serious investigation to identify the culprits. There is also the report from the former Sarajevo mayor.”Explore more on these topicsBosnia and HerzegovinaItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

OpenAI can appeal against the decision.ChatGPT accused of acting as ‘suicide coach’ in series of US lawsuitsRead moreChatGPT allows users to ask questions and type commands into a chatbot, which responds with text that resembles human language patterns. The model underlying ChatGPT is trained on widely available data.The case revolved around nine of the most recognisable German hits of recent decades, which were used by ChatGPT to hone its language capabilities.They included Herbert Grönemeyer’s 1984 synth-pop sendup of masculinity,Männer(Men), and Helene Fischer’sAtemlosDurch die Nacht(Breathless Through the Night), which was the unofficial anthem of the German side during the 2014 football World Cup.The presiding judge ordered OpenAI to pay undisclosed damages for using copyrighted material without permission.The GEMA legal adviser Kai Welp said the organisation now hoped to negotiate with OpenAI on how rights holders could be compensated.The San Francisco-based company, whose founders includeSam Altmanand Elon Musk, had said its language learning models absorbed entire training sets of data rather than storing or copying specific songs, the Munich court said.Because its output is generated by users of the chatbot via their prompts, OpenAI said, they were the ones who should be held legally liable for it – an argument rejected by the court.GEMA welcomed the decision as “the first landmark AI ruling in Europe”, saying it could have implications for other types of creative output.Its chief executive, Tobias Holzmüller, said the decision proved “the internet is not a self-service store and human creative achievements are not free templates”.“Today, we have set a precedent that protects and clarifies the rights of authors: even operators of AI tools such as ChatGPT must comply with copyright law. Today, we have successfully defended the livelihoods of music creators.”The Berlin law firm Raue, which represented GEMA, said in a statement that the court’s decision “sets an important precedent for the protection of creative works and sends a clear signal to the global tech industry” while creating “legal certainty for creators, music publishers and platforms across Europe”.OpenAI signs $38bn cloud computing deal with AmazonRead moreThe ruling “is likely to have an impact far beyond Germany as a precedent”, it said.The German Journalists’ Association also hailed the ruling as “a milestone victory for copyright law”.OpenAI said in a statement it would weigh an appeal. “We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” it said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people, businesses and developers in Germany that use our technology every day.”It added: “We respect the rights of creators and content owners and are having productive conversations with many organisations around the world, so that they can also benefit from the opportunities of this technology.”OpenAI hasfaced litigation in the US from authorsand media groups claiming ChatGPT has been trained on their work without permission.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTOpenAISam AltmanElon MuskGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Time and time again, people spoke of how it served to silence, to other, to label, to exclude and to stifle critical thinking.”On a day of pomp and celebration at Dublin Castle, formerly the seat of British rule, the 68-year-old former barrister said that as Ireland’s 10th president she would ensure “all voices” were heard and would promote climate action, tolerance and a Gaelic revival.View image in fullscreenCatherine Connolly receives the presidential seal of office from the chief justice, Donal O’Donnell, during her inauguration at Dublin Castle.Photograph: Government Information Service Handout/EPA“The people have spoken and have given their president a powerful mandate to articulate their vision for a new republic, a republic worthy of its name where everyone is valued and diversity is cherished, where sustainable solutions are urgently implemented, and where a home is a fundamental human right.”Connolly’s election shocked the political establishment. The independent leftwing legislatorunited opposition leftwing parties, energised young voters and trounced the ruling Fine Gael party’s candidate, Heather Humphreys, by winning 64% of the vote.The presidency is a largely ceremonial post but the outgoing president, Michael D Higgins, stretched the constraints and turned it into a platform for domestic and international issues, a practice Connolly is expected to continue.In a ballroom packed with government figures, ambassadors and other dignitaries, including former presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, Connolly lamented “the normalisation of war and genocide”.Lauding Ireland’s neutrality – a potential source of friction with the government, which wants to cooperate with EU security initiatives, she said: “Our experience of colonisation and resistance of a catastrophic man-made famine and forced immigration gives us a lived understanding of dispossession, hunger and war and a mandate for Ireland to lead.”Connolly also hailed the Good Friday agreement and referenced article 3 of Ireland’s constitution, which espouses a united Ireland with consent. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) declined to send a representative to the inauguration but said no snub was intended.Switching to Irish, Connolly repeated a commitment toprioritise the language in Áras an Uachtaráin, the presidential office and residence. “Irish will not be spoken in a low voice in the Áras, it will have first place as a working language.”No country can express its desires or values if the native language spoken by ancestors was extinguished, she said. “It has been put in second place without sufficient respect or recognition. The hearts of our people were quenched when they were made to stop using their own language. It’s a language that expresses feelings and sentiment with every word.”A 21-gun salute was fired as the new president received the seal of office.Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Its purpose is to stop the Republican People’s party (CHP), which came first in the last local elections, and to block its presidential candidate,” Özgür Özel said on X.The arrest of İmamoğlu, themain political rivalof Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was met with outrage from the CHP and prompted demonstrations across Turkey. It was the country’s worst street unrest since 2013.İmamoğlu faces allegations that include espionage and faking his university degree, which could lead to him being banned from running for president.According to the indictment, which names 402 suspects, İmamoğlu allegedly headed a crime network over which he exerted his influence “like an octopus”.In an address to parliament on Tuesday, Özel said İmamoğlu would be the party’s candidate in the next presidential vote.“Can someone be both an electoral fraudster, hold a forged decree and be a thief, a terrorist and a spy all at the same time?” he said before the indictment was released.“If you accused an innocent person of just one of these crimes, it would be a great injustice. But when you put all of them on one person, it’s a major crime … But his only crime is running for the presidency of this country,” he said.Also in the indictment, prosecutors said they had filed papers with Turkey’s top appeals court against the CHP, which observers said could pave the way for the party’s closure.In a separate statement, the Istanbul prosecutor’s office confirmed it had informed the court about certain irregularities but denied reports it was seeking to have the party shut down.The CHP has been under increasing pressure since it won control of Turkey’s largest cities in local elections in March 2024. Sixteen of its mayors have since been jailed.An Ankara court dismissed a case in October challenging the legitimacy of the outcome of the party’s 2023 leadership primary, saying there was no legal basis for removing the current leadership from office.The move could have unseated Özel, who is facing a number of lawsuits including one for insulting the president.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

These actions have contributed to a public health catastrophe, according to Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation.“Such practices in Gaza, but also in other armed conflicts such as Sudan, constitute violations of international law, and have been documented as patterns of behaviour that constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, that in the case of Gaza in particular, are an important part of a genocidal strategy,” said Arrojo.“Israel has systematically used water to displace and segregate the Palestinian population in their own territories, illegally occupied since 1967, as part of its strategy of apartheid and progressive colonization,” he added.In the occupied West Bank in April, a group of Israeli settlers in the village of Bardalah destroyed irrigation pipelines on Palestinian-owned properties, while on the same day, other settlers damaged a water pipeline in the nearby village of Khirbat.In July,Israel killed at least 10 Palestiniansat a water distribution point in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, six of them children, injuring another 16 amid critical levels of famine and dehydration that forced people to travel long distances in search of food and water. The attack is part of a growing pattern that has left more than 1,000 Palestinians dead while trying to access basic food and water aid.In July, a group of UN experts warned that Israel was using“thirst as a weapon to kill Palestinians”.The Middle East has become a hotspot for water-related violence in recent years, but incidents are surging globally amid climate catastrophe, poor governance and escalating conflicts over access to land and water sources.In 2024, there were a record 420 water-related conflicts globally –a 20% rise on 2023, which was also a record year, and a 78% increase over 2022. Another 160-plus attacks were documented in the first half of 2025. The violence included attacks on dams, pipelines, wells, treatment plants, irrigation systems and workers, as well as public protests and cross-border disputes over access to water, and the use of water as a weapon of war.In Madagascar, security forces armed with teargas, tanks and rubber bullets quelled almostdaily youth-led protests overthe government’s failure to address widespread power outages and water shortages, until a coup usurped the president in October.The rising trend in global water-related conflictsIn September last year, a brother and sister on their way home from fetching water at night were fatally shot in Matswale, among many places in South Africa where water shortages are worsening.Pakistan has seen a spike in water-conflicts this year, including a wave of protests in Karachi over the construction of six new canals on the Indus river, which left scores of protesters and police injured.The new data shows an increase in violence against environmental and community activists defending freshwater resources, especially in Latin America, as well as rising cyber attacks targeting water utilities. Recent surveys of water agencies in the US and UK revealed hundreds of attempted breaches targeting systems that manage operations of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure and equipment.The UNrecognizesaccess to safe, acceptable, affordable drinking water as a fundamental human right, yet more than 2 billion people, about 25% of the world’s population, still lack access. Cutting off or denying people access to safe water violates international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions, constituting a war crime.The Pacific Institute’s tracker is the most comprehensive open-source database of water-related violence in the world, documenting incidents dating back over 4,500 years and contains more than 2,750 entries identified from news reports, eyewitness accounts and other conflict databases.Overall, water-related violence has been rising steadily since over the past two decades but has surged in recent years as growing scarcity exacerbates old conflicts over land, ideology and religion, economics and sovereignty, and new ones erupt, according to theWater Conflict Chronology. Only 24 such incidents were reported globally in the year 2000, compared with more than 160 incidents in the first half of 2025.Israeli assaults in occupiedPalestineand Russia’s war with Ukraine have accounted for a significant chunk of the recent rise in assaults on water, irrigation and sanitation supplies, accounting for 12% and 16% respectively of all global incidents in 2024.Kalush, a city of 65,000 situated in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in western Ukraine, was left without water and power on 25 December 2024, Christmas Day, aftermajor shelling by Russian forces.In August this year,Ukraine National Newsreported that Russia had shut off water to some homes in the occupied Donetsk, allegedly as punishment for refusing to accept Russian rule.Ukrainian forces have also damaged Russian civilian and military water supplies. In July, they reportedly struck a water pipeline supplying Russian military facilities in Vladivostok, in Russia’s far east, cutting off drinking water to garrisons.Water conflicts have spiked in recent years between Israel and Palestine and Russia and Ukraine“The growing number of violent incidents involving freshwater resources underscores the urgent need for international attention,” said Peter Gleick, senior fellow and co-founder of the Pacific Institute. “Ensuring access to safe, affordable water for all and safeguarding civilian water systems in accordance with international law are critical to preventing further expansion of violence.”The Israeli government did not respond to request for comment.Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestineWaterMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They are among a number of separated families to which the government has failed to keep its evacuation promise, according to the law firm Leigh Day, which is representing them.“I wished that I didn’t have to do this, that it didn’t have to reach this level that I’d have to involve courts,” said one father in the UK, who asked to remain anonymous. “I wish anyone would intervene and take my children out of the life that they are living.”The man, who had been granted humanitarian protection in the UK prior to the breakout of the war in 2023, said he was told by the Foreign Office in August that he would be reunited with his family after they received a positive family reunion decision a month earlier.“It was really shocking to see that this didn’t actually end up happening,” said the father, who is from Gaza City, via a translator. The 39-year-old likened the government’s response to that of being released from prison, only to be told he would have to return.“The war is not over,” he added. “There’s still aggression from Israel, there’s no food or water, people are not OK.”In Gaza, the death toll continues to climb past 67,000, according to the health ministry. Israel has beenaccused of violating the ceasefirewhich came into effect in October, andof committing genocide by the United Nations.In August, the government announced that it would evacuate ill and injured children from Gaza, but has been called on byMédecins Sans Frontièrsto scale up its efforts after assistingonly a handful of children. In October the governmentannounced that it would allow Palestinian studentstaking up scholarships at UK universities to bring their families with them from Gaza, on a case-by-case basis.“My children are students as well,” the father said. “Why shouldn’t [they] be brought here?”While the family has a successful family reunion decision, they are subject to biometric checks. With no visa application centre in Gaza, lawyers say the UK government has refused to provide assurances by the Jordanian authorities to allow the family to cross the border to complete biometric checks there.The Foreign Office, which was approached for comment, is understood to have responded to a pre-action letter sent in October indicating that the family could not be assisted at present and that the differential treatment between the family and students and medical evacuees was not unlawful.A government spokesperson said: “It would be inappropriate to comment while legal proceedings are ongoing.”Earlier this year, figures revealedhow Home Office bureaucracy was making it impossible for people stranded in war zones, such as Gaza and Sudan, to reunite with family members in the UK. For months, campaigners and parliamentarians have been calling for the creation of a bespoke scheme, similar to that created after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.In Gaza City, the man’s wife, three children and adopted nephew in al-Zawida, Gaza, are now living in a tent. His wife walks an hour to be able to call him and he worries for his children, who, he said, have been shot at by Israeli forces trying to get aid and have had flour and rice taken from them by gangs.Sarah Crowe, a solicitor for Leigh Day, said the government had turned its back on their commitments to ensure their clients’ safe passage despite promising to assist them over two months ago.“Meanwhile, other groups have been safely evacuated under similar circumstances. Our clients argue that this differential treatment is not only unjustifiable and unfair – it is unlawful,” said Crowe.Another father in the UK, who asked to remain anonymous, has taken separate legal action in an effort to reunite with his six children in Gaza. Earlier this year the government agreed to assist the family after a pre-action letter, however thefamily say the government has gone back on its word.Speaking through a translator, he said family members in Gaza were living in a tent after their house was bombed by Israel, and that they were entirely reliant on charities for food. In Gaza, his daughter developed blood clots in her legs and his son struggles to breathe after inhaling phosphorus gas, he said. In the UK, his two daughters often ask when the others will join them. He said he was tired, drained and would often start crying and shouting uncontrollably.“My children were supposed to be here in May,” said the father, who fled Gaza in 2018 after he was imprisoned and tortured by Hamas. “I was supposed to have already been with them for five or six months now.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineImmigration and asylumMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He has spent five years in prison, where he has been tortured and kept in solitary confinement.View image in fullscreenMartina Navratilova and Sharron Davies: ‘A warning to every athlete who dares to speak out … The world must not stand by while Iran silences its champions.’Composite: Getty/PA/Alamy“Sport is meant to inspire hope, unity, and courage,” the signatories wrote. “The execution of a champion for his political views is a direct assault on these values and a warning to every athlete who dares to speak out.“We call on the United Nations, international sports federations and governments to act immediately to save the life of Mohammad Javad. The world must not stand by while Iran silences its champions.”The letter said Vafaei Sani’s case was not an isolated one and noted Iran’s history ofexecuting athletes for their beliefs, includingHabib Khabiri, captain of the national football team, andFourouzan Abdi, captain of the national women’s volleyball team. In 2020,Navid Afkari, a 27-year-old Iranian wrestling champion,was also executed.Other signatories to the letter include the UK’s Tracy Edwards, who skippered the first all-female crew in the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race, and was the first woman to receive the Yachtsman of the Year Trophy; the former captain of the Australian football team Craig Foster; and Bahram Mavaddat, a footballer who was in the Iranian squad for the 1978 World Cup.View image in fullscreenA protester in Amsterdam in September 2020 with a portrait of the Iranian wrestler Navid Afkari, who was executed earlier that month.Photograph: Evert Elzinga/ANP/AFP/GettyVafaei Sani was arrested in March 2020. The charges against him included “spreading corruption on Earth through arson and destruction of public property”. His sentence has been overturned twice but on 4 October it was upheld on the third occasion. His trial was condemned as “grossly unfair” by human rights activists and organisations, includingAmnesty International.Iranian champion wrestler Navid Afkari executed despite global outcryRead moreThe appeal to halt Vafaei Sani’s execution comes aftera 2023 letterto the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, signed by more than 100 human rights experts and organisations, calling for action to prevent the athlete’s execution.According to Amnesty International, there is an “execution crisis in Iran, which has reached horrific proportions”. In 2023, authorities executed at least 853 people – a 48% increase on 2022. Last year, Amnesty recorded 972 executions, marking the highest number since 2015. More than 800 people have been executed so far in 2025.Political prisoners and dissidents are targets, especially in the aftermath of the2022 Woman, Life, Freedom uprising.

As well as the eight people killed, about 20 were injured.The cause of the explosion had not been confirmed by Tuesday evening, but increasingly strongly worded statements from senior government ministers indicated they did not see it as an accident.View image in fullscreenRelatives and neighbours of a 21-year-old man killed in the explosion attend his funeral procession.Photograph: Ritesh Shukla/Getty ImagesThe home minister, Amit Shah, said he had instructed senior officials to “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”. “Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,” he said.The prime minister, Narendra Modi, said: “The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice.”The Delhi police spokesperson, Sanjay Tyagi, said investigators were “probing all possible angles, including a terror attack, an accidental blast or any kind of failure in the car”. Officials were waiting on an explosives report from the forensics team, he said.Delhi police confirmed they had filed a case under India’s draconian anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The home ministry confirmed that the case had been handed over to the National Investigation Agency, India’s counter-terror force.Witnesses to the Red Fort blast said they saw limbs ripped from bodies and scattered on the roads. “I saw the car explode while it was moving,” Dharmindra Dhaga, 27, told Agence France-Presse. “People were on fire and we tried to save them … Cars and people were burning – people inside the cars were burning.”Map‘People were screaming for help’: Delhi car blast witnesses describe scenes of horrorRead moreJai, 49, a shopkeeper, said the blast was so loud it damaged his hearing. “I heard a noise so loud my ears got blocked. Then I saw car parts flying and scattered body parts,” he said.According to reports, investigators have turned their focus to the final movements of the vehicle in which the explosion is believed to have originated. On Monday night, two people were detained who were linked to the Hyundai car, which was registered in the neighbouring state of Haryana.CCTV footage is reported to show the car driving into a car park in the Old Delhi area close to the Red Fort at about 3pm and remaining there for about three hours while the driver – who appeared to be wearing a mask – stayed in the vehicle. The driver was reported to have driven the car into Delhi from Haryana on Monday morning.India remains on high alert, with extra security measures imposed at airports and along border areas. The financial capital, Mumbai, was also put under high alert.The defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said findings of the inquiry would soon be made public. “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice and will not be spared under any circumstances,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIndiaDelhiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The area is usually heavily crowded with lawyers and litigants attending trials.The interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, said 12 people had been killed in the attack and 27 were wounded. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to “enter the court premises but, failing to do so, targeted a police vehicle”.The attack was claimed by the PakistanTaliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. “Judges, lawyers and officials who carried out rulings under Pakistan’s un-Islamic laws were targeted,” the TTP said in a statement, threatening more attacks until Islamic sharia law was implemented in the Muslim-majority country.A map of Islamabad showing the site of the attackPakistan is facing a deadly and destabilising rise in attacks by TTP militants that has thrown the country into its worst security crisis in more than a decade.TTP militants have carried out more than 600 attacks in Pakistan this year alone – mostly in the region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which bordersAfghanistan– leaving hundreds dead. However, Tuesday’s suicide attack was the most significant to target Islamabad for years.Pakistan’s government has accused the Afghan Taliban of giving a safe haven and armed support to TTP fighters, a claim that Kabul denies.Last month, the accusations led todeadly clashes erupting along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, which left dozens dead. The two countries remain in fragile ceasefire talks that so far have failed to reach any agreements over the handling of cross-border terrorism.0:30Footage shows moments after deadly terror attack in Pakistan – videoVideos of the incident on Tuesday showed a blackened car that had been targeted by the bomber. Witnesses described hearing a loud bang and seeing bodies lying on the floor near the court complex.“It was complete chaos, lawyers and people were running inside the complex. I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire,” Rustam Malik, a lawyer, told Agence France-Presse.Pakistan is also facing alethal surge in the decades-long separatistinsurgency in Balochistan, the region bordering Iran and Afghanistan. Baloch militants, who are fighting for a separate state, have carried out dozens of increasingly sophisticated attacks in recent years, including the high-profile hijacking of a passenger train earlier this year.The defence minister, Khawaja Asif, called Tuesday’s suicide attack a “wake-up call” to the terror threats the country was facing on multiple border fronts that were now playing out in the capital.‘An environment of terror’: deadly resurgence of Pakistan Taliban gathers paceRead more“We are in a state of war. Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan, today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts is a wake-up call,” he said.Asif said TTP’s attack raised doubts about whether the peace talks with the Afghan Taliban would yield any results. “In this environment, it would be futile to hold out greater hope for successful negotiations with the rulers of Kabul,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPakistanTalibanSouth and central AsiaAfghanistannewsShareReuse this content"

But at a rare protest anger and frustration were rifeHannah Ellis-Petersenin DelhiMon 10 Nov 2025 22.42 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 23.15 ESTShareAs afamiliar smoky evening hazegathered over Delhi, the crowd began to assemble in their hundreds. Mothers and children, students, retirees and environmentalists were all united by a basic but desperate demand: the right to breathe safely in India’s capital.“Delhi is not a liveable city any more, it’s a death trap,” said Radhika Aggarwal, 33, an engineer who joined the protest on Sunday.“As I stand here, I’m breathing air that I know is killing me. But we see nothing but a failure by the government to do anything to stop this and clean up the pollution. No policies, no real action. So I’m here to fight for my city.”For the past decade, Delhi has held the inglorious title of being theworld’s most polluted city. Pollution season has become as normalised as the monsoon, as it rolls over the city in a suffocating smog that begins in October and can last for more than four months.In the past weeks, Air quality index (AQI) measurements have regularly soared to more than a hundred times higher than is deemed safe by global heath bodies and residents routinely describe the city as akin to a gas chamber.Pollutionnow kills more people in Delhi than obesity or diabetes.13:28Life and death on India’s toxic trash mountains – videoThe seeming inevitability of the pollution, and the failure by successive state governments to do anything about it, means it has often been met with apathy by residents. But on Sunday, as a rare protest against the increasingly woeful air quality erupted in the Delhi’s political centre, anger and frustration were rife.The call for Sunday’s protest had been to gather atIndiaGate, the country’s famed memorial to its fallen martyrs. But in the days prior to the protest, the police had made hundreds of calls and homes visits to those amplifying the protest to pressure them to call it off, even threatening legal action against them; the latest crackdown on any form of dissent in India.Saurav Das, 26, was among those who received police pressure, after he put out a call for action against pollution on social media. Though young and fit, he had recently been diagnosed with allergic bronchitis, due to the filthy air.“We wanted to gather peacefully at India Gate to send a message, loud and clear, that people are fed by failed policies and government apathy that have failed to combat air pollution,” said Das. “Instead we were met with unnecessary brute force.”On Sunday police shut down India gate to prevent the protest and within hours, officers had aggressively cleared the nearby site, detaining almost 100 protesters at police stations until late into the night, with elderly people, mothers and children among them. The next day, a police case was filed against the organisers.Chart on air pollution in 2024The reasons the capital is left to choke every winter are well documented; a lethal mix of emissions from tens of millions of cars,fires set by farmers in neighbouring states, plants that burn the city’s waste, coal fired power plants and smaller fires set by people just to keep warm. The cold weather, and lack of winds and rain, ensures the smog smothers Delhi and much of north India.Yet state and national government policies to tackle the root causes remain largely absent. Instead, those who can, seal themselves indoors with expensive air purifiers or escape to the mountains and beaches of other states, turning clean air into Delhi’s most luxury commodity – one unaffordable to most the of the city’s 30 million residents.View image in fullscreenA flock of birds flies past a tree on a smoggy morning amid ongoing air pollution in New DelhiPhotograph: Adnan Abidi/ReutersOn Sunday, much of the protester’s ire was directed at the Delhi government. In February, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which also runs the national government under prime minister Narendra Modi, won the Delhi state elections, stirring hope among residents it might finally trigger substantive anti-pollution policies at both state and national level.Instead, the new BJP state government not only went to courts to allow “green” fireworks to be allowed during Diwali celebrations – contributing to one of the city’smost polluted festival seasonsin years – but has also beenaccused by opponentsof attempting to fudge the city’s pollution data, either by halting reports from the city’s air quality monitoring centres or by spraying water on the air pollution monitors to bring the numbers down. The BJP denied tampering with pollution figures and called the accusation “politically motivated”, blaming the previous government for the ongoing pollution problem.The BJP’s multimillion rupeecloud seeding experiment– an attempt to make it rain using chemicals, in order to bring down pollution levels – proved a failure.“I can’t breathe in this city any more, I can’t take a walk without getting a terrible headache,” said Sofie, 33. “It feels like there aren’t enough masks in the world to make this air breathable.”Many among those gathered at the protest were mothers accompanied their children and signs were held aloft with messages such as “breathing is killing me”. The nearby central secretariat and parliament buildings had been rendered almost invisible by the evening’s opaque brown smog as the city’s AQI touched 500 – the healthy level is 50.“Any other city breathing this air would have declared a health emergency by now,” said Gopesh Singh, 58. “How many more millions of people have to die for the government to act?”Explore more on these topicsIndiaPollutionSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The most common cancelled grants were from the Institute of Museum of Library Services, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Endowment of the Arts. Two-thirds of the respondent museums reported that the lost funding has not been replaced by foundations, sponsors or donors.“We’re seeing attendance and financial performance trending in the wrong direction for the first time since the pandemic, with recovery not just stalling but reversing. This should be a wake-up call for policymakers and philanthropists alike,” Marilyn Jackson, president and CEO of the American Alliance of Museumssaidin a statement about the release of the report.The report found that about a quarter of the museums that have lost federal funding have been forced to cancel or reduce programming for students, rural communities, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly while 28% have had to cancel programming for the general public.Museum directors said they are anticipating continued disruption into 2026, citing shifts in philanthropy, financial instability, changes to travel and tourism, inflation, and government funding losses. A third of respondents identified ideological and political polarization as likely disruptions to their business strategy in the new year.Since taking office for the second time, theTrump administrationhas not shied away from targeting cultural institutions that they believe to be in opposition of the US president’s agenda.Trumptook control of the Kennedy Centerin February, firing board chair David Rubenstein and appointing himself to preside over the storied theater. Ticket sales for the Kennedy Center’s three largest performance spaces have sincefallen to their lowest levels in yearsfollowing that shake-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then in August, the administrationsent a letter to the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, signaling their intent to conduct a wide review of all its exhibits, materials and operations.In response, the Smithsonian’s secretary, Lonnie G Bunch III, reportedly told staffers at the museum that the institution had “agreed to set up a team to review turning over materials to the White House, as requested” but would “do so as an autonomous institution”, per a September report inthe New York Times.“Our own review of content to ensure our programming is nonpartisan and factual is ongoing, and it is consistent with our authority over our programming and content,” Bunch reportedly wrote in his letter to the staff.Adocument compiled by the White House, also in August, detailed examples at seven museums that had “overly negative portrayals of US history”. Those museums included the National Museum of American History, the upcoming National Museum of the American Latino, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African Art, the National Portrait Gallery, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Museum of Asian Art.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMuseumsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Newsom sought to fill the notable void of official US activity by lambasting the president for tearing up climate policies and pushing for burning more of the fossil fuels that have caused dangerous global heating.On Tuesday, it emerged that Trump hasdrawn up plansto open up the coast of California for oil and gas drilling, a move that Newsom said would happen “over my dead body, full stop. He said he wants to open up the coast of California, but he doesn’t want oil-drilling rigs off the coast of Florida, not across the street from Mar-a-Lago. He’s silent on that. But it’s not going to happen. It’s dead on arrival.”Accusing Trump of an assault upon the climate and on democracy, Newsom said of the president: “He’s an invasive species, he’s a wrecking-ball president. He’s trying to roll back progress of the last century. He’s trying to recreate the 19th century. He’s doubling down on stupid.”Trump has called the climate crisis a “con job” and urged countries to remain wedded to coal, oil and gas, and even remove their climate policies if necessary in order to purchase more US fossil fuels.The Republican president declined to send any representatives toCop30, where countries are thrashing out new emissions-cutting targets and climate finance.Newsom said Trump’s rolling back of climate policies and removing the US from the Paris climate agreement is “an abomination, it’s a disgrace” and added this would benefit China, which is dominating the world in the manufacture and deployment of clean energy such as solar and wind.“You know who is cheering, who is singing his praises? President Xi of China,” Newsom said. “They are sitting back and dominating supply chains, because they understand the great opportunity of clean energy.”Newsom, a Democrat who became governor ofCaliforniain 2019, is heading an alternate US delegation at Cop30 that includes more than 100 elected officials who are stressing that subnational jurisdictions in the US are still committed to tackling the climate crisis.Newsom is one of 24 governors who are part of the US Climate Alliance, a group of states that represents more than half of the US’s population and has stated support for climate action.This motley group has not glossed over the jarring absence of the US government in Belém, however, and some other leading figures at the talks have expressed relief that the Trump administration wasn’t there.Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations framework convention on climate change, said on Tuesday that the US’s absence from the talks “actually is a good thing”.“Ciao, bambino,” was her response to the US’s departure from the Paris agreement.At a press gaggle, Newsom said: “That’s a hell of a statement coming from the mother of the Paris agreement.” In light of the Trump administration’s behavior at an international maritime meeting last month, where officials menaced some foreign leaders and threatened tariffs on those who supported a carbon fee on shipping, US presence could be a threat, Newsom added.Trump’s absence “creates opportunity” for local leaders to step into the fold on climate policy, Newsom said.“What stands in the way becomes the way. This is an opportunity for us bottom up at the local level to assert ourselves,” he said. “He pulled away. That’s why I pulled up.”Newsom is considered a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2028 presidential race. While he said he wouldn’t be drawn on whether he would run, he stressed that Democrats needed to reframe the debate around the climate crisis, to focus on simple messages around cost of living and the problems American households are facing in getting insurance due to repeated climate-fueled disasters.Joe Biden attempted to sell his climate policies as being a benefit for jobs and the economy, a pitch that failed to resonate with voters. Biden then dropped out of his struggling re-election campaign, with Kamala Harris losing to Trump.“Climate change can seem abstract,” he said. “We need to talk in terms that people understand. It’s about people, places, lifestyles and traditions. If we put things in those terms, we can start winning people over.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Gavin NewsomDonald TrumpClimate crisisCaliforniaUS politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

After his return to power, a string of US broadcasters and tech firms have paid tens of millions of dollars to settle such cases.The president has now gone global with this campaign, crossing the pond to threaten theBBCwith a $1bn lawsuit over an episode of the Panorama documentary program that aired more than a year ago.A lawyer representing Trump accused theBBCof “defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements” in stitching together Trump’s comments from his 6 January 2021 speech in Washington DC to make it sound like he was encouraging his supporters to “fight like hell” at the US Capitol, hours before a deadly insurrection unfolded.The BBC’s editing of Trump’s January 6 speech caused controversy – but what did he really say?Read moreAlready,two top BBC executives have resignedover the controversy. A lawyer for Trump said the BBC’s broadcast has caused Trump “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” and suggested it violated Florida law – even though BBC iPlayer, the main streaming platform that carries Panorama, and BBC One, the main TV channel that broadcasts it, are not available in the US.The BBC has said it will review the correspondence from Trump’s legal team “and respond directly in due course”.The saga is only the latest chapter in a campaign meant to keep media institutions that cover Trump on their toes. Often, legal letters sent to media companies on his behalf have not actually led to lawsuits – though many journalists say they have contributed to a chilling effect on coverage.But Trump has also followed through on several lawsuits, and since his re-election one year ago, a series of media and tech companies have chosen to take the easy way out by agreeing to significant settlements. Several of those companies have business before his administration.In July, Paramount, parent company of CBS News, chose to settle a case that Trump had filed in the state of Texas arguing that the company had violated consumer protection laws by misleadingly editing a 60 Minutes interview of then vice-president Kamala Harris. Many legal experts viewed the case as easily winnable for Paramount, considering the unrelated statute he sued under – and that Trump could not credibly claim to have been harmed by the segment since he defeated Harris in the election.But company leadership viewed the lawsuit as an unnecessary distraction, particularly as it sought the federal government’s approval of a merger with Skydance Media. Paramountultimately paid $16m.Trump also won a settlement last year from ABC, owned by Disney, which he had sued over comments made by anchor George Stephanopoulos. ABCagreed to pay $15m.When combining Trump’s settlements with ABC, CBS and cases against both Facebook parent company Meta and YouTube, which is owned by Google, he has racked up over $80m in agreements. Most of this money is slated to go toward the building of Trump’s presidential library, rather than to him personally.Now the BBC is in his sights. Unlike CBS, owned by Paramount Skydance, and ABC, owned by Disney, the BBC is not part of a complicated corporate empire: it is independent, although its unique structure as a publicly funded organization invites intense scrutiny.Because of the timing of the Panorama broadcast, one week before the 5 November 2024 presidential election, a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team accused the BBC of so-called “election interference”, a similar charge to the CBS case. “President Trump will continue to hold accountable those who traffic in lies, deception and fake news,” they told the Guardian.The legal letter cites the actual malice standard necessary to win defamation cases in the US. To meet that bar, Trump’s team would have to prove that someone with authority at the BBC knew that the edited package falsely portrayed Trump to have encouraged violence, and chose not to act on that knowledge.David A Logan, professor emeritus at the Roger Williams School of Law in Rhode Island, said Trump’s allegations against the BBC closely “track” those he made against CBS – though in that case, CBS had merely used two different parts of the same answer in separate broadcasts, rather than pulling together comments from opposite ends of the Harris interview.“I am reluctant to say which is worse journalism,” Logan said, but he noted that the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and chief executive of BBC News Deborah Turness “signals that the BBC thinks it’s plenty bad behavior”.Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer at the firm Howard Kennedy, said Trump’s team likely targeted the US in which to potentially file the case because the statute of limitations – one year from the date of the broadcast, which was 28 October 2024 – has passed in the UK.Still, he said that Trump’s team would face “jurisdictional hurdles” if it filed the lawsuit. Because the program was not easily viewable in Florida, Stephens said it could be challenging to prove that someone in the state had seen it. “The question I would ask myself early on is: how can someone in Florida think the worst ofDonald Trumpif they haven’t seen the publication?” (The legal letter noted the segment in question has been distributed “through various digital mediums”.)If Trump chooses to sue, Stephens said the case wouldbring renewed attention to Trump’s comments, and any role he might have played in fomenting the violence of January 6. (Trump claims he did no such thing.)“If he sues, he opens a Pandora’s box, and in that Pandora’s box is every damning quote he’s ever uttered about January 6,” said Stephens. “So this isn’t the hill to die on, in my view. It’s a legal cliff edge, and if he jumps, there’s a high chance he’ll fall.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpBBCLaw (US)US politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It also reported that second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5tn yen (£12.2bn), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.SoftBank also sold part of its stake in T-Mobile, as it assembled funds to bankroll its AI investments.Asked about the timing of the sale of the Nvidia stake, the chief financial officer, Yoshimitsu Goto, told reporters that because SoftBank’s investment inOpenAIwas very substantial, the company had to use its existing assets to finance new investments.“This year our investment in OpenAI is large – more than $30bn needs to be made – so for that we do need to divest our existing portfolios,” Goto said. “We did not have a specific [reason to sell] in October and it was nothing to do with Nvidia itself.”Shares in Nvidia, whose high-powered chips are in hot demand to power AI datacentres, fell by 3.5% in morning trading in New York after SoftBank’s announcement.Other tech shares also slipped, pulling the Nasdaq Composite index down by 0.85% in early trading. Arm, the Cambridge-based chip designer, fell 5.1%, as did the computer memory and storage developer Micron.Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said: “People are looking for clues that the tech rally is close to the top, and SoftBank’s profit-taking in the chip giant is significant.“Investors typically sell out of positions when they believe the valuation is too rich, the growth prospects for the company are less attractive than before, or they’ve found something better to back and need cash to make that investment.”Nvidia’s market value had soared during 2024 and 2025, helping to fuel concerns in recent months that an AI bubble was forming. At the end of October itbecame the world’s first $5tn companybut has since fallen back from that high.Mould suggested SoftBank had topped up its war chest for the next wave of AI-related investments by cashing in its stake in Nvidia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“The settlement represents a step towards accountability and healing after a difficult period in my life, and I really hope that my experience helps highlight to the public, and to especially Delta flight attendants, the importance of having a union,” said Nejat, who works as a flight attendant for a different major airline. “I truly believe that Delta values its anti-union campaign over the legal rights of its flight attendants to organize a union and their legal right to make complaints of sexual harassment.”Nejat said he planned to use the settlement to cover his law school costs.Several labor unions including the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the Teamsters are working to unionize 29,000 flight attendants at Delta, currently the largest single-unit organizing campaign in the US.Delta ex-flight attendant files lawsuit alleging retaliation, sexual harassmentRead moreDelta has strongly opposed the move. The airline has a unionrepresentingpilots at the carrier and onerepresentingdispatchers, but not for attendants – unlike other major airlines, where most workers are predominantly union represented.“One of the reasons that flight attendant unions were originally formed were to root out sexual harassment, assault or sexual exploitation in order to try to get workers to do what you want them to do, to keep them quiet,” said Sara Nelson, president of the AFA-CWA. “These were the original reasons that we organized over 80 years ago, and we first negotiated a seniority list and a due process in that contract that ensured that something like this, at a minimum, that Aryasp wouldn’t have faced the retaliation for the union support but would have had a due process here.”A Delta Air Lines spokesperson said: “Delta has consistently maintained his claims are without merit and settled to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation.

There was even a recent music forum in California calledDeath to Spotify.So the timing is fortuitous for a growing number of independent streaming and music community platforms, such as Nina Protocol, Coda, Subvert, Lissen, Vocana, and just last week a new one launched in the UK: Cantilever. “More people are definitely looking for alternatives,” says Nina Protocol’s chief executive Mike Pollard. “We strongly believe the future of music is independent.”Each of the new platforms have unique identities. Nina Protocol uses an open public network, where artists set their terms and keep 100% of any revenue from downloads; the collectively owned Subvert is intended to be an alternative to Bandcamp, where music files are bought and sold. Cantilever takes inspiration from curated film streaming platforms such as Mubi, offering a limited and rotating number of albums at a time (currently 10, but up to 30).What unites them is curation, a sense of community and an artist-friendly, anti-corporate model. “We think a lot about the dignity of releasing music,” says Pollard. “I don’t think these algorithm-driven reasons for why something’s getting played are very dignified: are you just something that sounds like something they already like? An artist may say, ‘one of my songs did well onSpotifybecause it was put in the most popular sleep playlist’. But maybe the 500,000 people who listened to that track weren’t even awake! And how many of those people know your name, care about you or would buy a ticket to a show?”View image in fullscreenCantilever founder Aaron Skates.Photograph: Courtesy: Aaron SkatesMany of these new services also have written articles and editorial, intending to offer contextual deep dives for a more focused listening experience. “It’s like a music magazine you can listen to,” says Cantilever’s Aaron Skates, an ex-record label worker and music writer who has launched the streaming platform. Skates has managed to pull in an impressive list of independent labels to work with too, such as Warp, Ninja Tune, Domino and Beggars Group labels such as Rough Trade, 4AD and Matador.By having a smaller roster of artists, it means they receive more money. “The pool is far less diluted,” Skates says. “We’re paying out a maximum of 30 artists for all subscriber revenue, versus the 100m tracks on Spotify. Also, we pay on a user-centric basis, so that means your fee will only ever go towards the music that you actually listen to.” Skates gives me an example: if Cantilever was to get 10,000 subscribers at £4.99 a month, that would result in albums on the service receiving £2,000-3,000 each, which he says is “roughly the equivalent of a million Spotify streams”.Spotify says in a company response that it “welcomes and celebrates choice and new perspectives,” but claims: “The narrative that the current system is failing artists is not supported by the facts; more artists are earning more than ever. Rather than just re-dividing the current pie” – through models like Cantilever’s user-centric one – “Spotify is focused on growing it for everyone, increasing the total royalties paid out year after year.”So, is all this new activity rooted in a revolt against the big companies? “I’m wary about saying that it is anti-Spotify,” says Simon Wheeler, director of commercial strategy at Beggars Group. “Perhaps more a disillusionment with the complete commoditisation of music. There’s always a swathe of new entrants to the market, but there’s more coming up that are talking about trying to provide an alternative. The tone of that conversation has changed.”Wheeler does not view these startups as major competition, though. “Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, none of them are going anywhere anytime soon,” he says. “So it’s more like: let’s try and bring something in which is offering something a bit different.” Skates echoes this: “Cantilever is not in any way competitive towards current major DSPs [digital service providers],” he says. “It’s a totally different thing. I don’t expect anybody to cancel their subscription and just have this – it’s an additional thing that tries to give additional value that wasn’t there before.”View image in fullscreenA view of Nina Protocol.Photograph: NinaPollard, on the other hand, “can see a world where Spotify doesn’t exist in the future,” he says. “Where people realise the options given to them aren’t the ones that best serve them.” Although the numbers aren’t quite showing this yet, with Spotify revealing an additional five million paying subscribers in this year’s third quarter report, that’s not to say the interest in alternatives isn’t rising. The five-person team at Nina Protocol is struggling to keep up with inbound interest and Skates says despite only launching a week ago, the interest and listener numbers for Cantilever have “surpassed my expectations”.Pollard suggests there is a wider cultural sea change beginning to take place, one that leaves him hopeful of a brighter future for music culture in the streaming era.Mood Machine by Liz Pelly review – a savage indictment of SpotifyRead more“There’s a growing awareness of how slop-filled everything is getting,” he says. “People are wanting a little more control of what they consume.” He gives the example of users leaving X, formerly Twitter: “They realised, ‘Shit, I don’t need to be here any more.’ Then you understand what it feels like to be more intentional about your choices, instead of just being on everything that you’re told you need to be on to exist. I think people are waking up.”Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingMusic industrySpotifyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Dutch government decision at the end of September to take over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chip factory, almost brought the entire European car industry to a halt.Tensions between Europe and China de-escalated over the weekend as Beijing confirmed it wouldease restrictions on automotive chip supplies to the EU, prompting sighs of relief in car factories around the world.But it has only intensified the questions about the EU’s asymmetric relationship withChina, with many in industry, diplomacy and governments asking if Europe is no longer collateral damage in the wider Sino-American political war but a target in itself.Boom or bubble? Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spreeRead more“We can buy a bit of time, but there is a sense that we are entering into a situation where we are going to be dealing with rolling crises from now on and that things have really crossed a threshold with China,” said Andrew Small, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund thinktank and former China adviser within the European Commission.Crucially China agreed to resume the supply of Nexperia chips, but only for a 12-month period, and only for civilian use, leaving the way open for future action should Beijing wish to interfere in the EU’s revived defence industry or turn the tap off again for the car industry.“China is repeatedly now taking steps that does not actually stop industries from functioning but just chokes supplies. If this kind of stranglehold persists, it just puts Europe under a constant sword of Damocles,” Small added.Europe is “no longer collateral damage” of the trade war with Donald Trump, said Small: “I think people are beginning to understand that now.”The deeply bruising experience of Nexperia aside, there is a wider imbalance in the relationship between the EU and China with a trade deficit standing at €300bn (£263bn) in China’s favour, with the bloc’s tariff measures,including last year’s electric vehicle levies, doing little to stem the tide of imports.In April there were a series of slowdowns in car manufacturing after China imposed export controls on materials, and one politician in Germany reported at a conference earlier this year that one household name had 100,000 cars parked up waiting for window magnets.View image in fullscreenChina’s controls on materials left thousands of cars awaiting export.Photograph: APBy June manufacturers were in “full panic” trying to source magnets, and more recently it emerged that manufacturers in Germany, which imports 95% of its rare earths from China, were being forced to hand over details about their businesses, which not even the German government has, to China in order to get hold of the goods.Jens Eskelund, the chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in China and a managing director at Maersk in China, believes that products onSheinsuch as plastic garden chairs or Christmas decorations are not the issue but the dependency China is creating in strategic industries such as clean tech, in other words the car industry, solar and wind industries.“Of course there are nuances here, there are certain sectors that are under threat. Europe is still a leader, or maybe last year was a leader within the production of wind turbines but if something does not happen, Europe will not be producing wind turbines five years from now,” he said.“We are living in a period of change unseen in 100 years,” Eskelund told a recent briefing in Brussels. “When China says China is rising and the west is declining, it’s not necessarily in terms of the economy, but what it sees as parliamentary democracies containing the seeds of their own destruction.”Or, as Small says, “China weaponises its trading relationships”, using them as an opportunity to “project power” on a weaker rival and to extract economic advantage.Bloombergreportedlast month that German car companies were being asked to submit detailed confidential information on their own businesses to get licences to import magnets needed for window openings in cars, giving Beijing a greater inside view of German companies than Berlin has.Officially the EU has been pursuing a policy of “de-risking” from China but not “decoupling”, asset outby the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in March 2023.“The Nexperia and rare-earths crises could and should jolt Europe out of its de-risking stupor,” Noah Barkin, an adviser to the China-watching thinktank Rhodium Group, said in a post on LinkedIn last week berating the “inertia” in Berlin when it came to acting to change the balance in the relationship with China.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month von der Leyen warned the EU was “ready to use all of the instruments in our toolbox to respond if needed”, a thinly veiled reference to the anti-coercion instrument (ACI) it did not use in its tariff row with Trump earlier this year.Labelled the “nuclear deterrent” by Brussels diplomats, it is a never-before-used trade defence law passed in 2023 that could allow the EU to impose more restrictions on Chinese imports, ban it from procurement tenders and at its most extreme block access to the open market.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who pushed for the ACI to be used against the US, is openly pushing for it to be used against China if necessary. “This is economic coercion. We need to act,” he said after the EU summit of leaders in October.But he is unlikely to get the backing of Germany.“It is not so easy to decouple from China, because there would be retaliation,” said Joachim Taiber, an advanced research fellow and automatic industry expert at Imperial College who points to the near 800,000 vehicles a year that BMW sells in China.“You could completely decouple, emulate the US and say we are not going to use any Chinese components but that is the alternative extreme and unworkable. It would have a disastrous impact on the economy,” he added.The EU has no operational rare-earth mines. The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said after the Korea meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping that it was “two years” away from its own supplies with companies such as General Motors already teaming up with mines.Nigel Stewart, the director of the Centre for Sectoral Economic Performance at Imperial College London, said China controlled 96% of the world’s magnet supply and it could take 10 years for Europe to do what Xi has done – buy up or control the entire supply chain from mine to assembly line.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economySheinTechnology sectorInternational tradeEconomicsFranceChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

OpenAI can appeal against the decision.ChatGPT accused of acting as ‘suicide coach’ in series of US lawsuitsRead moreChatGPT allows users to ask questions and type commands into a chatbot, which responds with text that resembles human language patterns. The model underlying ChatGPT is trained on widely available data.The case revolved around nine of the most recognisable German hits of recent decades, which were used by ChatGPT to hone its language capabilities.They included Herbert Grönemeyer’s 1984 synth-pop sendup of masculinity,Männer(Men), and Helene Fischer’sAtemlosDurch die Nacht(Breathless Through the Night), which was the unofficial anthem of the German side during the 2014 football World Cup.The presiding judge ordered OpenAI to pay undisclosed damages for using copyrighted material without permission.The GEMA legal adviser Kai Welp said the organisation now hoped to negotiate with OpenAI on how rights holders could be compensated.The San Francisco-based company, whose founders includeSam Altmanand Elon Musk, had said its language learning models absorbed entire training sets of data rather than storing or copying specific songs, the Munich court said.Because its output is generated by users of the chatbot via their prompts, OpenAI said, they were the ones who should be held legally liable for it – an argument rejected by the court.GEMA welcomed the decision as “the first landmark AI ruling in Europe”, saying it could have implications for other types of creative output.Its chief executive, Tobias Holzmüller, said the decision proved “the internet is not a self-service store and human creative achievements are not free templates”.“Today, we have set a precedent that protects and clarifies the rights of authors: even operators of AI tools such as ChatGPT must comply with copyright law. Today, we have successfully defended the livelihoods of music creators.”The Berlin law firm Raue, which represented GEMA, said in a statement that the court’s decision “sets an important precedent for the protection of creative works and sends a clear signal to the global tech industry” while creating “legal certainty for creators, music publishers and platforms across Europe”.OpenAI signs $38bn cloud computing deal with AmazonRead moreThe ruling “is likely to have an impact far beyond Germany as a precedent”, it said.The German Journalists’ Association also hailed the ruling as “a milestone victory for copyright law”.OpenAI said in a statement it would weigh an appeal. “We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” it said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people, businesses and developers in Germany that use our technology every day.”It added: “We respect the rights of creators and content owners and are having productive conversations with many organisations around the world, so that they can also benefit from the opportunities of this technology.”OpenAI hasfaced litigation in the US from authorsand media groups claiming ChatGPT has been trained on their work without permission.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTOpenAISam AltmanElon MuskGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We should copy its tactics to defeat fast fashionNicole LipmanThe dirt-cheap clothing company has opened its first permanent store in Paris – and politicians and workers have united against itTue 11 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 11.25 ESTShareParis is the fashion capital of the world – a paradise of couture and craftsmanship stretching back centuries. The city’s very name connotes luxury and glamour. But last Wednesday, 5 November, a sprawling Shein outlet opened on the sixth floor of the BHV Marais, the historic department store directly across from Paris’s city hall. It’s the Singapore-based ultra-fast-fashion store’s first permanent bricks and mortar retail space, and the first of several permanent outposts Shein plans to open in France in the near future. Many Parisians aren’t happy about it.Shein – launched as SheInside in 2011 in Nanjing, China – is the reprehensible paragon of the ultra-fast-fashion industry. The company sells clothing (and home goods, toys, stationery, cookware, blankets, pet supplies and more) at an unfathomable scale: today’s “new in” page alone lists more than 1,300 items, from shiny gold shirts in its “Manfinity Mode” category, to plunging, plus-size swimsuits under the sub-brand “Slaysola”. Nearly everything on the site ismade of plastic, designed for single-use disposability, and it’s all shockingly, disturbingly cheap.Shein is an economic affront to France’s fashion industry and labour market, and the French government has been going after the company for years. In 2023, at theurging of two French MPs, the French branch of the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched an investigation into Shein’s human rights, labour law and environmental violations, finding in 2025 Shein failed to uphold OECD standard in these areas. (Sheinrejected claimsit had breached any EU legislation, and questioned the neutrality of the investigation). In 2024, the French lower house of parliament approved a bill penalising fast fashion companies for environmental impacts; this June, the Senatepassed a modified versionof the bill, singling out Shein and other ultra-fast fashion companies as particularly egregious offenders. In the past three months, France hasfined Sheinnearly €200m for consumer protection violations and “misleading discounts”. (Shein contests the fines.)Most significantly, last Wednesday – motivated by the discovery of both “childlike” sex dolls and weapons for sale on Shein’s website – France’s prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, moved toblock the company’s e-commerce entirely. Immediately, the government suspended all Shein deliveries and flagged more than 200,000 packages for customs investigation. Deliveries wereresumed by the weekendafter Shein removed the offending products, although the PM noted that “Shein will remain under close surveillance by state services.” The concurrent timing of the attacks on Shein’s e-commerce and the new BHV Marais storefront seems intentional: it’s a strategic and effective approach designed to hobble the company at all points.The presence of Shein in France is more than an economic affront – it’s a cultural one, too. Shein stands in direct opposition to values the French stereotypically hold dear: artistry and durability, sustainability and chicness. BHV Marais staff, bolstered by support from the major French trade unions,have staged numerous strikesand demonstrations in recent weeks, and several independent retailers have pulled their products from the department store in protest. More than 100,000 French citizenshave signedan online petition opposing Shein’s presence in the city. And on opening day, protesters with anti-Shein signs wereforcibly removedfrom the store by police. The French fear Shein’s impact on the economy and labour markets, but also what the brand stands for: dirt-cheap clothing, at the expense of ethics.Yet for all the protests, fines and resistance, there’s a reason Société des Grands Magasins (BHV’s owner) has leased its retail space to Shein: it knows Shein’s shoddy, ultracheap and unethical clothes will sell.Sheinis the fifth-largest clothing retailer by volume in France, celebrated as an accessible retailer for trendy fashion. Behind the rows of protesters on Wednesday carrying signs reading “SHAME ON SHEIN” stood hundreds of Parisians, waiting patiently in line to enter Shein’s new, permanent, super-cheap emporium. They left carrying bulging shopping bags of polyester sweaters and shimmering going-out tops, muted pastel workwear and plastic, faux-leather winter coats. Most likely, they felt they had scored a bargain.Behind those low prices are enormous, insurmountable costs. There arethe coststothe environment. There are the costs to garment workers: paidpennies to toil,unendinglyin factories that supply Shein products the world over. There are thecosts to independent designers, whose work has regularly been ripped off by Shein. And there are the social, cultural costs, too: the lesson that clothing is worth so little, and the expectation that our garments are temporary.France’s regulatory attacks on Shein – and labour’s decisive, united opposition to the company – are powerful, necessary measures. By making it harder to purchase from Shein through corporate regulation, we can discourage the growth of ultra-fast fashion and limit its power in the market. Social pressure, led by workers arm-in-arm with consumers, may be an even more powerful weapon – when buying from Shein is widely considered shameful, no one will want to be caught in a Slaysola bathing suit.Still, the fight against fast fashion is ultimately a slow one. To truly defeat Shein, we must radically re-evaluate and reorient our relationship to clothing. We must learn to love the clothes we already have. We can dampen the environmental impact of textile manufacturing by committing to buying only secondhand. We must learn to mend things and invest care in our clothes, instead of disposing of them at the first signs of damage. Along the way, we must fight for better working conditions and better pay for garment workers everywhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also comes one day after Dumont, an owner of the Mavs and the team’s representative on the NBA’s board of governors, was seen talking to a fan who was wearing a Lakers Dončić jersey during Monday’s 116-114 home loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.Mark Cuban made the Mavericks relevant. But is his legacy rotten? | Lee EscobedoRead more“Fire Nico!” chants were audible during the fourth-quarter of the game, in which Dallas squandered a 13-point lead.Harrison, 52, accepted responsibility for the trade and defended the move by claiming there were concerns over Dončić’s physique and commitment to conditioning.“I did know that Luka was important to the fanbase. I didn’t quite know it to what level,” Harrison said in explaining the move, comments which themselves drew widespread criticism from fans andNBAcommentators alike.In a letter to fans on Tuesday, Dumont did not directly address the Dončić trade, but did allude to it. “I understand the profound impact these difficult last several months have had,” Dumont’s letter said. “Please know that I’m fully committed to the success of the Mavericks. ... Our goal is to return winning basketball to Dallas and win championships.”The deal has by and large has not worked out for the Mavericks. Anthony Davis, who was the key cog in return from the Lakers, was sidelined for six weeks after sustaining an adductor strain in his Dallas debut. Davis currently is out with a calf strain for the Mavericks, who have limped out of the blocks to a 3-8 record this season.Dončić, meanwhile, has continued to be one of the best players in the NBA with the Lakers. He is now averaging just over 37 points and nine assists per game this season, with the Lakers owning an 8-3 record as one of the better teams in the Western Conference through the early part of the season.Dallas’s drop in form after the Dončić deal did enable them to win the top overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, which they used to select Cooper Flagg. In Monday’s loss to the Bucks, Flagg scored a career-high 26 points and pulled down a game-high nine rebounds.ESPN reportsthat Michael Finley and Matt Riccardi, both assistant general managers, will be leading the Mavericks’ basketball operations on an interim basis.Explore more on these topicsDallas MavericksNBABasketballUS sportsLuka DončićnewsShareReuse this content"

The alleged victim, Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, told investigators that one of the bullets grazed his neck.Eiglarsh said Brown was simply protecting himself from Nantambu.“The actions he was forced to take were solely in self-defense against the alleged victim’s violent behavior. Brown was attacked that night and acted within his legal right to protect himself,” Eiglarsh said.Brown was not immediately arrested because initially police did not identify Nantambu as a victim. It wasn’t until later in May that Nantambu gave a full statement about the incident to police and identified Brown as the shooter, the affidavit says.Based on his social media posts, Brown had been living in Dubai for several months. In a post after the altercation, Brown said he was defending himself because he was “jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.”A second-degree attempted murder charge in Florida carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence and up to a $10,000 fine in the event of a conviction.Brown has dealt with several legal problems over the years. He previously had been accused of battery of a truck driver, several domestic violence charges, failure to pay child support and other incidents.During a 2021 game with Tampa Bay against the New York Jets, Brown took off his jersey, shoulder pads and gloves and ran off the field, leading to his release by the Buccaneers and effectively ending his football career.Brown, who spent 12 years in theNFL, was an All-Pro wide receiver spent most of his career with Pittsburgh. For his career, Brown had 928 receptions for more than 12,291 yards, the 28th most of all time. He was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection.Explore more on these topicsNFLPittsburgh SteelersFloridaUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Failing to drop struggling Salah | Barney RonayRead moreThe offside law allows for referees to penalise a player, even if they do not touch the ball, if they are adjudged to be interfering with an opponent by “making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball”.Speaking on Referees Mic’d Up, the regular TV review of officials’ recent decisions, Webb was challenged by the presenter Michael Owen, with the formerLiverpoolstar saying he was “strongly of the opinion” that the goal should have stood.Webb, in unpacking the officials’ thinking process, admitted that “only Donnarumma truly knows if he was impacted by this”, but said there was enough contributory evidence to lead Kavanagh to take the action he did, with Robertson’s ducking out of the way of the ball a key action.“It’s not unreasonable to understand why they would form that conclusion [of disallowing the goal] when the player is so close to the goalkeeper, the ball’s coming right towards him, and [Robertson] has to duck to get out of the way of the ball,” Webb said. “They form the conclusion that it impacts Donnarumma’s ability just to dive towards the ball and make that save.”After Owen suggested that Robertson’s decision to duck actually appeared an attempt to avoid having an impact on the play, Webb said: “That action could still cause hesitation from the goalkeeper. Goalkeepers work from reactions that make it possible to pull out some incredible saves. And that’s the judgment formed on the field.” Oliver could have overturned Kavanagh’s call only had he thought the referee had made a “clear and obvious” error.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Importantly, Silva moves to the left away from the flight of the ball and the ball goes straight over the keeper.”Explore more on these topicsVideo assistant referees (VARs)Howard WebbLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not a case that should have ever been brought to trial.”‘The most aesthetic line’: how Kilian Jornet climbed the 72 highest US mountains in 31 daysRead morePoon said the Pacific Legal Foundation had lobbied White House officials on Sunseri’s behalf but had not met with Trump directly.Sunseri ran up and downGrand Teton, the 13,775ft centerpiece of the Teton Range, in two hours, 50 minutes and 50 seconds in 2024.It was an epic feat:The 33-year-old’s run covered 13.3 miles, gaining 7,000ft in elevation, then back down again in Grand Teton National Park.But on the way down, Sunseri left a switchback to avoid hikers. Going off-trail in a national park is generally forbidden because it can cause erosion to sensitive environments.Sunseri, who freely admitted taking the two-minute detour, received a misdemeanor conviction from a judge in September. Fastest Known Time, which oversees trail running records, also voided his time because of his shortcut.Sunseri received widespread online support after his conviction and appeared on various podcasts telling his story. The hashtag “Free Michelino” also became prominent among the trail running community on social media.“There’s been a lot of media around this case,” Poon said. “I suspect that it caught the eye of the officials in charge of the pardon process.”Before the pardon, prosecutors agreed to seek dismissal if Sunseri completed 60 hours of community service and a course on wilderness stewardship, according to Sunseri’s attorneys. He had originally faced a fine of $5,000 and a lifetime ban from Grand Teton National Park.Explore more on these topicsSportUltrarunningExtreme sportsUS sportsWyomingDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A few weeks ago, Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Juve’s fifth manager since McKennie joined – orhis seventh, if you count the interim head coaches. It’s not a new situation for the American. But according to US men’s national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it’s why McKennie isn’t with the US during their upcoming friendlies with Paraguay on Saturday and Uruguay on Tuesday.Pochettino could have selected McKennie, trusting that Spalletti is the first Juventus manager in years to be instantly convinced of the multifunctional Texan’s value. Rather than the usual routine of a manager trying to push McKennie out of the club, only to realize that there’s a reasononly three players in the squadhave been at the club longer, Spalletti has given McKennie starts in all three matches he’s overseen. The 27-year-old has played all but five available minutes in that span.Still, Pochettino chose caution.USMNT’s Pochettino admits he misses Premier League and would like to return in futureRead more“These next few weeks, with the possibility for the new coach to work with the players there, I think it’s important for Weston to be there and to convince the coach to keep playing [him],” said the Argentinian. “I think that’s more important than to be with us, because we already know what he can provide the team.”McKennie isn’t the only absentee. So too are Christian Pulisic, Malik Tillman, Antonee Robinson and Chris Richards, all of whom are recovering from injuries. Tyler Adams, meanwhile, was a late scratch after freak injuries in consecutive Bournemouth games – a stray cleat to his knee and then a head-to-head conk with teammate Adam Smith, which left the latter concussed.The absences mean that, at most, Pochettino will have a single international window to work with his full, first-choice team before he assembles it for next summer’sWorld Cup. And when he does, it will be March 2026, with his European-based players already coming off seven-or-so mostly uninterrupted months of club soccer.In his year-and-change in charge, Pochettino has never had a full complement of his best players – whether they combine to form his bestteamor not. Even last March , at the ill-fated Concacaf Nations League Finals that triggered a total reset of Pochettino’s project, he was without strikers Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi, and full-back Sergiño Dest, whose creativity out wide completely changes the team’s setup. During Pochettino’s only other tournament, the summer’s Gold Cup, the US were without an astounding 10 regulars – but neverthelessmade a spirited run to the final.This litany of absences is, in part, a policy. The US head coach could have insisted on the presence of Pulisic, who injured his hamstring while with the national team in October but made his return with Milan on Saturday. Or Tillman, who is also back from an injury sustained at that same US camp. Or Richards, for that matter. After all, the Crystal Palace defender has played all 90 minutes in his club’s last three matches.But there are relationships to maintain. Richards’ club manager, Oliver Glasner,was upsetat the October call-up, when Richards played all 180 minutes in the heat of Texas and at the altitude of Colorado in spite of an apparent calf issue. This time, Pochettino opted to keep the peace, to be diplomatic and strategic, even though Glasner’s words “made me feel very disappointed, because I am very respectful with all the coaches and all the clubs.”“It’s not common sense to call a player that maybe is coming [back from] a small injury,” Pochettino said. “We never risk players … Always what we want is to do the best for the player, to be in a very good condition and then to have in March, and of course when arrives the moment to select the roster for the World Cup, to be in the best place, in the best form, in the best shape.”Pochettino, then, trusts that the March camp, and the weeks-long preparations for the tournament proper, will suffice to forge something cohesive out of all those puzzle pieces he has laid in disconnected clusters.“I have no concerns about that,” Pochettino said of his dwindling time with the team. “We have settled the principles and I think the team has responded very well. That is the time that we have, and we are not going to complain. We cannot give excuses to ourselves. I think we have time enough.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBut the broader conundrum here, of whether to prioritize team building or enabling his players with their clubs in hopes of a long-term payoff, also underscores just how much is out of Pochettino’s control. At the World Cup next summer, the USMNT will continue to be at the mercy of injuries and the unrelenting churn in European club management. There is a huge amount of randomness baked into the recipe of any international job. For all the good intentions in this ploy to play it safe, there is no telling which key US player will lose a friendly manager at just the wrong time. Or who will get benched down the season’s home stretch, their form fading in critical monthsBecause McKennie is hardly alone in cycling through coaches.Gio Reyna deflects blame for USMNT controversy, aims for World Cup returnRead moreNot even halfway through his third Milan season, Pulisic is on his fourth manager. Gio Reyna,who made a surprise return on this US roster, had six Borussia Dortmund managers before leaving for Borussia Mönchengladbach this summer, where he got yet another new manager by mid-September. Upon his move from PSV, Tillman’s Bayer Leverkusen manager was gone just two league games into the season, all of two days after Tillman made his club debut. Glasner is Richards’ third Palace manager in his fourth season there. Brenden Aaronson has had four Leeds managers since joining the club in 2022. Although now apparently out of the US picture,Josh Sargent has had six Norwich managers since 2021.There will surely be more managerial upheaval at the USMNT players’ clubs, possibly at the expense of their form and match fitness. But all the caution and planning and diplomacy in the world can’t protect Pochettino and his US squad from it.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

You think about all of the time that we’re going to miss him and he’s going to be missed by the people around him. He was just getting started.”Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland dies at age of 24Read morePolice say Kneeland took his own life, and Jones said he hoped the tragedy would help raise awareness around mental health.“His death is such a national awareness thing that it takes on some of that light when we think about how we go forward,” said Jones.Dallas have not played since Kneeland’s death due to their bye week. They will return to action next Monday against the Las Vegas Raiders. Cowboys players will wear t-shirts and decals on their helmetsin tribute to Kneeland.“From the standpoint of the team and going back to work, there’s no doubt in my mind they will do so in memory of what he’s all about,” said Jones.Jones added: “I think we all have unfettered feelings about the people we love, people we work with, and this is just a time when you acknowledge that there’s no answers. “It makes you want to live life to the fullest. It makes you want to look for the very best in what we have for each other. And in some way make sense out of these times in terms of what they can mean from helping those that are here on Earth right now.”Kneeland played in 11 games in his rookie season, but had taken on a more prominent role in 2025.He scored his first career touchdownin his final game for the Cowboys after recovering a blocked punt in the endzone.Explore more on these topicsDallas CowboysNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Packers, who owned the NFC’s best record before their 16-13 loss to Carolina on 2 November, would have the conference’s seventh and final playoff seed if the regular season ended now.From floored to flawed: Does anyone want to win the Super Bowl this season?Read moreA defensive struggle that was tied at 0-0 at halftime had a serious lack of big plays until the Eagles (7-2) delivered a one-two punch early in the fourth quarter.Philadelphia led 3-0 and faced third-and-seven from their own 23 when Saquon Barkley caught a pass five yards behind the line of scrimmage, made a spin move past cornerback Carrington Valentine and burst up-field for a 41-yard gain. On the next play, Smith made a leaping catch in the end zone over safety Evan Williams, giving the Eagles a 10-0 lead with 10:35 remaining.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

The Packers then had a couple more opportunities in the closing minutes.They got the ball back at their own 10 with 2:18 and two timeouts remaining, but that drive ended when Josh Jacobs fumbled while getting stopped for a four-yard loss on fourth-and-one from Green Bay’s 44. Green Bay had one last chance with 27 seconds left from their own 36 after the Eagles threw a long incompletion on fourth-and-six rather than punting. An 18-yard completion from Jordan Love to Bo Melton got the Packers beyond midfield, but McManus couldn’t convert what would have been the longest field goal in team history.The Packers couldn’t get a measure of revenge against the defending Super Bowl champions. Philadelphia had beaten the Packers twice last season, knocking them off 34-29 in Brazil on the season’s opening week and then beating them 22-10 at Philadelphia in the wild-card round of the NFC playoffs.During the offseason, the Packers proposed banning the tush push that Philadelphia has used so effectively in short-yardage situations over the last few years. The measure was supported by 22 of the NFL’s 32 teams, two votes shy of the three-quarters majority needed for passage.The Packers actually executed the first quarterback sneak of the game, and Love didn’t need a push to convert a fourth-and-one on the game’s opening series. During their first drive, Philadelphia answered with a tush push that gave Hurts a three-yard gain on third-and-one from the Eagles’ 18-yard line.There weren’t many other successful plays by either offense for much of the night.This was the first NFL game to be scoreless at halftime since December 2023, when both the Minnesota Vikings’ 3-0 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders and the New York Jets’ 30-6 triumph over the Houston Texans had no first-half points. Philadelphia finally broke through when Jake Elliott’s 39-yard field goal capped the Eagles’ opening series of the second half.Each quarterback fumbled away his team’s best first-half scoring opportunity.Green Bay’s Edgerrin Cooper knocked the ball away from Hurts at the end of an 11-yard run that would have put the Eagles inside Green Bay’s 15-yard line on Philadelphia’s opening series. Keisean Nixon recovered the fumble and returned it 22 yards.The Packers had second-and-10 at Philadelphia’s 27 in the final minute of the second quarter when Love lost the ball while getting sacked by Nakobe Dean. The fumble was recovered by Jaelan Phillips, who was making his Eagles debut after coming over from Miami at the trade deadline last week.Explore more on these topicsNFLPhiladelphia EaglesGreen Bay PackersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the hairstyle, the low socks, the sense of adventure about his midfield play. As Scott puts it, the club’s manager, Nigel Pearson, gave him “a lot of freedom to go out and almost do what I wanted”.It changed after he made his £25m move toBournemouthin the summer of 2023; there was a greater need for tactical discipline, for defensive responsibility. He became more of a No 8. So, less like an early years Jack Grealish, who is now on loan at Everton from Manchester City.But as Scott reflects on his excellent form across the early months of the season, which has led to him winning his first call-up to theEnglandsquad for the World Cup qualifiers against Serbia at Wembley on Thursday and Albania in Tirana three days later, there is one bit of the nickname that will never change; the part relating to Guernsey, where he is from, which goes deep into his DNA.Anthony Barry: ‘The England jersey should feel like a cape, not body armour’Read moreThe 22-year-old stands to become only the third Channel Islander to play for the England men’s team after Matt Le Tissier, another son of Guernsey, and Graeme Le Saux, who is from Jersey. There is also Scott’s stepsister, Maya Le Tissier (no relation to Matt), who has 10 caps for the England women’s side and was a part of the squad that won the European Championship in the summer. What binds them is what they like to call the islander mentality.“For me, it just means we are fearless,” Scott says. “I think when we get an opportunity … because they’re tough to come by back home, it’s tough to get to the mainland. I feel like we take them when they come around.”It talks to difficulties of a logistical nature. When Scott was on Southampton’s books between the ages of eight and 12, he would fly in from Guernsey every Friday with one of his parents for training and matches, staying in a hotel, returning on Sunday night. He often came over with Maya, who is now at Manchester United; in those days, she played for Hampshire.It also speaks to an ability to overcome setbacks and there have certainly been a few of those for Scott, most recently the injuries that scarred his first two seasons at Bournemouth. The biggest one was to his knee last October which ruled him out for four months.At least Scott had made it as a professional by then. When he was released by Southampton and later, before he turned 14, walked away from a year-long spell at the Bournemouth academy – he was not getting the game-time or enjoyment – it was difficult to see a future for him in football. “When I got released by Southampton, it was pretty upsetting,” he says. “It felt like I’d committed four years of my life to this and for it to be blown away … it was heartbreaking.”View image in fullscreenAlex Scott has established himself as a Premier League-level No 8 since joining Bournemouth from Bristol City in 2023.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersScott’s salvation was Guernsey, being back at home where he could live a more normal teenage life with his family and friends. He played for a local team and rekindled his love of the game. What was less normal was what he did at 16 – he played men’s football for Guernsey FC in the eighth-tier Isthmian League Division One South East, becoming the club’s youngest ever player. When he excelled over the first half of the season, Bristol City came calling, offering him a scholarship in January 2020.Scott says there were times when he could not see himself as a professional footballer and he was a little lost. “I went to college for half a year [while he played for Guernsey], doing a sport course,” he says. “I didn’t know what else to do. I failed PE at school. I wasn’t great at school. There was nothing on my mind that I really wanted to do.”As an aside, how does a future Premier League player fail GCSE PE? “The written coursework,” Scott replies. “I was no good at that. I passed English and maths, though, so that’s most important.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then, in this past summer, he starred alongside Elliot Anderson in midfield as the under‑21s retained their European title.View image in fullscreenAlex Scott is aiming to make an impact on England’s senior side after experiencing glory with the age-group teams.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesThomas Tuchel was so impressed by Anderson’s performance in the final against Germany that he called him up for the senior camp in September, believing he could be the solution in the No 6 role. Anderson has since started in every England game. Scott is in the squad as a No 8 and it will plainly be difficult to dislodge Declan Rice. His focus is purely on showing what he can do: being brave, which comes as standard, and continuing to make people proud, including Maya, who has been on the journey with him.“My dad is with her mum,” Scott says. “We’ve grown up together and we’re very close. We speak most days. I couldn’t be prouder of her. She can help me out with advice. It’s nice to have someone around who has experienced it and been around the Lionesses and England, in general.”Scott has another connection to the women’s game via his namesake, the female Alex Scott, who has just been named as an I’m A Celebrity contestant and is one of England’s most-capped players. “I saw something the other day that said I’d done well getting called up and going on I’m A Celebrity at the same time,” he says with a smile. Scott is all business about seizing his moment.Explore more on these topicsEnglandBournemouthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two goals from Catarina Macario, a finish from Wieke Kaptein, a double for Sam Kerr on her return to the starting lineup and an unfortunate Lisa Ebert own goal moved them up to second at the halfway stage of the league phase.It was the perfect night for Kerr who was making her first start for the Blues in 692 days. It has been a long road back for the Australian but with goals in the WSL and now the Champions League, she is starting to gain momentum as she builds up minutes and confidence. There was also a welcome back to the lineup for Naomi Girma, who missed the start of the season with a hamstring problem, while Lauren James got a 15-minute cameo as she made her return from the ankle injury she picked up in the Euro 2025 final.Reid setback for Arsenal highlights mounting concern over ACL injuriesRead more“It’s really positive especially when coming to a time where it’s really busy,” Sonia Bompastor said. “We are going to play every three days with big games coming, so it’s important to have the depth and the quality.”It was the kind of free-scoring performance Bompastor has been waiting for this season. Despite their unbeaten run in all competitions, Chelsea have struggled to put games to bed. Their manager had told them to avoid “overthinking” before this encounter in which they were heavy favourites. It worked – the visitors created 43 chances, with 19 on target and had 75 touches in the opposition box.“We were able to apply the gameplan,” the manager said. “We created a lot and we got some great goals. It’s always good for the individual and team confidence to be able to do that.”The disparity between the two sides was evident. While both have dominated their domestic leagues in recent years, the difference in resources, investment and experience is stark.Quick GuideWCL roundup: Weir rescues Real Madrid while Lyon stay perfectShowThe Scotland forward Caroline Weir scored a dramatic late equaliser asReal Madriddrew 1-1 withParis FCin the Women's Champions League.The Spanish side were heading for their first defeat in the competition this season after Lorena Azzaro's 41st-minute penalty gave the visitors the lead.

Sitting second behind Austria Wien domestically, they have had a baptism of fire in the league phase, falling to heavy defeats at the hands of Atlético Madrid and OL Lyonnes. A change at the helm followed with 47-year-old Laurent Fassotte replacing Lisa Alzner at the end of October.Despite their inconsistent form, St Pölten were welcomed on to the pitch by a drumroll of their vociferous fans who never stopped singing in spite of Chelsea’s dominance.Bompastor had called for patience from her players as they faced an organised defensive block but their superiority in all areas eventually paid off. Chelsea were particularly dangerous down the right. It was from this area that the breakthrough came as Ellie Carpenter sent a low ball across goal for Kaptein to turn home.View image in fullscreenWieke Kaptein receives the adulation of her teammates after opening the scoring for Chelsea.Photograph: Christian Bruna/Getty ImagesThe visitors continued their pressure but were made to work for their second goal. Kerr somehow could not prod the ball over the line while Girma had a comical finish disallowed for offside.They eventually got their reward just before the break when Johanna Rytting Kaneryd turned over possession and found Macario in the box. The American placed a low shot past the impressive Carina Schlüter into the far corner to double the score.Quick GuideSkinner defends Earps before Manchester United returnShowMarc Skinner will welcome the return of “good person” Mary Earps to Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday. United’s women play at Old Trafford in the competition for the first time but there will be a spotlight on Paris Saint‑Germain’s goalkeeper after her criticism of the England manager, Sarina Wiegman, and Earps’s successor as the Lionesses’ No 1, Hannah Hampton, in her autobiography.Skinner, who managed Earps at United for three years, said: “Me and Mary have always had a good relationship. So I’ll say nothing but good things. I’ve not read the book. I don’t know anything about it – I’m hearing snippets, of course. I’m always one of those [who thinks] you have to be careful what you say but Mary believes in it. So that’s her truth, she has to speak it.“From our perspective, we’ll welcome her as somebody on the opponents’ team in this game. But also always pay tribute to what she has done when she was at Manchester United. I know Mary’s a good person, so I look forward to the challenge of trying to beat her and her team on Wednesday.”Earps also writes in the book about her decision to leave United last summer at the end of her contract, citing a lack of urgency from Skinner and the club to tie her to a new deal. Skinner said: “There are moments where she might speak about the urgency, but also the club will have their own view and opinion on that.“I wasn’t in those conversations. She can tell me how she feels in that instance. I will feed back to my superiors who make that conversation, but it didn’t happen in that moment. She didn’t sign a contract and we move on.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.St Pölten had registered their first shot on target just before the break when Carina Brunold tested Livia Peng from distance and the hosts became more adventurous as they looked to push out and relieve the constant pressure on their defence. Sarah Gutmann got on the end of their best move of the game, making a strong run into the box, but she was ultimately unable to find an end product.Chelsea, however, were ruthless and extended their lead a minute later. When Alyssa Thompson was felled by Izabela Krizaj in the box, Macario stepped up to confidently convert from the spot. Thompson then had an effort ruled out for offside. Both coaches rang the changes but it did little to disrupt the visitors’ flow with Kerr and Sjoeke Nüsken both coming close.The icing on the cake came for the visitors when Kerr finally got her goal before they welcomed James on to the pitch for the first time this season. The England international was instrumental in their fifth with the unfortunate Ebert turning her delivery into her own net, before Kerr struck again from close range. It was a victory that set Chelsea up perfectly before the visit of Barcelona to Stamford Bridge next week.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenSt PöltenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

With her age, how mature she has been, how she’s been in the group and how she has grown every single day, it is very disappointing for her. It’s very hard. She’s been with us in the last couple of days and surgery is planned. She will move forward from there. She said she will use this time to grow as a footballer, which says everything about Katie.”Reid is the third Arsenal player to be sidelined with the long‑term knee injury this season. The goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger ruptured her ACL in training between Arsenal’s opening Champions League fixtures against Lyon and Benfica last month, and on 30 October it was announced that the forward Michelle Agyemang, who was on loan at Brighton, had sustained the brutal knee injury, having been taken off on a stretcherduring England’s 3-0 defeatof Australia in Derby.The prevalence of ACL injuries in women’s football is not new and is far from being an Arsenal problem. Liverpool similarly have three out with ACL injuries, Marie Höbinger and Sophie Román Haug both sustaining ACL injuries in October, joining the 18-year-old midfielder Zara Shaw who sustained the same injury in April. Chelsea (Kadeisha Buchanan and Brooke Aspin), Everton (Megan Finnigan and Aurora Galli), Manchester City (Mary Fowler and Mayzee Davies) and Tottenham (Ella Morris and Maite Oroz) all have two out apiece. Brighton have lost Agyemang, who has returned to her parent club Arsenal for treatment and rehab, but are also without Manuela Vanegas. Aston Villa’s Jill Baijings joined the ACL club at the end of September.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang faces a lengthy spell out after her knee injury during England’s match against Australia.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersIt would be wrong to sound fresh alarm bells or talk of an epidemic of ACL injuries in women’s football. The reality is that women’s football has been blighted by ACL issues for a long time. Arsenal’s opponents on Wednesday, Bayern Munich, are no strangers to just how devastating the injury can be, with the Germany midfielder Lena Oberdorf sustaining her second ACL injury on 20 October, having made just eight appearances following her return from her previous ACL injury two months before. Oberdorf’s tear came one month after fellow midfielder Sarah Zadrazil endured the same fate.“The starting point is about as much awareness as possible on how we can prevent these injuries and I think everyone agrees with that,” said Slegers, who called time on her own playing career after an ACL injury. “I know the club is prominent in these processes on a wider scale.“It’s hard because it’s one little moment and you’re out for nine to 12 months and it impacts a player’s career. We need to keep on doing research because the game is growing and changing so fast and we need to move with that change.”The goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar said: “Obviously the schedule gets busier, clubs and nations are asking more and more of us, and there’s probably somewhere a way of reducing the risk and I hope for everyone that we can find that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Walsh said that those “higher up do need to listen to what we’re saying as players” on the issue of overloading and underloading, with many feeling match scheduling does not take a holistic enough approach.On Wednesday night, Arsenal and Bayern will be weaker because of their absentees. For Arsenal, the loss of Reid and Zinsberger for the long term, added to their short-term losses, is placated by a squad depth that means a strong starting XI can still be fielded. The problem, though, is that with the number of games mounting and fewer options to rotate the risk of further injury only increases.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Look, we know Anthony Barry doesn’t like uscalling it the international break– and as Watson to Thomas Tuchel’s scrupulous, problem-solving Sherlock, we’re not about to argue with him. But actual football is thin on the ground, beyond Phil Neville’s Portland Timbers getting bounced out of the MLS Cup playoffs by San Diego. “It wasn’t about a system or tactic, it was the mentality,” crowed Neville after his team’s high line was pillaged in a 4-0 defeat. Beyond that, there are some lads in the park adjacent to Football Daily Towers doing keepy-uppies, but that’s about it. So instead, it’s time to speculate. With several managerial seats empty heading into the international break (sorry, Anthony), it’s time to fire up the Football Daily Analytics Machine and try to predict the future.We’ll start at Wolves, where Rob Edwardsis poised to take overin a very small step up from Middlesbrough, second in the Championship. Coincidentally, that’s where we predict Edwards’ Wolves will be in a year’s time. As for Boro, the FDAM foresees a fashionable throwback appointment – and with Gareth Southgate and Steve McClaren ignoring their calls, Bryan Robson is handed the interim gig. And yes, he’ll even reprise the suit and shorts combo for his unveiling. Where will they finish? Let’s say seventh. Meanwhile, with his love of pilsner and penchant for rescuing forlorn wolves, Ivan Pereira looks a good fit for Bundesliga strugglers Wolfsburg.Brendan Rodgers seems to be onpretty much every shortlistgoing but might just fancy a return to Swansea, where Alan Sheehan has just been rolled through the door marked Gwnah Un. A failed playoff push and mutterings about board investment await. Southampton have won two games under interim manager Tonda Eckert, but are still linked with former failures Russell Martin and Ivan Juric, both of whom havecrashed and burnedthrough high-profile jobs since leaving St Mary’s. Our trusty machine predicts that Southampton will go in a different direction, instead appointing Pompey legend Gary O’Neil, who will quickly be chased down the M27 by irate fans.With Juric’s recent luck, we might expect the Croatian to land next in Naples for when Antonio Conte next loses the plot. But what of Martin? Well, our data suggests that he mightrock up at Norwich City, because A: he played almost 300 games for them, and B: the nearby Norfolk Broads offer a wide range of boating, orienteering and other team-building exercises more galvanising than a half-time speech from Delia Smith. We’re backing Martin to lead the Canaries back to mid-table obscurity. Look, it’s either him or O’Neil.About the only shortlist po’ Gaz doesn’t seem to be on is Celtic’s, which is eclectic to say the least. Bodø/Glimt mastermind Kjetil Knutsen, Columbus Crew manager Wilfried Nancy (no, us neither) and former player Craig Bellamy are all on there, but unfortunately our algorithm will not accept a futurewhere Martin O’Neill– who has already delivered a heap of soundbites, rocked a retro trackie top and zoned out spectacularly at a presser – isn’t given the permanent job. With him at the helm, we’ll boldly predict that Celtic can pick up some silverware this season.We’d stop there but we don’t know how to turn off the machine, so here’s a peek into Plymouth Argyle’s future. After the Wayne Rooney saga, Argyleturned to Tom Cleverleythis summer, and he has led them to rock bottom of League One. With Cleverley running out of time and with Derek Adams back as director of football, we can see a third former Manchester United player coming to the rescue. After all, Neville will probably be available soon, and he looks good in dark green. Phew, we’ve come full circle. Turn it off at the plug! Let’s get out of here. Lads, fancy a game of headers and volleys? Lads? Lads?!LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Yara El-Shaboury at 8pm GMT for updates on St Pölten 0-2 Chelsea in Women’s Bigger Cup.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Soon for me means in 10 years … no, I’m joking. I’m really enjoying the moment right now. As you know, in football, when you reach [78], you count the months very quick. I feel very good in this moment. I score goals, I still feel quick and sharp. I’m enjoying my game in the national team. But of course, let’s be honest. What I mean by soon is probably one or two years” – an aging stalwart of the game trying and failing to inject humour into a dull international fortnight?

It was probably the most remarkable match I have been to. Although the football on show was of dubious quality (mainly, but not only, due to the weather) there were some incredible Canadian scenes on display, including the home keeper helping clear the mounting snow with his own shovel (while probably apologising to the ground staff that his 18-yard box was so untidy). But I particularly enjoyed watching the home supporters in front of me making and stockpiling snowballs during play, and then unleashing their arsenal on to the away team gathered around the manager during breaks of play.

We need heads on the battlements. We need entrails, horses, chains, a public quartering. Basically we just need to feel something. We need, above all, to feel that this is all someone’s fault.This is how elite football must function now. The Dalai Lama once said that instead of looking to blame others we should look for answers within ourselves, which just goes to show how wrong you can be and is, frankly, very disappointing from the Dalai Lama.I’d rather Van Dijk’s goal stood, but it wasn’t a clear and obvious error to deny him | Chris FoyRead moreIt turns out medieval medicine was right. Human beings are indeed composed of four basic humours: bile, fire, earth and being incredibly angry on the radio, energies that must be constantly fed.There is a central irony here. Rage and snark have become football’s defining energy. There is simply too much space out there, too many content channels, but not enough actual sport to fill them. So perceived injustice, the divvying up of fault, fraud-dom, bald fraud‑dom have become the game around the game.But at the same time there is less to actually blame people for. Success and failure have become structural. Big clubs really are too big to fail in any meaningful sense. Managers no longer run teams like autocrats, surrounded by directors, assistants, data wonks. There is simply less space to actually make terrible mistakes on an individual basis, the kind of clear-as-day mistake that really does throw an entire team out of whack.Quick GuideNagelsmann blames Wirtz's slow start on Liverpool's formShowJulian Nagelsmann, the Germany head coach, has defended Florian Wirtz after criticism of his slow start to life at Liverpool, pinning some of the blame on the team's poor form and finishing.Wirtz, a £100m summer signing from Bayer Leverkusen, is yet to register a goal or assist in the Premier League – though he has created 16 chances – while Arne Slot's side have struggled to sustain their title defence. The attacking midfielder started as Liverpool slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday, a result which left them eighth in the table.Nagelsmann has called for patience with the Germany international, however. \"To be honest, the overall situation doesn't make it easy for Flo,\" he said. \"The whole club isn't as stable this year as it was last year. It's much harder to slip into the team now.\"If you look at the game against City, they were actually the worse team over the 90 minutes. So it's also difficult for Flo to make a big impact. Ultimately, the overall situation is such that he just needs a little more time, which is normal. You see that with other players who move to the Premier League too.\"Nagelsmann added: \"We all know what he's capable of and it's perfectly normal for a player of his age to go through a bit of a dip in form. We can't expect him to perform at the same level for three years straight.\"Instead, we all need to support him a little bit so that he can clear his head here, and then maybe Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates. That would be one idea, because ... they somehow don't like to shoot the ball in, that's also part of the truth.\"Wirtz is part of Nagelsmann's squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia. Victories in both matches will secure Germany's place at the 2026 World Cup finals.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At which point, enter Arne Slot, who is out there making at least one very obvious, big‑ticket managerial mistake. Why is Slot playingMohamed Salahin every game? Why is Slot continuing to do this even when the evidence is clear that this is a mistake? One that can still be fixed, but which becomes more deeply compounded with every passing week.It makes little sense in the abstract. Slot is a title-winning manager, a details-obsessive, super-smart no-bullshit merchant. Crucially, he possesses a pair of eyes. And it has been obvious for the last two months thatLiverpoolare suffering with Salah in the team, most notably against stronger opponents.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah had one chance against Manchester City which he sent wide of the post.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockSince their last trip to the Etihad Stadium in February,when Salah was brilliantly decisive, Liverpool have played 11 games against City, Newcastle, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, losing seven of them. Salah has played in all of these, contributed zero goals and performed most of the time like a Salah-shaped void, a ghost at the edge of things.A wretched afternoon at the Etihad Stadium was confirmation of two key points. First, Salah’s own performance is well below the required level. And second his weaknesses speak directly to the problems in the team around him.Most obvious is the lack of physicality. Liverpool have gone from being more intense than their opponents, from intensity as a baseline and non-negotiable, to fielding three very small men in Salah, Florian Wirtz and the current version of Alexis Mac Allister. They are a team that is always struggling to exist in the same space as more powerful opponents.In the opening minutesagainst Citythere was the spectacle of Wirtz chasing Jérémy Doku down City’s left flank, grabbing and grappling at his back while Doku seemed vaguely aware of being tapped on the shoulder. Moments later Nico O’Reilly, a really good modern Premier League power player, could be seen cuffing Salah out of his lane like a man swatting away a cloud of midges.This spreads to other parts of the team. Pep Guardiola was coy about Conor Bradley after the game, talking up what a wonderful full-back Bradley has become (which is true) but also making sure everyone present noticed what City had done to him, which was to constantly double up, knowing in advance that Salah simply won’t offer any cover, that his flank is always open.So Bradley, one of Liverpool’s better players, is transformed into a point of weakness by the failings of the superstar in front of him. So Ibrahima Konaté is also drawn out to the right away from the tight spaces that suit his game, all the better to perform like a man with his legs on the wrong way round. And so the midfield pivot is pulled apart, always asked to cover slightly too much space.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wirtz is being asked to adapt to the world’s most brutal league in a team already balancing the presence of one non-contact creative princeling. Alexander Isak, already under pressure after a summer spent acting as a footballing Helen of Troy, must now fix this team rather than adding a final gloss.It is important to note that none of this really Salah’s fault. He is not doing anything different. He has never been a defensive player, something that didn’t matter when he was flanked by a furiously hungry three-man midfield. He is also right to be aware of his own worth as one of the most thrillingly productive goalscorers the league has seen. But then, he’s also 33 years old, quite small, and a veteran of more than 700 career games. What was everyone expecting to happen here?After hundreds of millions spent on players, what was Liverpool’s plan?Read morePerhaps we should blame Liverpool’s executive for offering Salah that new contract at a time when it was clear the team would have to be fundamentally rebuilt. Liverpool’s entire ownership mantra is to make clear commercial choices, to be smarter than its bloated fellow juggernauts. Retaining a massive-money 33-year-old seems counterintuitive. Are we looking at another Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang here, a more chiselled Phil Jones?But the contract did make sense on basic numbers at the time. When he signed in April, Salah was averaging 1.4 goal involvements per game, an astonishing level of productivity. The total cost of two more years of this is £36m, the kind of sum you might throw at a half-forgotten full‑back. There have been suggestions a deeper data dive could have predicted the drop-off this season. But still. Give us half of this. We can make it work.Slot has made this into a major problem by refusing to drop his star player, hobbling his own rebuild in the process. It is a mistake so obvious, so clear in its outlines, that it is tempting to cast around for some deeper motivation. We know that informal chats take place, that star players will demand guarantees on selection. Does Slot’s own status come into this, a power imbalance between generational star player and affable Dutch single‑season wonder?Salah was re-unveiled on a wave of emotion. This was all vibes energy, goodwill. How involved was Slot in the process? And who had final oversight of the top‑heavy spree that has left Liverpool not just with too many attackers, but with the wrong attackers, two centre-forwards and a surfeit of lightweight creatives? It never felt coherent, or like the work of single voice, more a case of team building by committee. It certainly doesn’t feel very Slot.The international break presents an opportunity to find solutions. Salah will be off to the Africa Cup of Nations before long. The current XI is clearly unbalanced, in hock to the past, but also making an enemy of its future. There is still time to show some teeth and pick a team solely on merit and future needs. But that time is definitely now.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahArne SlotcommentShareReuse this content"

There’s always going to be a certain group of people that will always try to bring that forward.”Djokovic said he believed that Sinner, a regular practice partner, “didn’t do it on purpose”, but he went on to question how the Italian managed to serve his time without missing a grand slam.“There is the lack of transparency, the inconsistency, the convenience [of] the ban coming between the slams, so he doesn’t miss out the others – it’s just it was very, very odd,” added Djokovic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The All Blacks are unbeaten in five Twickenham games, a run dating back to 2012. Borthwick’s team are marginal favourites with the bookmakers, however, after a run of nine successive wins but the head coach has laid bare the depths his players will have to reach to achieve victory.“There is no doubt here that this week, playing against New Zealand, this team is going to have to dig very, very deep,” Borthwick said.“This team is going to have to go to a place where there is pain and suffering. There is going to be this need to keep running, a need for this to be the most selfless team performance England have produced, because that’s how good New Zealand are.“The players are going to have to give absolutely everything of themselves and I think you see a team that plays more and more with their heart and you see just how hard the team runs.”Ford’s return at fly-half comes after he sat outthe victory against Fiji last weekend, with Fin Smith dropping out of the matchday squad. The 32-year-old Ford endured a torrid timein the 24‑22 defeatlast year, missing two late kicks at goal, but has been in fine form for Sale this season after celebrating his 100th international cap on the summer tour of Argentina.Borthwick said of Ford: “He’s a phenomenal player. I’ve gone on record as well saying that many years from now he’s going to be a brilliant coach. He’s the kind of character and has such a great understanding of the game, I would not be in any way surprised to say he’d be England coach at some point in the future. I think he will be, if that’s where he chooses to go. So having a player and a person of that kind of understanding, calmness, leadership is phenomenal.”In total Borthwick has made seven changes to the side that defeated Fiji 38-18 with Maro Itoje returning as captain. Ollie Chessum and Tommy Freeman have been ruled out with foot and hamstring injuries respectively – Borthwick confirming that the latter will miss the rest of England’s November campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sam Underhill, Fin Baxter and Jamie George also come into the side. On Monday the All Blacks head coach, Scott Robertson, predicted a kick-heavy gameplan from England but Borthwick countered, insisting New Zealand will waste little opportunity to go to the skies.“What’s been really clear is that New Zealand, when they have played against England in the last three games, have kicked the ball a lot,” Borthwick said. “Every game it has spiked how much they have kicked. Last year at Twickenham, they came and the first thing they did is go, ‘right we are kicking this ball’.“I’d be interested to see very early on if they are going to go with this strategy, maybe they will pick Beauden Barrett and Damian McKenzie in the team together this weekend and come with that plan. Going back to the nature of Test rugby, it is that tactical element of it and it will be interesting to see if that’s what Scott Robertson has asked his team to do.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickNew Zealand rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday Botham, who has said previously that England’s schedule “borders on arrogance”,returned to the subject. “It’s not the way I would prepare,” he said. “Historically you have to acclimatise when you come down here. You’ve got to remember there’s 24.5 million people you’re playing against.”Other notable voices to have spoken on the issue includeSir Geoffrey Boycott, who has called it “madness”, saying that “if they win in Australia it will be in spite of their lack of match practice, not because of it”;Michael Vaughan, who called it “a huge risk, a risky tactic”; and theformer Australia opener Simon Katich, who said it was “asking for trouble” and that “very few teams have come to these shores and prepared the way England have, and had success”.Trescothick said he “respects their opinions” but that alternative solutions are no longer feasible. “All I will say is times have dramatically changed in the way that cricket is done,” he said.“What we are doing for this series isn’t anything different from when we went to New Zealand, Pakistan or anywhere else. It isn’t any different from when India come to England, or when Australia come to England.“People are talking about it and I obviously respect their opinions, but with the volume of cricket that is now played around the world and the volume of white-ball into red-ball cricket, the opportunities are not there.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes leaves the nets in Lilac Hill Park, where England will play their sole warm-up game starting on Thursday.Photograph: Richard Wainwright/EPA“The intensity of playing five Test matches, if we were to go and play two or three warm-up matches on top of that, having done it myself in the past, it is very, very tricky, when you get to the back end of a series, to still be as mentally fresh as you need to be. It is what it is. If you look at the situation around the world, everyone does the same nowadays. You turn up, play a game and into the series you go.”Before the last Ashes series, in England in 2023, Australia’s only warm-up game was the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval, a scheduleAllan Border describedas “fraught with danger”; they won the WTC final and retained the Ashes, after the series was drawn 2-2. Before India started their series against England last summer they played the Lions twice, which was also how the England side prepared for their last away Ashes series, in 2021-22.“We’re very happy with the preparations,” Trescothick said. “We’re coming here with a team that have stuck together for a long period of time, it’s been very consistent. We’ve been playing good cricket in our Test stuff and it’s been pretty consistent for a number of years. So we’re pretty confident in our own team and what we have to throw at Australia.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The story caused controversy at the time of the book’s publication, being interpreted by some as an admission of ball-tampering.“I think those days have sort of changed,” Trescothick said with a laugh. “Ashes cricket is great fun, isn’t it?

But is his legacy rotten?Lee EscobedoThe businessman shaped Dallas into an NBA force after years in the wilderness. But problems with the team only worsened when he sold upTue 11 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 15.21 ESTShareThe year 2000 cracked open like a glow stick, flooding Dallas with new money – and a new Mavericks owner, who had made his money selling his streaming site just before the dot-com crash. Like the 1990s Mavs, Mark Cuban wasn’t polished – and he sure as hell wasn’t subtle. He was brash and argumentative, clashed with refs, and clapped too hard whenever Dirk Nowitzki buried a three. The internet age, in the form of Cuban, crashed courtside when he bought the team for $285m. Gone was the era of distant owners watching occasional games from the executive boxes: the fan was in control of the team now. Cuban had hacked reality.Cuban’s thesis was simple: never play by their rules. The Mavs were his start-up. He improved nutrition, upgraded hotels for road games, bought a team plane, filled lockers with PlayStations, and fought the NBA’s lawyers with the defiance of a rapper clapping off hundos in a strip club. This went against the NBA’s old boys’ club. For all his dot-com cache, Cuban was punk in practice.His first order of business? Signing 38-year-oldDennis Rodman, of course. As a trickster, Cuban understood spectacle. Those early years were about making the Mavs culturally relevant. The team made the playoffs in their first full year under Cuban. He was what has become routine for sports owners in the new millennium: a tech billionaire.A quarter century later, the glow has dimmed. Cuban sold his majority ownership stake for $3.5bn to a figure less a dreamer than a ruthless businesswoman:Miriam Adelson. Since then, as a minority owner, he has little to do with the day-to-day running of the team, and has been sidelined by the general manager he once hired, Nico Harrison (on Tuesday,the Mavs fired Harrison).Josh Giddey might be the anti-Jordan – but the Australian is finally winning over Chicago | Jack SnapeRead moreWithout the Mavericks to occupy him, Cuban has drifted on to a media tour. He’s defended everything from the GM who now calls the shots he once made,Harrison, toClippers owner Steve Ballmer’s“no-show” job controversy. The one thing he doesn’t seem to want to talk about isthe Luka Dončić trade, a move that still haunts much of the Mavericks fanbase. Cuban seems unmoored, clinging to the NBA spotlight like a man afraid the lights will dim. As Mavs owner, relevance was automatic – his mouth and moxie did the work. At the same time, his former team is off to a horrendous start under the dim-witted supervision of new ownership and his former general manager. The Mavericks are near the bottom of the NBA standings, and calls to “Fire Nico” have ramped back up. Many fans hold Cuban responsible for hand-picking Harrison and selling the team to the bad guys.Cuban turned a $285m gamble on the Mavericks into $3.5bn. But how will that windfall be read in the history books? Will it be as the mark of a visionary, or just another fortune sucked from American sports? To judge Cuban’s ownership tenure, sometimes the simplest paradigms are the most revealing.The goodThe time that Cuban hopes will define him, that will live as long as there’s a roof on the American Airlines Center, is 2011. Dirk’s run, the one that rocked Miami’s “Heatles” dynasty before it even began.A title, finally. That banner is proof that his mania could be distilled into a championship.But championships don’t happen in a vacuum. Cuban could have fired general manager Donnie Nelson after the Mavs lost in the 2006 NBA finals. But he knew that Nelson’s eye for foreign talent had already brought in Nowitzki – and one day it would bring in Dončić too. Nelson’s vision set up an international pipeline others envied and ripped off. Cuban was smart with players as well as executives though, and looked out for them when they needed it the most. Delonte West was a Mav for just one season, but Cuban made multiple overtures to help him kick drugs and get back on his feet. Sadly,Cuban couldn’t save West. Nor could West save himself.At the zenith of Cuban’s Mavericks reign, there was a rare sense of balance. He hired excellent coaches: Don Nelson brought a lust for life, Avery Johnson brought defense, and Dirk’s post game. Rick Carlisle brought tactical nous that fueled the team’s title run. Jason Kidd harnessed the Dončić-inspired finals run in 2024. Carlisle, in particular, was everything Cuban wasn’t – quiet and methodical. Together, they engendered the environment Dirk needed to become championship myth.More than any roster move, though, Cuban gave Dallas basketball relevance. Starting in 2000-01, they reached the playoffs in 15 out of 16 seasons. Their slogan,MFFL, wasn’t corporate branding but an identity built in South Dallas and Oak Cliff. The 1990s Mavs were godawful. That Cuban yanked them out of the gutter and turned them into championship contenders is to his immense credit.View image in fullscreenMark Cuban in 2000, his first year as owner of the Mavericks. He often came across as more of a fan than an owner.Photograph: Huy Nguyen/Associated PressThe badBut Cuban’s greatness also led to his own undoing. The same gambler’s instinct that made him a billionaire had him looking once or twice like a slapped ass. Letting Steve Nash walk in 2004 was the first great sin. Cuban didn’t want to pay an aging point guard with a bad back. Phoenix did, and Nash turned into a two-time MVP who reinvented basketball alongside Mike D’Antoni at the Suns. Dallas got nothing back but regret.It happened again with Jalen Brunson in 2022. A homegrown guard, Dončić’s natural backcourt partner, was lowballed and let go. The Knicks pounced, andBrunson turned into a starDallas desperately needed. Different decade, same error by Cuban.Hiring Harrison, a Nike executive, as general manager in 2021 sounded radical in press releases but he brought no real front office chops. Harrison made some smart plays by signing Kyrie Irving and Dereck Lively, but also pushed Cuban out as soon as he sold his majority ownership stake. The championship drought in the Dončić era has Harrison’s fingerprints all over it. Shipping off the Slovenian superstar made Harrison persona non grata in Dallas – the ultimate sellout move,a middle finger to the cityand the fans.Then there were Cuban’s free-agency calamities. Tyson Chandler, defensive heart of the 2011 team, walked out the door because Cuban wanted cap flexibility. Michael Finley, Cuban’s initial Mavericks captain, was waived via amnesty and won a ring with San Antonio. Kristaps Porziņģis was supposed to be Dončić’s running mate; instead, he was a salary dump, injuries included, costing Dallas two first-round picks. And the crown jewel of misfires: leaving Nowitzki to spend his twilight surrounded by entropy and one-year rentals, all because Cuban chased free-agents who never signed.The uglyCuban had a penchant for wasting draft picks on foreign-born busts, coupled with a lack of Black players. There’s no suggestion that was due to prejudice on Cuban’s part, but it was often an odd look in a league where more than two-thirds of players are Black.Cuban’s last act was to sell his majority stake to Adelson, the heir to casino billions anda sharp political operator. The difference is glaring: Cuban was a diehard fan who lived and died with every win and loss, who cared as much about the Mavs as the people in the cheap seats. Adelson, by contrast, appears to value political influence over basketball. The Mavs are just another part of an empire that includes the Las Vegas Sands casino business, the Adelson Family Foundation charity and a close relationship with Donald Trump. In the Mavs’ case,some seeAdelson’s investment in the team as as a stepping stone towards legalizing gambling in Texas. Of all the people Cuban could have sold the team to, why did he have to cash out to someone who many fans see asa real-life supervillain?Then there’s the decay that festered during Cuban’s time as majority owner. In 2018, aSports Illustrated reportdetonated the illusion of Cuban as the benevolent disruptor. The Mavericks’ front office was allegedly a morass of harassment and misconduct. Cuban denied he knew of any misconduct but admitted he bore some responsibility. “I’m embarrassed, to be honest with you, that it happened under my ownership, and it needs to be fixed. Period. End of story,”he said at the time.There were other problems.Donnie Nelson sued the team, accusing Cuban of retaliation after he reported allegations of sexual misconduct by a Mavericks executive. Bob Voulgaris, the gambler Cuban dragged in off his Twitter feed, morphed into a shadow GM – angering Dončić andcurdling the team from the inside. While a Mav, Chandler Parsons,played recruiterin ways that blurred the line between player and executive, pushing Cuban toward flopped contracts. But nothing outweighs selling the team to Adelson. In the end, Cuban’s basketball rebellion ended with a handshake deal with the establishment class he once mocked and swore to subvert.Explore more on these topicsDallas MavericksNBABasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Barcelona, where my diet has transformed at least half my body into ham.Who will dominate the autonomous vehicles market?We are on the verge of the global arrival of self-driving cars. Next year, major firms from both the US andChinawill deploy their robotaxis to metropolises around the world, in major expansions of their existing operations. These companies are posturing in the press like male birds fighting for the same mate; the dance sets the stage for the global competition to come.On the US side, there’s Waymo, Google’s driverless venture. The company has invested billions of dollars in Waymo in the past 15 years. The company opened its robotaxi service to the public in June 2024 in San Francisco after years of testing and has been rolling it out steadily since. Now, vehicles are very visible in most of Los Angeles, and they are going to Washington DC, New York City and London next year.On 2 November, the Chinese internet search giant Baidu issued a challenge to Google. Baidu announced that its autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Apollo Go, regularly conducts the same number of rides as Waymo: 250,000 each week.Waymoreached the milestone in the spring.The majority of Chinese electric vehicles, even without self-driving software, cost a fraction of those made by US companies. Building each Waymo vehicle costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, expertsestimate, though the exact figure is not known. The CFO of Pony AI, a leader in autonomous vehicles in China, told the WSJ: “Our vehicle’s hardware cost is much, much lower than Waymo’s.”Google now needs to convince future customers that it is the higher-quality option to achieve a return on its billions of dollars of investment in Waymo.Google is using a discrepancy in transparency as a point of differentiation. There is far less publicly available data on Baidu’s cars, which raises questions about the trustworthiness of its safety record. Baidu itself claims its vehicles have suffered “not a single major accident” in their millions of miles of driving. Google pointed out in a statement tothe Wall Street Journalhow extensive its disclosure to US transportation authorities has been in a story about the success of Chinese self-driving companies.But Apollo Go, which has let its taxis loose in Dubai and Abu Dhabi as the Gulf statescourt tech deals of all stripes, isn’t Waymo’s only challenger. The wheels of WeRide, another Chinese autonomous vehicle company, have touched down in the United Arab Emirates and Singapore. All of the significant players in the Chinese market areexpanding in Europe, Reuters reports. Cars made by the firm Momenta and deployed by Uber are slated to start driving in Germany in 2026. WeRide, Baidu and Pony AI also have plans to begin robotaxi service in various European locales in the near future. Many more people are about to see self-driving cars in the course of their daily lives.After the first question of self-driving cars – can we make one that works? – the question now becomes: who will dominate the market?Read more:Driving competition: China’s carmakers in race to dominate Europe’s roadsThe week in AISam Altman’s bet: can OpenAI’s profits keep pace with industry’s soaring costs?‘It shows such a laziness’: why I refuse to date someone who uses ChatGPTWhat we lose when we surrender care to algorithmsEU could water down AI Act amid pressure from Trump and big techGoogle plans to put datacentres in space to meet demand for AIElon Musk’s faithful vote to make him $1tn richerView image in fullscreenMartin Rowson on Elon Musk’s new pay package.Illustration: Martin Rowson/The GuardianTesla is not doing well.

In interviews, he has said there is a “homeless industrial complex” of non-profits ruining California and complained that “it should be okay to have white pride”. On X, he proclaimed that the UK would fall into civil war and western civilization would collapse.The social and financial backlash to Musk’s politics has not quelled his public embrace of the farright, and in characteristically stubborn fashion, he has begun flaunting his affiliations more openly while suggesting that being labeled racist or extremist is now meaningless to him.Read more:How Tesla shareholders put Elon Musk on path to be world’s first trillionaireCan you defeat a datacenter?View image in fullscreenA Google datacenter in Santiago.Photograph: Rodrigo Arangua/AFP/Getty ImagesThe datacenters that power the artificial intelligence boom are beyondenormous.

Silicon Valley’s biggest firms are spending hundreds of billions as fast as they can.Despite the scale and momentum of the explosion of datacenters, resistance is mountingin the United States,in the United Kingdomand in Latin America, where datacenters have been built in some of the world’s driest areas.

Inductees describe clashes with organisers and a lack of support from the beginningAlyssa MercanteTue 11 Nov 2025 07.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 07.33 ESTShareVideo games have long struggled with diversification and inclusivity, so it was no surprise when the Game Awards host and producer Geoff Keighley announced the Future Class programme in 2020. Its purpose was to highlight a cohort of individuals working in video games as the “bright, bold and inclusive future” of the industry.Considering the widespread reach of the annual Keighley-led show, which saw an estimated 154m livestreams last year, Future Class felt like a genuine effort. Inductees were invited to attend the illustrious December ceremony, billed as “gaming’s Oscars”, featured on the official Game Awards website, and promised networking opportunities and career advancement advice. However, the programme reportedly struggled from the start. Over the last couple of years, support waned. Now, it appears the Game Awards Future Class has been wholly abandoned.This is the second year in a row Future Class has not announced a new cohort: there are usually 50 inductees across various games industry disciplines, including writing, development, journalism and community management.As reported by Game Developer, organiser Emily Weir confirmed they “are not planning a new Future Class for [2025] and do not have any active programming plans for Future Class”.Previous Future Class inductees say this comes after years of internal advocacy and struggles to improve the programme. With the video game industry wrestling with another culture war over diversity, equity, and inclusivity initiatives (DEI), some members of the Future Class feel they were used for positive publicity, then cast aside when DEI was no longer in vogue.View image in fullscreenThe 2024 ceremony of the Game awards.Photograph: Frank Micelotta/Picturegroup/Shutterstock“We were effectively props,” game producer Dianna Lora, who was inducted into the first Future Class in 2020, said over video call. “Once we got to the Game Awards (most people flew in from other countries, which was expensive), we showed up, and it felt like we were pushed to the side door … We found out later that Keighley had a party in another room with all the influencers and industry people. You know where Future Class met that day? At a Starbucks.”“No one from official leadership even showed up until the meet-up was basically over,” Future Class member and RetconGamescreative director Jes Negrón said of that Starbucks meeting. “We were pretty bummed about just being cast aside.”Elsewhere at that 2021 ceremony, Lora, community manager Natalie Checo, podcast host Kahlief Adams, and other Future Class inductees’ seats were behind one of the camera risers, completely obstructing their view.Future Class inductees receive programme perks for the next 12 months: a ticket to the Game Awards (alumni were given discounts to buy tickets), and access to career advancement opportunities. Several people referred to the early career-focused events as chats with high-profile industry members such as former Nintendo president Reggie Fils-Aimé and Xbox head Phil Spencer, rather than proper mentorship programmes.“It felt like Keighley just called a bunch of his friends to do Zoom calls,” Lora said. “It was inspiring to have these conversations, but that’s really as far as it went.”Lora was one of several Future Class members who urged Keighley and Weir to improve the programme.View image in fullscreenWriter Emma Kidwell attending the Game awards in 2022.Photograph: Scott Kirkland/PictureGroup for The Game Awards/Shutterstock“They fought for everything the 2023 class got: the Future class mixer, [them] putting us up in a hotel for two nights, covering the flight … everything that I got was a result of my previous classmates,” writer and 2023 inductee Emma Kidwell said of previous Future Class inductees. More recent inductees praised the mentorship opportunities.But 2023 also saw a high-profile clash between the Future Class and Keighley, which members believe accelerated the programme’s demise. In November, in the wake of increasing media coverage of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, more than 70 Future Class memberssigned an open letterrequesting a statement be read at the December ceremony expressing support for Palestine and calling for a ceasefire. Though it gainedmedia attentionand was posted in the Future Class’s Discord, of which both Keighley and Weir belong, the letter was ignored.Not long after, several Future Class members gave a virtual presentation to Keighley and Weir, acknowledging the importance of the programme while expressing concerns about its “goals, structure, and sustainability”. They offered suggestions for how to improve both the programme and the awards ceremony in general, such as featuring more female presenters, improved accessibility options, and an acknowledgment ofthe recent deluge of layoffs in the industry). Younès Rabii, a 2022 inductee, said that Keighley was visibly frustrated during the call, while another member said he was “incensed”.Keighley and Weir did not respond to a request for comment.Every Future Class member who spoke to the Guardian expressed varying levels of frustration with the programme and its untimely ending. “It’s sad that we were part of something great, that has amazing people, that was left by the wayside,” said accessibility consultant Steve Saylor. “I’m not mad, I’m disappointed.” Many believed the programme was disbanded because the inductees pushed for a better Future Class. “You have the influence, you have the power, and you can change sh*t,” Lora said, “But ever since [we pushed back] it was like, ‘This is too much trouble, might as well peace out’.” Checo added: “As a result of advocating for ourselves (the very thing that we were inducted for), we were punished for doing the same thing that they ostensibly celebrated us for.”View image in fullscreenGeoff Keighley also hosts the annual Summer Game Fest showcase.Photograph: Frank Micelotta/PictureGroup/ShutterstockA few members wondered about the sponsorships associated with the programme (a video highlighting a 2023 inductee was presented by Old Spice) and if they were just being “tokenised” to help the programme make more money. (Presenting aone-minute trailer at Keighley’s 2024 summer games showcasereportedly cost $250,000, and sources say the Game Awards is even more expensive.) “They didn’t mention us at the 2022 Game Awards, except for a huge sponsorship that they apparently got in the name of the Future Class, which none of us were told about, and certainly didn’t see any money from,” said Negrón.At some point, the Future Class page was removed from the Game Awards site, meaning there is no official archive of its members. “Not only are they discontinuing the programme, but they’ve also eliminated any way for us to claim the honour that they provided,” Checo said.“Marginalised people need accolades because it pushes them to at least be on the same starting level that you or I might have,” said Kidwell. “Now people can’t put that on their résumés.” Negrón was curious about the thought process behind it all, saying: “Don’t gather some of the most brilliant activists in the industry, treat us like crap, and then expect us to do nothing about it.”Many believe Future Class’s failure will serve as a cogent reminder that allyship without proper support is simply performative. And for some, not all is lost. Midnight Hour founder Elaine Gómez said the “camaraderie and community that was created by bringing nearly 200 developers and creatives from underrepresented communities together” was the best part of it all. Meanwhile, the official Future Class Discord is still going – and more active now than it has been in the last year or so.Explore more on these topicsGamesGaming awardsAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mr Infantino did not hold back in lauding the president’s peace-making prowess,commenting: “Now we can really write some new pages. Pages of togetherness, of peace, in a region which really, really needs it.”News that Fifa is to launch its own annual peace prize, with the inaugural award to take place in Washington next month, would therefore seem to point to only one outcome. To use a metaphor from another sport, it surely looks like a slam dunk for the man Fifa’s presidentdescribesas a “winner” and “close friend”. As Mr Infantinotoldan American business forum on the day he announced the prize: “We should all support what [Mr Trump is] doing because I think it’s looking good.”The rest of us can be excused for wishing that Mr Infantino was spending less time on inappropriate Maga networking and self-aggrandising stunts, and more on addressing criticism of how he is performing in his day job. Ahead of this summer’s men’s World Cup, the sports academic and Guardian US columnist Leander Schaerlaeckens has justlyaccusedFifa of being “fully focused on monetizing the sport, no matter the collateral damage”. Recently unveiled ticketing arrangements for the tournament, which will take place in the US, Canada and Mexico, more than bear that judgment out.Apeing the superlative-laden bombastic style of his new best friend in politics, Mr Infantino haspredicted“the biggest, best and most inclusive World Cup ever”. The first of those claims is literally true, since Fifa’s desire to maximise receipts has led it to increase the number of participating teams from 32 to an unwieldy 48. The second is unknowable until the games are played. The third – at least for fans actually wishing to attend some matches – is cobblers.Fifa’s decision to adopt dynamic pricing for tickets means that the price of a family day out at a game could run into thousands of dollars. Supposedly discounted tickets for group stage games are vanishingly thin on the ground, and the decision to remove a cap on resale value saw a $2,030 ticket for theWorld Cupfinal relisted the next day for $25,000. Fifa, naturally, takes a cut from sanctioned mark-ups.Under Mr Infantino, Fifa has become the eagerallyof super-rich sportswashing states such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, with the latter given a clear run at the 2034 World Cup. The relentless quest for new sources of income has also led to theoverloadingof the football calendar with the overblown Club World Cup. This summer promises to be a Trump-endorsed masterclass in monetisation, allowing the US market to let rip and accelerating the uber-gentrification of the world’s most popular sport.In September, New York’s Arsenal-supporting mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, launched a “Game over greed” petition,condemningthe ticketing strategy as an “affront to the game”. He also lamented the fact that – unlike at the last three World Cups – no tickets are being set aside for local residents. A noble intervention, but sadly a doomed one. Just like his idol in the White House, Mr Infantino only starts listening when money is doing the talking.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How convenient for foes of the most trusted news organisation in the worldTue 11 Nov 2025 11.05 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 14.10 ESTShareListen, I hate to ruin ayarn wallbut I don’t think it’s at all helpful to start framing the current crisis at the BBC as a giant conspiracy or coup by dark rightwing forces, and get stuck in the weeds of that. The fact is, the three mistakes that form the bulk of Michael Prescott’s explosive leaked memo about impartiality – the Panorama edit, issues with coverage of the transgender issue and bias in the BBC Arabic service – happened and are bad. Given their spectacular fallout and the highest-level scalps that have been claimed, the opportunity to now deal with them might as well be taken by what is, let’s not forget, the most trusted news organisation in the world.There is no news organisation in the United States that reaches more than 25% of people in a week. BBC News reaches74% of UK adults in a week. There is vastly more distrust of news brands in the US. We in Britain live in a country with a far less polarised news market than almost anywhere else, in a world where 70% of people don’t even have a free press. This is great, whatever you might be told by Nigel Farage – a political leader who’s gunning to be the next PM but still presents a nightly current affairs show on GB News like that isn’t a massive conflict of interest and we live in Russia or something. Thanks for dialling in, Mr Ethics!Alas, he won’t stop dialling in on this BBC story. You might recall that when supporters of Donald Trump’s total lie that the 2020 election had been stolen from him stormed the Capitol, Nigel offered asingle autofill-style tweetof condemnation. Imagine having a mere nine words to offer on violent scenes which called into question the peaceful transfer of power in American democracy, but at least 9,000 to offer, so far, on a bad documentary edit for which a telly producer and editor should have been promptly fired.But we are where we are, and the BBC is in a place where the US president is threatening to sue it for aDr Evil-esque$1bn. Not here, I don’t think, although British libel laws have long favoured claimants. The former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar won in our libel courts over match-fixing and bribery claims, despite there being a video of him regretting accidentallymaking a savein which he said: “I dived the wrong way and it fucking hit my hand. In the Man United game, do you know how much I lost? A hundred and twenty-five fucking thousand pounds in cash.” As I say, Grobbelaar won this case.But British libel law is based on the notion that someone’s reputation has suffered material harm. Were Trump to sue the BBC in our courts, the US president’s case against would presumably be based on the notion that he – a convicted felon found guilty on 34 counts offalsifying business recordsin a hush money case; a civil case loserfound to have sexually abuseda womanand been ordered to pay her $83m – had reputational damage done to him by the editing of a clip in a documentary that aired in another country, which no one noticed at the time, shortly before he won a landslide presidential election victory. Righto. Along with the fact that this only came to light just after the one-year UK libel limit had elapsed, you’d assume this is why Trump’s counselishinting at suing in Florida.0:42‘We should have acted earlier’: BBC chair Samir Shah on Trump documentary – videoThe Florida courts are a different kettle of fish. Florida is where Trump’s former friend Jeffrey Epstein got his plea deal so he could serve 13 months in an open prison then be free to sex traffic and abuse underage girls for another decade. Then again, Florida was also where Rudy Giuliani was ordered to pay $148m afterlosing a defamation actionto two Georgia election watchers. Then again, again, Trump on Tuesday pardoned Giuliani and other cronies for their effortsto subvert the 2020 election. What an endlessly intriguing legal system they do have over there.As for over here – Donald, youdon’t even go here– it’s genuinely nuts to hear politicians and commentators honking about how the next director general of the BBC has to be some cleanskin from the world of business. Sorry, what person from “business”? Wake up. In the old days, the second a DG had been defenestrated, you’d see lists of deeply keen runners and riders, heavily briefed by those throwing their hats in the ring. This morning the papers contain scant, half-hearted rundowns of potential candidates who in many cases everyone already knows wouldn’t want the job. People in the private sector don’t have to live in the eye of the firestorm, every day, and they get paid vast multiples more money. The only comparable level of flak in public life to running the BBC, outside of politics, is copped by tech bosses. Tech bosses get paid billions, effectively own their own companies and demonstrably could not give a toss when called out by politicians, because they are so, so much more powerful than them. Just over a year ago, Meta overlord Mark Zuckerberg declared that his previous willingness to apologise for errors was a “political miscalculation” and a “20-year mistake”. Yeah, maybe we should get someone from the “I’m done saying sorry” sector to run the BBC. Feels like a great fit. I’m sure they’d do it!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With these resignations, it has given in | Jane MartinsonRead moreAs for whoshoulddo it … I don’t pick the next director general – a baffling oversight – but if I did, I’d try to persuadeMark Thompsonback for a second, maybe enticingly time-limited stint in the role he has previously held, at an organisation whose strength and weaknesses he would be tough and clear-sighted about. Think of it as a one-last-job movie, Mr Thompson. The next DG is probably going to have to have significant news experience, given the circumstances of this current crisis, as well as a deep understanding of the BBC from both the inside and the outside, as Thompson certainly has from his time there, then as CEO of the New York Times and now CNN. Furthermore, Thompson has, bless him, now earnedAmerican levels of money, so might consider coming back to be one of the few hardmen left who could take on public service in these rapidly enshittifying times.But as I say, more and more high-calibre people are picking a quiet life over public service. And it’s harder every day to seem surprised. Be you a potential British politician or director general, why would you want to live under constant attack by bad-faith rivals who wish you out of existence? Why would you want your permanent coordinates to be in the eye of trouble? Why would you want to be subject to endless threats of violence on social media platforms whose proprietors explicitly couldn’t care less? Why would you not simply … do something else, for massively more money?This, not events at theBBC, is the much more widespread crisis in public life. The BBC just makes it more obvious because it’s the last place anyone still resigns from. You almost never see politicians doing it any more – they wait to be sacked, or butch out the most awful mistakes, and get away with it because there aren’t legions of better people to replace them. More and more, the nature of high-profile public service is repelling the best and the brightest. That is the great tragedy of our age – and the great opportunity for those who were never in it to serve the public in the first place.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBBCOpinionDonald TrumpTim DavieNigel FarageMark ThompsoncommentShareReuse this content"

The key to a healthier relationship was empathyTue 11 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareOne evening as I was using my key to let myself into my mother’s apartment for a visit, I glanced toward the kitchen table where she usually sat reading the newspaper and saw her rolling walker standing alone. Surprised, I said loudly: “Where are you, Mom?”“Here,” I heard her respond from her bedroom down the hall. “I’m fine.”On the floor next to her bed, I found her splayed out on her back. “Did you fall? Are you hurt?” I asked with rising panic.“I’m fine,” she repeated. “It’s comfortable here,” she said, running her hand lightly over the cut-pile carpet.My thoughts went in several directions. As a clinical psychologist specializing in working with older adults and their family caregivers for two decades, I’d heard many stories of seniors lying where they’d fallen for hours or even days before being found. Why hadn’t she used her walker to prevent her fall? She hated it, I knew, because it made her feel old, but a botched knee replacement surgery and bad arthritis had made her gait unsteady. Had she forgotten it in her kitchen because her thinking skills were declining, or decided to not use it when no one – ie, me – was watching?“How long have you been here?” I asked as I lifted her gently and guided her to a chair.It is the relationship between parent and child that determines whether their caregiving experience is hard but gratifying or full of conflict and regret“A little while,” she answered. I didn’t believe her.“Why didn’t you use the medical alert?” I asked, pointing to the button she had on a necklace around her neck which, when pushed, would connect her to an emergency service.She fingered the necklace but said nothing. Had she forgotten about it, too, I wondered, or had she decided not to use it out of embarrassment?Such concerns about an older adult are increasingly common in our ageing America. According to the2025 Caregiving in the US report, published in July by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, nearly half of this country’s 63 million family caregivers are caring for their ageing or disabled parents. Many of these adult children, the report makes clear, are overwhelmed by the number and nature of caregiving tasks, such as driving their parents to medical appointments, managing their bills, and even dressing, bathing and toileting them. Because many of these children cut back on their work hours to be available to provide care, they frequently develop financial problems. Many feel unsupported by friends, other family members and employers as they try to do the right thing for their parents.The report misses a key caregiving challenge, however. In my professional and personal experience, it is the relationship between parent and child that largely determines whether their caregiving experience is hard, but gratifying or full of conflict and regret. Too often during caregiving, that parent-child bond is severely stressed by pride, minimization and resistance.What happened between my mother and me exemplified this. She was deservedly proud – a poor Bronx girl and child of Polish-Jewish immigrants who was her high school valedictorian and a stellar student at City College of New York. She had worked hard as a teacher, had run a successful insurance brokerage and had led several community organizations. Throughout her adult life, she’d constructed a self-identity as a smart striver who overcame long odds to go far, including traveling extensively on five continents.But as she became frail and forgetful with age, her pride became a problem. She hated being in the position of needing help and accepted it only grudgingly, especially from me, her oldest son. I’d heard many caregiving clients over the years report that their “stubborn” parents were reluctant to allow them to assist them for fear of being a burden. My mother felt all this and more. It was as if the idea that I’d be her caregiver and she’d be my care receiver seemed to her an abhorrent reversal of the parent-child hierarchy.Cumulative social advantage: is this the secret to a long, happy, healthy life?Read moreShe protected her pride by using minimization, a close cousin of denial. It wasn’t that she refused to believe she had kidney disease from chronically high blood pressure or that a car accident years ago and physical wear-and-tear caused her marked back and knee pain, but she made light of their impact on her capabilities. In her mind, she didn’t really need her walker nor a commode atop her toilet nor a notebook to write things down to remember them. She could still manage to drive safely, she was convinced, despite my contention otherwise.Most of us use the psychological mechanism of minimization by choosing to believe that our faults are not so onerous and that we are better than we probably are. With older adults, however, minimization may also have roots in neurology. A common early symptom of dementia is“anosognosia”or an inability to appreciate one’s physical or cognitive deficits. The same chronically high blood pressure negatively affecting my mother’s kidneys was also slowly damaging her brain. It took years for her to be diagnosed with vascular dementia. That almost certainly amplified her tendency to minimize.Pride plus minimization leads to resistance. There was almost nothing I could recommend to my mother that she didn’t initially reject. She resisted my efforts to hire personal care aides or get home-delivered meals for her. She balked at my suggestion to economize to stretch her paltry savings. She was furious when I took control of organizing her pill box.Like most adult-child caregivers, I wanted to preserve my mother’s dignity while ensuring her safety. I took the same approach I’d counseled many caregiving clients of ageing parents. I tried to lead with empathy for the losses she was experiencing by recognizing that she was often in pain and telling her that I admired how she was still doing the best she could. I told her I wanted to be her ally, not adversary, in helping her live as she preferred to whatever degree possible and that I wanted to support her, not overrule her, with most of the decisions she made. When I did need to overrule her at times, telling her it was unsafe for her to drive or manage her medications on her own, I tried to be as gentle as I could, while also reassuring her that I would take her where she wanted to go and manage her medicines for her. If my mother fought back, however, it wasn’t always possible for me to be gentle; I insisted on changes I felt she needed.As my mother continued to decline over time, her pride was hurt further and she minimized less as her deficits became more glaring. In one year, she had multiple broken bones, three hospitalizations and long rehab stays following a series of falls, including being found down one evening by a stranger in the parking lot of her apartment building. However, she never stopped resisting me. I was the villain who had curbed her independence and lorded power over her. “You are not my boss,” she told me in anger dozens of times.Guiding my mum through hospital showed me true patient-centred care takes more than paperwork | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreI didn’t want to be her boss, I protested defensively. But the more I tried to explain the reasons for hiring the aides and getting the home-delivered meals, the more she resisted me. We were often at odds. I met her anger about being mistreated with my own anger about being miscast.The tension between us made caregiving much harder for me. I felt angry, then guilty about having felt anger, then angry again about having been made to feel guilty. I had more reflective moments, though, too. I’d think back to the time I found her on the carpet. Was she really unfazed about being down, I considered in hindsight, or was that just bravado? Was the look in her eye as I lifted her up one of disbelief that she had fallen or was she rightfully frightened that she’d fall again? If I could see her resentment toward me as fear at her growing helplessness, then I could respond to her with empathy and not my own resentment at her resistance. When I was empathic, she argued less and agreed to disagree about the care I would arrange for her. Things became a little calmer between us.Few of us adult children aspire to dominating our moms and dads. We want instead to be recognized by them and even thanked occasionally for acting responsibly. For that to happen, we need to think first about how their losses are impacting our relationships with them. We need to drive, feed and perhaps dress them but tend with great attention to their fears. We need to set aside anger and react less to become more aware and effective caregivers.Barry J Jacobs, Psy D, is a Philadelphia-area clinical psychologist and author or co-author of three self-help books for family caregivers, includingThe AARP Caregiver Answer BookExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionAgeingParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

Nvidia’s worth $5tn. Yet America’s poor are struggling to eatSteven GreenhouseWe may be in a golden age for the super-rich – but it doesn’t feel that way for the 42 million Americans who use SnapTue 11 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 14.10 ESTShareIt seems like an understatement to call this the New Gilded Age. Perhaps we should instead call it the Obscenely Over-the-Top Gilded Age, considering that Tesla shareholders just approved a $1tn pay package for Elon Muskand the market value of the chipmakerNvidia has rocketed above $5tn.Not only that, the 10 richest billionaires in the US saw their collective wealthsoar by $698bnover the past year, while Google’s former CEO,Eric Schmidt, reportedly paid $110mfor a 123-room mansion in Los Angeles to host events. And then there’s our billionaire president, who – when his family isn’traking in tens of millions of dollars through crypto– is obsessed with building a $300m, gilded-to-the-hilt ballroom, funded by fellow billionaires.While it no doubt feels like a golden age for Trump and the super-rich, it doesn’t feel that way for 42 million Americans who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food benefits. They just suffered through an alarming 10 days, with many saying they didn’t have enough money to feed their families because the Trump administrationmoved to haltSnap benefits for millions of Americans on 1 November.Trump told them in essence: Sorry, we don’t have the money to pay those benefits right now. That claim seems far-fetched considering that it costs the government$8bn a month to provide Snap benefits, while Trump had no problem finding$1.5tn to pay for big tax cutsfor America’s billionaires and millionaires in his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was beautiful for billionaires and millionaires, but not so much for everyone else.That this is a fabulous time for the wealthy and not so fabulous for most other Americans helps explain why Trump and the Republicans took a shellacking in this month’s elections. For millions of voters, one of the biggest concerns was affordability, the struggle that many face paying for housing, groceries and childcare. The New York City mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, made that his number one campaign issue, and his charismatic campaign helped make it a national issue – an issue that worked against Republicans because they control the White House and Congress.Voters also turned against Trump because he has failed to make good on one of his main campaign promises: to lower prices on day one. As president, Trump has hardly focused on reducing prices, while he’s focused largely on imposing tariffs on other countries – a move that’s raised prices for US consumers.Unfortunately, billionaire Trump seems way out of touch with the struggles of average Americans. Not only has heboasted about his new marble-and-gold bathroomand his planned Louis XIV-like ballroom, but he held a lavish, times-are-greatGreat Gatsby-inspired partyat Mar-a-Lago the day before his administration withheld Snap benefits for millions of Americans. If anyone needed a symbol of how out of touch Trump is, just look to thebikini-clad model dancingin a gigantic martini glass at the party’s entrance.“Trump was one of those that I was all for,” a West Virginia resident upset about the Snap cutofftold the New York Times Daily podcast. “But now, I feel likehe’s more about the money, and helping the rich, and not caring about the people that really do need help.”That’s a big reason Mamdani won. Far more than most politicians, Democratic or Republican, he comes across as “caring about the people that really do need help”. In this age of increased income inequality and $1tn pay packages, Mamdani wants to find money to help those who need help by increasing taxes on New York City’s billionaires and millionaires, many of whom have more money than they know what to do with. Nonetheless, some billionaires seemed to freak out because democratic socialist Mamdani was pushing an idea that American progressives and European social democrats have long pushed for: increasing taxes on the wealthy to help create a fairer society. Mamdani has called for a2%-a-year tax increase on those earning over $1m a yearto help make bus rides free and to make childcare universal and free (or at least far more affordable).Describing his philosophy, Mamdani said: “When we talk about my politics,I call myself a democratic socialistin many ways inspired by the words of Dr King from decades ago who said, ‘Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.” Mamdani was referring to a1961 speechby Martin Luther King Jr.Many of God’s children are hurting, and Mamdani made clear he cares about them.In his victory speech, he talked of “those so often forgotten by the politics of our city”: Trinidadian line cooks, Yemeni bodega owners, Senegalese taxi drivers, and Uzbek nurses.In last year’s campaign, Trump promised to battle for forgotten Americans, but he largely seems to have forgotten them. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act contained big cuts in Medicaid and Snap benefits – programs that millions of “forgotten Americans” rely on. Trump seemed to forget them once again during the government shutdown, when his administration said it couldn’t find money to finance Snap benefits even though the US Department of Agriculturehad previously said the money was there.Ever since the GOP got thumped on election day, Trump has focused more on affordability, mainly by lying about it (although he did get some pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices for weight-loss drugs).“We just lost an election,they said, based on affordability,” Trump said. “It’s a con job by the Democrats.”Even though inflation has increased since Trump returned to office, he said: “We are the onesthat have done great on affordability… Every price is down,”except beef. There, Trump was again untethered from the truth; in the 12 months before September 2025,coffee prices rose 18.9%, beef 14.7%, bananas 6.9% and sugar and sweets 6.7%.Some other prices, including gas and eggs, have declined somewhat. But Trump also boasted that energy costs had fallen, eventhough electricity prices jumped 10.5%during his first eight months back in office. Americans shouldn’t forget Trump’s campaign promise: “Under my administrationwe will be slashing energy and electricity prices by halfwithin 12 months, at a maximum 18 months.”Once again showing how truth-challenged he is, Trump boasted that the price of Walmart’s Thanksgiving dinner has declined by 25% from last year. But he failed to mention thatthis year’s Walmart dinner excludesmany important items from last year, among them sweet potatoes, pecan pie and muffin mix.No one should be fooled when Trump claims that prices are down and that he’s fighting hard for affordability. Nor should anyone be fooled when Trump says he’s fighting for forgotten Americans. (Trump seems to be fighting farharder for crypto billionaires.)It’s Mamdani, not Trump, who’s fighting for forgotten Americans, fighting for those struggling to make ends meet. According to the Census Bureau,40% of US adultssay they have difficulty making ends meet each month. If Trump and the Republicans were truly fighting for forgotten Americans, they would have quickly found the $8bn to continue Snap benefits during the shutdown. If Trump and the GOP truly cared about struggling Americans, they would have quickly backed the Democrats’ demand to extend Obamacare subsidies to 22 million people and prevent their premiums from soaring. In that way, Trump and the GOP would have prevented the shutdown. And if Trump and Republicans truly cared about struggling Americans, they would join Mamdani in trying to make childcare affordable for every family.If Democrats hope to win in 2026 and beyond, they should focus their message on two things: first, that they’re fighting day in and day out to make life more affordable for average Americans and that they’re eager to tax billionaires more to help make necessities like housing, healthcare and childcare more affordable. Second, that while they’re fighting for affordability, Trump is fighting for his tariffs, his gilded ballroom and sending troops into America’s cities – none of which does a thing to help the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskNvidiacommentShareReuse this content"

But is his legacy rotten?Lee EscobedoThe businessman shaped Dallas into an NBA force after years in the wilderness. But problems with the team only worsened when he sold upTue 11 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 15.21 ESTShareThe year 2000 cracked open like a glow stick, flooding Dallas with new money – and a new Mavericks owner, who had made his money selling his streaming site just before the dot-com crash. Like the 1990s Mavs, Mark Cuban wasn’t polished – and he sure as hell wasn’t subtle. He was brash and argumentative, clashed with refs, and clapped too hard whenever Dirk Nowitzki buried a three. The internet age, in the form of Cuban, crashed courtside when he bought the team for $285m. Gone was the era of distant owners watching occasional games from the executive boxes: the fan was in control of the team now. Cuban had hacked reality.Cuban’s thesis was simple: never play by their rules. The Mavs were his start-up. He improved nutrition, upgraded hotels for road games, bought a team plane, filled lockers with PlayStations, and fought the NBA’s lawyers with the defiance of a rapper clapping off hundos in a strip club. This went against the NBA’s old boys’ club. For all his dot-com cache, Cuban was punk in practice.His first order of business? Signing 38-year-oldDennis Rodman, of course. As a trickster, Cuban understood spectacle. Those early years were about making the Mavs culturally relevant. The team made the playoffs in their first full year under Cuban. He was what has become routine for sports owners in the new millennium: a tech billionaire.A quarter century later, the glow has dimmed. Cuban sold his majority ownership stake for $3.5bn to a figure less a dreamer than a ruthless businesswoman:Miriam Adelson. Since then, as a minority owner, he has little to do with the day-to-day running of the team, and has been sidelined by the general manager he once hired, Nico Harrison (on Tuesday,the Mavs fired Harrison).Josh Giddey might be the anti-Jordan – but the Australian is finally winning over Chicago | Jack SnapeRead moreWithout the Mavericks to occupy him, Cuban has drifted on to a media tour. He’s defended everything from the GM who now calls the shots he once made,Harrison, toClippers owner Steve Ballmer’s“no-show” job controversy. The one thing he doesn’t seem to want to talk about isthe Luka Dončić trade, a move that still haunts much of the Mavericks fanbase. Cuban seems unmoored, clinging to the NBA spotlight like a man afraid the lights will dim. As Mavs owner, relevance was automatic – his mouth and moxie did the work. At the same time, his former team is off to a horrendous start under the dim-witted supervision of new ownership and his former general manager. The Mavericks are near the bottom of the NBA standings, and calls to “Fire Nico” have ramped back up. Many fans hold Cuban responsible for hand-picking Harrison and selling the team to the bad guys.Cuban turned a $285m gamble on the Mavericks into $3.5bn. But how will that windfall be read in the history books? Will it be as the mark of a visionary, or just another fortune sucked from American sports? To judge Cuban’s ownership tenure, sometimes the simplest paradigms are the most revealing.The goodThe time that Cuban hopes will define him, that will live as long as there’s a roof on the American Airlines Center, is 2011. Dirk’s run, the one that rocked Miami’s “Heatles” dynasty before it even began.A title, finally. That banner is proof that his mania could be distilled into a championship.But championships don’t happen in a vacuum. Cuban could have fired general manager Donnie Nelson after the Mavs lost in the 2006 NBA finals. But he knew that Nelson’s eye for foreign talent had already brought in Nowitzki – and one day it would bring in Dončić too. Nelson’s vision set up an international pipeline others envied and ripped off. Cuban was smart with players as well as executives though, and looked out for them when they needed it the most. Delonte West was a Mav for just one season, but Cuban made multiple overtures to help him kick drugs and get back on his feet. Sadly,Cuban couldn’t save West. Nor could West save himself.At the zenith of Cuban’s Mavericks reign, there was a rare sense of balance. He hired excellent coaches: Don Nelson brought a lust for life, Avery Johnson brought defense, and Dirk’s post game. Rick Carlisle brought tactical nous that fueled the team’s title run. Jason Kidd harnessed the Dončić-inspired finals run in 2024. Carlisle, in particular, was everything Cuban wasn’t – quiet and methodical. Together, they engendered the environment Dirk needed to become championship myth.More than any roster move, though, Cuban gave Dallas basketball relevance. Starting in 2000-01, they reached the playoffs in 15 out of 16 seasons. Their slogan,MFFL, wasn’t corporate branding but an identity built in South Dallas and Oak Cliff. The 1990s Mavs were godawful. That Cuban yanked them out of the gutter and turned them into championship contenders is to his immense credit.View image in fullscreenMark Cuban in 2000, his first year as owner of the Mavericks. He often came across as more of a fan than an owner.Photograph: Huy Nguyen/Associated PressThe badBut Cuban’s greatness also led to his own undoing. The same gambler’s instinct that made him a billionaire had him looking once or twice like a slapped ass. Letting Steve Nash walk in 2004 was the first great sin. Cuban didn’t want to pay an aging point guard with a bad back. Phoenix did, and Nash turned into a two-time MVP who reinvented basketball alongside Mike D’Antoni at the Suns. Dallas got nothing back but regret.It happened again with Jalen Brunson in 2022. A homegrown guard, Dončić’s natural backcourt partner, was lowballed and let go. The Knicks pounced, andBrunson turned into a starDallas desperately needed. Different decade, same error by Cuban.Hiring Harrison, a Nike executive, as general manager in 2021 sounded radical in press releases but he brought no real front office chops. Harrison made some smart plays by signing Kyrie Irving and Dereck Lively, but also pushed Cuban out as soon as he sold his majority ownership stake. The championship drought in the Dončić era has Harrison’s fingerprints all over it. Shipping off the Slovenian superstar made Harrison persona non grata in Dallas – the ultimate sellout move,a middle finger to the cityand the fans.Then there were Cuban’s free-agency calamities. Tyson Chandler, defensive heart of the 2011 team, walked out the door because Cuban wanted cap flexibility. Michael Finley, Cuban’s initial Mavericks captain, was waived via amnesty and won a ring with San Antonio. Kristaps Porziņģis was supposed to be Dončić’s running mate; instead, he was a salary dump, injuries included, costing Dallas two first-round picks. And the crown jewel of misfires: leaving Nowitzki to spend his twilight surrounded by entropy and one-year rentals, all because Cuban chased free-agents who never signed.The uglyCuban had a penchant for wasting draft picks on foreign-born busts, coupled with a lack of Black players. There’s no suggestion that was due to prejudice on Cuban’s part, but it was often an odd look in a league where more than two-thirds of players are Black.Cuban’s last act was to sell his majority stake to Adelson, the heir to casino billions anda sharp political operator. The difference is glaring: Cuban was a diehard fan who lived and died with every win and loss, who cared as much about the Mavs as the people in the cheap seats. Adelson, by contrast, appears to value political influence over basketball. The Mavs are just another part of an empire that includes the Las Vegas Sands casino business, the Adelson Family Foundation charity and a close relationship with Donald Trump. In the Mavs’ case,some seeAdelson’s investment in the team as as a stepping stone towards legalizing gambling in Texas. Of all the people Cuban could have sold the team to, why did he have to cash out to someone who many fans see asa real-life supervillain?Then there’s the decay that festered during Cuban’s time as majority owner. In 2018, aSports Illustrated reportdetonated the illusion of Cuban as the benevolent disruptor. The Mavericks’ front office was allegedly a morass of harassment and misconduct. Cuban denied he knew of any misconduct but admitted he bore some responsibility. “I’m embarrassed, to be honest with you, that it happened under my ownership, and it needs to be fixed. Period. End of story,”he said at the time.There were other problems.Donnie Nelson sued the team, accusing Cuban of retaliation after he reported allegations of sexual misconduct by a Mavericks executive. Bob Voulgaris, the gambler Cuban dragged in off his Twitter feed, morphed into a shadow GM – angering Dončić andcurdling the team from the inside. While a Mav, Chandler Parsons,played recruiterin ways that blurred the line between player and executive, pushing Cuban toward flopped contracts. But nothing outweighs selling the team to Adelson. In the end, Cuban’s basketball rebellion ended with a handshake deal with the establishment class he once mocked and swore to subvert.Explore more on these topicsDallas MavericksNBABasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

It is hope that feels cautious, like it might dissolve if you breathe too hard. It is learning to live again inside a body that remembers grief.I am now officially in my third trimester, and each day brings small signs of life: a flutter, a roll, a hiccup, the steady rhythm of his heart. I am growing a baby I will meet, hold and raise. But I have also carried a baby I never got to meet. For 13 weeks, my body held her. It nurtured her, protected her, grew her placenta, still believing she was safe. And in a way, she was. My husband told me then: “She only ever knew love and warmth”, and that has never left me.That first pregnancy made me a mother. It changed how I moved through the world, my sense of self, and how I understood love; the kind that expands quietly and invisibly into areas of your heart that you didn’t know were there before. When we learned her heart had stopped, it was as though mine did too, at least for a while. My body continued to hold her, to love her, even in death. It’s called a “missed miscarriage”: the body holds on to and continues to nurture a baby whose heart has stopped beating. There was both cruelty and comfort in that: that my body did not fail her, but could not save her either.Pregnancy after loss means living in parallel timelines; one where life was interrupted, and another where it continuesThe day I brought her into the world was unlike anything I’d known. As part of the medical management of a “missed miscarriage”, I chose to take medication to help my body bring my baby into the world. I was at home with just my husband, guided only by waves of intense pain that rose and fell until they broke. It felt like labour, though no one called it that, and it feels unfair to do so. The world would mark this as a miscarriage; a clinical word for something that felt both sacred and unbearable. I brought her into the world through pain and love. She came quietly, and the world moved on. But I didn’t.No link between paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children, review findsRead moreToday, a year later, I will walk through the same hospital corridors, this time carrying a baby whose heart beats strong. I will bring him into the world surrounded by support, recognition and celebration. It will be called my “first birth”, though that doesn’t feel entirely true. I have already laboured once before, just without witnesses, and in a way that has no name and isn’t spoken about in society. This pregnancy feels both familiar and foreign; my body knows the path, but it also remembers where it led last time.There is a strange dissonance to carrying new life when you have known loss. Every appointment feels like both a promise and a test. Every heartbeat heard through the Doppler feels like a small miracle and a reminder of how fragile miracles can be. Love is no longer simple; it is layered with memory, stitched with what-ifs and almosts.People say things like “it was meant to be” but I can’t hold that thought comfortably. She was meant to be. And so is he. One doesn’t erase or justify the other. Both have meaning. Both are mine. I’ve learned that grief and love can coexist, not as opposites but as two currents running in the same river.Sometimes I think about how love changes shape. My love for her hasn’t faded; it’s deepened into something quieter, a pulse beneath everything. As my love for him grows, I find myself wanting to protect the space that belongs to her. They are not the same, and yet they are forever connected; two stories written across the same body.Pregnancy after loss means living in parallel timelines; one where life was interrupted, and another where it continues. It means joy tinged with fear, gratitude tangled with guilt, and hope that feels hard-won. It means understanding that love is not measured by outcome.Both of my babies have changed me. One taught me how to love without certainty. The other teaches me how to hope again. I carry them both – one in memory, one in movement – and they both belong entirely to me.Lauren Farrugia is a clinical psychologist with a PhD in psychologyExplore more on these topicsPregnancyOpinionChildbirthFamilyHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

As a corporation executive, I lived through a number of these episodes:the Hutton reportinto coverage of Iraq, which resulted in the resignation of Greg Dyke as director general; and then theJimmy Savile revelations, which helped force out George Entwistle, even though he had nothing to do with the appalling crimes of history. Now Tim Davie hasresignedover the misleading editing of a Panorama programme, and the BBC’s enemies haven’t just scented blood: they have got it.There is only one response, and that is to get up and fight. As digital nonsense and lies swamp us every day, and tech billionaires in foreign countries decide what we see and hear, there is a stronger case than ever for British content and for journalism that serves the people of the UK – with some of those old-fashioned things such as honesty, accuracy and truth. Despite all the attacks upon it, and the whippings it administers to itself, theBBCis the country’s most trusted broadcaster. Its reach and its universality are why its foes hate it.But the BBC has to change, too. Some of its travails have been because sometimes it hasn’t been good enough. Its journalism is required byroyal charterto be of a higher quality and more distinctive than the market alone can provide; and that isn’t consistently the case. It has fallen for rookie errors – thefailure to identifythe family of the narrator of a documentary about Gaza, the indefensibleediting of Trump– that suggest a lack of managerial grip. Excellence, and the application of intelligence, are not consistent in BBC output; and recently the overwhelming number of puff pieces about Celebrity Traitors suggest a susceptibility in the newsroom for marketing mania with limp journalism.More challenging is the question of how it responds to the allegations of bias or being on the wrong side (however you define that) of the culture wars. Here the BBC is in a unique position, because it is the only media organisation in the UK funded by a compulsory licence fee – which is another reason why commercial organisations hack away at it. But with that requirement for everyone to pay for the corporation comes the obligation that the BBC should reflect all its audiences – nationalists, unionists, Reform voters in Clacton or Greens in Brighton.My own judgment is that the BBC has historically avoided a party political bias, but it has a well-meaning liberalism – it wants to be a force for good in the world – that can be inspiring to many but alienating to others. The BBC never truly understood the leave voters in the EU referendum, and over the years it has been nervous about providing a platform for opponents of large-scale immigration, thus ceding the territory to tabloid newspapers and GB News. It never got the forces driving Jeremy Corbyn, either.This reinforces that it is different from any other platform which leans one way or the other, and which may endorse political parties in an election campaign. Newspaper readerships were traditionally attracted to good journalism, certainly, but also by positions in a particular zone of the political spectrum with columnists and story selection to match. The BBC has to rely on its future funding from left and right and centre, and to navigate an editorial path through the massively more diverse and polarised nation that we have become.And that, I believe, is rather an exciting thing to do. A teeming public space where we can all meet and test ideas is something we’d need to invent if it didn’t already exist, and the virtues of a national conversation are obvious if you compare it with the anger-filled silos of social media. But with this comes obligations. You cannot start from the principle that some conscientiously held views are right and others are wrong; most acutely, arguments for trans rights and women’s rights must both be heard and not shouted down. Social progress over the centuries has been driven by open debate. In the even more disputed international reporting, the strengths and failures of the Israeli and Palestinian arguments must all be examined, and awkward facts can’t be avoided.That’s why debates about BBC bias so often miss the point. The rationale of the BBC should be to reflect the world as it is, to analyse it and to expose us to views we may disagree with or even find upsetting or distasteful. The time to worry is if everything we see or hear reflects our own perspective. It is why political interference should be implacably resisted, too: in the end, every politician just wants to hear more from their own party and it would like the questioning to be as docile as possible. Instead we should be hearing from every party in Westminster and subjecting them to grillings about how they respond to the concerns of voters. A current BBC sin is talking endlessly about Reform but not interrogating their policies. It is of a piece with broadcasters egging on Ed Davey tofall off sailboardsduring the election campaign as if those photo ops mattered more than his policies on tax and spend.So my proposal is to task the BBC’s journalism with working even harder to include everybody and every opinion that is within the law, and not to shirk from controversy. It doesn’t need yet more layers of regulation – just a commitment to public service and the accountability that admits when it gets it wrong. Directors general should not be judged and risk decapitation on the basis of individual mistakes. Instead, the best assessment is how the BBC tells us more about ourselves and each other and how we might live together in the future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ask the striking workers at the British LibraryZadie SmithThe dispute over pay at this great national institution gets to the heart of our misplaced prioritiesTue 11 Nov 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 13.51 ESTShareYou know a country by its values. Bywhata country values. And it turns out that what a country values can change over time. Sometimes, though, there’s a sort of cognitive delay between the country you think you are in, and the country you’ve actually become. For example, you can keep selling yourself, to foreigners, as the country ofWilliam Shakespeareand Jane Austen, and luring busloads of tourists to Stratford-upon-Avon and Bath, and put a statue of George Orwell in front of the BBC, and imagine yourself a cultured and literate nation, which the rest of the world admires for its devotion to the written word – but if you then chronically underfund your cultural institutions, and treat your cultural workers with contempt, many people will suspect you of being full of it. And as the decades pass – and fewer and fewer Shakespeares and Austens and Orwells emerge from your little island – even more people will begin to suspect that in truth you do not value culture at all, and are in fact running a giant heritage museum in which the only cultural workers you respect are the dead ones.The British Library is our great national home of cultural workers. We go there to read and research, to learn and to grow, to write and to think, to inspire and create. Facilitating our work is a great army of library staff, who are also cultural workers. Without them, the library does not function, the books do not get read, the culture does not come to pass. And how are they treated? According to their union,they are offered pay deals so dire that many of them work multiple jobs and live in substandard housing. Seventy one per cent of respondents to a union surveyfind their salary insufficient to meet basic needs. Some workers report mental and physical health deterioration as a consequence of these poverty wages. When a massive cyber-attack on the library results in a major disruption of the service they are able to offer, they’re left on the frontline, to be shouted at by the very patrons they are attempting to serve. And when they then try to ask for a pay increase that is at least in line with inflation, they are told there is no money, while some of the six-figure-salaried executives are eligible forfive-figure bonuses. One of the other things we used to think about this country was that it had a bone-deep sense of fairness. Does any of that sound fair?Above and beyond the executives themselves is the problem of this government, whose funding of the library has failed to keep pace with inflation. In fact, in the latest spending review afunding cut of 1.4%was levied on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Meanwhile, this same government has earmarked £2bn over the next four years for theAI Opportunities Action Plan. There is no doubt much justified excitement around AI – especially in the realm of medicine – but a healthy country needs healthy minds as much as healthy bodies. A country is also its culture. Even the AI productivity tool the government recently created for its civil servants iscalled Humphrey, a name borrowed from a 1970s TV show written by a human being, the scripts for which you will find in the British Library. That’s the thing about culture: it persists. Culture is what people pass down. It brings shared meaning into our lives. There’s a reason we’ve placed a statue of Orwell striding into the future outside the BBC, rather than any past or present chief executive of the BBC. And what is engraved on the wall of that same institution? An Orwell quote: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”One of the things this government doesn’t want to hear is that what defines a nation – in its own eyes and in the eyes of others – is, in the end, not the size and scope of its military hardware, or even the wealth it amasses, but the culture it creates. In other places they know this. In France they subsidise their bookshops. In Germany, libraries are plentiful and well-funded, no matter their size. In England one of the most famous libraries in the world is treated as an afterthought, an embarrassment. A white elephant nobody knows what to do with. A long time ago, a very great British writer sat in the British Library – which was then housed in the British Museum – writing a little book called A Room of One’s Own, which became one of the primary texts in a worldwide movement called feminism. Virginia Woolf wrote the following: “There is in the British Museum an enormous mind. Consider that Plato is there, cheek by jowl with Aristotle; and Shakespeare with Marlowe. This great mind is hoarded beyond the power of any single mind to possess it.”It is this “great mind” that is housed in this extraordinary library. It is the heritage of all peoples, British or not, but because it is after all theBritishLibrary, within its collections you will find a particularly enriching and gigantic British section. And if you really want to know a nation, and to experience its collective mind, instead of tying tatty flags to lamp-posts you might want to get thee to a library, any library, but especially the British Library. In there, you will find the nation’s books, its songs, its film and TV scripts, its plays, its dictionaries, its history, its geography and psychogeography, and so much more – a mind-boggling variety of material. You will learn a lot more about this country than can be expressed by a red cross on a white sheet, and a lot more about the whole wide world than an AI summary could ever give you. And it will be delivered to you by an army of overworked, underpaid, too-often verbally abused library staff, who deserve so much better from Britain, from their government, from the executives of the British Library, and from all of us.Zadie Smith is a novelist.

Experts weigh in on the mats that have emerged as a self-therapy toolRead more in theAntiviral seriesTue 11 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 15.55 ESTShareIt looks like a fancy yoga mat but manufacturers claim pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy mats can recharge the body at a cellular level. PEMF therapy is a favourite of biohackers including Gary Brecka, who spruiked the matson Joe Rogan’s podcastas having the ability to “re-polarise” red blood cells.Horses seem to really love PEMFand manyindividuals living with chronic painsay the mats have helped them.But experts caution that while there is evidence for using PEMF in medical devices, the commercial mats are part of an emerging home self-therapy device market which can be highly variable.What is PEMF therapy?These mats are a pulse electromagnetic field-generating medium, says Prof Gary Housley, the chair of physiology at the University of New South Wales.Medical devices, like MRI scanners, use quite strong pulsed magnetic fields that can have an effect on biological tissue by interacting with the molecules, principally the water molecules in the body, Housley says.Another example Housley points to using PEMF aretranscranial magnetic stimulators(TMS), which are anapproved treatmentin countries including Australia, the US, Canada, Israel and the UK, for people with depression who have not responded to medication.Is it worth it? PEMFRead moreTMS are used by placing coils on top of somebody’s head. The generated magnetic fields can provide local superficial stimulation of some neurons in the brain, which can connect the perceptions and even drive some activity and motor function, he says.How effective are the commercial mats using this technology?Unlike these other approved medical devices using PEMF, Housley cautions that the commercial mats are “highly variable” in their manufacture, and the pulsed electromagnetic fields they generate are “very, very weak” – about a thousand times less than transcranial magnetic stimulation devices.Also, the strength of the field rapidly decays when you move away from where the coil is, he says. “Because of the nature of being a mat” there is going to be variable contact with the body, with some parts inevitably lifted a few centimetres off the mat.When people apply pads with direct electrical stimulation, it can provide a consistent physiological effect, engaging their muscles. Devices that have direct local contact with the body may have application for modulating neuropathic pain, Housley says.Some mats also have a heating pad. That combined therapy can help with neurological conditions like pain, he says, because the heat generated from infrared light can penetrate the body and help circulation.What does the evidence show?There are a range of scientific publications that have looked at the potential utility of these mats for health benefits but there are no conclusive, randomised controlled blinded studies that actually validate the devices or show any clinically proven benefit, Housley says.The most promising results might be achieved for certain bone conditions or some pain modulation, he says, which may be associated with stimulating baseline cell tissues.Most of the research has been done on medical-grade devices that deliver a much stronger field and are more focused on a specific body area, says Prof Michele Sterling from the University of Queensland’s Recover Injury Research Centre.Chronic pain sent Jabez into a spiral of despair. Behaviour therapy brought her backRead moreThere have been some cell and animal studies showing that there may be some changes with these higher intensity devices that can influence cell signalling and inflammation, Sterling says. “But we don’t know whether that translates across to humans. The research hasn’t been done, and we certainly don’t know if that then translates across to these mat devices.”A 2024paper published in Naturesaid further investigations were needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying “promising” findings.What are evidence-based treatments for chronic pain?Anecdotally many people with chronic pain condition say the mats help them, and that’s OK if they are prepared to pay for them, Sterling says. “But they should remember that other factors have much stronger evidence, and not to neglect them as well.”Physical activity and regular movement are shown to help, she says, even if it’s gentle. “It doesn’t have to be high-level, high-intensity exercise.”Getting good sleep is increasingly found to be important, she says, while evidence-based physiotherapy orpsychological approaches can also help.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

They were not even written by a member of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Shockingly,they came from a journalist, Amichai Attali, a political correspondent for one of Israel’s most popular newspapers.The words came from a much longer post published on X in response to asagathat is dominating Israeli headlines: in July 2024, legal authorities in the IDF opened an investigation into soldiers who were allegedly shown beating and sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee. Then, in August, a video was leaked to the press, allegedly showing the abuse at the Sde Teiman military base. Five guards were arrested – all Israeli soldiers – and later indicted.In recent days the IDF’s legal chief, Maj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, has been directly tied to the leak – and, moreover, to a subsequent cover-up. An internal investigation into the leak found no one to blame. Only recently did a routine polygraph test, taken by an officer from the IDF’s legal office, raise suspicions about questionable contacts with journalists. From there, it all went downhill for the legal chief, who eventually resigned from her post on 31 October. In her resignation letter, she said: “I approved the release of material to the media in an attempt to counter false propaganda against the army’s law enforcement authorities.”Then came another twist: she went missing on 2 November, sparking a police search. She was found alive a few hours later and taken intocustody, although the police could not locate her phone. On Friday, a civilian swimmerrecovered the device, which, miraculously, was still working after five days in seawater. If that weren’t enough drama, Tomer-Yerushalmi washospitalised on Sunday morningafter an alleged suicide attempt. Though it is hard to predict what will come next in this saga, as things stand, she is likely to face several charges.Israel top military lawyer arrested after she admitted leaking video of soldiers’ abuseRead moreHowever, the criticism in the Israeli journalist’s post was not aimed directly at Tomer-Yerushalmi. His main target was Channel 12’s legal analyst, Guy Peleg, who aired the leaked footage. Just last week, it was reported that Channel 12 News hadassigned a security detail to Peleg, due to concerns that there might be attempts to harm him. Not long afterwards, Amichai Eliyahu, the heritage minister,posted about Peleg on his X account: “My heart is broken … In prison, he will be safe.” Last weekend even saw fans of Peleg’s favourite football club hold a banner in the stadium, informing him he is unwelcome there.This comes as no surprise. In Israeli society, there is a prevailing notion that soldiers should be bulletproof – “even sacred”, as Haaretz journalist Tom Levinson told me. “It feels as if they should be able to do whatever they want, and there shouldn’t be any repercussions.” This applies to accusations of war crimes in the Gaza Strip as well as to actions outside the territory.It seems as if a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy has been happily adopted. No one needs to know about any wrongdoing by IDF soldiers, let alone criticise them – we should simply thank and admire them. And when those secrets do come out, exposed to the public at home and abroad, one can expect a wave of public outrage – but not the type you might expect. “A blood libel,” no less, declared the defence minister, Israel Katz. Netanyahu said that this was “perhaps the most severe public relations attackthat the State of Israel has experienced since its establishment”.On Saturday, Channel 11 News (Kan, the public broadcaster) aired a 21-minute interview with four of the accused guards, portraying them as the “real victims” in this story. The framing of the piece suggested that they had been set up for something they had not done.According to the indictment,five soldiers beat the detainee, dragged him across the floor, stepped on his body, and used a taser against him. One of them allegedly stabbed the detainee in the buttocks, causing rectal injury. The detainee suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung. The news presenter did not confront the guards with the specifics of the indictment.As things stand, the path to the trial of the IDF soldiers appears full of obstacles. It was recently revealed that the detainee had been released to Gaza as part of the ceasefire deal, and somehowIsrael failed to depose him(have him testify under oath or by affidavit) after the indictment was filed.However, all of that seems unimportant in Israel. The real victims here – the detainees – are absent in the howls of outrage over this story. How many Palestinians have been mistreated in Israeli prisons? After this backlash, we may never know.Roy Schwartz is a senior editor and op-ed contributor at HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We should copy its tactics to defeat fast fashionNicole LipmanThe dirt-cheap clothing company has opened its first permanent store in Paris – and politicians and workers have united against itTue 11 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 11.25 ESTShareParis is the fashion capital of the world – a paradise of couture and craftsmanship stretching back centuries. The city’s very name connotes luxury and glamour. But last Wednesday, 5 November, a sprawling Shein outlet opened on the sixth floor of the BHV Marais, the historic department store directly across from Paris’s city hall. It’s the Singapore-based ultra-fast-fashion store’s first permanent bricks and mortar retail space, and the first of several permanent outposts Shein plans to open in France in the near future. Many Parisians aren’t happy about it.Shein – launched as SheInside in 2011 in Nanjing, China – is the reprehensible paragon of the ultra-fast-fashion industry. The company sells clothing (and home goods, toys, stationery, cookware, blankets, pet supplies and more) at an unfathomable scale: today’s “new in” page alone lists more than 1,300 items, from shiny gold shirts in its “Manfinity Mode” category, to plunging, plus-size swimsuits under the sub-brand “Slaysola”. Nearly everything on the site ismade of plastic, designed for single-use disposability, and it’s all shockingly, disturbingly cheap.Shein is an economic affront to France’s fashion industry and labour market, and the French government has been going after the company for years. In 2023, at theurging of two French MPs, the French branch of the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched an investigation into Shein’s human rights, labour law and environmental violations, finding in 2025 Shein failed to uphold OECD standard in these areas. (Sheinrejected claimsit had breached any EU legislation, and questioned the neutrality of the investigation). In 2024, the French lower house of parliament approved a bill penalising fast fashion companies for environmental impacts; this June, the Senatepassed a modified versionof the bill, singling out Shein and other ultra-fast fashion companies as particularly egregious offenders. In the past three months, France hasfined Sheinnearly €200m for consumer protection violations and “misleading discounts”. (Shein contests the fines.)Most significantly, last Wednesday – motivated by the discovery of both “childlike” sex dolls and weapons for sale on Shein’s website – France’s prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, moved toblock the company’s e-commerce entirely. Immediately, the government suspended all Shein deliveries and flagged more than 200,000 packages for customs investigation. Deliveries wereresumed by the weekendafter Shein removed the offending products, although the PM noted that “Shein will remain under close surveillance by state services.” The concurrent timing of the attacks on Shein’s e-commerce and the new BHV Marais storefront seems intentional: it’s a strategic and effective approach designed to hobble the company at all points.The presence of Shein in France is more than an economic affront – it’s a cultural one, too. Shein stands in direct opposition to values the French stereotypically hold dear: artistry and durability, sustainability and chicness. BHV Marais staff, bolstered by support from the major French trade unions,have staged numerous strikesand demonstrations in recent weeks, and several independent retailers have pulled their products from the department store in protest. More than 100,000 French citizenshave signedan online petition opposing Shein’s presence in the city. And on opening day, protesters with anti-Shein signs wereforcibly removedfrom the store by police. The French fear Shein’s impact on the economy and labour markets, but also what the brand stands for: dirt-cheap clothing, at the expense of ethics.Yet for all the protests, fines and resistance, there’s a reason Société des Grands Magasins (BHV’s owner) has leased its retail space to Shein: it knows Shein’s shoddy, ultracheap and unethical clothes will sell.Sheinis the fifth-largest clothing retailer by volume in France, celebrated as an accessible retailer for trendy fashion. Behind the rows of protesters on Wednesday carrying signs reading “SHAME ON SHEIN” stood hundreds of Parisians, waiting patiently in line to enter Shein’s new, permanent, super-cheap emporium. They left carrying bulging shopping bags of polyester sweaters and shimmering going-out tops, muted pastel workwear and plastic, faux-leather winter coats. Most likely, they felt they had scored a bargain.Behind those low prices are enormous, insurmountable costs. There arethe coststothe environment. There are the costs to garment workers: paidpennies to toil,unendinglyin factories that supply Shein products the world over. There are thecosts to independent designers, whose work has regularly been ripped off by Shein. And there are the social, cultural costs, too: the lesson that clothing is worth so little, and the expectation that our garments are temporary.France’s regulatory attacks on Shein – and labour’s decisive, united opposition to the company – are powerful, necessary measures. By making it harder to purchase from Shein through corporate regulation, we can discourage the growth of ultra-fast fashion and limit its power in the market. Social pressure, led by workers arm-in-arm with consumers, may be an even more powerful weapon – when buying from Shein is widely considered shameful, no one will want to be caught in a Slaysola bathing suit.Still, the fight against fast fashion is ultimately a slow one. To truly defeat Shein, we must radically re-evaluate and reorient our relationship to clothing. We must learn to love the clothes we already have.

All bets are offGaby HinsliffThey may lack Labour’s party machine, but Zack Polanski’s burgeoning popularity could have seismic consequences for British politicsTue 11 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 05.41 ESTShareWhen Zack Polanski won the Green leadership in September, hemade clearthat he was coming for Labour. At the time, his warning that “we’re here to replace you” still seemed faintly presumptuous, coming from a man who hasn’t even managed to get himself elected to parliament and whose party was only barely into single digits in the polls. Even battered and beleaguered as it was by autumn, Labour was still the big beast of the left: the only one big enough, anyway, to win a majority.Little more than a month on, pollstersare now talkingabout arguably the most underpriced wildcard in the 2025 pack, which is the prospect of the Greens overtaking Labour in the polls in the same way Reform overtook the Tories at the end of last year – not just in one rogue sample or outlier, but consistently enough to be credible.In themost recent YouGov poll, the Greens are still four points behind Labour. But that’s down from 12 points in August, just before Polanski was elected, and other polls have put them almost at parity. If both parties stick to their current trajectories – Labour drowning in pre-budget gloom and recriminations and the Greens surfing an optimistic wave of voters looking for a British equivalent to New York’s upbeat new socialist mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani – then the psychologically important crossover point could be only weeks away. Though polls are only ever a snapshot of a moment in time, revealing very little about the results of a general election that could still be four years away, that would nonetheless be a seismic moment.The two biggest obstacles to smaller parties breaking through are getting airtime, and convincing potential supporters that it won’t be a wasted vote. Like Nigel Farage before him, Polanski is good at making himself heard: his habit of saying bluntly out loud the things other politicians normally fudge has already made him big on TikTok, and is increasingly becoming his passport to TV studios. (According toanalysisby the PR consultancy Be Broadcast, he got many more broadcast mentions than the Liberal Democrats’ Ed Davey and almost as many as the Tories’ Kemi Badenoch between 1 September and 20 October: perhaps more surprisingly, the Greens also racked up the most positive, solution-focused coverage.) The real test, however, is whether he can convert all this into a sustained lead over Labour. For polling doesn’t just reflect reality; sometimes it can inadvertently accelerate it.Overtaking the Tories was what enabled Farage to claim that Reform really could win, that it had taken over from a collapsing Conservative party as the natural party of the right, and that it was safe for those previously worried about defecting to jump ship. It was the moment, in short, that the herd moved.It’s far harder for the Greens, with their four MPs, to claim the same kind of plausible dominance over a governing party with more than 400. But Labour’s achilles heel is its reliance on supporters who will grudgingly vote for them to beat Reform, but only because they don’t believe a more radical leftwing party could ever actually win. If enough of them start to conclude – rightly or wrongly, and given England’s longstanding electoral maths it may well be wrongly – that times have changed and the old constraints no longer apply, what then?Like Farage before him, Polanski is staggeringly underqualified for Downing Street – the highest elected office he has held is on the London Assembly – but he has the storytelling skills and creative political imagination that the more obviously qualified Keir Starmer lacks. He subverts questions about whether he’d serve in a Starmer coalition bycheekily arguingthat Starmer might not be around that long, and positions himself neatly one step ahead of where Labour seems destined, reluctantly, to end up. (If Rachel Reeves does deliver a soak-the-rich budget in November, expect Polanski – a longstanding advocate of wealth taxes – to claim credit for forcing her to the left.) His party conference speech,respondingas the Jewish leader of a zealously pro-Palestinian party to a Manchester synagogue stabbing which had happened only hours earlier, was strikingly deft and thoughtful for a relative novice.Of course, it’s Labour that still has the heft, the experience, the ground operation and the national network of candidates key to leading any leftwing alliance against Reform. But what they’ll lose, should that crossover point in the polls ever come, is the ability simply to assume seniority as of right. “We are not messing around,” Polanski warned, back in October. Evidently he meant it.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinionZack PolanskiLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

So how did the author turn his story into a tragic masterpiece?Tue 11 Nov 2025 12.49 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 12.57 ESTShareWhen we meet the morning afterthe announcement of this year’s Booker prize, David Szalay, the winner, seems an extremely genial and gentle author to have created one of the most morally ambiguous characters in recent contemporary fiction. His sixth novel, Flesh, about the rise and fall of a Hungarian immigrant to the UK, is unlike anything you have read before.Szalay (pronounced “Sol-oy”) is often described as “Hungarian-British”, but that has offended Canadians this morning, he says. His mother was Canadian and he was born in that country, where his Hungarian father had moved a few years earlier. “I’m arguably more Canadian than Hungarian.” Now 51, he grew up in England, graduated from Oxford University, and lived in Hungary for 15 years. To make things more confusing, he is over from Vienna, where he now lives with his wife and young son Jonathan.Brexit will cause very deep changes in the psychology of this countryFor many years, Szalay has been critically acclaimed as “a writers’ writer”. In 2013 he was named one of Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists. There was always a sense that he deserved to be better known. In the past 12 months, he has had a baby and won theBooker prize. “It’s not a year I’m gonna forget,” he says, his voice scratchy from lack of sleep and all the talking he’s already had to do this morning.Last night was not his first experience of the agonising Booker ceremony. In 2016 he was shortlisted forAll That Man Is, an interlinked collection of nine stories about men of different ages, from all over Europe, which provoked controversy as to whether it counted as a novel. It was a “very, very stressful evening” he says. This time he decided “to sort of hypnotise” himself into believing that he hadn’t won. “I maybe succeeded almost too well,” he says. “I was eerily calm – and then when it did indeed happen, I was slightly shocked.”Flesh was born of the failure of a novel he had been working on for four years. Partly this was due to the pressure of the attention that All That Man Is had received. Also: “the central concept was wrong.” Szalay had written 100,000 words before finally abandoning it. “There was an enormous feeling of relief, as well as trepidation that I now had to start with something else,” he says. “To abandon two books in quick succession would start to seem terminal.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d tried to hypnotise myself’…Szalay with Queen Camilla at a Booker prize reception yesterday.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/ReutersHe wanted to write a novel that straddled England and Hungary, to reflect his feelings of being “emotionally marooned between the two countries”. He also wanted to write about “the physicality of existence”, he says. “Obviously, it’s part of every story, but it’s very rarely prominent as an idea.” He opened a new Word document and gave it the working title Flesh. The title seemed very “unliterary”, he says, and it made his editor nervous. But in the end, they all agreed it suited the pervasive unease of the novel and its central preoccupation – the body.The unforgettable opening chapter came first, almost as a short story. Fifteen-year-old István is living in a new town on a Hungarian estate with his single mother. A 42-year-old neighbour seduces him and an altercation with her husband ends in disaster. “I would certainly read the second chapter,” Szalay says. “So I then thought, ‘How can we move this on?’”Move on it does, at speed. István spends time in a juvenile detention centre, then as part of the Hungarian army in the Iraq war. Both these experiences happen off stage. The next time we meet him he is working as a doorman for a club in London. He then gets a job as a chauffeur for a preposterously wealthy man. He becomes preposterously wealthy himself. To tell more would be to give too much away. A lot of things happen to István, most of them very bad. “I didn’t want to be a coward. I didn’t want to shirk, or to leave out things that were quite extreme,” he says. “Obviously it’s totally contemporary in its surface, but underneath that, I did conceive it as something akin to a Greek tragedy, in which the hero has to be thoroughly put through the wringer in order to reach his point of catharsis.” The reader is put through the wringer too.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve been as matter-of-fact as I can’.’Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianSzalay’s subject, honed over six novels and 15 years, is masculinity: what it means to be a man today, with an inevitable emphasis on sex, violence and money. In 2025, these are not obviously Booker-prize-winning themes. For years, writers were desperate to be anointed “the new Martin Amis”, but now it would be considered slightly shaming. As he said in his speech on Monday, Szalay knew he was writing a risky novel. “One of the risks I was taking was to write about sex from a very specifically male perspective, and to try to do that as honestly as possible.” We see István smoke and have sex. Sometimes he eats. “It’s very difficult, notoriously, to write about sex,” the author says. “I tried to write about it as matter-of-factly as possible.” Sex and anger, he explains, are largely “non-verbal experiences” – and often the most intense challenge for a novelist, as “you have to deal with everything verbally, unless you leave a blank page”.It’s akin to Greek tragedy. The hero has to be thoroughly put through the wringerIstván himself is almost a blank space on the page. We have no idea what he looks like, although women are all too ready to sleep with him. (This is his curse.) We don’t know what he thinks or why he does things – and neither, it seems, does he. He is a man of few words. Never has “OK” been deployed so often (about 500 times, apparently) or so meaningfully in a work of literary fiction. “It’s one of the main aspects of the characterisation,” Szalay says. “I very specifically didn’t want a character who unpacked themselves for the reader, either reliably or unreliably.” The result is a triumph of relentless exteriority and brutal realism, at once tragic and comic in its banality.Wary of the novel being “pigeonholed” as just a treatise on men, Szalay edited out most of the overt references to masculinity. “I hope that it’s about much more than that,” he says. “I hope the book is very emotionally impactful – and that only works if it feels very real to the reader.” He succeeds. It is a feat of authorial magic that he manages to make us care so deeply about a protagonist who is so unknowable that at a crucial moment of moral reckoning, we are uncertain how he will behave.For all the novel’s fixation on the body, István exists in a specific historical moment. Spanning roughly the author’s lifetime, the novel mentions external events, from the Iraq war to migration from eastern Europe to west, and up to the pandemic, to show how our lives are shaped by political and socioeconomic forces beyond our control. “The end of communism, Hungary joining the EU, those two things completely transformed life for Hungarians,” he says. “Brexit will cause very deep changes in the psychology of the UK.”Szalay is very happy to call himself a European novelist. Having spent most of his writing career in Hungary and now in Austria, he describes himself as a “literary hermit”. He doesn’t really speak German, he says, and isn’t part of any bookish scene. In previous interviews, it is possible to detect his frustration at the sameness of much contemporary fiction. Certainly, he has no time for the traditional form. “That sort of Russian novel that begins with the main character’s grandparents, and slowly works up to their birth about 200 pages in – that’s probably not my favourite sort,” he admits. “I prefer more compressed or concise novels, books that don’t tell you everything.”It is no surprise to learn that Ernest Hemingway and John Updike were favourites when he was growing up. “Virginia Woolf is an influence, too,” he says. “I read equally as many novels by women as by men.” He is already halfway through his next book, which “partly” involves a female perspective, he says laughing.He had planned to spend this day in London with his wife. Instead, she is returning to Vienna and their baby while he stays on to talk about masculinity. It is the first time they have left their son with other people (his aunts). “I think this is probably a good moment to do that,” Szalay says. Winning the Booker is surely a good excuse for calling in the babysitters. “I really didn’t know how people were going to take the book,” he says of his win. “I’m proud that it has connected with so many people.”Flesh by David Szalay is published by Vintage (£18.99).

But why seek out horror on screen if you have so much of it in real life?Geoffrey MacnabTue 11 Nov 2025 11.16 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 11.17 ESTShareWhen Ukrainian horror movie The Witch: Revenge started filming in late 2023, the costumes for the Russian soldiers were sourced straight from the battlefield. “They were real Russian uniforms. The captured soldiers or the dead soldiers, they just took those uniforms and cleaned them, and we used them,” the film’s producer, Iryna Kostyuk, says, speaking from Kyiv. Having cleaned the uniforms, the film-makers then had to dirty them up again so they looked suitably lived-in. Some of the vests still had names written in them – and several had names crossed out, presumably because Russian soldiers had filched them themselves from fallen comrades. “It was quite a challenge for the [Ukrainian] actors to wear them,” the producer says.The movie, also known as The Konotop Witch, is about a witch who has renounced her powers but re-summons them after the Russians kill her fiance. It was a runaway hit at the Ukrainian box office last year, making $1.4m – a very big number for a country during a war, facing curfews and electricity cuts. It’s also the first in a horror universe cycle, called Heroines of the Dark Times, that Kostyuk is overseeing. Kostyuk and her team have now completed the second film in the series, The Dam. A zombie splatterfest, full of gore and severed heads, it follows a unit of Ukrainian soldiers, led by a female fighter codenamed Mara, who uncover a cold war era laboratory where Soviet scientists conducted nefarious experiments in the 1950s. Mara and her team face the inevitable battle with undead Soviet soldiers – but must also confront their own innermost fears, and learn to trust one another.View image in fullscreenThe Witch: Revenge.Photograph: FILM.UAIt all begs a question: why turn to horror movies when you have so much of it in real life anyway? Kostyuk says that spectators’ responses to movies change in wartime. In 2023, she producedan animated family fantasy feature called Mavka: The Forest Song, about a mythical green-haired wood nymph who guards the forests. Although she had been working on it long before the Russian invasion, Ukrainian cinemagoers interpreted it as a patriotic wartime allegory and it became the highest-grossing Ukrainian film ever, making a reported $21m worldwide.But, by 2024, Kostyuk says she realised the public mood had darkened. “People wanted revenge,” she says. That’s what The Witch delivers in spades. The film’s logline was: “This is a film where a Ukrainian witch kicks the shit out of Russians”, and it immediately resonated. For a western viewer, the film makes peculiarly grim viewing. After the invasion, Russian soldiers are shown raping and murdering before the witch casts her dark spells against them and they begin to die in ever more grotesque ways.Kostyuk says: “The Witch was supposed to be a scary movie. It’s quite visual, quite graphic. But for Ukrainian audiences, it was not scary. They would look at those guts being splattered of the Russians and would be satisfied.”View image in fullscreen‘You choose locations and then you deal with it. It is high, high risk’ … The Witch: Revenge.Photograph: FILM.UAIf you are not Ukrainian, The Dam is an equally disconcerting experience. At certain moments, it plays like an eastern European answer to Shaun of the Dead, with enjoyably cheesy decapitations and absurdly bloody, over-the-top VFX. You think it must be tongue in cheek – but then you remember it was made in the middle of a very real war, about which there is nothing funny at all.And how does Kostyuk account for the films’ feminist overtones? According to her, it’s as much to do with the market as anything else. “Right now, the theatrical audience inUkraineis female-driven because lots of males are at war. There are not that many men left to go to the cinemas … but I think it also has to do with the fact that Ukrainian mythology is so rich, and it always has to do with the female side.”View image in fullscreenMade in the middle of a very real war … The Dam (2025).Photograph: FILM.UAKostyuk hopes that The Dam (which is being presented internationally for the first time at the American Film Market this week) will appeal beyond Ukrainian borders, both to horror fans and to any of us in the west worried about Russian expansionism. “That’s where Putin wants to take Russia now, back to the Soviet imperialist mindset, back to the USSR. We’re fighting the remains of that mindset and trying to stop it spilling out of the metaphorical bunker.” A third film is in development, about a policewoman fighting rightwing neo-Nazi vampires.Ask Kostyuk if it’s safe making such movies and she dismisses the question as no longer even worth asking. “Now that we are in the fourth year of war, I don’t think that the factor of safety applies any more when you are choosing your locations. You choose locations and then you deal with it. It is high, high risk.”However, it is true to say that audience demand is changing all the time. Last year, Ukrainan cinemagoers thirsted for revenge. Now, they crave escapism. Tales of the undead are less in vogue and The Dam has done modest business since its Ukrainian release last month. Nonetheless, Kostyuk is undaunted. She has recently overseen a live-action version of Mavka, called The True Myth, shot in Ukraine’s forests and lakes during wartime and delivered bang on schedule despite the constant air raids. If anyone is a heroine of dark times, you can’t help thinking that maybe Kostyuk is one herself. After all, making zombie movies and family adventures in the middle of an invasion takes a very special kind of gumption.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsUkraineFeminismRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

She wins £15,000.Holmberg’s portrait features the sitter, Mel, appearing lost in a daydream as cool light caresses her repaired skin.When Mel was two years old, her mother left her and her sister in the car while she went to make a quick purchase at a convenience store and when the mother returned, the car was on fire. Mel’s sister died while Mel survived with severe burns.Holmberg’s interest in photography was sparked at a young age by accompanying her father when he would develop his own prints and photos.The portrait of Mel is part of a larger series called The Outside of the Inside, in which Holmberg documents people with facial and physical differences. The NPG said the photographer paid tribute to the rich diversity of appearances and brought more visibility to the discrimination faced by those with physical differences.The judges commended Mel for its combination of compassionate approach and technical skill, noting how the lighting and thoughtful pose drew viewers to the sitter’s story.The £3,000 second prize went to Luan Davide Gray, a London-based fine art photographer, for We Dare to Hug, a black and white portrait of two men in their 60s sharing a tender embrace.View image in fullscreenWe Dare to Hug by Luan Davide Gray won second prize.Photograph: Luan Davide Gray/Taylor Wessing PPPThe image, which evokes sculpture through its composition and use of light and shadow, shows one man softly holding the other’s bare chest and gently kissing him on the cheek.Gray has a degree in visual communication from the University of Brighton and more than 20 years of experience as a hairstylist and creative image consultant.The NPG said the portrait, which is part of a larger series, Call Me By Your Name, captured a moment of mature intimacy that defied conventional representations of physical closeness.The £2,000 third prize went to Byron Mohammad Hamzah, an NHS consultant and photographic artist, for his portrait Jaidi Playing. Part of the series Bunga dan Tembok (The Flower and the Wall: The Stateless Youths of Semporna), the portrait depicts a child, Jaidi, whose head is cradled in the hands of another child.Hamzah has spent the past two years working as a volunteer art and photography teacher with an NGO based in Sabah, East Malaysia, that provides free schooling for stateless and marginalised youth, particularly from the Bajau Laut ethnic group.Jaidi is one of those children. The NPG said the portrait captured a moment of tranquility within a tumultuous and uncertain existence. The judges were drawn to the way the portrait pictured a moment of youthful connection while inviting questions from the details it excludes.View image in fullscreenThird place went to Jaidi Playing by Byron Mohammad Hamzah.Photograph: Byron Mohammad Hamzah/Taylor Wessing PPPThe £8,000 photographic commission to create a new work for the NPG’s collection was awarded to Hollie Fernando, a London- and Brighton-based photographer and director, for her portrait Boss Morris, from the series Hoydenish.The portrait explores the shift in gender equality within morris dancing. Boss Morris is a young, all-female morris side based in Stroud. The dancers are adorned in folkloric dress and make up as they huddle together for a group portrait. The judges commended the image for its striking and otherworldly qualities.The winning portraits will be on display at the NPG as part of the Taylor Wessing photo portrait prize 2025 exhibition, open from 13 November to 8 February 2026. The exhibition also includes a new portrait of the queer activist and advocate Lady Phyll, full name Phyllis Akua Opoku-Gyimah, by last year’s winner of the Taylor Wessing photographic commission, Jesse Navarre Vos.The 2025 judging panel included the photographer and educator Sunil Gupta, the art historian and curator Katy Hessel, the photographer Tim Walker, and Sabina Jaskot-Gill, a senior curator of photography at the NPG.Explore more on these topicsTaylor Wessing photographic portrait prizePhotographyAwards and prizesNational Portrait GallerynewsShareReuse this content"

The resulting film is never anything but likable and fun – though never actually disturbing in the way that it’s surely supposed to be and the ending is fudged and anticlimactic.Yet there’s plenty of enjoyment to be had. Wright accelerates to a sprint for some full-tilt chase sequences; there’s a nice punk aesthetic with protest ’zines being produced by underground rebels; and Wright always delivers those sugar-rush pop slams on the soundtrack, including, of course, theSpencer Davis Group’s Keep on Running. It’s a quirk of fate that The Running Man arrives in the same year asThe Long Walk,also from a King book: a similar idea, only it’s walking not running.Powell plays Ben, an honest, hardworking guy in a dystopian US run by a faceless corporation in the traditional manner. He can’t get work after being blacklisted for calling out unsafe practices but desperately needs cash to buy medicine for his sick daughter. His wife Sheila (Jayme Lawson) is moreover exploited at the club where she works as a waitress-slash-hostess, although King’s original novel is clearer about the distasteful things she needs to do to earn money. In despair, Ben signs up for a top-rated reality TV show called The Running Man; he has to go on the run across the US, hunted by professional killers, and if he can survive for 30 days, he gets a billion dollars. But all too late, he realises that these shark-like fascist TV execs aren’t going to play fair.The show’s wacky studio presenter Bobby T Thompson is played by Colman Domingo, and behind the scenesJosh Brolinis hard-faced producer Dan Killian, who has eerily white teeth. They are more or less familiar personae from the Hunger Games series, but the film alludes also to classic small-screen satires such as Sidney Lumet’s Network and specifically, I think, to Robert Redford’s Quiz Show, particularly in the early scenes in which we see all the lesser programmes that Ben could in theory go in for.Ben realises that he is being set up all along the way, misrepresented as a bad guy, and sneakily subject to recruitment overtures to join further franchise iterations of the show if he plays along with their lies. But wait. Killian is using AI for phoney videos showing Ben declaiming ugly contempt for the public: a level of digital fabrication that King never envisioned when he wrote it. And, if they can fake all that so easily, what is the point of getting anyone to go through all that real-life running at all?It’s an uncomfortable issue that the movie doesn’t entirely solve; as a result The Running Man sometimes feels retro-futurist and steampunky, though it is always watchable and buoyant. Wright has hit a confident stride.The Running Man is out on 12 November in the UK, 13 November in Australia and 14 November in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsAction and adventure filmsThrillersFilm adaptationsStephen KingGlen PowellreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it might just be its most dullStuart HeritageTue 11 Nov 2025 08.56 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 09.13 ESTShareIf there is one tried and true formula when it comes to television, it is this: when you run out of ideas, bring the kids in. This formula is why everything from MasterChef to The Great British Bake Off to Taskmaster has, at some point, bitten the bullet and introduced a junior version. And now it’s time forCome Dine With Meto join the gang.Which is probably a bit late, all said. It took five years for MasterChef to bring in a junior version, and just one for Bake Off. Meanwhile, Come Dine With Me is 20. To call it long in the tooth would be a profound disservice to long teeth.Come Dine With Me: Teens – for that is the title of the new series – just drives this point home further. The contestants who appear are between 16 and 19 years old. This means that they are all younger than Come Dine With Me. Not a single one of them knows what it is to live in a world where Come Dine With Me has yet to be invented. If that doesn’t make your skin sag and your bones creak, I’m not sure what will.Why did it take Come Dine With Me so long to bring in a teen version? The answer, you suspect, probably had something to do with its presentation. The thing that has always set Come Dine With Me apart from its army of imitators is Dave Lamb, who doesn’t so much narrate episodes as audibly roll his eyes at them. In its purest form, Come Dine With Me is raw footage of people doing their best to cook a nice meal while Dave Lamb calls them all idiots. And while that might be funny when your cook is a self-consciously wacky man from Tonbridge, it’s less funny when it’s an innocent teenager.Fortunately, on the basis of Monday’s first episode (of five; a longer run is planned in the near future), Lamb has toned down his Lambiness a little bit. He’s less of an attack dog here and, while this suits the age of the contestants, you can still sometimes hear him choke back on his instincts to be sarcastic.For example, one of the young contestants is Ben, a gym bunny who takes to kissing his own biceps whenever there’s a camera on him. Had Ben been 35, there is a very good chance that Lamb would have ripped him to shreds. But he is a teenager, and even when he admits to thinking that a beef wellington is a type of footwear (an open goal if ever there was one), the best Lamb can manage in response is a strangulated “I get your logic”.That said, maybe he’s just warming up. The joy of Come Dine With Me has always been watching it evolve over the week, with everyone’s quirks and flaws becoming more apparent as the episodes wear on. By Friday, there’s a very good chance that the teenagers will have worn Lamb down. There were even signs of it on Monday, with Lamb screaming “SHUT UP” when two contestants revealed that they had never eaten soup before.A bigger problem, though, is how dull it is to watch. You might put this down to the age of the contestants. They are, after all, blank slates to whom nothing interesting has ever happened; they have had nothing like enough time to build up the levels of resentment necessary to unleash a “What a sad little life, Jane” outburst.But possibly it’s bigger than that. Possibly the format has just ossified. This is far from the first spin-off that Come Dine With Me has attempted. Daytime Come Dine With Me begat primetime Come Dine With Me, which in turn begat Celebrity Come Dine With Me, then Couples Come Dine With Me, and then Come Dine With Me: The Professionals. For a while we even had Come Date with Me, which might as well have just been a gif of Dave Lamb eating himself.Come Dine With Me: Teens might spark to life eventually. One of this week’s intake is a catering student who dresses as Elvis, has no working knowledge of pop culture and brings tubs of Celebrations everywhere he goes. With a little coaxing and a creative edit, he might just blossom into a Come Dine With Me eccentric for the ages. But for now, it doesn’t feel likely. Let’s score it four out of 10 in the back of a taxi when it isn’t listening.Come Dine With Me: Teens is on Channel 4 now.Join Stuart Heritage and other Guardian journalists at a special live event hosted by Nish Kumar on 26 Nov.

It is an investment in imagination, in our shared experience – and in inspiration and joyTue 11 Nov 2025 09.32 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 09.34 ESTShareDurham is a small, beautiful city in the north-east of England that sits in a region of rising poverty and inequality. About 45,000 people, a cathedral, a castle, a university and streets that glow every two years when theLumiere festivalfills them with light and art.Since 2009, Lumiere has brought more than 250 artists from across the world to work in this extraordinary city.Ai Weiweiin the Cathedral’s Chapter House.Fujiko Nakayaon the riverbank.Chila Kumari Singh Burmanin the market square. The festival has reached more than 1.3 million people, drawn £43m into the local economy, and involved nearly 14,000 people in community projects. It worked because it was free, exciting and good. A rare combination.And now it’s over. After 15 years, the lights go out on Lumiere Durham. And with it goes one more piece of the UK’s cultural fabric.The arts sector is crumbling. We’ve lived through decades of neglect. The system that’s meant to support it is broken. Artists are exhausted, Arts Council England follows policy rather than shaping it. Government investment in ACE has fallen by 32% in real terms since 2010. Its main grant-giving platformcollapsed and was out of actionfor four months this year. When Jaguar Land Rover suffered a cyber-attack, the Treasurystepped in with a £1.5bn loan. When the Arts Council site went down, the government offered technical advice but no cash.View image in fullscreenBlinding … Ai Weiwei’s Illuminated Bottle Rack in 2023.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesLocal authorities are broke too. Years of central funding cuts have left them with impossible choices. Social care or sculpture? Bin collections or ballet? We all know what gets dropped when those are the choices.And as we head towards the autumn budget on 26 November, little has been said about what support will be offered to the arts. Industry bodies and campaigners are warning that the coming budget could be a tipping point. Without targeted investment, many organisations will not survive the next financial year. Business rates relief for cultural buildings is due to end. The Shared Prosperity Fund, which replaced EU regional support,is winding down. Local authorities, already on their knees, face further real-terms cuts.Meanwhile, UK Research and Innovation spends less than 2% of its budget on the arts and humanities. Trusts and foundations around the country are closing or turning away new arts applicants. And yet the governmentfinds half a billion poundsfor three major sporting events – the Euros, the Tour de France, and the European Athletics Championships – and another £400m for “grassroots facilities”. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: “Sport tells our story in a way few other things can.”I would strongly argue that it’s the arts that tells our story. It helps us understand who we are and it’s what has always connected us, across time and place. In Durham, for a few nights every two years, the streets are filled, not with division or anger, but with light, laughter and quiet awe. People stand side by side, strangers together, looking up. That’s what art can do.So why has Lumiere ended?It would be easy to blame the new Reform-led council in Durham. But the previous LibDem/Tory coalition started the process. And this government has just cut bursaries to trainee teachers in humanities subjects. The truth is, there is no political party that will commit to the kind of investment needed to keep a living art and culture ecology alive, despite the huge returns in financial and culture value.So where does the real fault lie? With all of us. With the arts community that has failed to convince politicians and the Treasury that art is not a luxury but a public service. And with the wider public who don’t make this an electoral issue.The numbers are there in spades. The arts and culture industry contributes more than £10bn annuallyto the UK economy and£2.8bn each year to the Treasury through taxation, alone.View image in fullscreenCommunal pride … I Love Durham by Jacques Rival in 2019.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAYou can and should count jobs, exports, return on investment and audience numbers. But you can’t count what it feels like to stand in a crowd and be moved, you can’t quantify wonder, inspiration or joy. That’s what we’ve lost.We talk about “funding” as if it’s a favour. It’s not. It’s investment in imagination, in shared experience and in our national story. We invest in trains, hospitals, and clean water because we know they’re essential. Art is essential too.The budget later this month could show whether the government understands that, or not. Sector leaders are calling for a new national arts recovery plan. Not charity but public investment on the same footing as sport or science. Even a small commitment would send a signal that culture matters, that it’s part of how we rebuild our economy and communities.That argument appears to have been lost long ago with Whitehall. But not, it seems, in Durham. People there understood. They came, year after year, in the rain and the cold, to stand together in the light, unified by art. Now the lights are out and what are they left with? Flags and banners?And unless something changes, Lumiere won’t be the last to go dark.Explore more on these topicsArt and designFestivalsArts Council EnglandArts fundingArts policycommentShareReuse this content"

There was even a recent music forum in California calledDeath to Spotify.So the timing is fortuitous for a growing number of independent streaming and music community platforms, such as Nina Protocol, Coda, Subvert, Lissen, Vocana, and just last week a new one launched in the UK: Cantilever. “More people are definitely looking for alternatives,” says Nina Protocol’s chief executive Mike Pollard. “We strongly believe the future of music is independent.”Each of the new platforms have unique identities. Nina Protocol uses an open public network, where artists set their terms and keep 100% of any revenue from downloads; the collectively owned Subvert is intended to be an alternative to Bandcamp, where music files are bought and sold. Cantilever takes inspiration from curated film streaming platforms such as Mubi, offering a limited and rotating number of albums at a time (currently 10, but up to 30).What unites them is curation, a sense of community and an artist-friendly, anti-corporate model. “We think a lot about the dignity of releasing music,” says Pollard. “I don’t think these algorithm-driven reasons for why something’s getting played are very dignified: are you just something that sounds like something they already like? An artist may say, ‘one of my songs did well onSpotifybecause it was put in the most popular sleep playlist’. But maybe the 500,000 people who listened to that track weren’t even awake! And how many of those people know your name, care about you or would buy a ticket to a show?”View image in fullscreenCantilever founder Aaron Skates.Photograph: Courtesy: Aaron SkatesMany of these new services also have written articles and editorial, intending to offer contextual deep dives for a more focused listening experience. “It’s like a music magazine you can listen to,” says Cantilever’s Aaron Skates, an ex-record label worker and music writer who has launched the streaming platform. Skates has managed to pull in an impressive list of independent labels to work with too, such as Warp, Ninja Tune, Domino and Beggars Group labels such as Rough Trade, 4AD and Matador.By having a smaller roster of artists, it means they receive more money. “The pool is far less diluted,” Skates says. “We’re paying out a maximum of 30 artists for all subscriber revenue, versus the 100m tracks on Spotify. Also, we pay on a user-centric basis, so that means your fee will only ever go towards the music that you actually listen to.” Skates gives me an example: if Cantilever was to get 10,000 subscribers at £4.99 a month, that would result in albums on the service receiving £2,000-3,000 each, which he says is “roughly the equivalent of a million Spotify streams”.Spotify says in a company response that it “welcomes and celebrates choice and new perspectives,” but claims: “The narrative that the current system is failing artists is not supported by the facts; more artists are earning more than ever. Rather than just re-dividing the current pie” – through models like Cantilever’s user-centric one – “Spotify is focused on growing it for everyone, increasing the total royalties paid out year after year.”So, is all this new activity rooted in a revolt against the big companies? “I’m wary about saying that it is anti-Spotify,” says Simon Wheeler, director of commercial strategy at Beggars Group. “Perhaps more a disillusionment with the complete commoditisation of music. There’s always a swathe of new entrants to the market, but there’s more coming up that are talking about trying to provide an alternative. The tone of that conversation has changed.”Wheeler does not view these startups as major competition, though. “Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, none of them are going anywhere anytime soon,” he says. “So it’s more like: let’s try and bring something in which is offering something a bit different.” Skates echoes this: “Cantilever is not in any way competitive towards current major DSPs [digital service providers],” he says. “It’s a totally different thing. I don’t expect anybody to cancel their subscription and just have this – it’s an additional thing that tries to give additional value that wasn’t there before.”View image in fullscreenA view of Nina Protocol.Photograph: NinaPollard, on the other hand, “can see a world where Spotify doesn’t exist in the future,” he says. “Where people realise the options given to them aren’t the ones that best serve them.” Although the numbers aren’t quite showing this yet, with Spotify revealing an additional five million paying subscribers in this year’s third quarter report, that’s not to say the interest in alternatives isn’t rising. The five-person team at Nina Protocol is struggling to keep up with inbound interest and Skates says despite only launching a week ago, the interest and listener numbers for Cantilever have “surpassed my expectations”.Pollard suggests there is a wider cultural sea change beginning to take place, one that leaves him hopeful of a brighter future for music culture in the streaming era.Mood Machine by Liz Pelly review – a savage indictment of SpotifyRead more“There’s a growing awareness of how slop-filled everything is getting,” he says. “People are wanting a little more control of what they consume.” He gives the example of users leaving X, formerly Twitter: “They realised, ‘Shit, I don’t need to be here any more.’ Then you understand what it feels like to be more intentional about your choices, instead of just being on everything that you’re told you need to be on to exist. I think people are waking up.”Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingMusic industrySpotifyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inductees describe clashes with organisers and a lack of support from the beginningAlyssa MercanteTue 11 Nov 2025 07.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Nov 2025 07.33 ESTShareVideo games have long struggled with diversification and inclusivity, so it was no surprise when the Game Awards host and producer Geoff Keighley announced the Future Class programme in 2020. Its purpose was to highlight a cohort of individuals working in video games as the “bright, bold and inclusive future” of the industry.Considering the widespread reach of the annual Keighley-led show, which saw an estimated 154m livestreams last year, Future Class felt like a genuine effort. Inductees were invited to attend the illustrious December ceremony, billed as “gaming’s Oscars”, featured on the official Game Awards website, and promised networking opportunities and career advancement advice. However, the programme reportedly struggled from the start. Over the last couple of years, support waned. Now, it appears the Game Awards Future Class has been wholly abandoned.This is the second year in a row Future Class has not announced a new cohort: there are usually 50 inductees across various games industry disciplines, including writing, development, journalism and community management.As reported by Game Developer, organiser Emily Weir confirmed they “are not planning a new Future Class for [2025] and do not have any active programming plans for Future Class”.Previous Future Class inductees say this comes after years of internal advocacy and struggles to improve the programme. With the video game industry wrestling with another culture war over diversity, equity, and inclusivity initiatives (DEI), some members of the Future Class feel they were used for positive publicity, then cast aside when DEI was no longer in vogue.View image in fullscreenThe 2024 ceremony of the Game awards.Photograph: Frank Micelotta/Picturegroup/Shutterstock“We were effectively props,” game producer Dianna Lora, who was inducted into the first Future Class in 2020, said over video call. “Once we got to the Game Awards (most people flew in from other countries, which was expensive), we showed up, and it felt like we were pushed to the side door … We found out later that Keighley had a party in another room with all the influencers and industry people. You know where Future Class met that day? At a Starbucks.”“No one from official leadership even showed up until the meet-up was basically over,” Future Class member and RetconGamescreative director Jes Negrón said of that Starbucks meeting. “We were pretty bummed about just being cast aside.”Elsewhere at that 2021 ceremony, Lora, community manager Natalie Checo, podcast host Kahlief Adams, and other Future Class inductees’ seats were behind one of the camera risers, completely obstructing their view.Future Class inductees receive programme perks for the next 12 months: a ticket to the Game Awards (alumni were given discounts to buy tickets), and access to career advancement opportunities. Several people referred to the early career-focused events as chats with high-profile industry members such as former Nintendo president Reggie Fils-Aimé and Xbox head Phil Spencer, rather than proper mentorship programmes.“It felt like Keighley just called a bunch of his friends to do Zoom calls,” Lora said. “It was inspiring to have these conversations, but that’s really as far as it went.”Lora was one of several Future Class members who urged Keighley and Weir to improve the programme.View image in fullscreenWriter Emma Kidwell attending the Game awards in 2022.Photograph: Scott Kirkland/PictureGroup for The Game Awards/Shutterstock“They fought for everything the 2023 class got: the Future class mixer, [them] putting us up in a hotel for two nights, covering the flight … everything that I got was a result of my previous classmates,” writer and 2023 inductee Emma Kidwell said of previous Future Class inductees. More recent inductees praised the mentorship opportunities.But 2023 also saw a high-profile clash between the Future Class and Keighley, which members believe accelerated the programme’s demise. In November, in the wake of increasing media coverage of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, more than 70 Future Class memberssigned an open letterrequesting a statement be read at the December ceremony expressing support for Palestine and calling for a ceasefire. Though it gainedmedia attentionand was posted in the Future Class’s Discord, of which both Keighley and Weir belong, the letter was ignored.Not long after, several Future Class members gave a virtual presentation to Keighley and Weir, acknowledging the importance of the programme while expressing concerns about its “goals, structure, and sustainability”. They offered suggestions for how to improve both the programme and the awards ceremony in general, such as featuring more female presenters, improved accessibility options, and an acknowledgment ofthe recent deluge of layoffs in the industry). Younès Rabii, a 2022 inductee, said that Keighley was visibly frustrated during the call, while another member said he was “incensed”.Keighley and Weir did not respond to a request for comment.Every Future Class member who spoke to the Guardian expressed varying levels of frustration with the programme and its untimely ending. “It’s sad that we were part of something great, that has amazing people, that was left by the wayside,” said accessibility consultant Steve Saylor. “I’m not mad, I’m disappointed.” Many believed the programme was disbanded because the inductees pushed for a better Future Class. “You have the influence, you have the power, and you can change sh*t,” Lora said, “But ever since [we pushed back] it was like, ‘This is too much trouble, might as well peace out’.” Checo added: “As a result of advocating for ourselves (the very thing that we were inducted for), we were punished for doing the same thing that they ostensibly celebrated us for.”View image in fullscreenGeoff Keighley also hosts the annual Summer Game Fest showcase.Photograph: Frank Micelotta/PictureGroup/ShutterstockA few members wondered about the sponsorships associated with the programme (a video highlighting a 2023 inductee was presented by Old Spice) and if they were just being “tokenised” to help the programme make more money. (Presenting aone-minute trailer at Keighley’s 2024 summer games showcasereportedly cost $250,000, and sources say the Game Awards is even more expensive.) “They didn’t mention us at the 2022 Game Awards, except for a huge sponsorship that they apparently got in the name of the Future Class, which none of us were told about, and certainly didn’t see any money from,” said Negrón.At some point, the Future Class page was removed from the Game Awards site, meaning there is no official archive of its members. “Not only are they discontinuing the programme, but they’ve also eliminated any way for us to claim the honour that they provided,” Checo said.“Marginalised people need accolades because it pushes them to at least be on the same starting level that you or I might have,” said Kidwell. “Now people can’t put that on their résumés.” Negrón was curious about the thought process behind it all, saying: “Don’t gather some of the most brilliant activists in the industry, treat us like crap, and then expect us to do nothing about it.”Many believe Future Class’s failure will serve as a cogent reminder that allyship without proper support is simply performative. And for some, not all is lost. Midnight Hour founder Elaine Gómez said the “camaraderie and community that was created by bringing nearly 200 developers and creatives from underrepresented communities together” was the best part of it all. Meanwhile, the official Future Class Discord is still going – and more active now than it has been in the last year or so.Explore more on these topicsGamesGaming awardsAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year, a GoFundMe page had been set up to help her in the wake of “life-threatening infections” and a number of falls. She had also been diagnosed with dementia.Kirkland had started her career as a model before studying acting with classmates including Dustin Hoffman, Robert de Niro and Al Pacino. After acting off-Broadway in the early 1960s, she also became part of Andy Warhol’s The Factory and the artist put her in 1964 drama The 13 Most Beautiful Women where she appeared nude and tied to a chair.She went on to star in the western Blue with Terence Stamp and underground sexually explicit thriller Coming Apart in the 60s while also appearing on stage in Terrence McNally’s Sweet Eros as a kidnapped woman where she spent the entirety of the production without any clothes.“I think I’m more European in personality,” she once said inan interview. “My attitude is always one of sensuality, aggressive enthusiasm and a kind of outrageousness in my expression. I suppose if I wanted to be the girl next door, I could have been. I think America is confused by someone who appears to be sexual and spiritual at the same time.”The 1970s saw her take on small roles in The Way We Were, A Star is Born and The Sting on the big screen while she also appeared on the small screen in Starsky & Hutch, Charlie’s Angels and Kojak.After the 80s saw her feature alongside Goldie Hawn in Private Benjamin, she received an Oscar nomination for her fact-based comedy drama Anna after a grassroots campaign. She also won a Golden Globe for the role. “At the Oscars, there were all these movie stars emerging from their limos, and then there was me,”she said. “I felt like Cinderella.”She played a stripper in 1989’s High Stakes and had cosmetic surgery for the film which she later regretted as she “almost died from them”. She later removed them and founded the Kirkland Institute for Implant Survival Syndrome.The 1990s saw her play herself in Robert Altman’s The Player and also appear in JFK, Excess Baggage and EdTV while later credits included Bruce Almighty, Factory Girl and 80 for Brady.Televisionroles also included Felicity, Roseanne and Murder, She Wrote.Kirkland also worked as a teacher of acting, with students including Sandra Bullock, Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli.“My life is not about acting,” she once said. “It’s about expressing my vision of life.

On-set conversions to vegetarianism are not uncommon. James Cromwell, now a prominent vegan activist, gave up all foods involving animal products on the second day of filming George Miller’s Babe in 1995. “I broke for lunch before everybody else,” he said. “All the animals I’d worked with that morning were on the table, cut up, fricasseed, roasted and seared.

I am quite quite confident, quite happy in my skin and I’ve always been able to make sure that I’m heard. That being said … there are plenty of things I remember that were completely inappropriate – to be asked to do that, to be directed in that way.“But my view is changing about it as well, because I’m now having fantastic experiences with intimacy coordinators. However, that being said, I’ve also had a shit example where someone just made it so weird and so awkward and really wasn’t helpful and kind of was just like wanting to be a part of the set in a way that wasn’t helpful.”Pugh added: “It’s a job that’s still figuring itself out. But I will say that I’ve been able to understand better meaning now through working with great [intimacy coordinators] in sex scenes. Finding the story of what it is, what kind of sex is it, how do you touch each other, how long have you been having sex for. All of these things really matter, when you are trying to build a relationship that’s been going for 10 years. I’d never thought of it like that before, because sex scenes are so awkward for everybody on set.”Pugh has joined a number of high-profile figures commenting on the role of intimacy coordinators on film shoots. Jennifer Lawrence said thatshe declined the optionto use one for her sex scenes for Lynne Ramsay’s Die My Love as co-star Robert Pattinson was “not pervy”, while Mikey Madison, who won the best actress Oscar for her lead role as a sex worker in the Sean Baker-directed Anora, likewise said that she had shot scenes without an intimacy coordinator, saying that she and co-star Mark Eydelshteyn “decided it would be best to just keep it small”.Gwyneth Paltrow also said she had been unhappy with intimacy co-ordinator input on sex scenes she filmed with Timothée Chalamet on Marty Supreme, saying she felt “as an artist, very stifled”.Madison and Paltrow’s comments led to backlash, with former Channel 4 drama head Caroline Hollick called Paltrow “irresponsible”. Pugh’s position is more conciliatory, saying: “When I worked with a fantastic coordinator, I was like, ‘Oh, this is what I’ve been missing, understanding the dance of intimacy’ as opposed to just shooting a sex scene. There are good ones and bad ones, and it’s through the good ones that I have learned how effective it can really be.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFlorence PughSexLouis TherouxnewsShareReuse this content"

He also played Hanbei opposite Mifune’s Sanjuro in Kurosawa’s 1961 samurai film Yojimbo, regarded as one of the director’s greatest works.A year later, Kurosawa reunited his leading men in Sanjuro, the sequel to Yojimbo. The film famously ends with a sword fight in which Sanjuro slices through Hanbei’s torso with lightning speed, unleashing acascade of blood– a display of graphic violence that shocked audiences at the time. Kurosawa later denied claims that the geyser of blood had been caused by a malfunctioning prop. Whether it happened by accident or design, the scene had an enduring influence on action films and video games.View image in fullscreenNakadai performs during a rehearsal in Tokyo in May 2025.Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/Getty ImagesBorn into a working-class family in Chiba, east of Tokyo, in 1932, Nakadai decided to take up acting as an alternative to a prohibitively expensive university education, enrolling in acting school in the early 1950s.One of his first major film roles – reportedly the result of a chance meeting with Kobayashi when Nakadai was working as a shop assistant in Tokyo – was an uncredited part as a prisoner in Kobayashi’s 1953 war drama The Thick-Walled Room – the start of a partnership that would last three decades.In later life Nakadai, whose stage credits included Death of a Salesman, Don Quixote, Hamlet and Macbeth, helped nurture young actors with his wife and fellow actor, Yasuko Miyazaki, with whom he opened the Mumeijuku school in Tokyo in 1975.In 2015, Nakadai was awarded the Order of Culture –Japan’s highest honour for contributions to the arts and science – by the emperor. The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Nakadai had performed on stage as recently as this year.Explore more on these topicsFilmJapanAkira KurosawaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

When he runs out of victims, the young Persian queen Shahrazad volunteers but stalls her own murder by telling the king one captivating tale after another – and those become the stories we’re reading.AsJeanette Wintersonputs it in her new book – a dizzying whirligig of memoir, history, philosophy, politics and self-help, loosely tied to commentary on the Nights – Shahrazad’s feat of creativity “refuses the present emergency – the contrived drama of a powerful man”. The echo of life in the Trump era is deliberate; for Winterson, the means by which Shahrazad changes her predicament holds out hope for a progressive politics currently losing ground to “radical-rightwing thuggery”. “A better story starts with a better story,” she writes. “Reason will not win the day. Without imagination nothing changes.”Each chapter opens with a pithy retelling of one of Shahrazad’s tales, spritzed with 21st-century idiom (“The Vizier … has no manosphere where he can vent”), before giving way to wide-ranging reflections on anything and everything, from the history of eugenics, to 13th-century Mali, to the awfulness of the trouser suits “preferred by some CEO types and lots of female politicians”. As opinions on matters big and small fly past, the tone evokes by turns a party political broadcast, Radio 4’s Thought for the Day, an old friend setting the world to rights. “A global economy that works for the many is not a childish dream … There’s always enough money for a weapons factory.” A brisk analysis of the misogyny of Mozart’s Così Fan Tutte concludes that it’s pointless to cancel dead artists (“We’re not marrying them”). At one point, Winterson tells us that compassion is wasted on sex offenders: “There is such a thing as evil, and we should not excuse it or forgive it.”It feels thrillingly direct, even when her views are run of the mill: the internet fosters division because “millions of followers … cluster round ideas rotten at the core – like flies on a carcass”, while smartphones lull us into photographing our lives without actually seeing anything. “I am sure people are addicted to falling in love because it’s one of the scant times when we really do look and look and look,” says Winterson, writing of how a new lover sharpens our perception; but the best remedy, she suggests, is art, which lets us “get closer to ourselves”, unlike the dopamine mill of TikTok (“a miserable way to live”).More unorthodox is Winterson’s embrace of big tech’s potential to redefine selfhood, a subject previously addressed in her essay collection 12 Bytes (2021) and her sex-robot novel Frankissstein (2019). The metaverse enables “the you that is not met, or served, in the usual world”. Nanobots in our bloodstream, like silicon chips in our brains, let us be “no longer dependent on a body, or what a body depends on” – which doesn’t mean not being human, “unless you think being human begins and ends with biology”. As for sentient AI, bring it on: “Our game of thrones will be over … What would a non-biological entity want with gold, cars, private jets, guns and land grab?”It’s hard to reconcile this with the general thrust of her politics, though the idea that fallen humanity might learn a thing or two from a disembodied redeemer perhaps bears the trace of Winterson’s evangelical upbringing, written about elsewhere and revisited here. Her adoptive mother hoped she’d be a missionary, and maybe there’s a trace of that, too, in the infectious urgency of this freewheeling disquisition.For Shahrazad, art makes the difference between life and death, and it’s never not been essential, Winterson argues. “Who comes home, after a long day hunting and gathering just to stay alive, and settles down to paint pictures on the wall? Humans! And first we had to make the crayons. So don’t tell me art is a luxury.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Fosse, who is also a poet and an essayist, and one of the most widely performed playwrights in the world, follows his own path. A case in point: Septology (2019-2021), published across three volumes, running to more than 800 pages, containing a single sentence. Forget formalism, though; his fictions, often set in fjordic Norway, are disintegration loops, quiet and incantatory, emotionally overwhelming.At fewer than 120 pages, Vaim, his first new work since winning the Nobel, is a wisp of a thing. Divided into three sections, each narrated by a different character, it begins with Jatgeir sailing on a small boat from the small town of Vaim to the big city of Bjørgvin. His mission is to buy a needle and thread to fix a missing button. It’s a long journey and, not just at one shop but at two, he gets royally ripped off, being charged far over the odds for a single spool. He huffs and seethes, but says nothing to the storekeepers themselves. What a hick, we might think. What a chump.Jatgeir, part Prufrock, part sitcom sadsack, lives alone in the house of his dead parents. Its curtains are beige, his hair is greying, occasionally he trims his beard. Far from rich, he is invisible to the women around him. He often finds himself harking back to Eline, the “secret love of my youth”. When he named his boat after her, the locals had giggled and she had moved away. How surprising, then – absurd, even – that on the night of his sewing thread humiliation, he is roused from his sleep by Eline calling his name. She’d like him, she says, to rescue her from her fisher husband. Back to Vaim they sail.This could be quite the romance, were it nota Fosse novel. The story stops, is picked up by Jatgeir’s only friend – the religiously minded Elias – only to stop again. This time the narrative baton is passed on to Frank, the husband Eline had left in the first section. Eline herself, though central to everything that happens, is elusive. More about her may emerge later (Vaim is the first volume in a planned trilogy), but all that’s revealed here is that she had been “such a silly girl”, left home young and worked for a rich family. Her ability to make men do her bidding is unnerving, a species of sorcery; she seems spectral, a figure from medieval dream poetry.Ambiguity mists the whole novel. Jatgeir wonders if Eline is a mirage, describes their encounter as “incomprehensible, inconceivable”, reflects on how “a dream is a dream and reality is reality, but in a way reality has always been, yes, no, no not like a dream, but reality has had something dreamlike about it too probably my whole life, reality is in the dream the way the boat is in the water”. Scenes take place in the gloaming, when day commingles with night. There are mysterious knocks on doors, talk of ghosts, even mention of an institution that often appears in Fosse’s fiction: a madhouse.How can prose that is so simple – cushions are ‘nice’, work is ‘trusty’ – pulse with such feeling?The characters are blurry and dissolving, too. Eline, whose name looks close to Elias, wasn’t born Eline. Jatgeir, whose name isn’t Jatgeir, can’t remember if a niece is called Gudrun Anna or Anna Gudrun. The men, tending to the passive, are likened to “old maids”; the female characters are purposeful and “masculine”. Meanwhile, time is bent and inscrutable – bar a fleeting reference to a car, the book could have been set 100 or more years ago. Invocations of yesteryear and the old days abound, but it’s often left unclear if what’s being alluded to actually happened far more recently.Fosse has spoken of his fiction as “mystical realism”. For all the roaming metaphysics and magnificently recursive, hypnagogic rhythms of this one-sentence novel, it’s those passages grounded in the everyday that pop – scenes featuring meatballs and rice pudding, comparisons between American and European suitcases, Jatgeir admitting that for much of his life he had felt closer to boats than to any woman. (His own he treats with masturbatory care – “I laid my hand flat on a board of the boat and gently rubbed my hand back and forth along the board and then I sat there and I sort of half-dozed off”.)“All was strange”: that’s what Jatgeir hopes will be written on his tombstone. It’s also the abiding feeling upon finishing Vaim. How can prose that is so simple – cushions are “nice”, work is “trusty” – pulse with such feeling? How can it be so littoral, incarnating the light and spray and tidal tempos of these seascapes with such power? And how can a novelist make a reader feel so lost and so found at the same time? It is strange. A strange miracle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

By contrast, this Caravaggio is a much more orthodox art-documentary treatment of its subject, playing to the strengths that the EoS films have built up over the years: beautifully crisp and detailed closeups of the work, well-informed and articulate talking-heads, and a nicely judged overall approach that is intelligent but not indigestible.To be fair, this particular artist is well worked territory, so to spruce things up, the joint directors, David Bickerstaff and Phil Grabsky, cut in sequences with a monologuing actor, Jack Bannell, in character as Caravaggio. The aim is to fill in the void of the painter’s personality, of which, outside police and court reports, very little is known. Bannell certainly gives it his all and, tricked out in full beard and makeup effect facial wound, definitely looks the part – alarmingly so when the film cuts toa shot of David with the Head of Goliath, which gruesomely contains Caravaggio’s own features on the severed head. It’s not a totally successful device: there’s occasionally something of the one-man-fringe-play about it, but in its favour it gets across the trigger points in Caravaggio’s life, particularly the final few years when legal troubles forced him to regularly move, from Rome to Naples to Malta, and back again.Of course, the main issue is how well the film makes sense of its subject’s life and work, and this Caravaggio is well up to scratch; it’s tough, of course, to probe every corner of such a titan’s output, but there’s interesting material here on the step-by-step progression of Caravaggio’s early career, as well as his seemingly committed Christian faith. LikeKen Burns’s three-hour treatise on Leonardo(currently on BBC iPlayer), Caravaggio makes room for explicitly religious commentary, something that has not always been a given in the secularised art-criticism world, even when the work is obviously deeply Christian. It is perhaps a reflection of the times we are living in, but it is undeniably a benefit to the understanding of the art itself.Caravaggiois in cinemas from 11 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsCaravaggioChristianityReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It has all the ingredients: good-looking leads (Alex Pettyfer, Eva De Dominici), picturesque locations (the film is mainly set in Puglia, and benefits from funding from the region), lightly comic music underlining the scenes, charismatic veterans in supporting roles (“withToni Collette… and Andy Garcia”), transparently engineered third-act jeopardy, and so on and so forth. But like a failed soufflé on Bake Off, it never rises to the necessary level.Pettyfer plays the hero, a romance novelist named Ian. (Yes, Ian. The sitcom Peep Show made great capital out of the ludicrousness of naming a baby Ian in the 21st century. Without wishing to do down the name, it’s an odd choice and speaks to a wider tone-deafness in the script.) In fact the plotline for Under the Stars is the inverse of, say, a great Richard Curtis one, in which implausible scenarios feel wholly realistic: there’s nothing particularly impossible about Under the Stars, and yet it all feels clunkily unlikely.Perhaps none of this would matter if there was more of that elusive chemistry between the leads, but despite physically resembling the results of an AI prompt for Attractive RomanticComedyProtagonists, observing Pettyfer and De Dominici’s characters attempt to strike a spark is like watching someone trying to light a fire using damp toilet roll and a magnifying glass. Early on, Collette’s novelist character is watching a television adaptation of her work. “Some moron has made a miniseries out of Last Lovers in Paradise,” she sniffs. “I mean, the actors are trying their best, but I’m telling you it is mortifying.” Well, quite.Under the Stars is on digital platforms from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsComedy filmsToni ColletteComedyAndy GarcíareviewsShareReuse this content"

Writing, and playing, the role of reformed city fraudster turned pugilist Danny Goode, as well as directing the low-budget British drama that results, Mark Hampton sets up a potentially fertile collision of these two opposed elements. But cornering himself into an ultra-earnest tale of redemption, he lets his film absorb a few too many cheap cliche shots.Danny is released after a three-year stretch for cooking the books; and, as a former high-rolling member of a late-night/early-morning gambling crew called the Breakfast Club, he now must accept diminished circumstances. This means a poky rental flat and, after his licence to trade is revoked, a restaurant job washing dishes arranged by an old friend, Jon (Mark Tunstall). His ex-wife, Chloe (Sarah Diamond), has the divorce papers ready to go, but Danny is keen to build bridges with his son, Ben (Artie Wong). He promises the kid a swanky holiday, so one more high-risk play is his only means of coming good: entering a £10,000 prize fight organised by local hardman Billy (Gary Davidson Jnr), who trains at Jon’s gym.Hampton has an easy screen charisma, and his handsomely shot film appears to be in fighting shape. But it proves sluggish on its feet, taking far too long over sappy and generic family wranglings that feel like EastEnders offcuts. It doesn’t start to make dramatic full contact until it is almost too late, outlining Danny’s gambling addiction (there is a nice scene in which access to banking apps makes it surprisingly easy to raise the £5,000 entry stake needed). Or, in counterpoint, how his business acumen allows him to turn around Jon’s flagging restaurant.Unlicensed’s straightforwardness suggests it may be a personal project for Hampton. But it feels less committed to exploring its protagonist’s compulsions and foibles than in paving an easy road for his comeback. Despite the prospect hanging over Danny of owing the local hard nut in perpetuity, the boxing bout plays out in the time-honoured Rocky manner. Betting on the worst-case outcome might have made for a more interesting film.Unlicensed is on digital platforms from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBoxingThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Secret Santa Project, based on a book by Tracy Bloom and set in a London council’s accounting department, manages a brief flicker of cosy charm in places but in truth it’s bit of a Christmas clunker.Like Richard Curtis’sLove Actuallythis is a film with a handful of interwoven storylines. Samantha Giles plays Diane, the grinchy head of accounts who in the tradition of London romcoms walks to work over Westminster bridge past Big Ben; she would love to see Christmas cancelled and save the council a few pounds. Her husband Leon (Mark Williams) is a panto director, and Diane suspects he’s got a thing going on with Snow White. This plot line is not a million miles from Emma Thompson’s in Love Actually, but it bungles along to a clumsy resolution lacking the poignancy of Thompson slipping off to the bedroom for a cry on Christmas Day.At work, Diane’s number two Jerry (Barrie Ryan English) has fallen for a man he met in a coffee shop. Perky graduate trainee Jolene (Myla Carmen) attempts to sprinkle Christmas joy with her plan for secret Santa – exchanging acts of kindness instead of less-than-a-fiver novelty socks. The best performance is from ex-EastEnders actor Charlie Brooks as Stacey, a single mum whose new boyfriend is clearly a total douche.There are a few things worth writing home about. The film nails the dynamics of an office where people have worked with each other for years and tolerate each other’s foibles with an eye-roll or side-eye. But its happy endings feel unearned and may leave a sickly feeling similar to eating three-day-old turkey leftovers on a sherry hangover.The Secret Santa Project is on digital platforms from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsRomance filmsChristmasComedyFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But that’s enough about Birmingham. There’s plenty more where that came from in Death to the West (Midlands), an adroit solo debut from the self-styled “amusing Arab”, the son of Middle Eastern incomers now addressing in standup his complex sense of belonging. The whole show balances his Brummie and his Iraqi identities, with reference to his stereotypical immigrant dad, his growing up during the second Iraq war, and – finally – visiting his so-called homeland as an adult.It’s an extremely polished introduction to Al-Habib and his talents; perhaps a little too smooth and slickly engineered, wanting some grit in its machine. A factor in that may be its flirting-with-formulaic familiarity as a second-generation narrative. Which isn’t to doubt the truth and emotional significance to our host of the stories he tells of feeling shame at his Iraqi background when the country was at war with the UK and of trying to pass as white British to fit in. If any of this sounds tormented, it certainly isn’t in the telling: Al-Habib’s touch couldn’t be lighter as he cracks wise about Margaret Thatcher’s contraceptive value, Jack Grealish as a Brummie archetype, and how his father learned to love Jewish people.In the former Footlights man’s hands, this stuff twinkles like sunlight on the Tigris (or should that be the Grand Union Canal?), as he joshes us about Islamic terrorism and the imminent Muslim takeover of the UK. Ballast is provided by one traumatic story of his father’s life under Saddam (later deployed as an unlikely cautionary tale at a UK theme park), and elsewhere by incidences of everyday racism directed at the seven-year-old Hasan and towards his stoical dad – whose relationship with his son is sketched here in an understated but eloquent filial portrait. It’s an adept and enjoyable show, finally, about what belonging looks like for a man suspended between the Middle East and the West Midlands.AtSoho theatre, London, until 15 November.Explore more on these topicsComedySoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

This week sees the start of previews for Ivo van Hove’s production of Miller’s first Broadway hit, All My Sons, which has had half a dozen major revivals over the past five decades. Indeed, you could argue that Miller is more honoured here than at home. On his death it was said in the Times Literary Supplement: “He was mourned in England as a revered contemporary, in America as a figure from a bygone age.”Why this division? One answer, supplied by All My Sons, is that Miller analysed the American psyche while being steeped in European tradition. It is difficult to discuss this particular play without giving away the plot. It is, however, an open secret that it hinges on the unproven accusation that Joe Keller, as a wartime manufacturer of aircraft engines, allowed faulty cylinder heads to be dispatched to the air force knowing they could endanger life.Immediately this makes one think of Ibsen. In The Pillars of Society,rarely seen these days, a wealthy shipowner allows his detested brother-in-law to go to sea in a rotten vessel only to discover that his own son is also on board. In his brilliant book on Miller’s plays, Christopher Bigsby also references The Wild Duck and sees in Joe’s son, Chris, an embodiment of the flawed idealist comparable to Ibsen’s Gregers Werle. But Bigsby hits the nail on the head when he says that Miller, exactly like Ibsen, blends the tragic and the comic and shows the present for ever haunted by the past.View image in fullscreenPresent haunted by the past … Bill Pullman, Colin Morgan, Sally Field and Jenna Coleman in the 2019 production of All My Sons at the Old Vic.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhile Miller is clearly indebted to Ibsen, he is also a profoundly American writer. I once had the temerity to ask him, in the course of a public interview about his autobiography, Timebends, whether he had ever considered relocating to Europe since at home he had endured political persecution and critical hostility. I remember Miller looking faintly aghast at the idea and stressing his commitment to his native land.No American critic has written better about this than Harold Clurman who, in his review of the original 1947 production of All My Sons, made a vital distinction between a play’s material and its meaning, and saw in Miller “a moral talent with a passionate persistence that resembles that of the New England preacher who fashioned our first American rhetoric”.Given that All My Sons is Ibsenite and American, how does one stage it? Looking back at three past productions, I am struck by their social realism and strong performances. Michael Blakemore’s 1981 production, also at Wyndham’s, stressed the play’s folksy back-yard humour and was expertly played, with Colin Blakely lending Joe a stocky muscularity and Rosemary Harris investing his wife, Kate, with the look of a blooming martyr.View image in fullscreenStark … Mark Strong, centre, in A View from the Bridge by Arthur Miller at Young Vic in 2014, directed by Ivo van Hove.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHoward Davies, who had first directed the play at the National in 2000, did an even better productionin the West End in 2010with David Suchet, like Blakely, stressing Joe’s back-yard bonhomie and Zoë Wanamaker subtly suggesting that Kate was as swathed in pretence as her husband.Arthur Miller: ‘My legacy? Some good parts for actors’Read moreMore recently, in 2019, Jeremy Herrin directed itat the Old Vicwith two American actors in the lead: Bill Pullman as a strenuously self-justifying Joe, and Sally Field, encasing herself in her cardigan as if it were a protective shield, as a superb Kate.So what can we expect from Van Hove? Given that in his celebrated 2014 Young Vic revival ofA View from the Bridgehe dispensed with Red Hook realism to stage the play in a stark black box, I doubt we will get an Ohio back yard that looks as if it were a Norman Rockwell cover for an American magazine. With Bryan Cranston as Joe, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Paapa Essiedu as Kate and Chris, we can also expect a fresh take on the Keller family. But, however it turns out, I hope the production recognises that Miller is a deeply American moralist with a bias to the European past, from Aeschylus to Ibsen.All My Sons is atWyndham’s theatre, London, 14 November to 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreArthur MillerWest EndIvo van HovefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was breakfast time and I wanted a drink, but the long menu of fruit juices was baffling. Apart from pineapple (abacaxi) and mango (manga), I’d never heard of any of the drinks. What arebacuri,buritiandmuruci? And what aboutmangaba,tucumãanduxi? Even my phone was confused.Uxi, it informed me, is a Zulu word meaning “you are”.But then I started to recognise names that I’d heard on my six-week voyage from the Andes to the mouth of the Amazon. There wascupuaçu. I’d picked one of those cacao-like pods in a Colombian village about 1,900 miles (3,000km) back upriver. And even further away, in Peru, there wasaçaí: a purple berry growing high up on a wild palm. The Amazon, it seems, is vast and varied, but also remarkably similar along its astonishing length.Belém and islands map, BrazilMy six-week Amazon adventure had begun with a conference on sustainable tourism in Peru. It was 2023 and Belém, on the other side of South America, had been declared the location for theCop30conference. Determined to cut down on air miles, I set off downriver, heading towards Belém, using public river boats, all the time seeking out people who were working to preserve this incredible environment. I did night walks with guides who blasted powdered concoctions up my nose to make me “alert” (not that kind of concoction – herbal stuff). I swam across the river (then enjoyed lots of electric eel stories) and repeatedly had the disorienting experience of not knowing which country I was in. Until I reached Manaus, I met only a handful of visitors, but I was always wondering about tourism and its potential role in the Amazonian future.The idea that tourism might help in the battles against the climate crisis and biodiversity loss is one fraught with problems. Flying is the most CO2-intensive way of travelling. Tourism is a luxury. Surely the only way to save the planet is to stop privileged outsiders flying around the globe, especially for self-indulgent rainforest tours?The ranching life for these people is brutally hard and unrewarding. They want a way out, but are trapped in a cycle of deforestationOn the Mamori, a tributary of the great river in central Brazil, surrounded by the smoke from forest fires, I was given a salutary answer to this by a schoolboy. “My father is a rancher,” he told me. “We burn the forest to get grass to feed our cattle. In emergencies we can also sell the cleared land, but not the jungle. That’s worthless. But I don’t want to be a rancher, I want to be a tour guide.”View image in fullscreenAn old port area of Belém.Photograph: Ricardo Lima/Getty ImagesWhen I later met his school teacher, he confirmed that other local teenagers felt the same. “To be honest, this generation don’t want the hard physical work of clearing land; they’d prefer tourism jobs. The problem is we don’t get many visitors and never see any NGOs or nature projects.” The ranching life for these people is brutally hard and unrewarding. They want a way out, but are trapped in a cycle of deforestation.Açaí is making good money for small farmers. They can grow it around their houses mixed in with other treesBack in Belém, having downed my juice, I moved on through the market, looking for food. My local guide was Junior who recommended the local favourite: fried fish and açaí berry sauce. “Açaí is making good money for small farmers,” he told me. “They can grow it around their houses mixed in with other trees.”In the Peruvian village where I had first come across açaí, the people explained that the fruit had only ever been an “emergency” wild food for them, but they were happy to find that it now commanded good prices. Their old way of life, hunting river turtles, had ended because of declining numbers and a government ban. Poaching inside the national park had been the only alternative until açaí saved them.Junior and I went off to explore the various river islands beyond the Belém waterfront, heading for the tiny green atoll of Ilha do Combu. The little wooden ferry took us up a narrow creek lined with abundant vegetation and watchful kingfishers where we met Charles, who runs a small handicraft shop and sells his own açaí. “It goes with anything,” he told me. “We can eat it with fish or make ice-cream.”View image in fullscreenIlha do Cumbu, off Belém.Photograph: Kevin RushbyWe walked through mixed groves of palms, cacao and dozens of other tree varieties. Up above, scarlet macaws clattered around and a family of giant fruit bats complained about the noise. This productive mosaic is a way to provide income and benefit nature. I picked up a beautiful seed the size of an egg. “Rubber,” said Charles, “We do collect it, but not in commercial quantities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hailed as a wonder product, it started an exploitation stampede. Fortunes were made. At Iquitos, 2,700 miles upriver from Belém, merchants imported bottled drinking water from Belfast and sent their laundry to Lisbon.View image in fullscreenHarvesting açaí berries involves having a head for heights.Photograph: Kevin RushbyFor most Amazonian people, however, rubber was a disaster. Forced into ever harsher labour conditions, tribes became dispersed and broken, their languages and cultures mangled. After seeds were smuggled out to Asia in 1876 – via Kew Gardens, where they were germinated – the boom ended, but the aftermath was bitter resentment and suspicion.Açaí has not had the same impact, but is not without controversies. Overblown hyperbole about superfoods has dented its reputation. On Ilha do Combu, however, Charles wasn’t worried. Local demand was strong and prices good.Next day, I took the ferry out to Ilha Cotijuba near the mouth of the river. The Amazon had one last novelty to impress me with. On the far side of the island I found a small cafe on a beach. The owner, Lena, served a delicious lunch: river fish baked in banana leaves, a pineapple ceviche and a dessert with some pale green berries that I’ve never seen before.“Like açaí,” she told me. “But different.”Hidden away on those islands, the Amazon still holds secrets.The trip was provided by sustainable tourism specialistSumak Travel, which offers tailor-made trips to Brazil and the rest of Latin AmericaExplore more on these topicsAmazon holidaysBrazil holidaysFood and drinkSouth America holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 11 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareI’ve accidentally bought too many boxes of dried lasagne sheets. How can I use them up?Jemma,by emailThis is sounding all too familiar to Jordon Ezra King, the man behind theA Curious Cooknewsletter. “It’s funny Jemma asks this,” he says, “because I was in this exact same situation earlier this year after over-catering for a client dinner.” The first thing to say is there’s no immediate rush, he adds: “It sounds obvious, but you can keep the boxes for a long time.” Fortunately for Jemma and her shopping mishap, however, lasagne sheets are also flexible, and their shape doesn’t have to dictate what you do with them.With this in mind, soupy things are good to get on the weekly dinner rotation, be thatpasta e cecior minestrone, the latter being the go-to of choice for Mattie Taiano, chef and co-owner withRavneet GillofGina’sin Chingford, Essex: “Just bash up the lasagne sheets with a rolling pin and chuck in all the bits.” Theo Randall, chef-patron ofCucina Italiana at the InterContinental London Park Lane, meanwhile, would break the pasta lengthways and cook it in boiling salted water: “Add that to a ragu-like sauce with some of the pasta cooking water and a generous knob of butter. Just make sure you cook the pasta and sauce together for at least three minutes, so they combine in texture and flavour.”Ezra King and Randall’s next port of call would be the delicate silk handkerchiefs of Liguria in north-western Italy. “If you were to make the pasta yourself, you’d essentially be making lasagne sheets anyway,” Ezra King says. Traditionally, these pasta squares are layered up with pesto formandilli de sea, for which Randall cooks lasagne in boiling salted water before lifting them into a large frying pan with a ladleful of the cooking water. Add some (ideally homemade) fresh pesto, then cook, tossing, and serve topped with grated parmesan and black pepper.Jemma could also stuff and roll her boiled lasagne sheets into cannelloni, Gill advises, and be as adventurous as she likes with the filling (think squash and chard, or spinach, sausage and ricotta). But it would be wise not to dismiss lasagne itself completely out of hand, Ezra King says: “The bolognese version dominates people’s imagination, but lasagne is much more of a framework.” That line of thinking can “set you free”, he adds, be that by roasting pumpkin to layer between pasta sheets with bechamel (“swap the usual nutmeg for sage”) and maybe fonduta. “If you go farther south in Italy, they put little meatballs in there, or hard-boiled eggs,” Ezra King notes. “There are no rules to lasagne, which is kind of cool.”If time is a concern, meanwhile, there are a few tricks to getting it on the table faster. “A good one is to mix the ragu and bechamel together, so you’re not having to spoon them in individually,” Ezra King says. “After all, once baked, they’re going to blend into each other, anyway.”If all else fails, meanwhile, Gill would be inclined to get a bow on those boxes: “You could always give them away as presents,” she says. Well, it is nearly *whispers it* Christmas.Got a culinary dilemma? Emailfeast@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsPastaKitchen aideChefsFoodFood wastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This was one idea I saw around, and I am sorry that I can’t credit the person who came up with it, because it is really clever. The premise is that you make a fish pie inside a jacket potato skin, having scooped out the potato and mixed it with the fish pie filling. It’s perfect for this time of year, when you may want to eat something warm, standing up, outside.Baked potato fish piePrep15 minCook1 hr 30 minServes42 large baking potatoesNeutral oil, for rubbing the potatoesSalt andblack pepper50gunsalted butter1 onion, peeled and finely diced1 celery stalk,finely diced½ fennel bulb, trimmed and finely diced200mlvermouth200gcreme fraiche300gskinless cod fillet, diced200gshelled prawns1 small bunch of chives, choppedSqueeze of lemon juice50gcheddar, gratedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Rub the potatoes with oil, season well on the outside and bake for an hour and 15 minutes, until a knife easily penetrates the flesh. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, then add the onion, celery and fennel. Sweat, without colouring, for about 10 minutes, until soft, then add a pinch of salt and the vermouth, and boil until the vermouth has almost all evaporated.Add the creme fraiche, let it melt into the pan, then, when it is simmering, stir the cod and prawns into the sauce. Cook for a minute, then take off the heat.Cut the cooled potatoes in half lengthways and scoop the flesh into the fish mixture. Stir to combine, then add the chives and a squeeze of lemon, and check the seasoning.Put the halved potato shells on a baking sheet and fill them with the fish mixture. Cover with the grated cheddar, then put under a hot grill until the cheese melts. Serve in a napkin with wooden forks.This recipe is an edited extract from The Sportsman at Home, by Stephen Harris, published by Quadrille at £30.
