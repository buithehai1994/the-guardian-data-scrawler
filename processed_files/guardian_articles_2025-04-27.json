London boroughs spend £4m a day on emergency housing – three-quarters of their total housing expenditure.Most of those in temporary accommodation are families, with 164,000 children in England now growing up in such housing, the highest number on record. Nearly 17,000 of those families have been in temporary accommodation for more than five years.The quality of accommodation can be appalling; theShared Health Foundation foundtemporary accommodation had contributed to the deaths of at least 74 children in the last five years, of whom 58 were aged under one.The billions of pounds being spent by councils housing people in emergencies has in turn created a lucrative industry of property providers and agents who supply accommodation that councils often do not have the resources to inspect.The Guardian sent freedom of information requests to every council in England asking how much they spend on temporary accommodation and which providers they use. About half sent replies.Reporters then cross-referenced those replies with publicly available spending figures and private rental data to build a picture of how much taxpayers are paying to house people in emergencies, and who is benefiting.The figures show that even though temporary accommodation is supposed to be used as a short-term last resort, its high costs are draining over a fifth of the core budgets of several councils.Hastings, one of the worst hit by the problem, is spending over 50% of its core spending on emergency housing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rooms in B&Bs are widely used by councils, accounting for 30% of all national spending on temporary accommodation, even though they are deemed unsuitable for families with young children.Crawley council said its temporary accommodation costs posed acritical riskto council finances in future years.The UK as a whole has far more people living in temporary accommodation than any other developed country, giving Britain the worst homelessness problem of any of its economic peers.Figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development show that for every 10,000 people in the UK, 40 are now homeless – the vast majority of whom are in temporary accommodation. The proportion of the population who are homeless is nearly a third higher than that in France, and double that in the US.A recent report from MPs on the housing, communities and local government select committee called the situation “utterly shameful”.Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the NationalHousingFederation, said: “We are now wasting huge sums of taxpayers’ money on expensive sticking plasters. We are spending £13bn a year more on housing costs today than we were in 2010, when the government cut funding for new affordable housing by 63%.”The Guardian interviewed several people who are or have recently been housed in temporary accommodation, many of whom spoke about the difficulty of living in rooms not equipped for long-term family occupancy.Aimee, who only wanted to be known by her first name, said she had been placed in a rodent-infested hotel where conditions were so unclean that her children decided to live with their grandmother instead.“I was only supposed to be there for 50 days but I ended up there for two years – mostly without my children,” she said. “I got told that housing would be found for me within four weeks of my being there, and it still hasn’t over two years later.”Additional reporting by Sammy Gecsoyler and Jessica MurrayExplore more on these topicsHomelessnessThrough the roofHousingImmigration and asylumLocal governmentCommunitiesRenting propertyPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Sit down and sign the deal. We have the confines of a deal, I believe, and I want him to sign it and be done with it.”“Do you trust President Putin?” Trump was asked.“I’ll let you know in about two weeks,” Trump said. Pressed to elaborate on what he expects to happen in two weeks, Trump evaded the question. “Two weeks or less,” he said, vaguely, “but you know they’re losing a lot of people. We have 3, 4,000 people dying every week.”Trump also said that his relationship with Zelenskyy was improved by the face-to-face at the Vatican: “Look, it was never bad. We had a little dispute, because I disagreed with something he said, and the cameras were rolling and that was OK with me.”“Look, he’s in a tough situation, a very tough situation. He’s fighting a much bigger force, much bigger,” Trump added. The president then repeated his frequent false claim that the United States had givenUkraine$350bn to aid its defense from the Russian invasion.“I see him as calmer,” Trump said, comparing the Zelenskyy he met at the Vatican with the one he confronted in the Oval Office in February. “I think he understands the picture, and I think he wants to make a deal.”The president also claimed that there had been “a little bit” of progress in trade talks with China, talks that Chinese officials have said are not taking place. “They want to make a deal, obviously,” Trump said. “Now, they’re not doing any business with us, you know, because, not because of them, because of me. Because at 145%, you can’t do business,” he said, in reference to the import tariff rate he imposed this month. “But something’s going to happen, that’s going to be possible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is their second Premier League title in five years but unlike in 2019-20, when Klopp’s team ended the club’s 30-year wait for a 19th league crown behind closed doors, their latest triumph was celebrated in front of jubilant supporters. Liverpool were unable to hold a trophy parade five years ago because of the Covid pandemic but one will be staged in the city on Monday 26 May. Klopp may be in attendance, having assembled the supremely talented squad that Slot inherited.The charismatic German’s shock departure last season signalled the end of an era but Slot, lured from Feyenoord by the club’s new sporting director, Richard Hughes, made a seamless transition. The head coach, as he is officially titled, became the first Liverpool manager to win 11 of his first 12 matches in all competitions. After a home defeat by Nottingham Forest in the fourth game, Liverpool embarked on a 26-match unbeaten run in the Premier League that lasted almost seven months.View image in fullscreenArne Slot has won the Premier League title in his first season in England.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesSlot’s side have topped the table since the defining date of 2 November. Arsenal lost at Newcastle that day, City were beaten at Bournemouth, part of their astonishing collapse of one win in 13 matches in all competitions, and Liverpool came from behind to beat Brighton 2-1 at Anfield. Mohamed Salah struck the late winner and has been the driving force behind the title success.Liverpool’s campaign was played against a backdrop of uncertainty over the futures of Salah, the captain, Virgil van Dijk, and Trent Alexander-Arnold. All three were in the final years of their contracts and involved in protracted negotiations over extending their glittering Anfield careers. Salah and Van Dijk have recentlysigned new two-year contractsbut Alexander-Arnold could join Real Madrid on a free transfer this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool made only one signing last summer, the rarely used Federico Chiesa, as Slot assessed the talent at his disposal. The club also agreed a €35m deal to sign the Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili from Valencia this summer, when Liverpool are also expected to be in the market for a centre-forward and a young left-back.Liverpool linksSlot follows José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte in winning the Premier League in their first season. He is the fourth Liverpool manager to win the championship at the first attempt, after Matt McQueen in 1922-23, Joe Fagan in 1983-84 and Kenny Dalglish in 1985-86, all of whom were established figures at Anfield before stepping into the role. Slot is the only one to win the league in his first season at the club, rather than being promoted from within.“I’m very, very happy of course but to a certain extent it also feels unreal,” Slotsaid after the title was secured. “You’ve worked so hard for this moment to happen and, you need time to truly feel it. The fans were so happy that it didn’t take me long to understand what we’ve achieved together this season.“It is so special. It was a proud moment when I knew I would become the new head coach here, to be part of such a great football club, and to now be part of the history of this football club is something I could have only dreamed of three or four years ago.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

Earl described him as a “big character with lots of energy”.She said: “Sam is very, very present on social media, he’s such a passionate person about sports.“He flew on the 13th, I’ve got confirmation that he landed, I absolutely know Sam was in Vegas. The concerning part is he went silent from the 16th and, because he is such a big presence on social media, people were quite fast to notice.”Earl said Ruddock was an “infectious” person and a “phenomenal” human being. She said she has started a social media campaign to try to get information.A spokesperson for British Cycling said: “British Cycling understands that para-cyclist Sam Ruddock was reported missing to UK and US police and Interpol after not being heard from since Wednesday 16 April 2025, while visiting Las Vegas, USA.“We urge anyone who has been in contact with Sam since 16 April or may have any information of his whereabouts to contact their local police department as soon as possible.”Lincolnshire police confirmed it has an active missing person investigation for Ruddock.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British man reported missing in Las Vegas and are in contact with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsSportParalympicsGBWarwickshireLas VegasnewsShareReuse this content"

We believe it was an isolated incident.”Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, said he had spoken to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, on Sunday afternoon and would remain in touch with her as well as the security minister, Dan Jarvis, regarding aspects of the incident.“I want to thank local people and the blue light services in how they responded to this and the fact that the area has now been cleared and is no longer a live crime scene,” he said.“The broader implications of an attack in which lethal weapons were found in a very busy area where the country’s most populous pub crawl takes place is a real concern,” he added.Sobel said he would be raising the issue of the availability of weapons linked to the incident, and how to keep people safe when they are standing in large groups and queueing.Counter-terror police are examining a number of Facebook posts – including one which appeared to include plans for a “mass-murder” attack – to determine if they are linked to the attacker or the incident.The post appeared before the attack on a Facebook account that indicated far-right sympathies as well as reflecting the “mixed ideology” that has increasingly been on the radar of counter-terrorism police.The posts listed as “targets” students, nightclub goers and “neurotypicals”. Reference was made to a “manifesto” written by a man who killed 51 people during shootings at a mosque and Islamic centre in New Zealand in 2019.Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told the Guardian that it had taken action to remove an account apparentlyassociated with the incident.The home secretary received further updates on Sunday from counter-terrorism police after she was first briefed in the wake of the attack.The incident caused shock across the community in the Headingley area of Leeds over the weekend, where large numbers of students and others routinely take part in the pub crawl route, days before the summer term starts for many university courses.One venue, Taylor’s Sports Bar and Grill, remained closed all weekend due to the police investigation but posted on Facebook that it intended to reopen on Monday,“While appalling to witness some of the scenes first-hand, lowlife scum like this will never win in our society,” the statement added.A member of staff at another bar said they had seen dozens of emergency service vehicles descend on the area on Saturday afternoon after the attack, although it took hours for people to become fully aware of what had happened.“We were told and were on high alert, but otherwise you wouldn’t have known. It wasn’t until the evening that people started asking about it,” they said. “I think people have been really shaken by it.”A fortnight ago, the Guardian revealed that counter-terrorism police and the National Crime Agency had set up a new joint taskforce to tackle young males fixated with violence online which is often also fuelled by “strongly misogynistic” online material.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The performer, whose real name was Bianca Castro-Arabejo, rose to fame after taking part in the fourth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race.Caliente’s family announced on Thursday that the Filipino-American drag performer had part of her leg amputated due to the infection.Her family wrote on Instagram that she was “cherished by many” for her career, and died on Sunday at 4.42am “surrounded by her loving family and close friends”.On Instagram, the BBC Radio 2 DJ andRuPaul’s Drag RacejudgeMichelle Visagewrote: “My jiggles …. The laughter was endless, our talks were special, your energy was contagious.“You were and remain so very loved. This world has lost an angel and we want you to soar high ….. I love you so much honey.”A statement from Caliente’s family said the star was a “luminous presence” in the worlds of entertainment and advocacy, adding that she would be deeply missed and eternally remembered.Her family said: “She touched countless lives through her artistry, activism, and the genuine connection she fostered with fans around the world.“Though her physical presence is gone, the joy she shared and the space she helped create for so many will remain for ever.”After publicly coming out as transgender, Caliente was a contestant on RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season six and was set to judge the latest season of the spin-off programme Drag Race Philippines, after being appointed as a judge when the show began airing in 2022.A statement shared by the show and producers World of Wonder on social media said they were “devastated” and asked for Caliente’s family to be given the privacy and space to grieve their “tremendous loss”.They added: “Jiggly’s humour, love, and light touched so many in the Drag Race family and beyond. Her legacy will continue to uplift the communities she advocated for.”Born on 29 November 1980, Caliente moved from the Philippines to New York when she was a child. She was praised in her first Drag Race series by the judges for her sense of humour, and impressive lip-syncs when she battled not to leave the competition early, while also struggling with sewing garments during some challenges.She was eliminated before the final, with Sharon Needles going on to be crowned champion in 2012.Since the franchise began in 2009, the reality show has been hit by the deaths of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK starsCherry Valentine, 28, andThe Vivienne, 32, as well as US competitors Sahara Davenport, 27, and Chi Chi DeVayne, 34.Explore more on these topicsDragRuPaulnewsShareReuse this content"

It means a lot to be here,” said Ann-Marie Barton, who remembers the mixed emotions whenLiverpoollast won the title: yes she was drinking champagne, but it was alone at home because of the Covid pandemic. “It was just me and Scooby [a stuffed mascot], and he doesn’t talk much.”On Sunday she was out in blazing sunshine at Anfield with good friends lapping up the communal party atmosphere. Everyone seemed to be smiling. It was some party and was never going to be spoiled.Barton has been Liverpool since she popped out of her mother’s womb, she said, and is proud of the autographs on the wheels of her chair. “You’ve got Klopp, Virgil Van Dijk, Alisson Becker, Stefan Bajčetić … I need to get Mo Salah.View image in fullscreenAnn-Marie Barton with Ali Hamidi (right) outside Anfield.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianBefore the game, she said: “I know we will do it today, which is why it’s important to be here with my mates. It does mean a lot.”One of those mates is Ali Hamidi, whoplayed a part in Liverpool’s win against West Ham a fortnight agoby scooping up the ball near his seat and making a long throw to Alexis Mac Allister, who took the corner for Van Dijk’s 89th-minute header.It has become something of a viral hit, although you cannot see his face. “It was me definitely … you can tell from the yellow sleeves.”Hamidi was born in Iran and got into football in 1988 when he was still a child living in southern England. So why Liverpool? “I have no idea. They wore red and that was my favourite colour, it was probably as simple as that.”View image in fullscreenFans knew a win would bring Liverpool even with Manchester United at 20 titles.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianBarton has seen Liverpool win the title a number of times, but it is the first proper time for Hamidi, a fishing tackle businessman who presents The Grand Fishing Adventure with Bobby Zamora on ITV. “I was only 10 when they won in 1990, so I didn’t really grasp what was happening.“Winning today doesn’t mean everything, we’ve been through too much as a club for it to mean that. But from a football perspective, winning the league in front of your fans after such a long time … it is important.”Some fans were wearing T-shirts declaring “Back on our perch”, a reference to the 2002 interview Alex Ferguson gave tothe Guardian when he said: “My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch. And you can print that.”View image in fullscreenTom Hughes, the owner of 12th Man Footy.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianFor Liverpool to now equal Manchester United and be on 20 titles means a lot to fans, but not as much as winning more titles than United.Tom Hughes runs a city centre shop selling Liverpool merchandise and is doing a roaring trade in Slotfather T-shirts and flags blazed with “Back On Our Perch”.As a diehard Liverpool fan he was of course going to the match. “I’m still nervous. It was like Christmas Eve for me last night. We waited so long to win it last time and we couldn’t celebrate, which I know a lot of other clubs were made up about.”There were fans from all over the world at the match. The teenage boy section of the Jacob family, from New Jersey, persuaded their parents that they all had to come because of the match.View image in fullscreenThe Jacob family, from New Jersey.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianThe family are of Egyptian heritage and there’s two words as to why the boys are Liverpool until they die: “Mo Salah,” one said. “That started it, but then we fell in love with the team. All of our friends love the team as well.“The best game we saw was against Barcelona in the Champions League, that 4-3 comeback. Amazing.”Two friends from Limerick, Pat Keegan and Gabriel Robinson, had their photos taken with a cardboard cut out of Van Dijk before the match.Keegan said he had been a fan since Liverpool lost to Arsenal in the 1971 cup final, so he had seen a lot of ups and downs. “It’s either United or Liverpool in Ireland, and we’re Liverpool. Being here today means everything … just to see them do it. To catch up with United with the 20 titles, we’re delighted.View image in fullscreenCelebrations in Liverpool are expected to continue for days.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian“We’ll knock Fergie off that perch next year. It was a fierce statement when he said it.”The two men reckon they drank Liverpool dry last night, but it continued apace on Sunday and is likely to continue until the early hours of Monday, if not longer.The Sandon pub near the ground was heaving pre-match, with the outdoor spaces a sea of red. Fans also queued up to have their photos taken at a new mural celebrating the 20 titles on one of its walls. It was made by the street artist John Culshaw last week and then vandalised on Friday.Danny Claeys, the pub’s general manager, said: “Somebody decided to get white paint and squeeze it all over. Thankfully the artist came back and fixed it and as you can see, it’s become a massive photo thing. It’s the first one with 20. People have been out here since 7 o’clock this morning.”View image in fullscreenDanny Claeys, general manager of the Sandon.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianThe joy around Anfield before and after the match on Sunday was a sight to behold, but it also has to be remembered that it is only half the city.One taxi driver said that many of his Everton-supporting friends had gone away for the day.Another said he had already booked a break in the Lake District in anticipation of the expected parade on 26 May, the day after the last league game of the season.“This is hell on earth for me,” he said of ferrying Liverpool fans from the city centre to Anfield. “I certainly won’t be doing any driving after the match finishes.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Primary accounts of that day are limited, but Lapulapu’s victory has become a symbol of bravery and resistance to colonial rule.British Columbia officially recognised 27 April as Lapu Lapu Day in 2023, with local officials noting the date was an opportunity to “learn more about the history of people in British Columbia of Filipino heritage and to celebrate their contributions to the vibrancy and prosperity of the province”.The province is home to a significant Filipino community, with 172,915 people of Filipino origin living in British Columbia in 2021, about 3.46% of the population.The Philippines’ former president Rodrigo Duterte named 27 April as Lapu Lapu Day, making it a special working public holiday for the country, and a non-working holiday for Lapu-Lapu City on Mactan Island, in the centre of the county.In Lapu-Lapu City, which was named after the national hero, festivities stretched for almost a month this year and featured a special market, parade and re-enactment of the Battle of Mactan.Organisers of the celebrations in Vancouver said this declaration honoured the legacy of Lapulapu as well as symbolising “the cultural harmony and mutual respect that thrive in the province of British Columbia”.Ahead of the gathering, organisers described Lapulapu as representing “the soul of native resistance, a powerful force that helped shape the Filipino identity in the face of colonisation”, adding that he “teaches us that the strength of a united people, bound by a shared commitment to their heritage, can withstand any challenge”.The festivities in Vancouver were designed as a celebration of Filipino pride and heritage, featuring music, a parade, film screenings, cultural dances, markets with local handmade goods and food, and basketball – the Philippines’ most loved sport.In a statement shared after the attack, organisers wrote that they were “devastated” for families and victims: “We are still finding the words to express the deep heartbreak brought on by this senseless tragedy,” they said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasPhilippinesAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

Local organizers would lead protests in their cities and towns, but the movement would not have a leader, and it would not be centralized.As Trump moved quickly to dismantle agencies, policies and norms, slashing through the federal government, people wanted to express their dismay – and they weren’t seeing it from their elected leaders.Protesters fill the streets in cities across the US to denounce Trump agendaRead more“Trump and his cronies are actively trying to take over our country and destroy our democracy, and the Democratic party is not doing enough to stop them, so people are going to step in,” said Hunter Dunn, the national press coordinator for the movement. “That was the basic idea.”The 5 February protest drew tens of thousands across the country. A subsequent February protest got more people into the streets. Come 5 April, a large coalition that included 50501 resulted in millions of people around the country rallying in their cities and towns in a “hands off” demonstration. And on 19 April, was another big showing nationwide Some communities also held mutual aid events such as food and supply drives and potlucks, Dunn said.The movement is one of many coming together to rally in the streets, organize events, contact lawmakers and build a resistance to Trump’s second term.“It’s gone from a trickle to a tidal wave really quickly,” Dunn said.A 50501 subreddit remains an active organizing space, where people discuss ideas for local protests, messages they should put on posters, strategies for getting more people involved. The movement is active on nearly all social media channels, and local offshoots have their own pages as well.The group is planning its next day of mass protest on 1 May, which will be focused on workers’ rights and immigrant rights. 50501 is far from the only group organizing around May Day, a frequent day of action for labor groups around the world.There are now thousands of volunteers across all 50 states and in DC who help with 50501 in their communities, Dunn said. People come together to organize an event, like a protest or demonstration, and form small teams. Those small teams can then become part of state-level 50501 groups. The state-level groups help inform a national group. Local organizers vote on dates for national days of protest, he said.“50501 is not an organization,” the movement’s handbook, posted on its website, says. “It is not a company. It’s not a brand, club, or influencer. It is an agreed-upon idea to end the executive overreach of theTrump administration. Do not look to 50501 for leadership or permission to hold your own government accountable. The time has come for you to get involved. You are 50501. Together our voices cannot be ignored.”Seasoned activists were initially skeptical – they didn’t know the group behind the protest, and they feared it could be a set-up from the other side, designed to make the opposition look weak, or worse, to draw peopleinto a trap. Now, though, established and centralized groups have partnered with 50501 on protests after their fears weren’t realized.In response to some of the early skepticism, Evolved Fungi responded on Reddit that he was “not a foreign agent, or bad actor, or whatever people seem to want to think” but “just a regular guy”. In fact, he has said on Reddit that he started organizing protests in opposition to infant circumcision. He did not respond to a request for an interview and has not yet been named publicly.“People didn’t need to find each other and then plan a date and a place – they needed a date and a place to find each other,” hewroteof the concept. “And at the core, that’s what 50501 is – a date and a place to find each other and stand together.”He laterreflectedon the first few actions and how the movement had grown from his concept: “You aren’t led by me, you’re led by that spirit in EVERY ONE OF US that sees a wrong and needs to do something to make it right! The same spirit that made me first write about 50501, as a normal guy who saw something wrong and did something about it to try to make it right. Just like you are doing.”The movement lists four groups aspartners: Political Revolution, Voices of Florida, NoVoiceUnheard and Build the Resistance. Dunn said Political Revolution has helped build out its website and other places to coordinate events and provided technical support. Voices of Florida has helped train new organizers on how to speak to the press and keep people safe at protests, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s amazing to see new people building this amazing infrastructure. It’s bottom-up, not top-down.”Many of those involved in the movement are new to political organizing and action, but others have been parts of previous movements, such as Black Lives Matter, or, for some older activists, as far back as anti-Vietnam war protests, Dunn said.Dunn got involved after he saw an Instagram post about 50501. He had previously organized in his local school district as a high schooler to help pass diversity initiatives and worked on some local political campaigns. He helped organize a 50501 protest in Los Angeles on 5 February.Another organizer, Sydney,told the Guardianin February that she hadn’t organized protests before, but didn’t see anyone in her part of Pennsylvania planning a 5 February action. “I decided to pick the ball up and do it myself. And I learned a lot extremely quickly. It’s probably one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done,” she said.‘A particularly heinous villain’: a disdain for Musk has sparked protests across USRead moreSydney, who asked to use only her first name, said the Pittsburgh protests have grown from a couple hundred people to more than 1,000 at the 19 April event. “It feels amazing. I mean that in the best way possible. But there are some days where I’m like, is this actually happening? Is this real? It’s been amazing to watch.”Each day of action has had more people than the one before it, she said.“I’m seeing more and more parts of Pennsylvania actually take up their own mantle and start their own actions, because, for whatever reason, they can’t get to Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Philadelphia,” she said. “I hope that that momentum results in our elected officials hearing our voice and hearing that we are not happy with the way things are going, and listening to us.”Dunn expects the protests to continue to grow as more of Trump’s agenda takes hold.“I always like to tell people, when they ask how they can join, there’s four things you need to do: you need to be pro-democracy. You need to be trying to protect the constitution. You need to be against executive overreach. You have to be non-violent. If you’re those four things, you’re 50501 if you say you are.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpProtestTrump administrationUS politicsActivismnewsShareReuse this content"

Then someone shoves him …Stuart HeritageSun 27 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTShareIf you’ve even casually been tracking Louis Theroux’s career, you will have detected a noticeable deceleration of late. For a while, after he shed the culty sheen of his Weird Weekends persona, Theroux emerged as a sober, probing documentarian who made films about drug addiction, sexual assault and postpartum depression. These films were, without exception, vital.Then lockdown happened, and the wheels fell off. After going viral for a self-consciously ironic rap he did 20 years earlier, Theroux settled into the low-stakes quicksand of a generic celebrity interview podcast. You were left with the feeling of an extraordinary talent being wasted.The Settlers lays all those worries to rest in an instant. By travelling to Israeli settlements in theWest Bank, Theroux is revisiting the subject matter of a documentary he made in 2011. That film, The Ultra Zionists, concerned a clutch of Jewish people who – propelled by religious nationalism – were infringing on international law by building their homes in Palestinian territory. But, 14 years on, he has returned to find that the settlements have accelerated. The settler ideology has found itself gaining political traction. What was fringe has now become mainstream.As such, The Settlers requires Theroux to alter his approach. Ever since Weird Weekends, his stock in trade has been the faux-naïf, lulling his subjects into a false sense of security with his bumbling charm. With everyone from Jimmy Savile to the members of the Westboro Baptist Church, he was able to lay traps they simply didn’t see coming.But the situation in the West Bank is so dire that the kid gloves have to come off. This is partly because he and his crew repeatedly find themselves subject to many of the confrontations and intimidations that blight the lives of Palestinians on a daily basis. During a visit to a Palestinian home, settlers drive up and point guns with laser sights through the windows at him. More than once, he has to politely ask people to lower their guns while talking to him. In one especially tense encounter, he has to bark “Don’t touch me” at a pair of balaclava-wearing Israeli soldiers.View image in fullscreenLouis Theroux with Ari Abramowitz in The Settlers.Photograph: BBC/Mindhouse Productions Ltd/Josh BakerIn the early years, Theroux would gently attempt to convince his subjects that their worldview might not be the only one around. In the later, more serious films, he would leave long silences on which the viewer could project scorn on his behalf, saving his true feelings for the voiceover afterwards. In truth, there is some of this in The Settlers. When he meets Ari Abramowitz, a Texas settler in the West Bank who refuses to even use the word “Palestinian”, he holds his tongue. When he meets a rabbi who calls Palestinians “savages” and “camel riders”, he manages to do the same.Then comes Daniella Weiss. A key member of the Israeli settler movement for 50 years, Weiss is Theroux’s prime target. She is able to hide her extreme views behind a friendly smile, no matter how aggressively he plays cat and mouse with her. But, at the end of the episode, they both get to each other like never before. Theroux corners Weiss and presses her on settler violence against Palestinians. She says none exists. He says he has witnessed it, notably in a video of a Palestinian being shot. She claims the Israeli shooter was acting in retaliation, then physically shoves Theroux in the hope that he’ll push her back. Instead, he does something he’s never done before. He calls her a sociopath.I’ve been watching Theroux’s films for more than three decades, since his days on Michael Moore’s TV Nation, and watching him be this forthright feels like a true watershed moment in his career. This level of stridently editorialising just hasn’t been in his toolbox until now. Whether it works or not is debatable – by the end of the encounter Weiss has recovered herself enough to taunt “I wish you’d pushed me back” at him – but this new version of Louis Theroux feels like a deliberate adaptation to the ages. It suits him.As with everything, you wish certain aspects of the situation could be explored more. Most notably, the peripheral glimpses of Israeli activists who protest against the settlements probably need more airtime, if only to demonstrate that this is a problem of individuals rather than an entire nation. But that’s by the by. It looks very much like we’ve got Louis Theroux back, and not a moment too soon.The Settlers aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewLouis TherouxDocumentaryFactual TVWest BankIsraelreviewsShareReuse this content"

A patchy sampling of Hiroshige’s imitators is all a bit rushed. But then, to do justice to his after-echoes would take a blockbuster in itself, not an epilogue.Everywhere I looked up to this point, it was evident how precisely French impressionism followed Hiroshige’s cues. Take rain. It becomes a pleasurable urban event inRenoir’s The Umbrellas, but it was Hiroshige who first saw rain as a lighthearted excuse to put up umbrellas – in works such as his printTarui, created in the 1830s. The impressionist theme of snow, enjoyed by Monet, is also delightfully anticipated by Hiroshige’s 1832-34 workSnow-viewing Along the Sumida River.This triptych, in which a single scene is expanded across three separate prints in a favourite Hiroshige tactic, shows the French avant garde took much more than imagery from Hiroshige. Artists and writers in late 19th-century Paris adopted his whole philosophy. For Snow-viewing encapsulates the way Hiroshige looks at the world, with a hedonism he shares with the people he depicts. In this print, a well-dressed family hunch up in their robes on a cold day in Edo (now Tokyo). But they are not on a hard winter journey – they are just enjoying the way snow blankets nature.View image in fullscreenA kaleidoscopic trip … Pleasure Boats at Ryōgoku.Photograph: Matsuba Ryōko/© Alan MedaughPleasure in the passing moment, from a shower of rain or fresh crisp snow to a restaurant meal or trip to the theatre, is Hiroshige’s ideal. His art wittily insists that happiness lies in savouring these little freedoms. This was the ideal the early European modernists took from his art, though what was calm common sense for this devout Buddhist would be for them a revolutionary escape.This is, you might say, an exhibition about nothing. Hiroshige is a connoisseur of brief glances and weightless incidents. A man says goodbye to a female friend who is a sex worker, as the blue dawn shadows under a pinkening sky show that it’s daybreak in Edo’s sex district. In another triptych, two women watch their companion as she goes off to bathe. That’s it, but you could look for ever at their expressions, sinuous poses and colourful swathings of cloth.View image in fullscreenFresh scenes … Cherry Blossoms on a Moonless Night along the Sumida River.Photograph: Alan Medaugh. Photography by Matsuba RyōkoHiroshige portrays scenes so fresh you could restage them not just in fin de siecle France but London or Newcastle today. You thought pop-up restaurants were a 21st-century idea? Nah. In Enjoying the Evening Cool Along the Shijo Riverbed, crowds of people enjoy the temporary restaurants set up on a dried-up riverbed. In the foreground, men and women dining on a platform over the still-flowing part of the river laugh as one of friends does a comic dance. Here we go again: it’s Renoir’sLuncheon of the Boating Party. As for Manet’sLuncheon on the Grass, there it is in scenes of people picnicking on sheets spread out in the open air.But Hiroshige did not live in modern times, nor is “modern” even a helpful term in relation to his art. He was born in 1797 in aJapanthat had been ruled since the 1600s by the Tokugawa shogunate, a military dictatorship led by the samurai class that excluded virtually all foreign contacts. His 1830s triptych of a Samurai procession captures what his world was like, but with a twist: the ritualistic procession is almost exclusively female as a bride is taken to her elite marriage.View image in fullscreenCopied by Van Gogh … The Plum Garden at Kameido.Photograph: Alan Medaugh. Photography by Matsuba RyōkoMaybe Chaucer is more relevant than Baudelaire. An 1851 print by Hiroshige depicts a fun-loving crowd of pilgrims heading for a mountain shrine by the sea, their bright costumes and dancing movements as robustly human as Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims. What makes this print, and almost every other here, so radiant is this artist’s ecstatic sense of colour. Seas like sapphire, skies on fire, acid reds and oranges, kimonos with myriad hues that contrast with the white faces of the women – it’s a kaleidoscopic trip. The matter-of-fact details of Hiroshige’s pleasure gardens, teahouses and picnics are irradiated by his cosmic colours. He sees nirvana in a blast of Prussian blue.It was Van Gogh who was Hiroshige’s most passionate western fan. There are two versions here of The Plum Garden, which Van Gogh copied. In the different variants, Hiroshige casts the sky in varying tints of red-pink, as if the atmosphere is stained with plum juice. Van Gogh’s drawing for his canvas after Hiroshige is shown beside these juicy scenes. You feel his pained concentration as he carefully, spikily delineates the fruit trees, trying to drink the redemption and happiness of Hiroshige’s sweet strong art.Hiroshige: Artist of the Open Road is at theBritish Museum, London, from 1 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtBritish MuseumJapanPaintingAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Science reveals the best way to peel a boiled eggPolly BureyFrom storage temperature to pH of the egg white, a food scientist explains how to seamlessly extract an egg from its shellSun 27 Apr 2025 19.44 EDTShareWe’ve all been there – trying to peel a boiled egg, but mangling it beyond all recognition as the hard shell stubbornly sticks to the egg white. Worse, the egg ends up covered in chewy bits of adhesive membrane in the end.The internet is littered with various “hacks” that claim to prevent this problem. But there are several reasons why eggs can be hard to peel. Luckily, that means there are also science-based strategies we can use to avoid the problem.Egg ‘peelability’ factorsEggs consistof a hard, porous shell, an inner and outer membrane, the egg white (albumen), and a membrane-encased yolk at the centre. There is also an air cell between the inner and outer membrane next to the shell.View image in fullscreenChicken eggs have a shell, an outer membrane and an inner membrane.Illustration: ttsz/Getty ImagesA lot of research was done in the late 1960s and 1970s on factors that affect the peelability of eggs after they’ve been boiled.One of these factors is the pH of the egg white. Anearly studyfrom the 1960s indicated that the pH of the egg white needs to be in the range of 8.7–8.9, quite alkaline, in order for the egg to be easier to peel.Storage temperature has a role to play, too. Astudy from 1963showed that storing eggs at about 22C gives a better peelability result than storage at lower temperatures of 13C, or even fridge temperatures at 3–5C.Of course, there is a risk of spoilage if eggs are stored at higher ambient temperatures.In the studies, an increase in storage time before boiling – using less fresh eggs – also increased the ease of peelability.View image in fullscreenThe older the eggs, the easier they might be to peel.Photograph: Framarzo/AlamyStep one: avoid fresh eggsThe fact that fresh eggs are harder to peel is relatively well known. Based on the factors above, there are a couple of reasons for this.For one, in a fresh egg the air cell is still quite small. As the egg ages, it (very) slowly loses moisture through the porous shell, increasing the size of the air cell while the rest of the egg contents shrink. A bigger air cell makes it easier to start the peeling action.Scientists crack what they say is the perfect way to boil an eggRead moreAdditionally, egg whites, although they already start out relatively alkaline,increase in pHas the eggs age, also making them easier to peel.Step two: water temperatureSome keen egg boiling pundits believe thatstarting off with boiling waterand lowering it to a simmer before gently placing the eggs into it provides a better result. However, you want to do this with room temperature eggs to avoid them cracking due to a sudden temperature change.The reasoning behind this approach is that exposure to higher temperatures from the start of cooking also makes it easier for the membrane to come away from the shell and egg white.Furthermore, the quick hot start makes it easier for the egg white proteins to denature (change structure as they cook) and bond to each other, rather than to the membrane.After boiling eggs for the desired amount of time (typically three to five minutes for runny yolks, six to seven minutes for jammy yolks, and 12 to 15 minutes for hard-boiled), you can quench them in ice water. This should help the egg white to slightly shrink away from the shell, improving peelability.View image in fullscreenStarting in hot water might help peelability, especially if you plunge the eggs in ice water afterwards.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianStep three (optional): adding things to the waterSome other suggestions to improve peelability include adding salt to the boiling water, but this has mixed results.In one study, this approach did actually improve peelability, but this effect was lost after eggs had been stored for longer periods.Acids and alkali have alsobeen shown to aid eggshell peelabilityor removal. The patent that describes this used rather harsh substances with the goal to dissolve away the shell.How to make devilled eggs – recipe | Felicity Cloake's MasterclassRead moreBut based on this idea, you could try adding baking soda or vinegar to the water. With vinegar, the theory is that it attacks the calcium carbonate in the eggshell to then aid its removal. As for baking soda, because it’s alkaline, it could help detach the membrane from the shell.Bonus: alternative cooking methodsThere are other methods for hard-cooking eggs, such aspressure steaming, air-frying and even microwaving.In steaming eggs, some proponents theorise that water vapour permeates the eggshell, loosening the membrane from the egg white, and thereby making the egg much easier to peel.While studies have recently been done on theair-frying of other foods, there is still scope to further understand how this style of cooking might affect eggshells and peelability.Lastly, once you have successfully separated the eggshells, don’t just throw them in the bin. There are lots of different uses for them, including compost, slug and snail deterrent in your garden, using them as little biodegradable pots for seedlings, or even something as advanced asscaffolds for cancer research.Paulomi (Polly) Burey is a professor in food science at the University of Southern Queensland.

Will turning it into a game make everything better?With two small kids and a dog to take care of, I often struggle to look after myself. Self-care apps promise to help – if you can handle the quests, magic potions and rainbow stones. I put four of them to the testChloë HamiltonSun 27 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareThe other night, I didn’t moisturise before bed. The baby had just woken and was crying for a feed. I didn’t want him to wake the toddler he shares a room with, and I couldn’t, in that intensely fraught moment, locate my Elizabeth Arden.We all find it hard, at times, to fit in self-care. But if there’s one thing I’ve noticed since becoming a mum of two small children, it’s that even the most basic level of personal care requires military-level planning. Often, I pour from an empty cup because I haven’t had time – or, more likely, I’ve simply forgotten – to refill it.Fortunately, there’s an app for that. Lots, in fact. The global self-care apps market wasvalued at about $3bn (£2.2bn) in 2024and is projected to reach $14bn by 2033. Many of these apps turn self-care into a game to help users look after themselves. There are gamified apps for meditation, drinking more water and consuming less alcohol. There’s even one called Zombies, Run! that claims to put a “post-apocalyptic spin on a workout” by challenging users to outrun the undead.Gamification expert Kimba Cooper-Martin says of the trend: “Gamification taps into psychological motivators like achievements, competition (even with yourself) and rewards. It makes tasks more engaging and less like chores.”So, I put four gamified apps – Finch, Habitica, Ahead and PokémonSleep– to the test for one week each to see if any of them could help me take better care of myself. All are available for iOS and Android and have free versions or free trials, plus extra features for between £4.99 and £9.99 a month.FinchI thought I’d love Finch, which launched in 2021 and encourages users to look after themselves by, um, making them look after a pet. I’m a child of the 90s, after all, and once kept my Tamagotchi alive for nearly two weeks – although, in fairness, this was mostly because my dad took it to work with him and left his meetings to feed it.View image in fullscreenThe birbs from the Finch app.Photograph: FinchAs you complete self-care goals on Finch (drinking more water, meditating, running) your little pet (they call it a birb) will go on adventures, grow, be happy. And if you don’t hit your goals? Don’t worry: according to the app’s creators, the pets “never die because it can be too anxiety inducing”.I downloaded the app with much anticipation. Sure, I already have a baby, a toddler and a spaniel to look after, but what’s another mouth to feed?“You hatched a birb,” my phone tells me when I open Finch for the first time, before inviting me to choose its pronouns. The app then suggests a name: Squiggles. Unconvinced, I click “shuffle” and a new moniker is generated for my pixelated pet: Peach. Better.And so Peach and I begin our adventures. I’m allowed to choose my own goals and decide to keep it simple. Get out of bed is one. Brush my teeth is another. I do set a few slightly more intentional ones, though: take three deep breaths; have a stretch break; do one thing that makes you happy. Each time I complete a goal, I get to check it off and Peach rewards me with merry little cheeps, the occasional burst of digital ticker tape, and messages letting me know that she now has 123 Rainbow Stones, whatever they are. I’m also thrown daily affirmations each time I log on to the app. “I’m not lost, I’m exploring,” preens one. “I allow myself time to unwind,” gloats another.I play along and even buy Peach a little toadstool hat for 500 Rainbow Stones (seems steep to me); try to hatch her a micropet by promising to take three deep breaths for seven days in a row (unsuccessful); and even plan to send her off on adventures in Finchie Forest powered by a “potion” (bought with more Rainbow Stones).I find the whole thing overstimulating to the point of being unusableWhile I like keeping track of my goals, I find that the concept is lost on me. Maybe the app’s colourful display is too busy or maybe I’m simply too old for this business, but I find the whole thing overstimulating to the point of being unusable.At one point, Finch advises me that Peach is just four more “full-energy” days away from becoming a toddler. Sadly, my actual toddler, himself already full of energy, is not only slowly sapping mine but is also – rightly – keeping me away from my phone, meaning I sometimes go a day or two without checking in on poor Peach.Before long, the app feels like another job, so I enact the biggest act of self-care thus far and delete it.HabiticaPerhaps the best way to ensure you keep on top of self-care is to make it a habit, part ofyour daily routine. That’s the thinking behind Habitica, which features in-game rewards and – eek! – punishments to motivate users.I’m initially impressed. The app invites me to list a range of habits and then select whether they have a positive or negative impact on my life. Putting my phone down for at least an hour, for example, is a positive habit. Spending more than 15 minutes at a time scrolling on Vinted is negative. I enjoy thinking about what habits I already have, exploring if they’re helpful or unhelpful, and then siphoning them off accordingly.Things then get a bit other-worldly. The more positive habits I check off, the more “gold” I accumulate for my avatar, who I can also send off on quests – completing tasks, battling monsters and collecting enchanted feathers. I’m able to get gold, too, by completing a daily scheduled task like brushing my teeth or by ticking off an item on my personalised to-do list, such as collecting my son’s prescription from the pharmacy. I can then use said gold to “buy” rewards, which can either be, say, potions for my avatar (potions again!) or customised prizes that I input: listening to a podcast, watching an episode of my favourite TV show, allowing myself more than 15 minutes on Vinted. If I partake in bad habits, I lose gold or damage my avatar.I wonder if relying on extrinsic motivation erodes the power of intrinsic motivationI understand the theory: that if you do something – a good habit – and something positive happens as a result, you’re more likely to repeat that habit. Similarly, if you do something bad and something negative happens, you’re unlikely to do it again.I’m not entirely convinced, though, by relying on extrinsic motivation: to me it risks eroding the power of intrinsic motivation. I should spend an hour away from my phone because it’s good for my brain, not because if I do, I get some guilt-free scrolling time in return.Like Finch, Habitica encourages me to build a streak by using the app every day. But, although there isn’t a digital dependant relying on me this time, I still feel guilty every time I forget to log on. I even find myself feeling stressed about not recording health habits on the app, even if I’ve carried them out in real life. I also – and perhaps this is my age at play again – find the cluttered design a bit tiresome. So I delete this one, too.AheadBy the time I try Ahead, I’m a bit frustrated with self-care apps. Finch and Habitica – though, I’m sure, helpful for their fans – are too overstimulating for me. So I’m pleasantly surprised when I download Ahead – which bills itself as “Duolingo for your emotional intelligence” – and find the app has been created by scientists from Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard universities. This, combined with a clean and intuitive design, gives it a reassuring air of grown-up credibility.It opens with a quiz about how I’d respond to different events: if a friend moved a coffee date, for example, or if I made a mistake at work. The language is clear and accessible, if sometimes a bit too wacky. (Do you get “hot like a jalapeno” in arguments? Apparently I do!) Then, from my results, it calculates what I’m most in need of help with, covering everything from anxiety to anger. It also asks me – and I particularly like this bit – how much time I’m able to commit to the app per day, ranging from three to five minutes to more than 15. I choose five to 10 minutes, a middle ground, which I resolve to do while winding down before bed. I also commit, somewhat tentatively, to a five-day streak of logging on to Ahead to “work on myself”.Working on myself, it transpires, involves clicking through a series of very short courses that have the vibe of workplace fire safety training, even down to the short recall quizzes I’m asked to complete at the end of each one. In them, I’m taught about how to manage my emotions, spot distorted thinking and establish whether any of my worries are helpful. Each mini-course comes with sources to back up the theory and a timestamp that tells me how long it will take (most are around three to five minutes). They’re easy to do, surprisingly informative, and – hurrah! – there’s not a single potion or quest in sight. Learnings and techniques picked up along the way are safely stashed within the app for me to refer back to as needed. And I do.I don’t manage my five-day streak. However, crucially, I don’t feel guilty for missing a day, knowing the courses are there for me to pick up when I can.Pokémon SleepView image in fullscreenA help or a hindrance?Photograph: Wachiwit/AlamyI was initially sceptical that Pokémon Sleep, a sleep-tracking app based on the Pokémon franchise, would work for me given I often share a bed with my own little Pikachu – my 10-month-old baby – who still wakes frequently at night. I also suffer from bouts of insomnia, made worse, I think, by the postpartum hormones raging through my body. Would the pressure of gamifying my sleep make it harder to drop off?The premise of the app – which, I should say, is intended for entertainment purposes only – is supposedly simple: help the fictional Professor Neroli research Pokémon’s sleep habits using a Snorlax (a large, blue-green creature that sleeps a lot) as, I guess, a kind of sleep bait, encouraging different Pokémon to come over and have a nap next to it. The more you sleep, the greater your Snorlax’s “Drowsy Power” will become and the more Pokémon you will attract and wake up to in the morning. Got it? Good.The app uses your device’s accelerometer to estimate your sleep state by detecting body movement. Professor Neroli suggests sleeping with the app open and running, your phone face down on the mattress and uncovered by pillows and blankets.I’m not a Pokémon fan (unless you count trading cards in the playground when I was 10) but seeing a tiny, snoring Charmander curled up on my screen when I awoke on the first morning elicited an unexpected squeal of delight. I also found it interesting – and useful – to dig into the data the app provides. It divides sleep into three categories – a doze, a snooze and a slumber – and each morning sends you a report on how you slept, noting what percentage of your sleep was spent in each one. It tells you, too, how long it takes you to fall asleep, which was fascinating for someone who, too often, lies awake for hours on end wondering why they can’t sleep. (While using the app, I learned it’s typical for it to take me about 20 minutes to get to the land of nod.) I should, however, point out that phones, smartwatches etc are not 100% reliable when it comes to measuring sleep and often unable to distinguish slumber from simply being still. In other words, if you just lie there hoping to drop off, your tech may assume you already have.Maybe self-care apps aren’t for me, because I’m trying to spend less time on my phoneProfessor Neroli was, in addition, irritating. It was a little galling, for example, when he chastised me – after a night when the baby had been up from midnight to 2am – for my sleep score of 85, telling me I was aiming for 100 and should “try to get as much sleep” as possible. That, and the fact you need to clock up an uninterrupted 90 minutes of shut-eye in order to even log sleep data, suggests this app probably isn’t designed with new parents in mind.The verdictMaybe self-care apps aren’t for me, not least because I’m trying to spend less time on my phone. I’m already addicted to WhatsApp, Instagram and Vinted, and I’m not sure it’s helpful to add another app into the mix. I realised, over the course of the experiment, that not only was I not sold on the level of fantasy involved in many of the apps I’d chosen, I also didn’t like how much they dragged me away from the real world.On reflection, too, I found the pressure of gamification to be in conflict with the whole idea of self-care: it just made me more stressed.This, it transpires, isn’t uncommon. Dr Frankie Harrison, a clinical psychologist, says: “There’s a fine line between using these apps as a helpful tool and turning self-care into another task to complete. For some people, especially those dealing with anxiety or trauma, tracking habits or emotions too rigidly can actually add pressure rather than relieve it.”There’s no doubt these apps have their place. Some people, I’m sure, find them extremely useful, especially if they thrive on structure and accountability as well as fun. But, at least for me, they’re not a magic fix, no matter how many powers, Pokémon or potions are involved.Explore more on these topicsSleepHealth & wellbeingMental healthAppsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No scientist has ever done that. But that ancient dream hovers today over the discipline called synthetic biology, the very name of which seems to promise the creation of artificial life forms. Take one of the most dramatic results in this field: in 2010, scientists at the J Craig Venter Institutes in Maryland and California announced they had made “thefirst self-replicating synthetic bacterial cell”.This wasn’t, however, truly the creation of life either, but rather, a particularly bravura (or scary, depending on your viewpoint) example of genetic engineering. The team had produced a bacterium of a species found in nature, but with DNA that the scientists had assembled in the laboratory using chemical methods, modified to their own design (including a DNA-encoded version of the institute’s website address).To truly make a living thing from scratch is another matter entirely. Can we create life afresh from its basic, nonliving components? Some scientists are attempting it – last year researchers in the US and Europe reported a “roadmap” to, as they put it, “achieve the vision ofbuilding cells from molecular parts”.That it appeared at all on our planet suggests that making life from scratch must be possibleAll life forms on Earth share the same chemical ingredients: DNA for encoding the hereditary messages of the genes, protein for making the enzymes that enable the chemical processes of life, lipids to make cell membranes, and so on. And all living things are composed of individual cells, which are inherently alive in themselves; the Nobel laureate Paul Nurse calls them life’s atoms. (I’m not getting into the argument about whether viruses, which are exceptions to these rules, are truly alive.) So if we were to make versions of all these molecules using chemistry alone (and that can be done) and somehow assembled them into a cell, would we be creating life?It’s a moot point, because we can’t even do that. Cells won’t just assemble themselves from all their molecular components mixed together in a test tube – they are far too complicated. Every cell that ever existed was made by the division of an earlier cell: as Rudolf Virchow, the German physiologist who helped promote cell theory in the 19th century, put it, “every cell comes from a cell”.You’ve doubtless spotted the flaw in this picture, which is that it had to start somewhere. Where did the first cell come from? In other words, how did life originate? We don’t know, but there is no shortage of theories. In 1953, two scientists at the University of Chicago tested one of these – that life arose from a primordial soup of chemicals in the early oceans – by making amino acids (the chemical ingredients of protein) from mixtures of water, hydrogen, methane and ammonia. Echoing the headlines of half a century earlier, Time magazine claimed that experiment had come close to creating a“living molecule”(whatever that was meant to be).However life started, it almost certainly wouldn’t have cohered all at once: increasingly complicated chemical entities must have developed from simpler ones, acquiring ever more attributes of the truly alive. But the mere fact that life appeared at all on a planet that was once little more than rock, water and simple molecular gases in the atmosphere shows us that making life from scratch must be possible.Some parts of cells do assemble themselves. In particular the lipid molecules of our cell membranes will gather together into hollow cell-like sacs in water to shield their fatty parts. Researchers in the Netherlands are trying to construct a kind of miniature assembly line for loading such lipid bubbles with proteins. But there’s no reason why DNA, proteins and the rest would spontaneously arrange themselves into the positions they adopt in living cells. We have no idea how one might get all these parts to organise into something alive.Yet wouldn’t it anyway be rather unimaginative simply to create life in our own image (or that of a bacterium)? Why not make it instead from totally different molecular components – to, so to speak, write our own song of life and not just do a cover version? That would indeed be amazing, but we have even less idea where to start. How to make things that do what DNA and proteins do but aren’t those molecules?What this really comes down to is the slightly embarrassing fact that scientists don’t even agree on what “life” means in the first place. So how would we know if we’ve made it, if it doesn’t resemble life as we know it? Some researchers argue that computer-based “artificial life” – algorithms that can make copies of themselves, or that produce patterns which crawl across the screen, perhaps mutating and evolving as they go – fit the criteria for being genuinely alive. Last year, researchers at Google described howcomputer programs that replicate themselves emerged spontaneouslyfrom non-replicating ones when they had the ability to join and split. Group leader Blaise Agüera y Arcas argued that this “synthetic life is no different to natural life” because all life is just a kind of computation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photograph: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianMetal detecting isn’t just about searching for ancient treasure – the missing belongings of living people are just as precious. Meet the volunteers reuniting the twoByAndrew LloydSun 27 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareI’ve been standing in a soggy field in Bristol for two hours and I’m starting to lose hope. I try to smile optimistically at the woman beside me, but she’s staring ahead at the metal detectorists slowly sweeping the ground like crime scene inspectors. Suddenly there’s a screech. A man drops to his knees and digs into the mud. Is this the moment we’ve all been waiting for?In 2013, Morley Howard launched one of Britain’s biggest metal detecting communities, with a twist. Its members don’t focus on ancient treasure; instead they look for the lost belongings of living people. There’s a chance they’re in your neighbourhood, wading through weeds and plunging into ponds for missing jewellery. They’re an altruistic service just waiting for your call, formed as a result of one chance purchase 15 years ago.Howard, now 52, was at a car boot sale when he bought a metal detector on a whim. It was missing instructions, so he contacted the manufacturer who told him it was a collectible underwater diving detector from 1973. Howard hadn’t switched the thing on yet, but it was instantly clear he had a knack for spotting overlooked gems: he sold it on eBay for almost 30 times what he’d paid for it, and used the profit to buy a modern version he could use on land. Then he took it down to the beach in Burnham-on-Sea, just 600 yards from his house.“I put the headphones on and that was it. I switched off from the world,” Howard says. “I was out for six hours.” He returned home with £3 in change, a handful of ring pulls, and a new obsession. “I was hooked.”View image in fullscreenMorley Howard: ‘We’ve been called the fifth emergency service.’ Photograph: Joel Redman/The GuardianHoward went the traditional detecting route at first, attending organised expeditions, unearthing artefacts and imagining how “gutted” bygone figures would have been at their loss. “One of these pennies might have been a week’s wages,” he says, holding up an old coin. “You sit there and start making stories up in your head.”In 2012, he was on a casual sweep of the beach when a man approached him in a panic. He was recently married and had just lost his wedding band; could Howard help? Within half an hour he had dug the glinting ring out of the sand and handed it back to the relieved newlywed.“I got a tear in my eye,” Howard says. “I lost my dad’s wedding ring three or four months before I started detecting and I know how it feels to lose something so sentimental.” He shared the experience online and received a rush of messages. Locals wanted to know if he could track downtheirmissing valuables, too. It was the start of a project that would involve hundreds of people in need, thousands of pounds raised for charity and countless hours scanning the mud, sand and grass.In the UK we’re great at misplacing things. According toresearch conducted in 2019 by OpiniumResearch on behalf of Direct Line home insurance, we lose “around 7.9bn items” a year and each Brit spends the equivalent of 110 days of their lifetime trying to find them again.Howard spent the next year dashing around Somerset, returning car keys to distraught drivers, hearing aids to panicked OAPs, and plenty more pieces of sentimental jewellery. “I get a lump in my throat talking about it,” he says. “Hairs on your arm stand up. It’s the pressure, the relief, the smiles, the tears … It’s beautiful. I love it.”Howard’s longest search took five days. A man was removing ivy from a wall when the ladder slipped and knocked him face first into a slurry pit. He moved his tongue and found nothing but gum where three gold teeth should have been. He needed help, fast. Howard tried his best to look for them, spreading the slurry and sifting through the stench. It turned out they were tangled in the ivy, dangling above them the entire time.One day, Howard was asked to find something 50 miles away; he couldn’t travel that far – he’s a full-time carer for his son who has cystic fibrosis – but he didn’t want to let the person down. At the time, he ran a small Facebook group called Detecting Somerset for fellow enthusiasts, so he asked if anyone closer by could give it a go. One volunteer promptly located it, and Howard had an epiphany: “Hang on, why don’t we go national!”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenExamining items unearthed by detectorists. Photographs: Joel Redman/The GuardianHe set up a website called theNational Ring Recovery Service, offering free searches for lost metals, and invited other detectorists to join in. The Facebook group he created in 2017 now has more than 5,000 members and the service has become a thriving network of metal-detecting volunteers who take on missing requests all over Britain. “We’ve got people from Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Guernsey, Jersey,” Howard says with pride.To date, members have recovered around 600 items. Their success rate percentage is in the “high 90s”, Howard says. On the website there is a gallery featuring some of the people they’ve helped so far, tired relief on their faces, white fingertips gripping reclaimed rings as if they’re afraid of immediately losing them again.The goal is to have a friendly detectorist near every town and village in Britain, so anyone can get help when they need it. “We’ve been called the fifth emergency service,” Howard says. “It’s the last port of call or it’s gone for ever.”He once heard from a frantic woman who needed help finding someone buried in her garden; he thought it was a joke but showed up anyway, to be told landscapers had accidentally built her new patio over a set of ashes beneath a rose bush. Howard picked up a signal on the corner flagstone, dug a tunnel and found the metal urn in a Vanish soap container. “I can’t believe I dug up their mother-in-law,” he says, shaking his head.Joe Allen, 37, is an administrator in the detectorists’ group, helping connect missing requests with regional members. When I call, he’s on break during his shift as a medical supply officer at a private London hospital. In his spare time, Allen is amudlarker, a detectorist who scans the shoreline of the Thames for relics. In central London, he delves through the river’s edges to find items dropped by tourists and pub-goers. He also attends call-outs in the big parks. Detectorists need special permission here, but Allen has made a few connections which helps hurry things along.“Speed is of the essence,” Howard says. “If somebody’s lost something out in public, somebody else might find it.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenMatthew Naish, who was recently invited to a stranger’s wedding after finding her engagement ring. Photographs: Joel Redman/The GuardianThe NRRS receives up to six requests a day in summer. Not all are straightforward – one woman wanted her son metal-detected to see if a battery he had swallowed was still in his stomach (she was told to take him straight to hospital instead) – but Howard insists, “Every time a call comes in, I’m straight on it. I’ve got to reply.”NRRS members will accept money for travel costs, but refuse payment for the recovery. Plenty of people still offer, so Howard set upa charity pagewhere they can donate to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust if they wish to thank their rescuer. In January, Allen returned a wedding ring to a man who was so ecstatic, he donated £500. The NRRS has raised more than £7,400 from 166 supporters, many of whom leave emotional messages of appreciation.Darren Wiles, 53, from Bournemouth, is something of a superstar in the group. He alone has helped 293 people recover 315 items. After he’s clocked out from his day job as a client manager at a software company, he’ll be on the coast after dark, responding to call-outs. It’s especially easy to lose things on the beach. A strong wave can knock a necklace loose, and sea water can cause fingers to shrink so rings slip off; the tide is effectively one big pickpocket. Removing precious items before taking a dip can be just as risky: a whip of a towel or an errant ball can send phones, keys and heirlooms into the sand.Shortly after competing in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Great British rower Annabel Eyres, 60, bought a necklace from the Olympic village, which she wore to the closing ceremony. She attached an inch-long good luck charm and wore both for the next 30 years, until the chain snapped while she was undoing her wetsuit on a pebbled beach. She was distraught; her husband and friend insisted she was never going to see it again. “Everyone was telling me to forget it,” Eyres says. She is not superstitious or religious, but she prayed to Saint Anthony, the patron saint of lost things. Then she heard about Wiles. She messaged him on Facebook and he instantly replied, then drove 40 minutes to look for the charm. “I was kind of amazed,” Eyres says.View image in fullscreenDarren Wiles: ‘The tide takes everything east.’ Photograph: Joel Redman/The GuardianOn the dark, winter’s night, Wiles came equipped with a pinpoint detector, shaped like a small baton, which he used to poke between the rocks in hopes of a signal. Eyres had prepared herself for the worst, when Wiles pulled the charm from the pebbles. “It was a kind of double celebration,” she says, “because not only are you seeing it again, you’re also putting that pessimistic side of yourself to rest.”Wiles is more of a metal detective than detectorist, with a sophisticated system for tracking things down. When he meets someone, he shows them a bird’s-eye map of the location, separated into grids, so they can target a more precise area. He then uses the movements of the water to predict where an item may have ended up: “The tide takes everything east, so I search 10-15 metres west just in case. Then 20-30 metres east.”Wiles estimates he’s recovered around £200,000 worth of belongings for strangers, including a £10,000 Rolex watch and a Cartier bracelet worth £15,000; but more valuable than that are the sentimental items. One in particular really stands out. It was a Saturday night in 2018. Wiles was settling down at home when he received a call from a hotel worker in Bournemouth who said one of their guests, Jordan Jenkins, 27, had lost a ring on the beach. It contained the ashes of his younger brother, Owen Jenkins, who had died in 2017, aged 12, when he was carried away by a river current after saving a girl from drowning.Nicola Jenkins, 49, mother of the boys, recalls the panic of that night. “I was in Nottingham,” she says. “I just got a message from Jordan saying, ‘I don’t know what to do, I’ve lost Owen.’” Nicola hadn’t heard mention of the ring, so she feared Jordan was having a breakdown about the loss of his brother because he was “absolutely hysterically screaming on the phone”. She felt helpless as she listened to him cry 190 miles away.As soon as he heard about the ring, Wiles rushed to the beach with a detector. Within 10 minutes he had a strong signal. His heart thumped as he pulled the ring from the sand and handed it to Jordan, who gave him a big hug.“I will for ever be grateful to Darren,” Jordan says. “I was overwhelmed with joy, so emotional because it wasn’t just a ring, it was part of my brother, and we were reunited again.” Nicola, who launched theOpen Water Education Network(Owen) to help raise awareness around water safety, has stayed in touch with Wiles ever since, tightly bonded by what he did for her family. When Wiles recovered his 200th item, a local artist made a mural of him in Bournemouth as a thank you from the community for his volunteering.I’m keen to join a call-out, so I keep an eye on the Facebook group and wait for a lost item to pop up in my area. It doesn’t take long. At 1.55pm one Monday, Allen tells the NRRS a woman has lost an heirloom ring on a farm in Bristol. Within minutes members begin tagging nearby detectorists. Others volunteer and share their availability. By 2.23pm they have assembled a team.Five days later I’m standing in a damp field watching three detectorists preparing their gear: Craig Meredith, 42, who joined the group six years ago; Matthew Naish, 48, who was recently invited to a stranger’s wedding after finding her engagement ring; and Howard, who has forgotten his wellies. They are decked out like members of the SAS, with military-style webbing which they use to collect stray pieces of metal so they can clean the land as they go, and pinpoint detectors holstered on their sides. Naish has a patch on his cap that reads: WHO DIGS WINS.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenHolly McGowan Hayes (in patterned jacket) goes in search of her lost ring with friends and detectorists including Craig Meredith (in check shirt) and Morley Howard (in flat cap). Photographs: Joel Redman/The GuardianBefore the search I speak with Holly McGowan Hayes, 34, who was volunteering as a tree planter on the farm when the ring slipped off her finger. The silver Celtic braid had been passed down from her grandmother to her mother to her, but she’s surprisingly upbeat about the loss. “It has meant I’ve stumbled across this network of good guys,” she says. “It’s been heartwarming.”As we sludge through the thick mud retracing Hayes’s steps, the myriad detector frequencies beep and bounce around us. The task, to me, seems impossible. A detector head is the size of a dinner plate and we have three fields to scour, but everyone’s in good spirits. Hayes has brought a group along for support and they’re watching the detectorists with fascination and anticipation.Experience: I’m a professional gold hunterRead moreNaish and Meredith regularly stop to inspect promising patches, digging small holes before filling them back in. They move with incredible thoroughness and patience, inspecting every potential signal. It’s a slow, intense workout. I ask Howard if there’s such a thing as detectorist elbow and he says he often returns from a search with one arm bulging like Popeye’s.They sweep for hours. As the light fades, Naish suddenly picks up a strong frequency. He kneels, digs something out and brushes the muck off. It looks like a ring! He throws his head back and lets out a long groan. It’s another false alarm, likely a Roman period harness loop, which is given to Hayes as a consolation prize.It’s too dark to continue, so the search is called off. Howard is slightly dejected, but has an experienced outlook. “It’s not always about the find,” he says as we watch the detectorists huddle with Hayes, inspecting their bounty of miscellaneous metal. “When you make a friend, that’s probably your best find of the day.”As we head back, the detectorists continue their search, refusing to give up until we reach the cars. Then we stand in a circle and Howard tells Hayes they’ll return as many times as she’d like. As he’s chatting, his phone pings. He brings it to his face and from his intense expression, I get the impression it’s yet another request. There is no rest for your local, friendly detectorist.Explore more on these topicsHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive photograph: courtesy of Jeremy VineBorn in 1965 in Epsom, Surrey,Jeremy Vineis a journalist and broadcaster. Vine’s media career began at the Coventry Evening Telegraph before he landed a job at the BBC in 1987, where he has worked in a number of roles including as a political reporter, Africa correspondent and Newsnight presenter. As well as his weekday programme on BBC Radio 2, he presents a self-titled weekday morning show on Channel 5. His new novel, Murder on Line One, is out now.My dear old mumwould have pulled this costume together. If you dress a boy as a soldier, he will almost certainly crawl around the floor like a sniper, which I did. Shortly after this was taken, I decided to launch a large log over my shoulder as if it were a bazooka. The back of it hit my head on the way past. I did myself a bit of mischief that day.Aged five, I was a quiet, happy little boy who lived in an interior world. At the age of about seven I remember thinking, “I now know everything there is to know about life.” Which, of course, I didn’t. I was the guy who had no idea what sex was until they showed us a video at school.My brother is the comedianTim Vineand my sister is an artist called Sonya. I believe we all have creative careers because, growing up, we had to make our own fun. There wasn’t a lot going on in Cheam in the 70s. We could put the TV on, but there was nothing worth watching. The only real activity was playing outside and stroking the neighbour’s cat. There was the time my brother and I dug a hole. We got 6ft deep, then filled it back in. That was an entire Saturday.I got more anxious as a teenager, but I remained sheltered. My friends called me “The rebel of Cheam” – a send-up, because I was badly behaved by the standards of the suburbs. And really I did nothing untoward at all, except perhaps a silly practical joke when I was 15. I got 20 cans of tinned tomatoes, put radiation stickers on them and left them in the park. The police brought along Geiger counters and everything. The Sutton Guardian headline ran “Park cordoned off after nuclear waste hoax.” Nobody found out it was me. Until now.Beyond Paradise’s Kris Marshall looks back: ‘I was once fired from Iceland for wearing blue sunglasses on the till’Read moreIn general, I was a bit of a weirdo and outcast; the last person to get picked for the team. I studied a lot, but didn’t have the social graces. If you grow up as a boy, there is a certain status ladder you have to climb – and my feet were on none of the rungs. My dad didn’t drive a Maserati, I wasn’t good at cricket and I didn’t know the name of every car or Premier League team. As a result, I was bullied and beaten up a few times. Violence was a shock to me – I was no good at it. I’ve never thrown a punch – I never could. I’m not that kind of lad, but I wanted to be. I made up for that absence by mucking around and being silly. I continually showed off and, to some extent, that’s what I still do for a living. I find that bullied kids often end up on the radio. Who knows what the bullies end up doing.Music was a gatewayinto other worlds. My parents’ life revolved around going to church, church people visiting and doing Bible studies. Because they were brought up after the war, all they knew were restrictions, rationing and worrying. They had a very rigid idea of who I should be – which was to remain the quiet, well-behaved soldier in the photo. When the Sex Pistols came along in my teens, my parents were shocked that their previously conformist son was playing these punk songs so loudly. They were genuinely scared when the band went on TV and called [broadcaster] Bill Grundy a “dirty bastard”. Whereas I thought it was absolutely brilliant. “At last! Young people are breaking through!”It’s a very different dynamic between my two daughters and me. One is 18 and has the exact same musical register as me. I go to bed early and often hear her music pumping out of her room upstairs – the same Smiths songs that I adored.The moment I realisedI wanted to become a broadcaster was in 1977. I entered a competition on Capital Radio called Young DJ, where they gave kids a chance to play a few records on a programme called Hullabaloo. I got on, which was so exciting, and I even caught a glimpse of Kenny Everett, my absolute hero, in his studio. When I came home I said to my mum, “I’m going to be a DJ.” She said, “You may not want to do that for the whole of your life, but if you want to, then give it a go.” She was always supportive, but the only thing she said she didn’t ever want me to do was to write for Private Eye. I never have. But I have ended up a DJ onRadio 2. I still can’t play the records very well, but I’m learning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Someone had walked in with a starter pistol and the whole place was being treated as a crime scene. A weird way to start my career. I went on to become the Africa correspondent in the late 90s and lived in Johannesburg when Mandela was president. He would turn up at local events as if he was running a council. His business dealings were small-scale compared with the global icon he was. I would come home and look at the politicians in Westminster with contempt. All they did by comparison was run around looking at faxes.When people say,“What will you do after Radio 2?” I say, “I don’t know. Die?” I love my job. All I need is a red light and a microphone. The experience is a rush and it’s easy to get adrenal failure, but most of the time I find broadcasting the most delicious escape. Being on Channel 5 for nearly three hours each morning is like being inside a tornado, but I am excited to see what the day’s stories are. The only time I’ve ever found being present on air difficult was in my 40s. I had burnout, mainly because if you do a job you love, there is no safety mechanism. You drink all the honey. I couldn’t say no. Plus my kids were young. Now I realise that I was in hunter-gatherer mode. It was primal: “I have to feed everyone!” My sensitive brain was in a crisis when that whole period should have been joyful.Have I slowed down? If you look at my diary you wouldn’t think so. I went on holiday recently in South Africa and we had a week and a half off. I came home disconsolate, and I knew it was because I didn’t do anything creative. It’s not enough to sit and watch the sun go down. I have to write or speak, or create in whatever shape it takes.I look at the happy boy in that photo and realise nothing has hit me yet – the insecurity, the feelings of inadequacy. But, just like him, I remain a showoff, and I’ve still never done anything edgy. Unless, of course, you count donning a cowboy hat for the BBC’s 2008 election coverage. Which I do.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyJeremy VineRadio 2Tim VineBBCRadio industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some fast, plenty slow, and I’ve put together a few flat lays in my time. So I know how important it is to get marathon kit right.From the best marathon running shoes for speed and comfort to preventing the dreaded nipple chafe, kit choices can make or break your race-day dreams. Or, at the very least, they can be the difference between a happy day out and hours of torment on the tarmac.I can’t guarantee you’ll finish with a smile, but here’s my shortlist of the mission-critical kit you need to stack the odds in your favour. Starting with the most important item – your running shoes.The best kit for running a marathonShoes for first-timersView image in fullscreenThe correct shoe is the one that’ll work from mile one to mile 26.2.Photograph: caronwatson/Getty ImagesIn recent years, marketing hype has suggested you have to run a marathon in a carbon-plate super-shoe. However, thebest running shoefor first-time marathoners probably isn’t a stripped-back race shoe that prioritises speed over protection.I always advise beginners to ask themselves: will I still want to be running in this shoe if the wheels come off at mile 18, when I’m in a world of pain and everything feels slow, heavy and ragged? The correct shoe is the one that’ll work from mile one to mile 26.2. Those fall, roughly, into three camps.Tarmac-taming comfortView image in fullscreenBrooks Glycerin MaxThe Glycerin Max has a truly giant stack of new DNA Tuned nitrogen-infused foam to provide softness, springiness and maximum cushioning with a more reliable stability. When you’re running on tired, beaten-up legs, the cocooned, protective comfort will be kind to fatigued feet.Men’s£180 at Brooks Running£179.95 at Runners NeedWomen’s£180 at Brooks Running£179.95 at Runners NeedView image in fullscreenNike Vomero 18With a giant stack of foam, plush-padded heel collars and tongues, and soft, cosy uppers, everything about the Vomero 18 is geared towards cruising comfort. The dual-foam midsole is soft and cushioned without being leg-sapping. It’ll put some pep in your step when you’re moving well, but it’ll still look after you if you start to struggle. All that extra padding means it’s quite heavy, but you’re trading weight for comfort.Men’s£134.99, Nike£134.99 at Pro DirectWomen’s£134.99 at Nike£134.99 at Pro DirectComfort and speedView image in fullscreenAsics Novablast 5This non-plated, big-cushioned running shoe is primarily designed for everyday runs – and that’s part of the appeal. You can use it for most of your marathon trainingandit’ll perform on race day. The soft, bouncy, energetic midsole is versatile. It lacks the thrust of all-out race shoes, but the ride is still smooth, springy and controlled. When you’re moving well, with good form and pushing your pace, it returns the energy you put in. There’s plenty of road-impact protection at slower paces, too. It’s a capable marathon cruiser and no matter how you feel at mile 20, it’s got your back.Men’s£134.99 at Sports Shoes£135 at AsicsWomen’s£134.99 at Sports Shoes£135 at AsicsAll-out race shoesIf you’ve trained well, you’re in great shape and you fancy giving it full beans, lacing up a carbon race shoe can provide leg-sparing efficiency gains. It can also just make you feel fast. However, choose your weapon wisely.View image in fullscreenBrooks Hyperion Elite 4 PBFrom the current crop of carbon race shoes, Brooks’s latest racer would be my choice for beginners. It’s light and airy, and so comfortable on the foot that you can forget you’re wearing it. The 100% Peba superfoam midsole and plate are fast and smooth but, crucially, more natural and reliable than some wilder carbon race shoes. It delivers all the energy you want when you’re hitting your splits, but offers enough backup comfort should race plan A unravel to plan C!Unisex£200 at Brooks Running£199.90 at AmazonView image in fullscreenSaucony Endorphin Pro 4Springy and energetic but with a broader, nicely stable cushioned platform, this shoe offers some of that super-shoe energy and efficiency but with much more road protection to fall back on should things get tough deep into the race. If you need to slow down and rock back on your heels, the Endorphin Pro 4’s high-cushion platform will help you wobble home in comfort.Men’s£229.95 at Runners Need£230 at SauconyWomen’s£229.95 at Runners Need£230 at SauconyClocking up indoor miles?

Much comes down to personal preference, but it’s worth investing in run-specific underwear that uses soft fabric that wicks well, with minimal or flat seams to help avoid chafing.Runderwearis a popular choice. I also recommend the sports underwear specialist CXP. Its range of running and training briefs – for men and women – is incredibly light, comfortable and reliable against unwanted rubbing. There are a few different styles, but the CXP XP Endurance is ideal for longer training and events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Others prefer the second-skin, suit-of-armour coverage offered by longer-leg half-tights. For sheer practicality, I find the best option is the storage short.A good pair of storage shorts combine built-in belts, zippered pockets and leg pockets to provide all the stash space you need to carry gels, phone, headphones and your other marathon essentials. Often you need to look for trail shorts for maximum storage, and the Asics Fujitrail Elite shorts are a great example of a lightweight option with ample stash space.Running socksView image in fullscreenStanceIcon Sport crew£12.99 at StanceThose old cotton gym socks might work for the odd 5km, but they’re a fast ticket to blisters when you start increasing your distances. Happy feet make for a happy runner, so you definitely want a few good pairs of comfortable, durable technical running socks in your kitbag. There are plenty of good brands to choose from, but Stance stands out.You can’t go far wrong with a pair of Stance’s run-technical socks, but these crew socks are an excellent mid-cushioned choice that are great for comfort on longer runs. They’re quite thick but that generous padding in the reinforced heel, toes and all the way around the foot will be welcome in hour three of the marathon.Running watchesView image in fullscreenCoros Pace 3£219.99 at Decathlon£219 at AmazonThe light and compact Pace 3 is one of the best-value running watches you can buy. It offers an impressive 38 hours of battery, reliable dual-frequency GPS and a competitive suite of in-depth training, health and recovery features, including marathon training plans, fitness progress and recovery insights. Everything you need to train for a marathon is covered, along with handy tools for race day, such as a virtual pacer and race-time predictions.View image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 165 Music£289 at Argos£288.56 at AmazonIt’s pricier than the Coros, but the Forerunner 165 Music is a highly capable watch with enough training and race-tracking tools to conquer a marathon. The bright, smartwatch-style AMOLED display punches up the visibility of your vital stats, the 19-hour GPS battery life happily endures race day and there are reliable GPS and heart-rate trackers. If you want to run phone-free, it also offers offline Spotify. Garmin’s PacePro tool can create a pacing strategy based on your marathon course with real-time feedback along the way.Race-friendly running headphonesView image in fullscreenAmazfit Up£42.68 at AmazonAn excellent open-ear alternative to bone-conduction headphones, the lightweight, clip-on Up is among the more affordable running headphones. Yet it has plenty of marathon-friendly features for the price. That includes an unshakeable fit that leaves your ears open, so you can soundtrack your run but stay tuned into the race-day atmosphere. If you struggle wearing in-ear buds for hours on end, this new style is more comfortable. It’s a bit like clipping two tiny speakers in front of your ears, where they kick out surprisingly big, run-boosting sound. Throw in a marathon-taming six hours of playback on the buds – 18 more in the charging case – and you’ve got a cut-price rival for classic headphones.Other marathon essentialsAnti-chafeView image in fullscreen2Toms Sport Shield£17.99 at Mountain Warehouse£18.99 at AmazonStand at the finish line of any major marathon and you’ll see countless runners crossing the line with big red circles around their nipples: the bloody aftermath of spending 26.2 miles with fabric rubbing your soft bits raw. I’ve been that runner. It’s a painful mistake you make only once.2Toms’ Sport Shield roll-on oil has been my go-to for a decade to avoid that fate. It provides a trusty barrier against unwanted friction burns. It’s easy to apply to all the at-risk areas – nipples, thighs, under arms – and even the hardest-to-reach nooks and crannies.It’s relatively mess-free and covers easily, and one application lasts all day. The tube is portable, too – should you need to take it with you. There’s also a Sport Shield Extra variety that offers more waterproofing and skin-soothing extras, such as aloe, green tea extract and shea butter.Sun creamView image in fullscreenRiemann P20 SPF50+spray, 200ml£19.99 at Boots£24 at Look FantasticWhen you’re training and racing, you’ll spend long hours exposed to the sun’s harmful rays, so it’s smart to slather on sunscreen. However, traditional sun creams run when you sweat and often require reapplication.I’ve been putting on P20 SPF50+ ever since I used it to fend off the Saharan sun while running the Marathon des Sables in 2015. It’s water- and sweat-resistant, so it doesn’t leak into your eyes and partly blind you mid-run. The spray bottle also makes application about as mess-free as sun protection gets. And one liberal coating protects from all the sun’s nasties for 10 hours.Get your post-run recovery sorted with our expert-approved guide tothe best massage gunsDon’t bother with …Hydration vestThere are benefits to running with a hydration vest, and they’re great for being self-sufficient on long training runs. Having water always at hand during a race breeds confidence and saves you grabbing cups from hectic water stations on the move. Vests also offer a convenient way to carry your energy gels. However, you’ll feel less burdened if you leave it at home on race day. Most big-city marathons have aid stations at frequent points, so if you want to lighten your load you can safely leave the pack.Compression arm sleevesYou’ll see lots of runners slipping on compression arm sleeves in search of marginal gains. These elasticated accessories are designed to improve blood flow, help boost oxygen delivery and limit the movement that causes tiny muscle tears, affecting recovery times. Research suggests, though, there’s no real performance benefit for runners. So unless you’re using them for warmth, or you really love the way they look or make you feel, skip them.Explore more on these topicsMarathon runningThe FilterRunningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Black families face an outsize riskReniqua Allen-LamphereMy fear growing up was gun violence. But a bigger threat to my body may have come from an invisible villainSun 27 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 19.51 EDTShareEveryone experiences a moment that shapes who they are – a moment when childhood innocence is lost, and the burdens and traumas of the world become clearer.For me, that moment occurred in elementary school when my friend discovered a gun in Denning Park in Englewood,New Jersey. For days, I worried about what might be lurking behind the trees and in the shadows. This anxiety lingered through high school; I even wrote in my local newspaper that “I couldn’t remember anything more frightening for a young girl in elementary school”.Looking back at the violence-obsessed, fear-driven 90s, I thought dangerous people and violent weapons were the biggest threat to my body. It turns out that an invisible villain may have been the real danger.Black maternal health means navigating a broken system. But there is hope | Venice HaynesRead moreBack then, my suburban town of hardworking families felt like the heart of the Black American dream. Not perfect, but peaceful. Redlined, but filled with love.We lived in the shadow of factories bordering our beloved park. Companies such as the LeDoux Corporation, a chemical testing company that had worked on everything from the Manhattan Project to the moon landing, were just steps from the swings.While I was consumed by the potential danger of some shadowy, gun-toting figure, the real pain I felt was internal. My reproductive system betrayed me month after month, leaving me doubled over in excruciating pain. While the world validated my fear of violence, my period pain – marked by ER visits, surgeries and more than 30 Aleve each cycle – was dismissed as “in my head”. No one asked questions or explored its cause, let alone its potential environmental roots.Instead, I was handed birth-control pills and told to go about my merry way, even though Black people are far more likely to live in areas filled with environmental toxins that can harm fertility. We’re75% more likelyto live near industrial facilities and breathe air that’s38% more pollutedthan what white communities are exposed to.Discussions about toxins and the environment usually focus on cancer. However, a recentHuman Rights Watchreport found that air pollution is linked to gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and fibroids. On the heels of Earth Day and Infertility Awareness Week, it’s worth remembering that contaminants such as heavy metals and industrial solvents areassociatedwith infertility and pregnancy complications due to endocrine disruption.Uranium exposure can disrupt menstrual cycles and contribute to conditions including endometriosis, which I had, and can impact fertility. These contaminants loweregg qualityand increase the risk of miscarriage.Last year, I began a documentary about how the climate crisis – flooding, heat, wildfires, hurricanes – affects Black people who are pregnant or trying to conceive. It was an urgent story that felt both intimately familiar and strangely distant, since many of their environments were marked by large factories, disastrous floods and devastating hurricanes.Across the country, their stories echoed mine: shame around infertility, questions of illness and correlation, dismissive doctors and public officials, and frustration that their stories would go unheard or, worse, that their lives just didn’t matter.I first heard from Marquita in Tennessee, who put it this way: “When a woman, through no fault of her own, doesn’t have a viable pregnancy, sometimes people make it seem as if it’s her fault. There is a conversation happening about Black maternal health, but I feel like they’re not connecting it to pollution.”Then there was Shamell in Louisiana’s notorious “Cancer Alley”, who talked about being blamed for her infertility: “I learned I wasn’t ovulating because I was insulin resistant. Chemicals like benzene are endocrine disruptors that contribute to diabetes. It’s not necessarily what you’re eating or drinking.”It wasn’t until my mom mentioned that Denning Park had been closed due to concerns about toxic contamination from the factories falling into the brook behind the park (which was flooding more frequently because of the climate crisis) that the link between it all became clear to me.An old family friend posted about growing up in the park in the 60s and 70s: “As kids, we always played in the brook and thought it was fun when the water changed colors and stained our hands … Our neighborhood smelled like rotten eggs every day when we came home from school, which I now know was the smell of sulfur. I can only imagine the toxins we were exposed to.” My fears were validated, and I hoped for answers about my reproductive health issues.In February, a city councilmeetingrevealed that 37 samples from the park had tested negative for radiation, with no history of radiation found, and the park was reopened. While some felt relieved, others called for more expansive chemical testing. A frustrated councilmember criticized residents for raising the contamination issue and essentially claimed the park was a red herring. He claimed that they were playing politics and mad over a development project for a cannabis factory and new apartment complex, and their complaints had led to the city losing a grant: “We need to ensure that discussions are based on knowledge, not wild speculation.” Yeah.Wild speculationabout a park next to a place where apackage of uranium went missingin 2005.It reminded me of Kay Gaudet, a Louisiana pharmacist who raised alarms in the 1980s about chemical exposure leading to increased miscarriages, only to be met with skepticism. One industry official told theWashington Postin 1987: “They say the chemical plants are causing the miscarriages, but they have no proof. I could say they screw too much, and that’s the cause of the miscarriages. But then I would have no way to prove that.”Like the residents of those communities, the burden of proof fell on folks in my old neighborhood, and their worries were cast as “speculation” instead of a legitimate call for further investigation. Meanwhile, rollbacks in Washington under theTrump administrationto theNational Institutes of Healthand Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have only made it harder to conduct environmental studies and reproductive health research.I’m a Black gun owner. I have mixed feelings about gun control | Akin OllaRead moreGrowing up, I never imagined that something invisible – something without a face or a trigger – could be responsible for my pain. Like so many others, I may never find concrete answers. The connection between the environment and my reproductive health isn’t a clean narrative. It’s messy and complicated and doesn’t fit neatly into a single report. But that doesn’t mean it’s just a story that shouldn’t be taken seriously.I moved away from Englewood years ago, but my mom still lives there. I wanted my children to play at Denning Park, enjoy all the laughter and smiles like I did. But now I’m not sure if it is safe, not because of guns or shadowy figures, but a system of intersectional oppressions that have ignored the voices of Black and Brown communities and disregarded women’s stories.When we reflect on “wild speculation” by Aristotle or Galileo, we call it a hypothesis, not some type of paranoia. This scrutiny is how we get closer to the truth, how we investigate and understand harm, especially harms that are more subtle than a gun in a park.Reniqua Allen-Lamphere is a film-maker and writer.

It’s no wonder mountain rescuers are being called out so oftenSun 27 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 16.09 EDTShareIt does not involve protest or violence, but it might be the quintessential human image of our times: a small group of people in the midst of spectacular natural scenery, drawn there in the certainty that the apps on their phones could somehow get them from A to B to C – but utterly, hopelessly lost.Two weeks ago, Mountain Rescue England and Wales published figures showinga record number of annual callouts. For the first time, in fact, teams – of overworked volunteers, mostly – had been called out on every day of the year. Between 2019 and 2024, the total number of rescues had increased by 24%, and there was a marked jump among the 18 to 24 age group, among whom callouts almost doubled. Similar trends were evident in data from Scotland: across Britain, there is evidently a mounting problem about the gap between people’s urge to experience wild and open spaces, and their ability to cope when they actually get there.The Guardian’s report included an incisive quotation from Mike Park, the chief executive of Mountain RescueEnglandand Wales, who talked about incidents in the Lake District, Eryri (Snowdonia), Northumberland and other places. “We know from incident reports that more and more people are tempted into risky locations by Instagram posts and the navigation apps being used aren’t always suitable for an outdoor environment,” he said. Whatever people found online either underplayed or completely ignored what he called “the hazards and context” – or, put more bluntly, the real world.Welcome, then, to yet another version of a familiar story: how seemingly infallible technology turns out to be nothing of the kind. Superficially,digital navigationbased on GPS tech seems massively empowering. In most of our everyday environments, that promise usually just about holds true. But it is also quintessentially infantilising, leaving us unable to get around without it, or cope with its shortcomings.Most of us know the horror and panic that comes with sudden battery loss in an unfamiliar place, and that weird sense of being cut adrift from basic skills that human beings have had since they learned to walk upright (if not before). But those hapless souls getting lost up mountains have confronted something even more fear-inducing: that once you are away from roads and built-up environments, many of the most dependable apps suddenly run out of detailed information.When that happens, do we even have the skills any more to find our way back to safety? In 2020, neuroscientists based at McGill University in Montrealpublished researchsuggesting that “people with greater lifetime GPS experience have worse spatial memory during self-guided navigation”. Thirteen of their participants were retested three years after the initial research, when they found that “greater GPS use since initial testing was associated with a steeper decline in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory”. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that deals with navigation: amongLondon taxi drivers, the need to memorise so many geographical details was found to cause it to increase in size. But here were findings that suggested the opposite: reliance on automated directions reducing people’s capacity to navigate for themselves.There is something even more profound and insidious at work here. On our phones, all that really matters is an archetypal blue dot, representing a single individual. As the writer and academicJerry Brottonputs it in his brilliant book Four Points of the Compass – published last year – this represents “the most extreme expression of a long history of egocentric mapping”. Anyone familiar with the history of ancient Rome willrecall Ptolemy, the mathematician and astronomer who believed that the planets of the solar system, along with the sun, revolved around the Earth. Here is our delusional modern equivalent: a version of reality that puts us at the centre of everything. It also offers no clues about what awaits us further along the route: the journey just unfolds by increments.Worse still, what the most-used navigation apps – Google and Apple maps – most clearly show is the location of shops and restaurants, embodying the sense that, as Brotton puts it, “what matters most is where we stand and how we consume, often at the expense of an immersive understanding of and interaction with our physical domain”. The result is that “individuals online can be virtually connected but environmentally detached from the surrounding world, inhabiting a confused realm of spatial illiteracy”. If that can happen even in towns and cities, what hope have we got amid fells, lochs and forests?Lost your sense of direction? Turn off your phone and you’ll soon reconnectRead moreWanting to believe you are omniscient while constantly running the risk of accident and disaster might be the basis of the human condition, but the revolution in human thinking caused by the internet seems to have taken it to a surreal new extreme. It is surely telling that amid the endless profusion of apps designed to tell us where we are, how fast or slow our heart is beating and the latest news headlines, the word that seems toconstantly crop upin articles about the way we now live is “disorientation”. In that sense, people’s inability to find their way through the physical world reflects our declining skills at navigation more generally – and through information in particular. These are the consequences of the 21st century’s insistence that everything must be personalised: it distorts our understanding of the world to the point of near-fiction.And so, at the risk of sounding like someone’s dad, to some practical advice. If anyone is thinking of venturing into the wild but unsure of how to avoid disaster, I’d recommend the Ordnance Survey’s peerless phone app – which requires a subscription – and a paper map as a back-up, either in the form of the full fold-out version, or a relevant section shown in a reliable guidebook. Always carry a compass. Before you set off, do what the blue dot discourages, and cast your eyes across the whole route, mindful of the aforementioned hazards and context, and what apps underplay or omit: bogs, high streams and rivers, steep gradients.More broadly, we clearly need to talk about improving people’s understanding of what the countryside is like up close, and how to get around it – a conversation that might revive interest in the much-mocked subject of geography. Here, perhaps, is the key to reconnecting the world we see on our phones and the one we have to actually deal with. That is the breach that needs to be healed: if it isn’t, even more generations will find themselves lost, in every sense of the word.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionAppsGPSOrdnance SurveyWalkingMapsEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s something Reform and the Tories will never understandSun 27 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 06.55 EDTShareDo you know somebody who is good at fixing the local church roof? Who is well liked in your community? Well, if we are to go by the comments of the leader of the Conservative party, Kemi Badenoch, they are quite likely to be standing as a Liberal Democrat candidate in next week’s local elections.Yes, that’s right. According to Badenoch, a Lib Dem is “somebody who is good atfixing their church roof. And … the people in the community like them.”Reader, I will let you in on a secret. I think she meant it as an insult. But I’ll happily wear it as a badge of honour – as will more than 1,000 Lib-Dem candidates standing across England for election on 1 May. And don’t her comments tell you all you need to know about the state of the Tory party in 2025? Completely out of touch, serially online and with a sneering attitude to serving your community.The Conservatives were deservedly kicked out of office last year by the British public. But, sadly, whole swathes of the country are still having to put up with the dire record of failing Tory-run councils and councillors. And in so many parts of England – from Cornwall to Cambridgeshire – it is the Lib Dems who are the main challengers. We are a party that views being achampion for local people– fixing a church roof or a pothole, or helping clean up a local river – as something worth fighting for.I have been travelling across the country these past few weeks – albeit via some unusual modes of transport: swan boats, diggers, teacups and, of course, a horse (of the hobby variety). And so many of the local people I’ve met have told me about how they want to kick the Conservatives out of local government in their area.View image in fullscreenEd Davey at a local election campaign launch at Badgemore golf club on in Henley-on-Thames on 31 March.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesBut I have also been struck by the disappointment at the new Labour government. Before I embarked on arollercoaster rideat the Big Sheep theme park in Devon last week, the owner explained to me how, while they were looking forward to a new government after years of struggling through a cost of living crisis, Labour’s changes have actually made things worse. The hospitality industry in the south-west, and across so many parts of the country, is being hammered. Wherever I go, there has been a sense of despondency – whether about the cut to the winter fuel payment, which has forced pensioners to choose between heating or eating, or the failure to solve the longstanding crisis in social care.Anger at the Conservatives, despondency at Labour. It is in these conditions that the easy soundbites of Nigel Farage and Reform UK can start to sound compelling. But theoccasional memberfor Clacton and his ilk offer no real solutions.Let’s be frank: if you want to fix the NHS, why would you put your trust in a man who has in the past said he wanted to replace healthcare that’s free at the point of use with an insurance-based model(whatever hemay say now)? If you care about high-quality British food, why would you support someonewho is in favourof allowing US chlorinated chicken on to UK supermarket shelves? And if you love your country, why stick with someone who would rathersuck up to Vladimir Putin– the world leader he admires most – than stand up for Britain?I’ve quit the Tory party because it’s become a Trumpesque mess. Others will follow | Jamie GreeneRead moreIn the Hull and East Yorkshire mayoral election, what everyone expected to be a Lib Dem v Labour fight is turning into one between theLib Dems and Reform. That’s why the bookies’ odds now show Reform and the Lib Dems in the top two, with Labour trailing in fourth place as eight to one outsiders. When you compare the records of the two parties, there is no contest. We have a strong record of running Hull council – and many other local authorities across the country – and of being an effective opposition in East Riding. Meanwhile, Farage can’t even run his own party. He and his MPs are fighting like rats in a sack. He is overseeing a bin fire – yet wants you to believe that Reform can be trusted with running your local bin collections.The fundamental difference is that the Lib Dems work hard for our communities. We are winning up and down the country.

Trust me: you don’t want to know my innermost thoughtsSun 27 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 12.38 EDTShareAfew years ago, a friend asked me to be her “literary executor”. We were both, I think, tickled by the grandiose sound of it, as if I would be playing off competing bids from the Bodleian and the New York Public Library for her juvenilia and early drafts (she is not actually primarily a writer). What she wants, though, is quite serious: I am to destroy her diaries when she dies.That is because they aren’t meant for anyone’s eyes but her own. Whatever is in there (I don’t know, didn’t ask), it was never meant for public consumption. Many diarists feel that way: Sheila Hancockwroteabout destroying decades’ worth of hers: “Maybe this vicious, verging-on-insane woman is the real me, but if it is I don’t want my daughters to find out.”Perhaps the lateJoan Didionneeded someone like me in her life. The response to the recent publication of her therapy journals, Notes to John,has mostly spanned unease to stark horror. Just those words “therapy journals” explain why, but dismayed reviewers have found them “naked”, “raw” and “brutal” and Didion’s writing “frequently boring”, full of pain that had not been distilled and crafted into the precise, controlled beauty of the life writing she chose to publish. Her assistant, Cory Leadbeater,described their publicationas “a deeply uncomfortable thing”. There is a sense of violation – what is it doing out there, in public?It’s tricky. We would have been deprived of some extraordinary writing if private diaries and journals were never published, fromSamuel PepystoSylvia PlathorKenneth Williams. I’m currently reading the Australian authorHelen Garner’s, which are full of intimate pain (when an editor suggested their publication, Garner initially, understandably, “freaked”) but also luminous observation, humour and joy. Reviewing them,Leslie Jamison noted, “Sometimes we want theunmade beds, with messy sheets … the fossils of curled hairs on the pillow, the faint salt of dried sweat.” It can feel grubbily prurient, peering at the diary writer’s dirty laundry, but it can also be transporting or deeply comforting.I think we have accepted the idea of diaries as entertainment too: think of the vogue for events where people readmortifying extracts from their teenage journals, or the publication of more public-facing ones. Alan Bennett and David Sedaris must write with at least one eye to future publication. Garner burned her earlier diaries, but eventually chose to edit, anonymise, then publish these later ones.You can see an ambivalence about exposure in how some diarists treat their material: Pepys wrote in hard-to-decipher shorthand, but had his diaries bound and carefully preserved. There is an argument that Didion – perfectly aware of her own image and cachet – must have known anything she left behind would end up published. “My guess is … she would completely understand the literary interest,” Leadbeater added.But there must be a safe place for the entirely private diary – somewhere to tease out pain or document the ordinary, occasionally sublime day-to-day, purely for yourself. That is what makes me wish I had the discipline. “For a diarist life ceases to be an indistinct blur. Experiences are there in sharp focus,”Michael Palinsaid of his lifelong habit. As I get older, I am realising how dense the blur has become, childhood and adolescence reduced to a few half-remembered, probably wrongly, vignettes. I can’t conjure many memories of my sons as babies either; I would love to have recorded those endless days before the years sprinted away from me.The thing is, though, I know any diary I wrote would have been too horrifically cringey to reread: self-conscious “literary” pretension, interspersed with whining and domestic resentment (the passages that resonated most in Garner’s diaries were the comforting likes of “I am theonly onewho ever cleans the lavatories”). I want to burn mine and they don’t even exist. Some underbellies just aren’t supposed to be exposed and I hate the idea of that happening to anyone, however famous, however beautiful or revelatory their writing might have been.That is why I have no problem with my mission. It doesn’t matter if my friend might have been the Pepys of our age: I shall execute my orders without a peep.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionDeath and dyingJoan DidioncommentShareReuse this content"

Deepening debt in the developing worldRead moreA quarter century on from the hugely consequential Jubilee 2000 movement – in which churches played a major role – the pope had asked a commission chaired by the economist Joseph Stiglitz to report on the issue next month.Debt reliefis also likely to be discussed at the UN financing for development conference in Seville in late June.But there was little optimism in Washington that any country is prepared to offer the necessary moral and political leadership to force the issue up the agenda. Certainly, it will not be the UK, which played a crucial role in the Jubilee 2000 campaign under Gordon Brown, but has shown little interest in the issue since imposing brutal cuts to aid spending, to boost defence.Meanwhile, ample evidence was shared in Washington to show how the situation is rapidly deteriorating. The IMF’s analysts warned that Trump’s dramatic shake-up of the global trading system, the final shape of which remains impossible to guess, willdepress economic growthand ratchet up the risks of financial crisis.For emerging economies, the outlook is especially bleak. Many had already been left heavily indebted, after grappling with the Covid pandemic. And asthe IMF’s Global Financial Stability Review made clear, one side-effect of the market chaos triggered by Trump’s “liberation day” is likely to be tighter financial conditions.That will make it harder, and more costly, for countries to refinance their debts – a problem the IMF said could be compounded by fresh volatility in the currency markets.The more is spent on debt repayments, the less is available for important areas of government spending that are necessary for development. As Achim Steiner, the head of the UN’s development arm, the UNDP,said on the sidelines of the spring meetings: “The debt servicing is essentially a defunding. We’re defunding, or forcing countries to take money out of their social and welfare and education budgets and health budgets just to service their debt. This is for obvious reasons bad: it’s not sustainable and ultimately contributes further to locking countries in into this stagnation.”He added: “If you are defunding your own education system, you’re locking yourself into a generation that is going to fall behind.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since 2022, 80% have cut social spending as a share of their budget.This comes at a time when the economic impacts of the climate crisis are already being felt, in the soaring costs of extreme weather events for example. There is a consensus, at least outside the White House, that significant investment will be needed to manage the transition away from fossil fuels.Another report launched in Washington last week– from the expert panel on climate and finance, a joint project of the Colombian, French, Kenyan and German governments – warned of a “vicious circle”, between the “debt, climate and nature crises”.“Debt pressures and environmental vulnerabilities are most pronounced in the poorest and most credit-constrained countries … yet these countries account for only a tiny fraction of the consumption and emissions driving nature loss and climate change,” they said.Even the IMF itself suggested last week that debt restructuring may need to be part of the toolkit to respond to the rapidly changing economic and financial situation.“The path forward demands clarity and coordination. Countries should work constructively to promote a stable and predictable trade environment, facilitate debt restructuring, and address shared challenges,” it said in its World Economic Outlook.But campaigners complain that the IMF’s debt restructuring process, the Common Framework, is cumbersome and time-consuming – and can still leave beneficiaries with high servicing costs, because it does not contemplate debt write-offs.Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, when he was not taking anti-woke side swipes at the IMF and the World Bank, said he would like to see the IMF get more involved in restructuring struggling countries’ debt. In amuch-analysed speech, he said the IMF should “more proactively push official bilateral lenders to come to the table early, to work with borrower countries to minimise periods of debt distress”.Some development campaigners seized on his comments as a positive sign that the US would not stand in the way of multilateral efforts to ease the burden for the world’s poor.But others warned that in saying that he wanted to “make the IMF again”, and calling for it to be a “brutal truth teller”, Bessent appeared to be yearning for a return to the bad old days of economic shock theory, when the fund swept into struggling countries and imposed a prescription of harsh spending cuts and privatisation.Meanwhile, as they geared up to amplify Francis’s calls for a jubilee, some in Washington last week privately warned it may take a large-scale default to force the world’s powerful to accept the need to lift developing countries’ debt burdens. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.Explore more on these topicsDebt reliefEconomics viewpointPope FrancisInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)World BankTrump administrationGlobal economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Will that be enough to win Canada’s election?Erica IfillHe’s got name recognition and gravitas. But he lacks ideas for how to heal the fissures in Canadian societySun 27 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTShareMonday’sCanadian federal electionis likely to determine the economic future of the country for years to come. Someone should inform the Conservatives and the New Democratic party (NDP). On 6 January this year, Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as prime minister and leader of the Liberal party, which had been in power since 2015. His resignation cameamid plummeting support: the Liberals hadn’t formed a majority government since 2019 and on the day Trudeau resigned, the party netted its lowest approval ratingat 20%. After a truncated leadership race, Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister and leader of the Liberal party. He is now on the brink of retaining his position.Pierre Poilievre, on the other hand, leader of the official opposition Conservative party, has seen his party’s fortunes ignominiouslydrop from 44%support when Trudeau resigned to 37% on 9 April. This is a battle of leadership, and while for two and a half years Poilievre seemed on course for victory at the next election, the re-election of Donald Trump in November reoriented politics. Poilievre has been flatfooted and unable to adjust to the new environment. Now he is struggling toretain his own seat.Prior to Trump’s election, Poilievre shaped the political conversation by attacking Trudeau, and was successful in denigrating one of Trudeau’s signature policies, the carbon tax to combat the climate crisis. With his slogan “axe the tax” he blamed the carbon tax for the rising cost of living. The slogan was catchy and seemed to address the financial squeeze many households were facing. His hammering of Trudeau’s climate policy and his frequent claims that Canada was broken contributed to the former prime minister’s plummeting approval rating.Unfortunately for Poilievre, we are now in the era of Trump, in which national pride – in opposition to the US president’s promise to annex Canada tobecome the 51st state– has galvanised the country. Prioritising Canadian-made products, Canadian stores and Canadian culture, the country finally speaks with one voice that says, “elbows up” – a reference to a defensive hockey move, that has become a national rallying cry.The NDP is also seeing support fall to its lowest level since 1993, when it won only nine seats. The party’s support has dropped fromabout 19%at the time of Trudeau’s resignation to as low as 8.2%. Leader Jagmeet Singh’s undignified performance on the campaign trail may cause the loss of official party status (for which a minimum of 12 seats is required) in the House of Commons. In other words, the NDP is irrelevant.The economy is now the focus of the election. The main question is whose stewardship will bring about a better outcome for the country and its future. When asked about affordability during the leaders’ English language debate,Carney responded: “The biggest risk we have to affordability, the biggest risk we have to this economy is Donald Trump.” In other words, tariffs and Trump are our biggest rivals to prosperity, rather than a paltry carbon tax that Carney had in any casealready cancelled.View image in fullscreenConservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre, campaigns in Vaughan, Ontario, 22 April 2025.Photograph: Arlyn McAdorey/ReutersIn this race, Poilievre is a minnow and Carney, the former Bank ofCanadaand Bank of England governor, is the shark. Carney may be confirmed in Canada’s highest office simply through having the gravitas and requisite employment record to steward the economy, despite lacking political experience.This election also exposes asignificant generational divide. The Conservatives have captured the 49-and-under demographic, while the Liberals are the strongest with those over 49. One major reason for this is asset ownership and appreciation. Older Canadians own houses, and have investments that have matured at a healthy pace, especially in an inflationary economic environment. The value of their capital holdings has appreciated over time, and therefore they can capitalise on increasing house prices. But for those who seek to get on to the property ladder, rising house prices have negated the opportunity for upward economic and social mobility, and expensive rents have hamstrung a lot of young people. Their money can only go so far, as they have experienced a falling real wage due to inflation.According to an OECD report, Canadian “real wages are still 2.4% lower than they were just before the pandemic in Q4 2019”.Inflation has made Canada a very expensive place to live. Housing, food and energy, to name a few expenses, have soared. Trump’s tariffs threaten to cause a recession that could see many Canadians lose their jobs, especially in the working class. Those on lower incomes are more likely to vote Conservative, whereas those with university degrees are more likely to be Liberal supporters. Poilievre has hammered the Liberals on the affordability crisis, accusing the party of failing to fully address it; while the Conservatives haveframed their platformaround the growing cost of living for families,the Liberals’ platformis a framework for nation-building. The latter does not address the immediate affordability crises many Canadians face.A big problem for the Conservatives is that women reject the party. Ekos, a political polling company,calculates the female voteat 51% for the Liberals, compared to 26% for the Conservatives. Poilievre appears to give some women the ick. His aggressive communication style, gruff responses to questions and constant attack mode are turn-offs. It is difficult to find women posing behind him at press conferences amid a wall of men. Women are also more likely than men to vote to preserve social services, which is not Poilievre’s mainstay. He voted against the three largest publicly funded social programmes that have been designed during the last decade, including affordable childcare, dental care and pharmacare.Unfortunately, there are issues that have not been addressed in this election. The English-language leaders’ debate focused on rightwing talking points such as crime, border security, energy and tariffs. Left out were many social issues, allowing candidates to avoid answering questions about funding for public services. If there is a recession, politicians are likely to cut social services to the bone, disproportionately affecting poor and working-class Canadians. The homelessness crisis,opioid overdose epidemicand climate catastrophe are all going unaddressed. We also need more funding for community programmes to elevate the many marginalised people in Canada – but since the debate did not touch on those issues, we have no idea what the parties’ positions are.Nor did we hear anything regarding Indigenous rights beyond establishing partnerships for pipeline expansion. TheTruth and Reconciliation recommendationshave yet to be wholly implemented. We still have work to do with implementing the recommendations of themissing and murdered Indigenous women and girls inquiryand infrastructure upgrades on reserves. Carney and the Liberal platform have produced vague commitments on Indigenous rights, but most racialised Canadians have been ignored in both Carney’s and Poilievre’s visions for Canada.This election is focused more on Canada and less on Canadians. It lacks solutions for those who are struggling. It’s offering trickle-down politics, instead of relief and community-building from the ground up. Without those, no nationalism will heal the fissures in Canadian society.Erica Ifill is a political columnist based in CanadaExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionJustin TrudeauAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

We’re headed toward a collisionSun 27 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 17.39 EDTShareDonald Trumpissued his declaration of war against his “enemies within” at the Department of Justice on 14 March. Thus the president launched a constitutional crisis that encompasses not just agroup of migrants snatchedwithout due process and transported against federal court orders to aforeign prison, but a wholesale assault on virtually every major institution of American society.“We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose, and very much expose, their egregious crimes and severe misconduct,” he pledged. “It’s going to be legendary.”Trump’s speechcondensed his mission to its despotic essence. While he distilled his contempt, Trump also marked his disdain for the traditional conservatism of limited government, respect for the law and liberty. He defined his project, built on his executive orders as substitutes for the law, to crown himself with unrestrained powers to intimidate, threaten and even kidnap. His political philosophy is a ruthless quest for absolute power.Want to beat authoritarianism? Look to Latin America | Greg GrandinRead moreTrump hailed his appointees for being “so tough” – the enthusiastically compliant attorney general,Pam Bondi, and the irrepressible flunky FBI director, Kash Patel. He attacked lawyers whose firms he would issue executive orders against to eviscerate their work – “really, really bad people”. He claimed Joe Biden and the former attorney general Merrick Garland “tried to turn America into a corrupt communist and third-world country”. And he described “people that come into our country” as “stone-cold killers. These are killers like – they make our killers look nice by comparison. They make our killers look nice. These are rough, tough people with the tattoos all over their face.” Trump’s accusations are invariably projections of his own malice that he manufactures into politically pliable paranoia.No staff attorneys within the department were invited to the speech, as people at the justice department told me. The senior lawyers from the Public Integrity Section had alreadyresignedwhen Trump attempted to coerce them to participate indropping the prosecutionof New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, for corruption in exchange for his support of Trump’s coming roundup and deportation of migrants. After Trump, a convicted felon, concluded by comparing himself to Al Capone, the mafia boss convicted of tax evasion – “the great Alphonse Capone, legendary Scarface, was attacked only a tiny fraction of what Trump was attacked” – Trump’s theme song from his political rallies, YMCA, blared out of the loudspeakers in the department auditorium.The next day, Trump announced hisexecutive orderciting the Alien Enemies Act of 1789, a wartime measure, to incarcerate members of the Tren de Aragua gang he asserted were coordinating with the Maduro government of Venezuela to commit “brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking”. (On 20 March, the New York Timesreported: “The intelligence community assessment concluded that the gang, Tren de Aragua, was not directed by Venezuela’s government or committing crimes in the United States on its orders, according to the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity.”)The238 menabducted were taken without any due process to a maximum-security prison operated by the Salvadorian strongman Nayib Bukele, who calls himself “the coolest dictator” and whosegovernment is being paidat least $6m in an arrangement with the Trump administration.In a hearing on 24 March before the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, Judge Patricia Millett, criticizing the absence of due process,said: “Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act.” She asked the deputy assistant attorney general, Drew Ensign, arguing the administration’s case: “What’s factually wrong about what I said?”“Well, your Honor, we certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,” he replied.Trump’s assertion of emergency power under the Alien Enemies Act is more than a bit analogous to the ideas of Carl Schmitt, the chief legal scholar and apologist of the Nazi regime, “crown juristof the Third Reich”. The falsity, according to the intelligence community, of Trump’s claim about the men underlines the analogy of Trump’s argument to Schmitt’s. “Authority, not truth, produces law,” Schmitt wrote. “Sovereign is he who decides on invocation of the state of emergency.” And then: “Der Ausnahmefall offenbart das Wesen der staatlichen Autorität am klarsten” – “The State of Emergency reveals most clearly the essence of the authority of the state … The exception is thus far more important that the ordinary rule. The normal state of affairs shows nothing; the emergency shows everything; it confirms not only the rule, rather the rule derives strictly from the emergency.”The ACLU filed alawsuiton 15 March before Chief Judge James Boasberg of the US district court of the District of Columbia to halt the flight to El Salvador. The judge issued an order for the planes to return to the US, but the Trump administration defied it.Trump’s defiance has set in motion a flurry of legal challenges and court cases heard in district courts and circuit courts of appeals, as well as the supreme court. On 7 April, the courtruledthat the detainees had theright to due process, which they were denied. On 11 April, the justices unanimously ordered the administration tofacilitate the returnof one wrongly taken individual,Kilmar Ábrego García, a legal resident of Maryland who was identified by his family and had no criminal record. On 19 April, the courttemporarily blockeda new round of deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.CBS’s 60 Minutes reported: “We could not find criminal records for 75% of the Venezuelans.” Bloomberg Newsreportedthat about 90% had no criminal records.On 14 April, Trump welcomed Bukele to the White House. Trump has turned the Oval Office into his small stage with cabinet secretaries and staff seated on the couches as his chorus. Bukele was dressed in black casual wear, but not admonished, as Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy was admonished, for supposedly showing disrespect to Trump by not appearing in a suit and tie.Trump and Bukele played the sceneas a buddy movie, kidding each other, but not kidding, about repression. “Mr President,” said Bukele, “you have 350 million people to liberate. But to liberate 350 million people, you have to imprison some. That’s the way it works, right?”Trump’s already skirting due process. Now he’s musing about deporting citizens | Moira DoneganRead more“The homegrowns are next, the homegrowns,” said Trump. “You’ve got to build about five more places.”“Yeah, we got the space,” Bukele said.When the question of Ábrego García was raised by a reporter, Bondi said: “That’s not up to us,” and that it was “up to El Salvador”.“Well, I’m supposed – you’re not suggesting that I smuggle a terrorist in the United States, right?” Bukele replied. Trump reassured him: “It’s only CNN.” Bukele called the question “preposterous”.“Well, they’d love to have a criminal released into our country,” said Trump. “These are sick people. Marco, do you have something to say about that?” It was another test of the secretary of state’s sycophancy. Marco Rubio rose to the occasion. “No court in the United States has a right to conduct a foreign policy of the United States,” he said. “It’s that simple. End of story.”Standing behind Rubio, Trump’s most influential aide and the architect of his immigration policy, Stephen Miller, chimed in: “To Marco’s point, the supreme court said exactly what Marco said. That no court has the authority to compel the foreign policy function in the United States. We won a case 9-0. And people like CNN are portraying it as a loss, as usual, because they want foreign terrorists in the country who kidnap women and children.”A reporter attempted to point out that the court had in fact ruled it was illegal to deprive the captives of due process. “Well, it’s illegal to, so I just wanted some clarity on it,” he asked. Trump jumped in: “And that’s why nobody watches you anymore. You have no credibility.”On 17 April, the day the supreme court ruled on Ábrego García, Trumpsaid: “I’m not involved in it,” though he had signed the executive order that authorized his kidnapping. Trump was reverting to the tactic of denial, however patently ludicrous, that he had been schooled in originally by Roy Cohn, the Republican power broker and mafia lawyer who had been his private attorney. The Trump administration continues to claim it has no control over the captives in the Salvadorian prison and they cannot be returned.Trump’s disavowal of responsibility made thevisit to the prisonby the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to tape a video on 26 March problematic on several levels. If Trump has no control, then how was Noem allowed the run of the place? If the prisoners were combatants under the Alien Enemies Act, then their status made her appearance a violation of the Geneva convention’s Article 1 that outlaws “outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment”, and Article 13 that prohibits “acts of violence or intimidation” and “insults and public curiosity” – that is, using prisoners for propaganda purposes.If Schmitt’s argument is not Trump’s argument, the difference has certainly not confused the judges handling the cases. Boasberg ruled that the Trump administration hadacted with “willful disregard”for his order and, while contempt proceedings were paused, threatened toappoint a special prosecutorif the Department of Justice declined to do so.The Maryland federal judge Paula Xinis, who ordered the administration to return Ábrego García, said on 15 April she hadseen no evidence of progress. Sheruled on 22 Aprilthat such stonewalling “reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations … That ends now.”She also stated: “Defendants must supplement their answer to include all individuals involved as requested in this interrogatory.” That discovery process might range into stranger precincts of Maga depths than imagined. The New Yorkerreportedon “a Maga salon” at a tech billionaire’s Washington residence to which a Republican lobbyist, Andrew Beck, brought Trace Meyer, self-described as the “Babe Ruth of bitcoin”, where they discussed with state department staffers the “work-in-progress plan” for abducting migrants to El Salvador. The officials had reached “an impasse in the negotiations. Meyer, through his crypto connections, was able to help reopen the conversation.” Add to the discovery list: Beck, Meyer and the state department officials.In denying the Trump administration’s motion for a halt in the Xinis ruling, Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III, of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit, issued athunderous opinionon 17 April, marking a historic break between principled conservatism and Trump’s regime. Wilkinson is an eminent conservative figure within the judiciary, of an old Virginia family, a clerk to Justice Lewis Powell, and a Ronald Reagan appointee revered in the Federalist Society.The Guardian view on the US immigration crackdown: what began with foreign nationals won’t end there | EditorialRead more“The government,” Wilkinson wrote, “is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”Wilkinson concluded with a siren call about Trump’s threat. “If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home? And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present, and the Executive’s obligation to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed’ would lose its meaning.”Wilkinson has defined the stark conflict headed toward an unstoppable collision. Against Trump’s appropriation of Schmitt’s authoritarian logic, the conservative jurist has thrown down the gauntlet of American constitutional law. Trump’s disdain for that sort of conservatism moves the cases again and again toward the conservative majority of the supreme court, which must decide its allegiance, either like Wilkinson, to the constitution, or instead to Trump’s untrammeled power that would reduce the court itself to a cipher.This article was amended on 27 April 2025; an earlier version stated that JD Vance admonished Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit to meetDonald Trump.

But the findings of anInstitute for Government reportabout general practice in England have more complex implications too. One striking finding is thatwaits for appointmentsseem to matter less than is often assumed. Successive governments have pushed for same-day consultations. If this was done to please the public, the research suggests they should not have bothered. Surprisingly, it found no statistically significant relationship between patient satisfaction and length of wait. For many people, there is no substitute for a face-to-face conversation with the family doctor who they may have known for years. A higher number of online and telephone consultations is correlated with lower satisfaction. The shift away from in-person consultations, which accelerated during the pandemic and has not reversed, has coincided withfalling confidence in general practice– though the reduction on spending on primary care, relative to hospitals, must also be factored in.Appointments with other staffdo not boost patient satisfaction to anything like the same degree. Once again, this finding raises a question over recent policy, which has been to substantially increase the “direct patient care” workforce, including pharmacists, in England’s 6,200 GP surgeries. The most popular appointments of all are those in smaller practices with higher numbers of GP partners. People’s preferences are not, in themselves, a mandate for change. This study found that practices with higher satisfaction scores also meet more targets. But measuring outcomes in primary care is complicated and previous research has raised doubts about some of the care offered by the smallest practices.That said, the report highlights the importance of personal contact in healthcare, as in other public services. Under thenew public managementethos that emerged in the 1980s, strenuous efforts are made to make health, education and social security systems work like businesses. Increasing efficiency and productivity are the goal. Human interactions are tightly managed with the aim of suppressing demand. Objectors to this approach have long argued that the emphasis on outputs is overly narrow, creates perverse incentives, anddevalues much that is important. As Ambulance, the BBC’s Bafta-winning documentary series, shows week after week, what many people need more than anything else in their interaction with public services is a feeling of connection. As the paramedic Nimah Shyr-Nai said inlast week’s episode, “everyone’s got a story in the end”.A recognition that care quality is to do with relationships lay behind Labour’s promise to “bring back the family doctor”. But this is easier said than done. Given ongoingdifficulties in recruiting enough GPs, ministers need to ensure that other primary care staff are equipped to meet people’s needs – while also training more doctors. Policymakers must reject efficiency as the sole measure of success and rebuild public services around human connection. It should not be seen as utopian, or nostalgic, to advocate for public services that value relationships. These do not all need to be in person. Automation can streamline services and help different people, and age-groups, meet their needs in various ways. But John Donne’s famous assertion that“no man is an island”still holds. We are all connected, each “a part of the main”. That matters in public services, too.Explore more on these topicsGPsOpinionHealthDoctorsNHSEnglandPublic services policyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Quietly signed by President Barack Obama, it now reads as a premature act of enclosure: staking titles in a realm we scarcely understand. Though some expressed concerns at the time, it was justified by the idea of inevitable progress. Such naivety evaporated with Donald Trump. Space had been humanity’s last commons, shielded by a 1967 Outer Space treaty. Mr Trump declared it dead in 2020, signing the Artemis Accords and enlisting 43 allies, including the UK, in the legalisation of heaven’s spoils. In March, Mr Trump vowed to plant thestars and stripes on Mars– and beyond. The age of celestial commons was brief, if it ever began.A new report by the Common Wealth thinktank, titledStar Wars, warns that a powerful coalition – composed of private corporations, billionaires such asElon Musk and Jeff Bezos, and “neoliberal” thinktanks – is working to extend earthly ownership structures to space. The report’s author, Durham University’s Carla Ibled, calls it “the transfer of shared resources into the hands of a few”. The 1967 treaty bans state exploitation of space, but is vague on private claims – a loophole now fuelling a tycoon-led scramble for the stars. The aim is obvious: to act first, shape norms and dare others to object.Companies are targetingasteroidmines for “platinum group” metals,lunar icefor fuel andhelium 3for nuclear fusion. These are, admittedly, more likely to be business cases more than functioning businesses. Space law, however, is being fashioned to allow appropriation under the guise of peaceful, commercial activity. Some bizarrely argue that off‑planet mining is social justice – shifting pollution from Earth to “lifeless” space to spare local communities environmental harm. Common Wealth rightly sees this as a modern-dayenclosuremovement. Space isn’t a prize for private conquest. It’s a shared realm needing democratic, ethical stewardship – not corporate extraction in legal disguise.Building a worldwide democratic, collective model is not easy. There is no global body that has clear authority over space resource governance. There is an embryonic one in theUN Office for Outer Space Affairs. Previous attempts to create new frameworks – like the 1979 Moon Agreement – have failed to gain traction among major space powers. There are also longstanding concerns that privatisation is a cover for themilitarisationof the cosmos. Notably, the UK has yet to adopt a space resource licensing system – unlike its fellow Artemis Accords founders the US, Luxembourg, United Arab Emirates and Japan. Reviving cold war lines in the stars, Russia and China defend space as common property against western-style celestial land grabs.There is no viable commercial model for the extraction of space resources and their return to Earth for sale. Nasa’s Moon rock returns helpedCongressjustify space property rights. Dr Ibled warns that humanity’s last commons is slipping into private hands. Some have proposed anAntarctic-style, consent-basedmodelfor space – which would treat it not as endless bounty but as a realm worthy of restraint and respect, where survival uses like water extraction would be permitted. Creating equitable global governance is hard. But that’s no excuse not to try. The stakes, after all, are planetary.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How to reduce violence in our jails? The response always seems to be some new piece of kit – be it Pava spray, which it appears has been authorised foruse on children, and now stun guns.This doesn’t deal with the root causes of a service in perpetual crisis after a decade or more of austerity and a failed 30-year political race of longer sentences and locking more people up as the answer to reducing crime. If we hold people in squalid conditions, it’s hardly surprising more violence erupts. Prisoner assaults are at anall-time high, but so are deaths in prison custody, self-harm and overcrowding.Use of force by prison officers, as with police officers, is always applied in greater numbers toblack, MuslimandGypsy, Roma and Travellerinmates. Racism is an indelible part of prison life. If we want to reduce violence in jails, the recentreport on HMP Guys Marshgives us a big clue. It identifies the deterioration in relationships between officers and prisoners. Politicians, senior Prison Service leaders and theprison officers’ unionshould reflect and take heed.Mark BlakeLondonAlex South believes, albeit reluctantly, that the time may be right for prison staff to be armed. After over 40 years in the Prison Service, and 12 years’ involvement in prisons in the UK’s overseas territories, I couldn’t disagree more. Unlike in the US and other jurisdictions, the operation of UK prisons has been predicated on building sound working relationships between staff and prisoners. That would not be possible if the dynamics changed with staff carrying stun guns.The problem is that reductions in staffing levels and the loss of experienced staff have made the maintenance of control and the establishment of reasonable officer-prisoner relationships impossible.Rather than creating additional barriers between staff and prisoners, the solution is to provide sufficient trained officers to establish control, build relationships and provide opportunities to change the lives of those in our prisons.Keith MunnsBramhall, Greater ManchesterClaiming stun guns will make prisons safer is perverse. A debate about violence and safety must include state violence against inmates and the shockingdeath rate in prisons, up to 399 deaths in the year to March 2025, an increase of 37%. In 2019, a European Committee for the Prevention of Torture delegation said it “encountered examples of the unprovoked and unjustified infliction of violence on prisoners by staff”.A report by the charity Maslahanoted that Muslim prisonersare more likely “to be confronted with batons, made to wear rigid bar handcuffs, or deliberately held in a painful position”.An effective response would be to commit to a dramatic reduction in the prison population. Also, the culture of immunity and impunity needs to be replaced with a system that is democratically accountable, and human rights prioritised over technology. This would improve safety for all – a better use of money than further weaponisation or building more prisons.Deborah ColesExecutive director, Inquest,Joe SimEmeritus professor of criminology, Liverpool John Moores University,Steve TombsEmeritus professor of criminology, the Open UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Unfortunately, no mention is given of the proposals by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, in her children’s wellbeing and schools bill to curb academy freedoms. These include requirements to follow national pay scales for all teachers and for employing only those with qualified teacher status; an obligation to follow the national curriculum once the government’s curriculum review has been completed; an end to the forced academisation of maintained schools; and greater powers for councils over academy admissions.Is this another example of the government getting little credit for some of its more positive stories?Bob HudsonDurhamWhenLabourset up academies in the early 2000s, the aim was for better performing schools to join with those needing to improve. On a not-for-profit basis the schools would share resources to save money, with pupils from poorer schools benefiting by having the same opportunities.The 2010 coalition government, in the form ofMichael Gove, turned the idea on its head by making the system into a business opportunity where those schools within the academy trusts have to buy in most resources from their lead school run by leaders on enormous salaries.Now that many schools have been forced to become part of a multi-academy trust, the situation is frankly appalling. The government should bring back Lord Adonis (whose brainchild the academies programme was under Labour) to return the system to its original principles.Wendy MussonWraxall, SomersetExplore more on these topicsAcademiesSchoolsTeachingBridget PhillipsonLabourMichael GovePolitics pastlettersShareReuse this content"

He is the 10th Liverpool manager to win the league but the first to become champion in his debut season with the club.Slot paid tribute to his predecessor for bequeathing a title-winning squad and hardworking culture and to Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group, for what he claimed was the bold decision to appoint him last summer.“I’m very, very happy of course but to a certain extent it also feels unreal,” he said. “You’ve worked so hard for this moment to happen and, when it does happen, you need time to truly feel it. The fans were so happy that it didn’t take me long to understand what we’ve achieved together this season.“It is so special. It was a proud moment when I knew I would become the new head coach here, to be part of such a great football club, and to now be part of the history of this football club is something I could have only dreamed of three or four years ago.‘The first time I came here was when Pep Lijnders [Liverpool’s former assistant manager] invited me and that was against Tottenham. We all know what happened around Tottenham one or two years ago [the VAR decision] so now to win it against them is quite special.”Victory brings Liverpool level with fallen rivals Manchester United on 20 league championships. It is their second Premier League title in five years but unlike 2020, when Klopp’s team ended the club’s 30-year wait for a 19th league crown behind closed doors, their latest triumph was celebrated in front of jubilant supporters.View image in fullscreenCody Gakpo sprays Alexis Mac Allister with champagne after winning the title.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPALiverpool were unable to hold a trophy parade five years ago because of the pandemic but one will be staged in the city on Monday 26 May. Klopp may be in attendance, having assembled the supremely talented squad that Slot inherited. The Liverpool head coach sang Klopp’s name on the pitch after the final whistle, reciprocating the welcome his predecessor gave him at Klopp’s final game in charge last season.“The only moment I was emotional today was when we arrived at the stadium to see what it meant for the fans, for these people,” Slot said. “For us to have a chance to win it was really special but we still had to do it. Everyone inside that bus felt, if the fans are with us like that, it was impossible to lose this game of football.”Slot’s side have topped the table since 2 November. After a home defeat by Nottingham Forest in the fourth game of the season, Liverpool embarked on a 26-match unbeaten league run that lasted almost seven months. The former Feyenoord coach, who said he would celebrate with a “beer or two or three”, praised FSG and Liverpool’s sporting director, Richard Hughes, for appointing him last summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For them to trust me in this position, maybe now everyone says it makes complete sense, but the moment they signed me maybe not everyone was as convinced as they are now. That tells you what a special club this is because that they don’t always go for the most simple or obvious choice. They make the choice that is best for the club. It must be a special time for them, second time in five years that they win the league and to do it in front of our fans is special, including for them.”Slot follows José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte as the fifth manager to win the title in his first season in the Premier League. The Dutch coach is also the fourth Liverpool manager to win the championship at the first attempt, following Matt McQueen in 1922-23, Joe Fagan in 1983-84 and Kenny Dalglish in 1985-86, although his predecessors were all established figures at Anfield before stepping into the role. Slot is the only one to win the league in his first season at the club.His wife and two children were present at Anfield to see him make history. “It is special to have them with me because my family, and all of the families of the players, have to make sacrifices if you do this job not only this season but your whole career,” he said. “My family was still in Holland this year so, in moments, it was hard for me but also for them.

They beat the last season’s runners-up 4-1 thanks to an own goal from Christiane Endler and strikes from Mariona Caldentey, Alessia Russo and Caitlin Foord.The final in May will be the first of Slegers’s fledgling management career. The 36-year-old was delighted with her team’s success as they reached a European final at her first attempt.“I’m so proud of the whole team,” she said. “I am so happy for everyone that we have achieved this. It’s a team performance and I don’t take myself out of the team … There is so much work that has been done before both to qualify this season and also all the work the club has done through many years to get us into this position. It is so good as an organisation to be able to compete in this final.”Lyon 1-4 Arsenal (3-5 on agg): Women’s Champions League semi-final – live reactionRead moreOn a balmy day in the south-east of France, there was a discernible buzz surrounding the stadium. The local bars were awash with fans, enjoying the afternoon sun in nervous anticipation for the match ahead. Among them the several hundred travelling Arsenal fans, decked out in their customary red and white, seemed in a jubilant if wary mood as they contemplated their side’s chances. The 2-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium inthe first leghad been frustrating but these fans have witnessed this side come back from the brink on more than one occasion and there was optimism that they could do it once more.There had been clear belief emanating from the Arsenal camp since the final whistle on 19 April. They had been disappointed with the result but clearly felt that they had produced a performance to merit coming away with more. The Arsenal manager had spoken about her faith in her team’s ability to continue to exploit Lyon but stressed their need to “remain humble” throughout.Slegers made two alterations to the side that started in the first leg. The big surprise was the return of Daphne van Domselaar in goal. The Dutch international had picked up an ankle injury during the last international break which was meant to keep her out for about five weeks, but she appeared to have made a remarkable recovery. Chloe Kelly, meanwhile, came into attack in place of Beth Mead.Joe Montemurro also made two changes as he opted to bring in a wealth of experience. The imperious Wendie Renard had recovered to full fitness to take a place at the heart of the Lyon defence, making her 500th appearance for the club. Ada Hegerberg, the all-time record goalscorer in the Women’s Champions League, also returned to lead the line, with the exciting Melchie Dumornay dropping into midfield.View image in fullscreenVanessa Gilles’ reaction to Arsenal’s fourth goal.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersArsenal had been criticised for their slow start in the first leg but there were no such issues on Sunday. The Gunners seem to enjoy playing on this expansive pitch – on their last visit to Lyon in 2022 they came away with a 5-1 win – and they were immediately exploiting the spaces afforded to them. They did not have to wait long for the breakthrough, striking within five minutes to level the tie on aggregate. The Chilean goalkeeper Endler made a superb stop in the buildup, turning Kim Little’s effort instinctively past the post. The hosts, however, were all at sea when defending the subsequent corner. The ball bounced off Frida Maanum and then the unfortunate home goalkeeper before rolling into the net.It was inevitable that there would be some nervy moments for Arsenal’s defence to deal with but they held their own and restricted Lyon to one shot on target in the first half. Foord, meanwhile, stung Endler’s gloves once more before Russo misdirected a header from an unmarked position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scary thought for the rest of the Premier League must be that Guardiola, who looked and sounded like a man ready to pack it in and head for the golf course earlier this season, is finding fresh motivation in puttingManchester Cityback together. Enjoy it while it lasts, you can imagine him saying to his rivals, but just be aware that I have revenge planned for anyone who dared to wonder if I was finished when we were losing 4-0 at home against Tottenham.It is, of course, worth pointing out that it is too soon to assume that a new imperial era is taking shape. City are deservedly through to their third consecutive FA Cup final, a date with Crystal Palace secured thanks to a well-crafted2-0 win against Nottingham Forest, but Guardiola still has damage to repair. Ever the perfectionist, he will look back at his team’s performance against Forest and conclude that there were moments when this semi-final could have slipped from their grasp. Anthony Elanga had a glorious chance to make it 1-1 early in the second half, only to miss from close range, while City will know that they were fortunate not to concede after going 2-0 up.‘It has not been good’: Guardiola says FA Cup win will not save City’s seasonRead moreYet defeat was deflating rather than heartbreaking for Forest, who cannot let it affect their push for Champions League qualification. There was more knowhow to City, accompanied by a sense of a team embracing the process of renewal. It was striking that Kevin De Bruyne, who will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season, was an unused substitute.Although City’s starting lineup was not short of leadership and experience – Rúben Dias, Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva have seen and done it all – it was one capable of coping with Forest’s energy.There has been an injection of youth, replenishing enthusiasm levels. Nico O’Reilly and Rico Lewis, 20-year-old homegrown talents, showed again that they are versatile, technical and comfortable at this level. Savinho, raw but dangerous on the right wing, is 21 and learning as he goes. Josko Gvardiol, whose big dark beard makes him look older than 23, is thriving after shifting into central defence; he delighted in powering in the second goal from an Omar Marmoush corner in the 51st minute.Guardiola has spoken about his possession football becoming outdated this season. He is reacting, adapting and reshaping his squad. City spent heavily on youth in January. If the 26‑year‑old Marmoush is a signing for the here and now, then Vitor Reis, Abdukodir Khusanov and Nico González look like bets on potential. Space will be made by old timers leaving. De Bruyne is on his way and Ilkay Gündogan could go too. There is talk of additions in attacking midfield. Phil Foden, who did not come on until the 81st minute here, has struggled this season but is only 24.There are hints of a resurgence. Sir Alex Ferguson went through dips at Manchester United but always responded. Guardiola has seemed weary since leading City to the treble and four consecutive league titles. Losing Rodri to injury was a devastating blow. City have been slow and fragile. The talk has been of Guardiola’s approach being replaced by a more vertical, dynamic style of play.Having seen off Andoni Iraola’s front-foot Bournemouth in the quarter-finals, Guardiola approached the challenge of breaking down Forest’s resolute defence with typical imagination and counterintuitiveness. How to cope without Erling Haaland leading the line? Simple: confound the Forest centre-backs by sending out a team with no fixed point in attack and a host of diminutive technicians spreading confusion with decoy runs and dizzying movement.It was a classic Guardiola ploy. The conventional approach would have been a 4-2-3-1 system with Jack Grealish sticking to the left, Bernardo Silva as a No 10 and Marmoush playing up front. Not here, though. City used a box midfield. Silva and Kovacic were deep, Lewis and Grealish operated in advanced central positions, Marmoush and Savinho drifted wide and Forest were confused.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was also the way that first Marmoush and then Savinho distracted Murillo with darts into the defender’s zone, ensuring that Lewis was in space when he received the ball in between the lines.Forest, who did not have a shot before half-time, never got to grips with City’s system. City pressed aggressively during the first half, repeatedly forcing turnovers. Silva and Kovacic were excellent. Lewis, a right-left, left‑back, No 6 and No 8 rolled into one, was exceptional. There was a moment when O’Reilly won the ball, pirouetted and shot wide from 25 yards.City’s belief has returned. Guardiola, though, is far from satisfied. Would winning this competition make this season a success? There was something ominous about the way he heard the question, laughed and made it very clear that he expects far more than glory in the Cup.Explore more on these topicsFA CupNottingham ForestManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

I’d be absolutely gobsmacked if it wasn’t a record crowd.”Those running includedSergio Aguiar and David Stancombe, who were raising money for projects set up in their daughters’ memory after they were murdered in the Southport attack. Both finished in just over four hours; however, Aguair collapsed to the ground shortly after crossing the line.In a video message, played to the families before the race, Keir Starmer paid tribute to the two men, who lost their daughters Alice Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, while they attended a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in July.View image in fullscreenBritish Olympic triathlon gold medallist Alex Yee came 14th in his debut marathon.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“This is an incredible way to honour the memory of your precious daughters and the entire nation is in awe of your courage and your resilience,” the UK prime minister said.The finishers also includedLindsay Burrow, the wife of rugby league great Rob Burrow, who died in June 2024 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2019. Burrow, who said that running had given her a “focus and purpose”, finished the race in just under five hours.Thewomen’s race was won by the Ethiopian Tigist Assefa, who set a new women’s-only world record of 2:15.50. However, that record, which applies to races without a male pacemaker, was six minutes behind the official women’s record, set last year.View image in fullscreenEilish McColgan crosses the line to finish eighth in the London Marathon women’s race on Sunday 27 April.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEilish McColgan was the leading British woman home, coming eighth in her first marathon in a time of 2:24.25 – although it was several minutes slower than she had hoped after the warmer than expected weather.“I was just determined to put one foot in front of the other,” she said. “I think if you look at a lot of British athletes, everyone was a little bit off where they wanted. Maybe it did have a bit more of an impact than we thought.”View image in fullscreenHugh Brasher.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersMeanwhile in the men’s race,won by the Kenyan Sabastian Sawe, there was a creditable performance by Britain’s Olympic triathlon gold medallist Alex Yee.Yee, who was running in his first marathon, finished in 2:11.8, and afterwards paid tribute to the crowds. “That was seriously tough but probably one of the best moments of my life,” he said. “I expected the crowds to be good but that was a whole other level.“I am just immensely proud to have run the London Marathon,” he added. “Obviously, in the second half I faded quite a lot. But I am so proud to be part of such an amazing day.”The Guinness World Records team were also kept busy, with 42 unusual records being set – including by Chris “Rhino Boy” Green, who broke one for the most marathons run in a 3D costume.‘The costume develops its own microclimate’: what it’s like to run a marathon in a novelty outfitRead more“You could not find a happier rhino right now,” said Green after completing his 113rd marathon as a rhino and raising money for the Save the Rhino charity.As the day came to an end, Brasher said that the celebration and joy he had seen once again painted London in its best light.“Three-quarters of the people out there are running for a charity – and everyone has a reason to run,” he said. “People have asked: ‘Why are you trying to break the world record for finishers?’ But it’s not about that.“What we’re trying to do is give as many people as we can the opportunity to experience something that is life affirming, that is community building, that is good for their physical and mental health, and truly will give them an experience like no other.”And, once again, the London Marathon duly delivered.Explore more on these topicsLondon MarathonRunningAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

You know it’s a good goal because the moment it hits the net, Barcelona’s substitutes scramble forward to the front of the dugout, desperate to watch it again on the replay screen. Meanwhile, a few yards away Sonia Bompastor turns to the Chelsea bench and smiles weakly. A yeah-fair-play smile. A what-can-you-do smile.Pina’s goal makes it 7-1 to Barcelona on aggregate, there are still more than 45 minutes to play, and we have reached the point in thisChampions League semi-finalwhen it almost begins to feel rude that Uefa insisted Barcelona fly over to play this second leg. Imagine the aircraft emissions and single-use plastic glasses that could have been saved simply by abandoning the pretenice that this was a meaningful contest.Chelsea humbled by Barcelona and Bonmatí in bruising WCL semi-final exitRead moreBut then there are certain pleasures in life that require no justification, and to watch Barcelona in full flow on a gorgeous spring Sunday certainly qualifies. And of course there has always been some maestro quality to this team that allows them to grow in proportion to the occasion, that allows them to flourish at their moment of greatest danger. Give them a stage, give them an elite opponent with a hungry press and something worth winning, and the results are likely to be worth watching.For Chelsea the one positive thing about a defeat this comprehensive is that there is no need to fixate on the fine margins. No need to complain about the referee or the marginal selection calls or hang individuals out to dry. There were 56,000 runners pounding the streets of London on Sunday and somehow none of them looked as bedraggled at the finish as Chelsea’s players did here. At one point Lucy Bronze had a shot from distance, and Cata Coll simply controlled it with her feet.The irony is that imperial-phase Barcelona have rarely looked as vulnerable as they have done at times this season. Statistically speaking it’s been their worst campaign since 2018-19, with two defeats in the league and one to Manchester City in the Champions League. Real Madrid can still catch them in the Liga F title race, even if they probably won’t. That’s the problem with establishing a reputation for invincibility: mere dominance feels like a let-down by comparison.But then there are matches like this, ties like this, when the focus is locked in and the pieces are aligned and Barcelona seem to be playing football in different colours, new colours, colours you can’t even name yet. There is a kind of collective intelligence here that no other women’s team on the planet can currently replicate, the point where pure instinct meets pure identity, individuals empowered to do the exact thing the team requires of them.Take Pina’s goal, a sweeping length-of-the-field move begun by Pina herself, trapped by four Chelsea players near the corner of her own penalty area. For 99% of the players in world football, the onset of blue shirts is a moment of pure sporting urgency, a time for getting rid. Go long. Swivel and beat a path back to the goalkeeper. Hack it out for a throw. All of these count as decent outcomes.View image in fullscreenCatarina Macario reacts after a missed chance against Barcelona as Chelsea suffer more Champions League misery.Photograph: Dave Shopland/APBut of course Barcelona tends to select its roster from the other 1%. And so Pina invites the pressure, waits for the overcommitment, threads a pass to Aitana Bonmatí with the outside of her foot, and all of a sudden Barcelona have a two-on-two break. There is a kind of poetry to the fact that Pina, having hurtled forward in support, is the one who ends up curling in the unstoppable finish from distance. It’s a pure Barcelona goal, the kind that pretty much no other team in Europe is capable of scoring.Bonmatí’s goal, by contrast, is an entirely different beast. She gets the ball deep in her own half and simply starts running. As she gathers momentum, Chelsea first back off, and then engage too slowly. Niamh Charles puts in a sliding challenge so late it seems to come from an entirely different timeline: a tackle that also serves as its own slow-motion replay.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bonmatí runs games, she drops deep to receive, her engine is inexhaustible, she gets Barcelona out of tight spots, she gives spice and verve to their attack. But it’s also richly fitting that occasionally she will just run 70 yards out of her own half and smash in a hall-of-fame goal at the near post from a tightening angle. Because the great players don’t simply gild the game. They simplify it.Naturally there will be talk, because there is always talk, of gaps and gulfs, how they might close and how they might widen. Of where the challenge might come from, of how this dynasty might falter or weaken or somehow be toppled. From a Chelsea perspective there will be angst and soul-searching and very possibly another glut of record spending in the summer.Football will always be obsessed with the next thing. But empires always crumble in the end; it’s what they do. Perhaps in the next few years Real or Chelsea or Paris Saint-Germain will finally get their act together; perhaps the hunger will wane a little; perhaps injuries and fatigue will bite. The future always comes. In the meantime, this is a team that deserves to be savoured and relished while it still exists.Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

The British fighter, who holds the IBF belt, has been angling for a rematch against the WBA, WBO and WBC champion, who stopped him in the ninth round of theirprevious meeting in August 2023.Now the pair have agreed to a sequel at the national stadium and will meet face-to-face at a press conference on Tuesday. Dubois’ camp, led by promoter Frank Warren, were unhappy about the circumstances of the 27-year-old’s previous defeat in Poland. Referee Luis Pabon ruled that a fifth-round knockdown of Usyk was a low blow, allowing him a lengthy recovery period, and his call was strongly contested in the aftermath.Chris Eubank Jr beats Conor Benn by unanimous decision after frenetic brawlRead moreSince then Dubois has bounced back by defeating Jarrell Miller, claiming the vacant IBF belt with a win over Filip Hrgovic, andknocking out Anthony Joshuaat Wembley. Usyk has not boxed since beating Tyson Fury in Saudi Arabia in December.“This is the fight I wanted and demanded and now I get my chance for revenge againstOleksandr Usyk,” said Dubois. “I should have won the first fight and was denied by the judgment of the referee, so I will make no mistake this time around in front of my people at the national stadium in my home city.“I am a superior and more dangerous fighter now and Usyk will find this out for himself on July 19. I would like to thank my promoter Frank for making this happen for me and I intend to repay him by becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.”Usyk, who won his previous unification bout against Fury last May on a split decisionand beat him againseven months later, is eager to put his full collection together again. “I’m grateful to God for the opportunity to once again fight for the undisputed championship,” he said. “Thank you, Daniel, for taking care of my IBF belt – now I want it back.”The prospect of getting the two men back in the ring together rose last month amid reports that a request has been lodged with the WBO to sanction the Dubois-Usyk clash ahead of a scheduled mandatory defence against Joseph Parker.Dubois had been looking at a possible all-British affair against Derek Chisora had his hopes of a second crack at the Ukrainian fallen through.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise, things have gone truly pear-shaped. A Sunday where their fans lived vicariously through hopes of Tottenham delaying Liverpool’s title celebrations and Nottingham Forest stopping City winning another FA Cup counts as a ground-zero level ebb, even considering United’s decline and fall. Rescuing a point from 10-man Bournemouth might have arrested some of the helpless, listless doom but probably not for too long.Perhaps United’s team spirit, that which carried them past Lyon in the Europa League, is evidencing itself, though far more than that is required. As with Lyon, it took an opposing red card - Evanilson, a tad unluckily - to add momentum to a muddle.Bournemouth 1-1 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happenedRead moreReports of Ruben Amorim playing the kids ahead of Athletic Club were proven exaggerated, his selection as strong as can be expected from the Frankenstein-like horror of United’s bolted-together squad. With Ernesto Valverde’s Athletic in mind, Amorim was running a case study against a team of a similar style, coached by a Basque bred by the same club. It didn’t go too well. Even if this group somehow lifts a European trophy, it will surely be broken up for scrap. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, sometime renewables enthusiast, was watching on.If the past was United’s, how long until the future is theirs? “We are in the different levels at this moment,” said Amorim, referencing Liverpool’s imminent triumph. “Everything can change, so we need to focus and step by step, not trying to to to think too far ahead. We have a ultimate goal that is winning thePremier League. And again, I’m not crazy, I know that it is not going to be next year, but we are trying to build something and the small things are really important.”Luke Shaw,signed for Louis van Gaal in 2014, was making a first United start since February 2024, his only other startthe Euro 2024 final. Shaw played part in the farce that resulted in Antoine Semenyo’s goal but hardly looked more rusty than his colleagues. He completed the full match. “When you are losing, you are not thinking about the next game,” said Amorim.André Onana’s goal-kick had played Shaw and Patrick Dorgu into trouble, an area of malfunction repeated to the point of insanity. If dodgy keeping and defending have been a problem, so too goalscoring. It took Hojlund’s second of 2025 to win a point.United’s away support was, as ever, loud though songs of Matt Busby, Wayne Rooney, Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo cast gloomy shade, even if Amorim was hailed lustily. His team began slowly and stayed that way. Onana’s ball-playing from the back soon attracted the mockery of home fans eventually disappointed their team failed to climb above Fulham and Brighton, sunk by the type of late goal sinking Andoni Iraola’s team’s quest for Europe.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo took advantage of United’s muddled defence to score early in the first half.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images“This win would have meant a lot to us,” said Iraola. “A point is a big difference. It is difficult to look in a positive way at the moment. We need a few hours.”CouldBournemouthhave been down to ten earlier? Alejandro Garnacho was on the receiving end of a tackle from Tyler Adams that required the video assistant referee to rule out a straight red. That incident only loosened United’s concentration, Onana, Shaw and Patrick Dorgu getting in that mess before Semenyo stole in to score. Bournemouth had early second-half chances to kill the contest through Semenyo and Evanilson before Dango Ouattara smashed a post with a free-kick from a near-impossible angle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their salvation arrived very late. Substitute Mason Mount had a shot deflected wide and Shaw volley the resulting corner off-target. Chido Obi, the teenager on as a sub, forced a save from Kepa, Fernandes agonised at a miss. Eventually Hojlund, from inches out, tapped in the result of a ricochet begun by Ugarte’s hopeful hack forwards. “He can be a little bit lighter during the week,” said Amorim of his No 9. “He now needs to score many more.”Cue celebrations in the away end, previously running through their greatest hits playlist, including a celebration of 20 league titles collected increasingly long ago.

And shortly afterwards he received a rare mid-frame standing ovation after sinking a black that took his next effort to 105 – it would eventually reach 132 as he cleared the table.It is the second time Trump has reached a century of centuries with Neil Robertson, who had a record 103 in the 2013-14 campaign, the only other player to achieve it.View image in fullscreenJudd Trump has a four-frame overnight lead against Shaun Murphy.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAMonday evening’s ticket holders can expect to be short-changed as former champion Luca Brecel will also come back requiring a single frame to complete a comprehensive win over Ding Junhui.The Belgian had looked certain to clinch the match with a session to spare after reeling off 11 frames in a row after former champion Ding had opened proceedings in their first session on Saturday with a break of 141.Ding finally stopped the rot in frame 13 and after Brecel moved further clear at 12-2, Ding then summoned successive centuries out of nothing, to pull back to 12-4 and require Brecel – who had flown in for Saturday’s first session by private jet – to hang around for a final session.Zhao Xintong reached the quarter-finals for the first time after completing a 13-10 win over his Chinese compatriot Lei Peifan.

The tribunal ruled that Mbonu, 53, was the victim of direct race discrimination, harassment related to race, and constructive unfair dismissal.Mbonu, who spent five years at the prison on the Isle of Sheppey, told the Guardian he joined because he wanted to make society a better place. “I was extremely passionate about rehabilitating offenders,” he said. “I believed in the dignity and potential of people, even in the most difficult and dehumanising environments.”But he said he was targeted by fellow officers. “I went through hell and high water. The working environment was extremely hostile and degrading. I was stressed, anxious, depressed, burnt-out and lost my self-esteem. I suffered sleep disturbances, weakened immune system. I was completely isolated and I couldn’t trust anyone.“I was treated with disdain. My voice was suppressed. My worth was invalidated. I felt I didn’t belong, just because I was black, didn’t have the British accent, had a different mannerism, didn’t understand British jokes, refused to join their shenanigans. I was often isolated, gaslighted and made to question my own perceptions.”View image in fullscreenHMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.Photograph: John Stillwell/PAThe tribunal said the insults violated his dignity and created an “intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment”.It flagged up that though Mbonu complained about an offensive comment made by a colleague, no evidence of it being responded to was produced during the tribunal.In its ruling, it said: “This we consider goes a considerable way to support the claimant’s [Mbonu’s] overarching allegations of being ignored and treated badly … There appears to be an unusual tolerance for such offensive and obviously racist remarks.”The tribunal said a different colleague made a separate comment about him being “money-grabbing” and on the same day wrote a false account of an incident involving Mbonu and a prisoner.A third officer also made a false claim about a meeting he said he had with Mbonu concerning a bonus scheme. The tribunal said it was “troubling” that this man went on to join the UK Border Force.The tribunal, which sat in south London, said it was not difficult to see how Mbonu felt there was a “witch-hunt” against him. It said: “We find it entirely understandable why Mr Mbonu would become increasingly distressed and paranoid.”Mbonu was overall a “credible and honest witness”, the tribunal said, adding: “We found him to be someone who was deeply affected by his time at Swaleside.”Mbonu said he was falsely accused over his work with two prisoners and resigned in 2023.He said: “I’m still going through the trauma inflicted on me. I haven’t recovered and I don’t think that I will. I still have sad flashbacks and nightmares. I feel a whirlwind of emotions like anger, grief, betrayal, self-doubt, exhaustion, loneliness, PTSD.”The Prison Service says all allegations of unacceptable behaviour are taken seriously, investigated and, where appropriate, disciplinary action is taken.It has atackling unacceptable behaviour unitthat it says aims to improve the working environment by providing additional support, insight and expertise to staff raising concerns.A Prison Service spokesperson said: “We will carefully consider this judgment. All reported incidents of discrimination are taken extremely seriously and investigated robustly.”A remedy hearing is due to take place for the tribunal to rule on compensation.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationRaceKentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Just 7% of Britons think the economy will improve, while 13% thought it would stay the same, equating to a net score of -68.IMF warns of ‘major negative shock’ from Trump’s tariffsRead moreEY’s forecast said it now expects UK gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 0.8% this year, down from a projection of 1% in February, and has cut its 2026 forecast from 1.6% to 0.9% as longer-term effects hit the UK.Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded itsgrowth forecast for the UK this year to 1.1%, from the 1.6% it had been forecasting as recently as January, while the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the UK faced a“growth shock”from Trump’s trade policies.About 16% of UK goods exports go to the US – where there is a “baseline” 10% import tariff for most countries and 25% for cars, steel and aluminium – which will directly affect growth by driving down demand for UK products.However, EY Item Club said that the bigger hit is likely to come from the indirect impact of the new policies weighing on British consumers already cautious about committing to spending on bigger ticket items. Businesses are also likely to limit the amount they invest over the next two years as a result.Research indicates British businesses are reacting to potential supply chain disruption from tariffs by targeting new export markets in Asia, Africa and Australia.Expanding or exporting overseas is a top priority for almost a third of mid-size UK businesses over the next year, a survey of 500 businesses by advisory and accountancy firm BDO found.Overall, almost 40% of firms polled expect to increase exports over the next year, rising to more than half of businesses in the retail, wholesale and tech sectors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Butler or any other candidate receives at least 25 branch nominations, they would run against Wrack in an open election among members.Lawyers acting for Butler and Lockyer began legal proceedings seeking an injunction last Wednesday, after the union’s announcement of Wrack as the new general secretary. At an emergency meeting on Friday, the executive was told that legal advice suggested the union was likely to lose in court.The reopening of nominations will come as a relief to grassroots members who had been angered by Wrack’s appointment, coming only weeks after Wrack had been defeated in his bid to be re-elected as the FBU’s general secretary, a post he had held for 20 years.Wrack’s close association with the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and his lack of a teaching or education background, had been controversial within the traditionally moderate union that restricts its membership to qualified educators. Wrack would be the first leader in the NASUWT’s history never to have been a teacher or lecturer.The NASUWT said in astatementthat the executive’s recent decisions about eligibility would be rescinded, and that branches will “be permitted to submit nominations on behalf of members or non-members”. If required, an election is scheduled to begin on 19 June.The executive’s statement said that “as a union it is important that there be stability and that the general secretary be appointed free from any suggestion that they have been elected otherwise than in accordance with due process”.Ministers raise concern over NASUWT move for ‘combative’ ex-FBU chiefRead moreIt added: “The national executive recognise that the local associations and individuals who have raised concerns about the process have done so in good faith and the union now have responded to those concerns by extending the period for nomination”.Butler had applied to be the executive’s candidate, and later received branch nominations after Wrack was named instead. But those nominations were rejected on the grounds that Butler, a non-member as a union employee, was ineligible despite being a former member and teacher.Butler’s lawyers were preparing to challenge the decision, arguing that the executive was rewriting the union’s rulebook at the same time as nominating a non-member, Wrack.They also argued that the executive ignored valid complaints from members and branches, as well as a recommendation of its own national officers’ committee to extend nominations.Explore more on these topicsTeachingTrade unionsSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

But that is the logical consequence of the court ruling and the EHRC guidance.”The commission’s update stated that if a trans individual used a facility that aligned with their chosen gender, “this will mean that they are no longer single-sex facilities and must be open to all users of the opposite sex”.The interim advice from the equalities watchdog, which comes ahead of updated guidance and a code of practice expected by the summer, also said that “where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use”.The supreme court ruling was described as “a massive relief” by the campaignerswho brought the legal challenge, For Women Scotland. Its co-founder Susan Smith told the Guardian it would help women feel safe if there was a male in a female-only space: “They will know that they are well within their rights to object to that.”Smith welcomed the interim advice from the EHRC. “It’s useful, given how much misinformation there has been about the judgment, to give people a starting point and an immediate prompt for government on how to act,” she said.But Christine Burns, one of the UK’s best known trans rights advocates, said a blanket ban on trans women using women’s facilities was “an incredibly dangerous statement, given that they give no indication how that should be enforced”.‘Rights can be knocked out in a second’: older trans people shocked by supreme court rulingRead moreBurns, who was instrumental in the campaign for gender recognition in the UK, said the commission was “making service providers the enforcers. Without training, it means their staff will be sent out to use their imagination as vigilante toilet police.”Burns added that “the idea that a trans woman using the facility would magically downrate it to ‘mixed sex’ was not tested or confirmed law”.“But the point is that if the idea gets out there among employers, service providers and their cautious corporate lawyers, then it will become the received wisdom. The eventual official guidance may be more tame but the damage will be done.”The Greens co-leader Carla Denyer said her party was calling for the EHRC interim update to be withdrawn because it seemed “rushed”.Also speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Denyer said: “Clearly, it’s been ill thought out, and it’s really obvious that they have not listened to trans people, possibly not consulted them at all in the preparation of this guidance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would cause even more worries.”Amnesty UK, which intervened in the supreme court case, intends to write to the commission expressing concern about the brevity of consultation period offered on the code of practice, which is only two weeks.The EHRC says there has already been a three-month consultation on the full code, but the significant redrafting demanded by the supreme court ruling merited a shorter consultation.Explore more on these topicsTransgenderGenderEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)Equality Act 2010Ed DaveyUK supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

The councilsuspended the guidancehours before it was due to take effect in response to the backlash.However, 20 organisations including the Centre for Women’s Justice, Amnesty International and the End Violence AgainstWomenCoalition have written to Mahmood claiming that consequences of ditching the guidelines could be dire, given that they contained detailed advice on sentencing pregnant women and parents of very young children.Without such guidance, they say, “sentencers may not fully and adequately consider the significant risks that custodial sentences pose to the health and wellbeing of both mother and child; risks that have resulted in the deaths of several babies in the prison estate”.Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, who signed the letter, said: “Under the current sentencing guidelines, hundreds of pregnant women every year are sent to prison. These women face increased risk of miscarriage, pregnancy complications, and in some of the worst cases, the stillbirth or death of their newborn baby.“These proposals would have changed the way pregnant women are treated by the justice system – recognising that there are very few instances where prison is a reasonable or acceptable sentence. Without them, we are deeply concerned for every pregnant woman who is incarcerated, endangering her health and her ability to access the healthcare she needs – whether that is choosing to continue her pregnancy or not.”The letter also references evidence of disproportionality in sentencing among minority ethnic groups as highlighted inDavid Lammy’s 2017 review into the justice system. It says the signatories are “deeply concerned by the potential chilling effect and detrimental consequences which the legislation could have on work to ensure that minority and vulnerable groups in the justice system are treated fairly and appropriately by the courts.“Given the sensitivity and scope of the proposed reform, it is only right that such measures be subject to proper debate or scrutiny, with adequate time to consider potential unintended consequences.”Announcing the bill, Mahmood said the guidelines created unacceptable differential treatment “where outcomes could be influenced by race, culture or religion”.But the chair of theSentencingCouncil, Lord Justice Davis, blamed “widespread misunderstanding” for the reaction, insisting that the guidelines relating to pre-sentence reports were just designed to ensure judges and magistrates were fully informed “no more and no less”.Stephanie Needleman, legal director at Justice, said the government should be expanding, rather than narrowing, the use of pre-sentence reports.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pre-sentence reports help judges understand more about those whose backgrounds are unfamiliar to them, or who have particular health concerns – yet this bill would deny judges adequate guidance on when such reports would be particularly useful.”Mark Day, deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, described the bill, which has its committee stage on Wednesday, as “reckless and clumsy”. He said: “Politicians are playing games with real people’s lives. They need to step up and take the heat out of this debate before they do lasting damage.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said:“The government supports the use of pre-sentence reports but the Sentencing Council’s guidance risks differential treatment before the law.“This bill will not affect existing case law or restrict courts from requesting pre-sentence reports when they are appropriate, including for pregnant women and people from an ethnic minority. The government is fully committed to tackling disparities in outcomes in the criminal justice system and has set up the Women’s Justice Board to reduce the number of women going to prison.”Explore more on these topicsSentencingShabana MahmoodWomennewsShareReuse this content"

The cost-cutting tactics resulted in a group of 62 of about 150 Vodafone franchise operators filing a£120m-plus legal claimlast December.The telecoms company, which is valued at about £17bn on the London Stock Exchange, has said: “We refute the [legal] claims but will be fully engaging in [a mediation] process with a view to resolving this commercial dispute.”However, the emergence of warnings to senior management reveals for the first time how some of the mobile operator’s own staff appeared to support the franchisees over their own employer.The drastic cuts to commission rates paid to franchisees, which were imposed as the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, were blamed for the small business owners running up huge personal debts andfearing for their livelihoods or homes, with some reporting suicidal thoughts.The company says it apologises “unreservedly to anyone whose experiences while operating their business has impacted [their health] in this way” and added that “where issues have been raised, we have sought to rectify these and we believe we have treated our franchisees fairly”.Della Valle, who has been Vodafone’s chief executive since December 2022 and was previously finance director from 2018, was notified of the franchisees’ plight around the time of her promotion, according to interviews and records seen by the Guardian. One email to Della Valle, which she appeared to respond to, cited an instance of an internal Vodafone whistleblower raising concerns about the company’s treatment of its franchisees.Sources allege that some of the senior executives briefed about the franchisees’ grievances during that period includedtwo members of Vodafone’s current UK board:Max Taylor, who was promoted to Vodafone’s UK chief executive last year and was previously its chief commercial officer from 2019; andJon Shaw, who was promoted to commercial operations director in 2022 and who has worked for the business for a decade.Vodafone said it disputed the term “whistleblower”, stating that the company has a transparent and open process. It said the company’s “Speak-Up process provides a safe forum for anyone to anonymously raise any issues or concerns they may have, which are picked up by a dedicated team … This process was used by one Vodafone employee in relation to the franchise programme and an immediate and thorough investigation was conducted.”The company added that it had made “improvements to the programme” and had made payments to current and former franchisees.“We reimbursed a total of £4.9m including VAT across our franchise estate,” a spokesperson said. “We made this payment with no obligation to do so and applied it consistently across our estate. This resulted in individuals who are bringing the claim against us, some of whom are no longer franchisees, receiving payments with no strings or legal consequences.”A franchise is a type of licence that allows a company to sell a product or service under another business’s brand name, in return for paying certain costs such as rent and wages. As part of their deals, Vodafone franchisees – who created their own small businesses to run the stores – were paid commissions based on the handset and airtime revenues they generated from customers visiting their shops.The changes to the commission rates left many franchisees with drastically reduced revenues, while their costs remained largely unchanged.One Vodafone employee, who said that the company’s UK bosses were aware of the issues affecting franchisees, said: “[The franchisees were] very badly treated throughout and I felt very compromised … Every day was a battle.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some franchisees claimed that regional managers told them it was only their individual stores that were in difficulty, in messaging that some complainants allege echoes one theme in the long-running Post Office scandal.A spokesperson for Vodafone, who argued the legal claim is actually worth £85.5m, said: “This is a commercial dispute between Vodafone UK and some of our franchise partners. We have fully engaged with all claims made by these partners since they were first raised, including through a formal process which, at appropriate times, involved independent legal review.“We are now fully engaged in mediation … with the claimant group. This is run by an independent mediator, who was selected and agreed upon by both sides. We are hopeful the mediation will reach a conclusion that suits both parties.”The company says that many franchisees disagree with the claim and out of its current “83 franchise partners, 68 have chosen not to join the claim and are continuing to run their businesses”.Explore more on these topicsVodafoneCorporate governanceSmall businessTelecommunications industryRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

I think people will see that lack of consistency, lack of political honesty, lack of coherence. He promises all things to all people.“I get why people might be attracted in the short term. I think it’s partly my job to say to people, well, don’t just listen to what he says, look at what he does. He’s directly voting against the interests of millions of working people.”Nowak’s criticism of Farage represents the most personal attack yet on the Reform UK boss from within the labour movement in the run-up to the elections. He described him as a “political fraud and a hypocrite” who “makes Liz Truss look like a politician with integrity”.“I don’t think he really wants a sensible relationship with trade unions any more than I think he really cares about the interests of British workers or industry or those working-class communities,” he said.View image in fullscreenTUC general secretary Paul Nowak in his office in London. He acknowledges ‘there’s a lot of disillusionment with mainstream politics’.Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian“This is Nigel Farage, public school-educated ex-metals trader cosplaying as a champion of the working class. There’s a massive contradiction between what he says and what he actually does in practice.”He added: “The fella who says he stands up for British industry is hanging on the coat tails of Donald Trump whose tariffs will put at risk thousands of good quality jobs in Britain’s manufacturing heartlands.“His driving through of Brexit did lasting harm to the UK economy, including those jobs in engineering and in manufacturing. He hasn’t got a coherent economic plan.”Reform has opposed the employment rights bill, which includes day one sick pay and new rights to parental leave and flexible working, even though a TUC poll found it wasthe government’s most popular policyamong Reform voters. The bill goes to the House of Lords on Tuesday.MPs across the main political parties believe that Reform could struggle if they do win the two metro mayoral contests in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull and East Yorkshire as some polls suggest.“He and his party have never run anything – a local council, a parish council. He’s literally spent a lifetime doing what he accuses others of doing, which is riding the political gravy train,” theTUCchief said.“I think they’ll be found wanting because it’s such a ragtag coalition. I don’t think there is any real political coherence and they’ll have to actually prove how they’re going to make the sums add up.”Nowak also accused Farage of “playing fast and loose with racist rhetoric” in the past over Brexit and immigration and suggested his “nudge, nudge, wink, wink”about a police conspiracyafter the Southport killings had “kindled the fires of violence” on the streets.All eyes are on Reform right now – but why are they given so much influence? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreBut he distanced himself from the stance of the UK’s largest teaching unionwhich has called Reform “far-right and racist”,saying: “I don’t think for one minute that the vast majority of people who vote Reform are in any way racist at all, but there are clearly racist elements in that party.”He said that Farage had pushed a “very divisive narrative” on migration, after the TUC argued that the UK shouldforge much closer ties with Europeamid an increasingly volatile and unpredictable global economy.But Nowak also had a warning for Starmer. “Don’t learn the wrong lessons from what happens in the local election results on 1 May,” he said. “I don’t think lurching to the right is the answer. You’ll never out-Reform Reform. The solution doesn’t lie in aping Farage.”Instead, he said the government should stick to its Labour values to deliver on public services, workers’ rights, industrial strategy and the cost of living.“That’s the thing that will make a real difference. You shouldn’t be suffering any sort of crisis of confidence with a 170-odd seat majority, you need to get on with the job of delivering the change that people voted for.“And I think that would be the best way to shut up Farage and those yapping on the populist right.”A spokesperson for Reform UK said: “Workers are ripping up their trade union memberships to join Reform. It’s no wonder Paul Nowak is lashing out.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageTrade unionsTUCnewsShareReuse this content"

Another shipment of more than 66,000 tonnes of iron ore pellets and 27,000 tonnes of iron ore fines, a lower-grade source of iron, is due to arrive from Sweden next week.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said: “By securing the raw materials we need to keep Scunthorpe going for the foreseeable future we’ve helped protect thousands of crucial steel jobs. Now British Steel workers and their families can breathe a sigh of relief and know that we are on their side.”The government said the shipments had been paid for from existing budgets at the Department for Business and Trade.Earlier this week, British Steel scrapped a consultation plan onmaking up to 2,700 steelworkers redundantthat Jingye had launched after it proposed closing Scunthorpe’s two blast furnaces, which would have ended the UK’s ability to make steel from scratch.Allan Bell, interim chief executive at British Steel, said: “We’ve successfully secured the raw materials we need to keep the blast furnaces running, meaning our production of steel can continue. Over the coming months our focus will be on stabilising our operations for the long term, cementing British Steel as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of steel.”Securing the supply of coking coal to the Scunthorpe plant has avoided the need for a so-called“salamander tap”, a process in which a hole is drilled in the bottom of the blast furnace to let out, or tap, molten metal and slag, which in effect would have paused steelmaking operations at one of the two furnaces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a drone attack on the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipro region, a person was killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded after a third consecutive night of assaults, the local governor, Serhiy Lysak, said.The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, described the coming week as “very critical” for US attempts to end the war, telling the American broadcaster NBC that the administration would need to “make a determination about whether this is an endeavour that we want to continue to be involved in”.He was speaking after what was described in diplomatic circles as a potentiallyhistoric meetingbetween Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the US president, albeit only a 15-minute conversation, on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday.Amid plea to build bridges at papal funeral, Trump has a revelation – about RussiaRead moreIn a social media post sent during his flight back to the US afterwards, Trump suggestedRussia was not committedto negotiating a ceasefire.“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” he wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.” He also implied he was considering further sanctions againstRussia.The meeting had been the two men’s first encounter since their highly antagonistic confrontation in the Oval Office two months ago.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Russia would not stop targeting sites used by the Ukrainian military, including those involving European contributions to aid Kyiv or connected to foreign fighting forces. He claimed in an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation that a residential building in Kyiv last week, which washit by a Russian missilekilling at least 12 people, had not been an “absolutely civilian” target.View image in fullscreenUkraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, met Donald Trump on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday.Photograph: Ukraine Presidency/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock“We will continue to target the sites used by the military ofUkraine, by some mercenaries from foreign countries and by instructors who the Europeans officially sent to help target Russian civilian sites,” he said in the interview, which was recorded on Thursday.Zelenskyy denied Moscow’s claims made on Saturday that Ukraine’s army had been forced out of Russia’s Kursk region. “Our military continues to actively defend the designated areas of the Kursk and Belgorod regions,” he wrote on Telegram, admitting that the situation remained difficult in those, and many other, areas.Ukraine’s army has dismissed as “propaganda tricks” Russia’s claims to have carried out the “full liberation” of the Kursk region, where Ukraine made considerable gains during a surprise offensive in August 2024.Zelenskyy said the tense situation on the frontlines and the position of the Russian army were an indication of the inadequacy of the “current pressure on Russia to end this war”. He said increased pressure on Moscow could bring more opportunities for “real diplomacy”.A carve-up in gift wrapping: Trump’s peace plan puts the sacrifice on UkraineRead moreIn Moscow, a man suspected of killing a Russian general in a car bomb explosion on Friday has said he was paid by the Ukrainian security service to carry out the deed, according to Russian authorities who said he had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges.Ignat Kuzinsaid he had received payment from Ukraine for killing Lt Gen Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the general staff of the Russian armed forces, who died just outside Moscow on Friday after a car bomb exploded as he was walking past.Ukraine has yet to respond to the accusations that it was involved in the second attack of its kind in four months in which a high-ranking Russian military officer was killed.Asked in his Sunday appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press about possible concessions to Russia, Rubio stressed the need to be “grownups and realistic”.“There is no military solution to this war. The only solution to this war is a negotiated settlement where both sides are going to have to give up something they claim to want and are going to have to give the other side something they wish they didn’t,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeMarco RubioDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

His words echoed previous statements where he vowed to hunt down the attackers “to the ends of the Earth” and turn terrorist hideouts “into dust”.The missiles launched are designed for powerful, long-range, high-precision strikes. The navy stressed the importance of the drills in maintaining “operational” readiness as military rhetoric intensified on both sides.Pakistan’s railway minister, Hanif Abbasi, warned over the weekend that the country’s nuclear arsenal of more than 130 missiles was “not kept as models” and was aimed “only for India … these ballistic missiles, all of them are targeted at you”.The domestic pressures shaping India’s response to Kashmir attacksRead moreAbbasi’s comments fuelled concerns the nuclear-armed neighbours were headed for a wider confrontation. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two overKashmir, which each holds in part but claims in full. They have come to the brink many other times, leading the former US president Bill Clinton to call the Himalayan region the world’s “most dangerous place”.Pakistan’s military doctrine of Full Spectrum Deterrence focuses on using tactical nuclear weapons to deter conventional threats, while India’s Cold Start doctrine is designed to deliver swift conventional strikes before escalation. These contrasting strategies have raised fears any confrontation could quickly spin out of control.“From Delhi’s perspective, given public pressure, the egregiousness of last week’s attack, and a desire to restore deterrence, some type of military response is quite likely. And if it happens, Pakistan, not wishing to look weak, would most certainly retaliate,” said the foreign policy author and analyst Michael Kugelman.“An all-out war is unlikely, as India, despite its relentless tough talk, is most focused on limited options like degrading anti-Indian terrorists and restoring deterrence,” he said.“That said, one can’t completely rule out worst-case scenarios, depending on the nature of a potential Indian strike, how Pakistan might respond to any initial Indian military action, and the ever-present miscalculation risk,” Kugelman added. “And given that these are nuclear-armed rivals, the stakes are quite high.”New Delhi has accused Islamabad of links to the attack, in which terrorists singled out Hindu men and killed them. While presenting no public proof, it has pointed to Islamabad’s past support for terrorists targeting India.In tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus waters treaty, expelled Pakistani diplomats, and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians’ visas, closing its airspace, and suspending the 1972 Shimla agreement, a key dialogue framework.While Modi’s speech marked a continued commitment to retaliation, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, sounded more conciliatory, saying Pakistan was “fully prepared to cooperate with any neutral investigators” and reaffirmed “Pakistan’s strong desire for peace”. At the same time, he reiterated Kashmir remained Pakistan’s “jugular vein”, a position enunciated by the late founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.As tensions escalated, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged fire on Sunday for a third day along the line of control dividing Kashmir, a frequent flashpoint.Fuelling speculation about possible Indian military action, India’s information ministry issued a media advisory warning against live broadcasting of military operations. Echoing concerns from past crises such as the 1999 Kargil war and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the advisory reflected fears about real-time broadcasts compromising sensitive strategies.In Kashmir, Indian forces have launched an extensive crackdown. Security forces have targeted suspected terrorists, demolishing at least 10 homes linked to militants as part of a wider effort to dismantle what India calls the “terrorism ecosystem”. Rights groups have raised concerns, and reports have estimated up to 1,500 young men have been detained or questioned.Tensions have flared over water usage. India’s release of water from the Uri Dam caused the Jhelum River to surge, flooding parts of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It followed India’s suspension of the treaty governing the region’s rivers. Pakistan has warned any water interference would be an “act of war”.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanNarendra ModiKashmirSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think the next pope can be the same but I hope he will have an open mind and be realistic about the challenges in the world right now.”A special mass was held on Sunday morning in St Peter’s Square led by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, who is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Francis. About 200,000 people attended, according to theVatican.More than 220 cardinals will meet at the Vatican on Monday morning to decide the date that the conclave to elect the next pope will begin.Only cardinals under the age of 80 – 135 in total – are eligible to take part inthe conclave, which will begin its deliberations after the completion of nine days of official mourning for Francis.Something to look up to: how Michelangelo’s love and humility could influence the Sistine Chapel conclaveRead moreJean-Claude Hollerich, a cardinal from Luxembourg, has said he expects the conclave to start within a day or two of the end of the mourning period on 4 May. It must start by 10 May.Reinhard Marx, a German cardinal, said on Saturday the conclave would last just “a few days”.The cardinal-electors – about 80% of whom were appointed by Francis – will cast four votes a day until one candidate secures a two-thirds majority. The news that a successor has been chosen will be communicated by white smoke emitted from the Sistine Chapel.Cardinals were expected to pay their respects at Francis’s tomb at Santa Maria Maggiore on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisThe papacyCatholicismChristianityReligionVaticanItalynewsShareReuse this content"

Another videoshoweddozens of people fleeing the building through its entrance after federal agents smashed a window.The DEA Rocky Mountain division said agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), homeland security, the US army’s criminal investigation division and theColoradoSprings police had joined the raid.“200+ inside an underground nightclub in CO Springs had their illegal party upended this am,” the DEA posted. In a separate post, the agency’s Rocky Mountain division added: “Nothing good ever happens after 3 a.m.”Jonathan Pullen, the DEA agent in charge,told reportersat a news conference that some detained service members were patrons while others were working as armed security guards at the underground nightclub.Jonathan Pullen, the DEA agent in charge of an early morning raid on a nightclub in Colorado Springs, briefed the media on Sunday.Pullen said the nightclub had been under investigation for several months for alleged activities including drug trafficking, prostitution and “crimes of violence”.“When the cops showed up at the door, most of the drugs hit the floor,” Pullen said, adding: “Colorado Springs is waking up to a safer community today.”The pink cocaine, or tusi,that was reportedto have been seized is a relatively novel drug often containing no cocaine but rather combinations such as ketamine and MDMA, methamphetamine, cocaine and fentanyl or some other combination of pink-dyed powders,according to the DEA.Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, heralded the raid,saying on X: “As we approach his 100 days in office @POTUS Trump’s directive to make America safe again is achieving results!”Colorado Springs is home to a number of military installations, including the Cheyenne Mountain space force station and the headquarters of US space operations command.Sunday’s raid is the latest DEA crackdown in the area this year. In January, a raid on a “makeshift nightclub” in Adams county, near Denver, led to the arrests of 41 people living in the country illegally and another eight who had been in the club.David Olesky, a DEA special agent in charge, said at the time that an uptick in enforcement was due to a “renewed sense of purpose” under theTrump administration.Derek Maltz, the acting administrator of the DEA,toldthe ABC News affiliate Denver7 last month that Colorado is “ground zero” for violent criminals in the US and is home to the “command and control” of the Venezuelan gangTren de Aragua.After Sunday’s raid, the owner of the building where the party had been heldtold Denver7he had no idea an underground nightclub was operating on his property.“I’ve never even seen a lot of trash in the parking lot to even suspect that anything like an after-hours nightclub is going on. So, it’s pretty shocking,” Mike Moon said.Moon said the space is usually rented out for birthdays, weddings and quinceañeras, and alcohol is not allowed to be served. “It’s written in their lease. They’re not allowed to do any illegal activity,” he told the outlet.In a statement, Colorado Springs’ mayor, Yemi Mobolade,saidthe investigation and the execution of these warrants were “the result of clear evidence of serious criminal conduct” and that residents deserved “to live in a city where the rule of law is upheld and where illegal behavior is met with firm and decisive action”.Explore more on these topicsColoradoDrugsUS immigrationLaw (US)Trump administrationShareReuse this content"

Authorities have refused to give more details other than saying forensic evidence had been gathered and a coroner’s report submitted.According to the local broadcaster NDR, citing police sources, Fröhlich was shot. Investigators have issued an appeal for potential witnesses who may have observed suspicious activity on or around the long cerise houseboat in which Fröhlich resided, on the Holzhafen bank of the Elbe River in the eastern Moorfleet district.Her son discovered her body on Tuesday morning, according to police, who believe she died between midnight and 5.30am.“According to current information, relatives found the 58-year-old woman lifeless on her houseboat and alerted the fire brigade, who were only able to confirm the woman’s death,” a police spokesperson told local media.“After evaluating traces and evidence, the investigating authorities now believe that the woman died as a result of violence.”The spokesperson said investigators were looking into possible suspects and whether the killer may have been known to Fröhlich. “Given the ongoing investigation, no further information can be provided at this time,” he said.Media reported that divers were at the scene of the crime, amid speculation that the weapon could have been thrown into the Elbe.Fröhlich started out as a journalist, initially in Ukraine where she founded a women’s magazine in Kyiv. She later worked as a freelance journalist in Germany for women’s and other magazines such as Stern, before turning her hand to writing novels.In 2012 she published her debut novel, My Russian Mother-in-Law and other Catastrophes, which she said was based on her own experience of being married to a Russian.It entered the bestseller list of Der Spiegel magazine, one of the closest-observed indicators of fiction and nonfiction sales in Germany, where it remained for several months. It was subsequently translated into French. A critic at the time described it as “a hilarious west-east satire”.In 2016 she published the crime novel Death is a Certainty, which was similarly successful, and in 2019 she followed this with Skeletons in the Closet. Both were published by Penguin. Her novels were characterised by a mix of humour, family tales and social topics.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They are now empty.“There isn’t anything left to give them now, so once the last supplies have been used up, the kitchens will have to close,” said one senior UN official. “At the moment people are holding up OK but we know from other crises that when things deteriorate, they deteriorate very fast, and we are not far from that point.”Within hours of the ceasefire’s collapse almost two months ago, Israel blocked food, fuel, medicine or other items from entering Gaza. Dozens of bakeries that provided bread for hundreds of thousands have already shut down.The 47 community kitchens, which provide only lentils, plain pasta or rice, have already reduced portions.“These people who depend on us are threatened with starvation if this kitchen closes,” said Hani Abu Qasim, of the Rafah Charity Kitchen in Gaza.Markets across Gaza are nearly bare and anything on sale is now too expensive for the vast majority.Since the end of the ceasefire, the price of a kilogram of tomatoes has quadrupled to $8, sugar has gone up seven times and flour 10 to 15 times. Meat or dairy products are unobtainable.Um Aboud, 45, an academic and journalist in Gaza City, said: “We eat two meals a day, sometimes just one. We have only a small amount of food left.“The living conditions are extremely difficult. Hospitals are destroyed, with no treatment or medicine available. There is no clean water or electricity. Garbage surrounds us from every direction. Gaza has become a disease-ridden place. People are dying slowly, as if we have been sentenced to death.”Almost70% of Gazais now covered by evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military or is part of an expanded buffer zone controlled by Israeli troops. More than 400,000 people have been displaced since the collapse of the ceasefire.Israeli officials justify the blockade with claims that Hamas routinely steals aid, distributing it to its fighters or selling it to raise vital funds. Aid officials in Gaza deny any widespread theft of aid in recent months.In a sprawling tent camp outside the southern city of Khan Younis, Mariam al-Najjar and her mother-in-law prepared a meal for their family of 11 with four cans of peas and carrots, some rice, stock cubes and spices.View image in fullscreenThe al-Najjar family eats peas with rice – the family sometimes eat just one meal a day.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APBefore the war, her family would eat a large meal of meat, stuffed vegetables or other traditional dishes on Fridays, Najjar said. “Now we eat peas and rice. We never ate canned peas before the war. Only in this war that has destroyed our lives.”The UN said it identified 3,700 children suffering from acute malnutrition in March, up 80% from February.Specialists from the UN’shunger monitoring system, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), are preparing a new assessment in Gaza, to be released next month, UN officials in Gaza said.There is also a growing shortage of medical supplies. “Everything from sterile gloves to body bags needs replenishment,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said. “This is an ongoing and particularly acute challenge as we unfortunately continue to see shockingly high numbers of sick people, including severely wounded patients, which increases pressure on the system.”The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel in October 2023, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say 59 hostages remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are thought to be dead.Israel says its blockade also aims to force Hamas into releasing hostages. Rights groups accuse Israel of using a “starvation tactic”, endangering the entire population and so making it a potential war crime.Hospitals in Gaza received the remains of 51 Palestinians over the past 24 hours who were killed in Israeli strikes, the local health ministry said on Sunday, bringing the Palestinian death toll from the war to 52,243.The overall toll includes nearly 700 bodies for which the documentation process was recently completed, the ministry said in its latest update.On Monday, the international court of justice (ICJ), the United Nation’s principal court, willbegin hearingsto establish if Israel’sban on all cooperationwith Unrwa’s activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank is unlawful. Israel claims Unrwa has been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested.South Africafiled a complaintwith the ICJ in December 2023 alleging Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, which Israel denies.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Throughout the day, they were joined by other Democratic lawmakers, including the senator Raphael Warnock,who spokeas the sit-in passed the 10-hour mark.The proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year,the New York Times reported on Friday, includes cuts to programs that support childcare, health research, education, housing assistance, community development and the elderly.“Republican leaders have made clear their intention to use the coming weeks to advance a reckless budget scheme to President Trump’s desk that seeks to gut Medicaid, food assistance and basic needs programs that help people, all to give tax breaks to billionaires,” Booker and Jeffries aid in a statement.“Given what’s at stake, these could be some of the most consequential weeks for seniors, kids and families in generations,” they added.Bookerwrote separately on X: “This is a moral moment in America. Sitting on the Capitol steps with Leader Hakeem Jeffries this morning to discuss what’s at stake with Trump’s budget and affirm the need for action to protect Medicaid, food assistance, and other safety net programs.”Booker and Jeffries started their sit-in around 6am and were joined by lawmakers including Democratic senators Chris Coons and Angela Alsobrooks and representatives Sarah McBride, Maxwell Frost, Gil Cisneros and Gabe Amo, among others. Labor leaders, including Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, also took part in the event that stretched for more than 12 hours.Republican unity to be tested in talks over Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’Read moreReverend Dr William J Barber II and the National Education Association president, Becky Pringle, also joined. Pringle said the Trump administration was perpetuating “the greatest assault on public education that we’ve ever seen in this country”.Democrats and independents have added a new degree of physicality to their opposition to the Trump agenda. Earlier this month, Booker set a new record for the chamber’s longest speech when he held the floor, without a bathroom break, for more than 25 hours.Booker said he was doing so with the “intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States senate for as long as I am physically able” in order to protest the actions of Trump and his administration.The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been on a “Fighting Oligarchy” nationwide tour of the US to protest the “oligarchs and corporate interests that have so much power and influence in this country”.On Sunday, Sanders, who has accused Democrats of significantly ignoring working-class priorities, said that the party does not have “a vision for the future”.“You have Democrats appropriately, and I’m working with them, talking about Trump’s movement toward authoritarianism, vigorously opposing the so-called reconciliation bill to give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks for the 1% and make massive cuts to Medicaid, nutrition and housing, opposing what Musk is doing to dismember the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration, making it hard for our veterans to get decent healthcare or benefits on time,” Sanders told NBC’s Meet the Press.Throughout Sunday’s livestreamed sit-in, groups of curious passersby also found themselves sitting on the Capitol steps listening and weighing in on the discussion.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsCory BookerHakeem JeffriesRepublicansWashington DCUS politicsUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

Majorel, the company at the centre of the allegations in Ghana, is owned by the French multinational Teleperformance.One man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he attempted suicide owing to the nature of his work. His claims his contract was subsequently terminated and he has returned to his home country.Facebook and other large social media companies employ armies of content moderators, often based in the poorest parts of the world, to remove posts that breach their community standards and to train AI systems to do the same.Moderators are required to review distressing and often brutal pictures and videos to establish whether they should be removed from Meta’s platforms. According to workers in Ghana, they have seen videos of a person being skinned alive and a woman being beheaded.The moderators claim mental health care offered by the firm was unhelpful, was not delivered by medical doctors, and that personal disclosures made by staff about the effects of their work were circulated among managers.Teleperformance disputed this, saying it employed licensed mental health professionals who are registered with the local regulatory body and hold a master’s degree in psychology, counselling, or another mental health field.The legal case is being prepared by a UK-based nonprofit, Foxglove. It would be the second case brought by content moderators in Africa, after Samasource workers in Kenya sued in 2023.Foxglove said it was “urgently investigating these shocking abuses of workers” with a view to using “every tool at our disposal, including potential legal action” to improve working conditions.It is working with a Ghanaian firm, Agency Seven Seven, on preparing two possible lawsuits. One would allege psychological harms and could involve a group of moderators, and the other unfair dismissal, involving the moderator from east Africa whose contract was terminated after he attempted suicide.Foxglove’s co-executive director Martha Dark said: “These are the worst conditions I have seen in six years of working with social media content moderators around the world.“In Ghana, Meta is displaying nothing short of a complete disregard for the humanity of its key safety workers upon whom all its profits rely: content moderators. They are treated as objects who can be used up, burned out and replaced with no care whatsoever for the permanent damage to their mental and physical wellbeing.”Dark said basic wages for content moderators in Accra were below living costs, incentivising them to work overtime, for which pay is understood to be even lower than normal rates. Moderators faced deductions from their pay for failing to meet performance targets, she added.Contracts seen by the Guardian show that the base wage starts at about 1,300 Ghanaian cedis a month – just over £64. This is supplemented by a system of performance-related bonuses, the upper range of which amounts to about 4,900 cedis (£243) a month, significantly less than the estimatedcost of living in Accra.A Teleperformance spokesperson said content moderators enjoyed “strong pay and benefits, including monthly pay that is roughly 10 times the country’s minimum wage for domestic moderators, and 16 times the minimum wage for those who have relocated from other countries, when including project allowance, transportation allowance, language premium and more – all of which are automatically paid to the moderator and are not performance-based”.Foxglove’s researcher Michaela Chen said she had seen photos of moderators’ living quarters, in which they were “crammed five to a flat, two to a room”. She said there appeared to be a culture of secrecy, including surveillance from managers, who follow workers into the toilets during breaks.This extends to moderators’ work for Meta. She said: “Workers spend all day working on Meta’s platforms, moderating to Meta’s standards and using Meta’s systems, but at the same time, moderators are told constantly: ‘You do not work for Meta,’ and are forbidden from telling anyone they do.”Teleperformance said moderators were “offered housing in … one of the most upscale and well-known residential and commercial neighbourhoods in Accra”.The spokesperson described the housing as “safe, with strong security” and having air conditioning, recreation facilities, including gyms and pools.Carla Olympio, a partner at Agency Seven Seven, said she believed a personal injury case could succeed in Ghana’s courts and would set a precedent establishing that worker protections extend to psychological harms as well as physical injury.“[There is] currently a gap in our laws because they haven’t necessarily caught up with the new developments that cover technology and virtual work,” she said.Rosa Curling, a co-executive director at Foxglove, said it was seeking for the court to “order immediate changes to the content moderators’ workplace”, including proper safeguards and psychiatric care.A spokesperson for Teleperformance said: “At TP in Ghana, we take our content moderation work seriously. From the very beginning during the interview process, within the employee contract and through employee training and resiliency testing, we are fully transparent with our prospective moderators regarding the content they might see during their work to help keep the internet safe for our communities. We have robust people management systems and workplace practices, including a robust wellbeing programme staffed by fully licensed psychologists to support our content moderators throughout their content moderation journey.”Meta said the companies it worked with were “contractually obliged to pay their employees who review content on Facebook and Instagram above the industry standard in the markets they operate”.The tech company said it took “the support of content reviewers seriously”, including detailing expectations around counselling, training and other support in contracts with the companies it outsourced.It said all content moderators signed client confidentiality agreements because they were dealing with user information which needed to be protected and for their own safety, but moderators may discuss their jobs with doctors and counsellors, and some aspects with family members.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

He added that Beijing’s denial that negotiations are ongoing was for a Chinese audience.“I think they’re playing to a different audience,” Bessent said. “We have a process in place and, again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable.“The first path will be, again, a de-escalation, which I think the Chinese are going to have to have. Then I think there can be an agreement in principle, these 17 or 18 important trade deals that we’re negotiating.”But Bessent warned that “a trade deal can take months” and said negotiations with other significant US trading partners were progressing. “Some of those are moving along very well, especially the – with the Asian countries,” he said, praising Trump’s negotiating strategy.“In game theory it’s called strategic uncertainty,” he said. “So, you’re not going to tell the person on the other side of the negotiation where you’re going to end up. And nobody’s better at creating this leverage than President Trump.”The treasury secretary’s comments come as top US retailers have reportedly warned the White House that tariffs will cause empty store shelves and price hikes within weeks.Bloomberg reportedthat Chinese fast-fashion giantShein raised US pricesof its products from dresses to kitchenware on Friday ahead of imminent tariffs on small parcels. The average price for the top 100 products in the beauty and health category increased by 51%, and more than 30% for home and kitchen products and toys, including a 377% increase in the price of a 10-piece set of kitchen towels.Trump predicted on Sunday that tariffs would ultimately benefit US taxpayers and boost employment. “When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated,”Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.“Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year. Also, massive numbers of jobs are already being created, with new plants and factories currently being built or planned.” He called it a “bonanza” for Americans and said “the external service is happening”.US consumer sentiment sees largest drop since 1990 after Trump tariff chaosRead moreSeparately on Sunday, US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said the US was holding daily conversations with China over tariffs. “Every day we are in conversation with China, along with those other 99, 100 countries that have come to the table,” Rollins said on CNN’s State of the Union.Rollins said the president was prepared to bail out American farmers if the trade war continues squeezing commodity exports, particularly soybean and pork sales to China.“First of all, the prayer is that that doesn’t need to happen – but secondly, if it does, for the short term, just as in Trump 1, we are preparing for that,” Rollins said.Rollins said it could take months before it is known whether a bail-out is needed.“I don’t think we’re going to need it, but if we do, it will be there,” Rollins said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsChinaXi JinpingDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The death toll had risen to at least 28 and the numbers injured had risen to more than 1,000.Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, flew to Bandar Abbas, a city 20 miles to the west of the port in Hormozgan province, to be briefed on the investigation and rescue operation.With choking smoke and air pollution spreading across the area, schools and offices in Bandar Abbaswere ordered closed on Sunday, state TV reported. The health ministry urged residents to avoid going outside until further notice and to use protective masks.Early indications were that the explosion appears to have been an accident rather than a deliberate attack. The Tehran prosecutor’s office said it had filed charges against a variety of media outlets of different political persuasions, a reflection of officials’ concern at speculation that the explosion was an act of terror or due to mistakes by the army.CCTV footage circulating on Iranian media showed a localised fire starting five minutes after midday in a single container and then spreading rapidly to other containers, and port workers starting to run away. A vast explosion then occurs within two minutes, knocking out the camera.View image in fullscreenCCTV image of people running from a fire at the port.Photograph: Social Media/ReutersThe interior ministry launched an inquiry. No official explanation has been given for the explosion yet but there were growing reports that the storage of chemicals in containers in high temperatures may have been to blame.Evidence of previous, smaller incidents was being cited, as well as claims that much of the regime surrounding health and safety protocols, especially concerning the inspection of chemical storage, had been contracted out.The Kremlin website said Putin had conveyed his “words of sincere sympathy and support to the families of the victims as well as his wishes for a recovery to all those injured”.Russiadispatched planes carrying specialist firefighters.The explosion happened just as a third round of talks between the US and Iran started, designed to lead to fresh controls being placed on Iran’s nuclear programme in return for the lifting of US sanctions.The Iranian foreign ministry described the talks, mediated by Oman and held in Muscat, as serious, practical and more detailed than those previously. Another round of talks is due to be held in a week’s time.Explore more on these topicsIranRussiaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Now, with the advent of talent TV shows and social media where those who dabble in the art of magic have amassed millions of followers, their popularity has reached new heights.With this has come the rise of tutorial videos showing anybody at home how to pull off their own routines. It was not always this way. For one thing, revealing the secrets behind the world of magic would get you blacklisted.The magician’s cape was also once the preserve of a select few. So selective was the world of magic that one woman, Sophie Lloyd, posed as a man to join the Magic Circle 30 years ago at a time when women were barred from becoming members. Lloyd, who was expelled in 1991 when her deception was exposed, wasreadmitted this week.So how is life for a magician today? The Guardian ventured down to Covent Garden in central London, the public stage where performers can show off their skills to thousands of people, including tourists.Cam Clarke, 27, has been interested in magic since he was five years old after his grandparents brought him a magic kit from Las Vegas. “They had the cups and balls, which is what I’ve gone on to do in my show.”At the end of his routine, Clarke pulls out six tennis balls from cups and then a pineapple from a hat.He has been performing professionally since he was 17. “When Dynamo started getting big, audiences got way more into magic again. It was a fringe thing before. I started getting a lot more gigs in bars and restaurants once magic on TV got big,” he said.Nathan Earl first got the magic bug when he was 14 years old. “I had a bit of interest from a young age, but didn’t do it for years after that,” he said. “Someone in college said I should be a magician because he thought it would fit my character as a hobby. I took his advice and started doing it.”The 29-year-old, who joined the Magic Circle at 18 and is an associate of the Inner Magic Circle, welcomed the news of Lloyd’s induction. “We’ve definitely moved forward into modern times, 100%, which is obviously the way it should be. Now it’s about righting any wrongs,” he said.He said being a street performer was “one of the best things” a magician could do. “I go out there and I have my equipment. I go out and I make some smile, I make them stay and hopefully they give me money at the end.”View image in fullscreenMagician Nathan Earl, a member of the Magic Circle.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianLaura London, the Magic Circle’s first female chair, said the industry had rapidly diversified in recent years, with more women and young people joining. Of the Magic Circle’s 1,700 members, 5% are women, and 15% of its Magicians Club for 10- to 18-year-olds is female.“We have women on Britain’s Got Talent, on the television and internet. It’s really accessible. We’re getting more and more young girls every single day. They know they can be magicians now,” said London.At the Magic Society at the University of Bristol, London’s words rang true. “We’re really diverse. We’ve got 32 members at the moment. About half are women and we’ve got quite a few LGBT members,” said Samuel Stephens, 21, the society’s secretary.While previous generations may have eyed the TV guide for Penn & Teller or episodes of The Paul Daniels Magic Show, the rise of social media and magician influencers has drawn younger eyes to the world of magic.“Usually, the spark comes from someone watching a magician on YouTube or TikTok and they want to figure out how it works,” said Johnny Clavo, 28, a member of the society. “There are magicians who post tutorials or performances and that makes them get into magic.”While previous generations were enchanted by parlour magic, where props and assistants were on hand to pull off grand, theatrical illusions, Stephens said young people were more interested in close-up magic, where items such as cards and coins are manipulated in smaller settings.“It’s just so much more accessible than stage magic and easier to learn. Back in the day, parlour magic was more the done thing and close-up magic would be an appetiser,” he said.With the old guard welcoming diverse, new generations with open arms and magic being easier to learn than ever, the magician’s cape appears to be something everybody can don.It’s a kind of magic: simple tricksThe floating pen:1: Grasp a pen with your right hand.2: Grip your wrist with your left hand, close enough so your fingers can reach the pen.3: Extend the index figure on your left hand to the pen and grasp it tightly, ensuring this movement is obscured by staying faced forward.4: While keeping the pen steady with your finger, open your right hand. This should mean your pen dropping to the ground but, because the finger on your other hand is keeping it held, it will look like it’s floating.Coin vanish:1: Place your coin across two of your middle fingers on your left hand.2: Grasp the coin with these two fingers tightly, then mimic a toss of the coin into the other hand.3: Quickly grasp your right hand. It should look like you have thrown the coin from your left hand into your right hand, but the coin with remain wedged in your left hand.4: Open your right hand and, shock horror, no coin will be there. Open your left hand and the coin will be there.Magic card swap:1: Flick through your deck of cards and subtly grasp the final two.2: Flip this card over, grasping both cards tightly so they look like a single one.3: Reveal the card.4: Return it to the top of the deck, then remove the final card this time.5: Reveal it, it will magically be a different card.Explore more on these topicsMagicSteven Frayne (AKA Dynamo)featuresShareReuse this content"

The only flaw in Robert Harris’s brilliant novel of clerical politics Conclave is that, as they scheme, none of the prelates seem bothered about the ceiling Michelangelo painted with scenes from Genesis between 1508 and 1512 or the Last Judgment he painted on the altar wall much later, from 1536 to 1541 – let alone the earlier paintings by Botticelli and others on the side walls.When a bomb blows in a window in last year’saward-winning film of the book, the conclave carries on without even pausing for restorers to check the damage. As if.But if cardinals do glance upward to the painted heavens or sidelong at the fires of hell behind the altar, how could Michelangelo’s two fresco masterpieces stimulate or challenge them in their mighty choice?The Sistine contains warnings as well as inspirations from history, for Renaissance papal elections made the film look tame. The election in 1503 that awarded Giuliano della Rovere the papacy and enabled him as Pope Julius II to commission Michelangelo’s ceiling was a tense factional struggle in a college that the previous pope’s son, Cesare Borgia, had under his thumb. By chance, Cesare fell ill, which allowed his enemy Julius to take power and destroy the Borgias. And Julius’s desire to beautify the chapel with Michelangelo’s art was itself dynastic – the Sistine was shaped by Julius’s uncle, Pope Sixtus IV, so he was adding to the glory of the Della Rovere clan. All very spiritual.While the Renaissance papacy that created the chapel was bloody and ruthless, Michelangelo was someone to look up to. Everything about his frescoes testifies to a personal example of courage, integrity and Christian faith that should help the electors think about the virtues of an ideal pope.His towering pictures also point to the church’s need for reform. Full recognition of gay rights would be accepted by a pope who understood the Last Judgment.Michelangelo painted itafter he had recently declared his “neoplatonic” love for a young nobleman in poetry, drawings and letters. This heroic assertion of the beauty and dignity of same-sex love, in an age when you could be burned at the stake for “sodomy”, is reflected in his portrayal of men kissing in heaven.A puritanical backlash led to the male nudes being bowdlerised with draperies soon after Michelangelo’s death. In fact, even with some of the draperies still in place, any cardinal who looks around will see so many nudes above and around them, it is impossible to escape Michelangelo’s challenge to the Christian equation of sin and sexuality that goes back to St Paul.This devout yet independent thinker challenges today’s church with a fundamental question: can it really be moral and godly without adopting a more honest attitude to the human body and its desires?1View image in fullscreenGod creates the sun, moon and Earth.Photograph: Peter Barritt/AlamyPope Julius II’s theologians proposed a complicated plan for the Sistine ceiling but Michelangelo rejected it and came up with his own design in which the creativity of God mirrors that of the artist himself.God is not only human but fleshy in Michelangelo’s intimate vision. As he whirls in space, creating the sun and the moon, we get a huge view of his buttocks through tight purple fabric. In High Renaissance Rome, such free thought was accepted – Michelangelo freely mixed upChristianityand pagan philosophy. A lesson for the cardinals to loosen up on doctrinal pedantry perhaps?2View image in fullscreenMichelangelo’s portrayal of the Libyan Sibyl.Photograph: AlamyMichelangelo depicts an array of Old Testament prophets and pagan Roman prophetesses – this one is the Libyan Sibyl – who witness and frame his scenes from Genesis. While they are conventionally explained as “precursors” of Christianity, Michelangelo’s art may reflect the more radical teaching of Pico della Mirandola and other thinkers who mentored him as a teenager in Florence.Pico claimed that pagan, Jewish and Islamic ideas, including Kabbalistic magic, are compatible with Christianity. Looking up may encourage the cardinals to embrace religious relativism.3View image in fullscreenInterior and architectural details of the Sistine Chapel.Photograph: Jurate Buiviene/AlamyMichelangelo set his biblical scenes within multilayered, trompe l’oeil architecture, confusing you about where the gothic vaulting ends and his artbegins: is that a real pedestal or just paint? Is that goat skull flat or solid? A bored cardinal idly looking up at these playful quirks may remember that appearances are often deceptive – useful to know amid the intricacies of clerical politics.4View image in fullscreenMichelangelo depicted himself as St Bartholomew on the Sistine Chapel altar wall.Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/AlamyAny cardinal tormented by ambition to “win” this election should reflect on Michelangelo’s surprising self-portrait in the Last Judgment.He depicts himself as a bag of skin, flayed off, his bearded face an empty, distorted mask. He was as famous as the pope when he painted this, yet portrays himself at the height of his career as a husk. It’s a lesson in humility.5View image in fullscreenA scene from the Last Judgment.Photograph: imagebroker.com/AlamyMichelangelo broke with the convention in which the blessed and damned at the Last Judgment stand on either side of such scenes, and brilliantly rethought it as a vertical composition in which those awaiting salvation and damnation are expressed rising heavenwards or falling to hell. To sit in the conclave and see this must fill you with the longing to be lofty, to rise to the moment, to go high – and not be dragged down by base calculations or corruption.6View image in fullscreenMinos, judge of the underworld, in the Last Judgment.Photograph: AlamyInspired by Dante, Michelangelo painted the ass-eared Minos, judge of the underworld – the number of times a serpent coils about him shows to which circle of hell the damned soul is condemned.Michelangelo is said to have given Minos the face of a clerical official who accused him of turning the Sistine into a “bath house” with his nudes. This was his caustic response to this bigot, who in an ironic twist has his penis chewed forever by the serpent.The message here is: how canCatholicismrefuse full sexual justice when its own greatest artist is such a heroic example of a Christian gay man?Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismThe papacyReligionChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was just 22 at the time. “I didn’t even think it was a book,” she says when we meet. “I was just learning how to write.”Send Nudes, her first collection, about being a young woman in a messed-up world, was published in 2022. She won theBBC national short story awardand the Edge Hill short story prize. The following year, she made the once-in-a-decade GrantaBest of Young British Novelistslist. “Then I was like: ‘Oh, this is actually happening. This feels like a big deal,’” she says.It is one of the first warm spring days and we are sitting outside a cafe in Broadway Market in east London. Sams, now 28, has another new baby (three months old). He is being looked after by her grandmother, along with her toddler, at her flat in nearby Bethnal Green, while her eldest, who is just about to turn six, is at school.She also – somehow – has her first novel, Gunk, out next month. Squinting against the sunshine, she seems remarkably unfazed by it all. And, as a writer of youthful malaise, very cheerful. Although she does admit that it is a “relief” to have the tricky follow-up to a hit debut in the bag. “You write the first book and you’re like: ‘Well, that will probably never happen again,’” she says. “I feel like a real writer now.”Sams writes in the disarming voice of a bored teenager with a gift for one-liners and sudden moments of poetry, and it is not hard to see why her work has caused such a stir. The 10 short stories in Send Nudes show characters on the heady precipice between girlhood and becoming young women. “It was the summer between year nine and 10, when all the boys smelt of Lynx Africa and Subway,” one narrator tells us.There’s only so long you can write before you’re like: ‘Let’s do a sex scene.’ It’s funPool-side rivalries flare on a first blended-family holiday; a young woman bakes sourdough in the days after an abortion; a girl attempts to recreate a Tenerife beach in a London high-rise flat to console her mother during the pandemic – these stories are sad, true and very now. The girls’ world is one of Tinder and Snapchat, but also age-old problems of unwanted pregnancies and abuse. They navigate toxic relationships with their friends, boyfriends, parents and their own bodies in stories that are sticky with booze, sex and blood.Gunk returns to the same territory. The title is the name of the grotty student club in the novel, which is set in Sams’s home city of Brighton, and also refers to the slime on a baby’s head after it’s born. It opens with a baby just “24 hours and 17 minutes” old and loops back to end with what Sams calls her “big fat birth scene”. In between, the novel charts the friendship between Jules, the divorced manager of Gunk, and nim, a shaven-headed 18-year-old who comes to work in the club. In a twist on the standard love triangle, Jules’s ex-husband Leon is the father of nim’s baby, and the novel rests on the ambiguous relationship between the two women.In Sams’s fictional worlds, the edges between female friendship and desire are as smudged as lipstick after a long night partying. Jules and nim are everything to each other, she explains. “They’re a boss and an employee, a kind of mother and daughter interchangeably, they’ve slept with the same man and they are parents of the same child.” Like the unequal best friends in her short storySnakebite, their relationship is charged with attraction. “I wanted it to be sexy,” she says. “I wanted to keep it really messy and to see if there weren’t so many rules around love, maybe we could love each other better.” Sams is interested in the tangled and untidy: “I couldn’t write something neat because it wouldn’t feel true to me.”Her own life became messy when she got pregnant just after graduating from the University of Manchester with a degree in English and creative writing. “I was a woman of a certain class and education; I was expected to dream of something other than wasting my life on a baby,”she wrote in an essayin Granta magazine shortly after Send Nudes was published. She realised she desperately wanted to keep the baby. Her boyfriend Jacob wasn’t initially keen (he’s now a very happy father of three boys).“It didn’t occur to me that I would feel completely alone afterwards,” she says today. She felt alienated from her friends and the older mums she met in west London, where she was living at the time. Writing the stories was a form of escape, but also “a kind of grieving process for girlhood,” she says. “I really felt like I had left young womanhood behind.”View image in fullscreenGunk was written when Sonny was a toddler and she was pregnant with her second baby. She knew she had to write about young motherhood, and that inevitably meant writing about alternative families. In a time of a cost of living crisis and crazy childcare fees, she feels “like everyone’s rethinking how the family looks. Everyone is like: ‘Where’s the village? We need the village.’ It’s just not working.”It is not just domestic set-ups that have changed. “You no longer need a man and woman to have a baby,” she says. In Gunk she wanted to think about all the different ways to be a mother, “how we mother each other, and how we all still need mothering”.Growing up in Brighton, her world “was run by mothers”. Her childhood was one of parties and music festivals, which left the bookish young Saba (her name comes from her Syrian heritage) longing for more rules. Her parents divorced when she was 11; she has a younger sister and a much younger half-brother. Her mother, a breastfeeding consultant, has recently gone back to university to train to be a midwife. Send Nudes is dedicated to her maternal grandmother. Having so few men in her life as a child, she was thrown to find herself the mother of three boys, “but they are all so different from each other that it becomes impossible to know what ‘a boy’ even is,” she says. “The world has changed, gender really does feel looser.”Send Nudes was written as a reaction against the “simplified feminism” of those bubble-gum-pink go-girl affirmations all over Instagram when Sams was at university. She would look at the slogans and ask: “OK, but what about this situation? What about this one?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But then thereports of rising depression, anxiety and eating disorders among generation Z, particularly women, show that it really isn’t. Add in financial insecurity and the existential threat of the climate catastrophe, and it’s no wonder novels by a generation of female writers have come to be dubbed – rather patronisingly – “sad-girl lit”.Feminist critic Jessa Crispin complained that Send Nudes conformed to this vogue for listless young female characters “as helpless against the tides of fate as a jellyfish washed up on the beach”. This passivity could be seen as part of a generational helplessness in the face of world events. In fact, many of the stories are also celebrations of female resilience or agency, such as the title one in which the unnamed narrator finds liberation in sending a nude selfie to a stranger. “Obviously, it’s complex and it’s shit sometimes,” Sams says of the reality she was trying to capture. “But ultimately I wanted the stories to be about power and the slipperiness of control.”Far from being merely victims, many of her girls are drunk on their own youth and beauty. “I think that there is loads of power in being a young woman,” Sams reflects. “But your power is also your powerlessness. It’s constantly eluding you.” Looking gorgeous might feel great, but “it’s just the patriarchy” and can always be weaponised against you.Like writers such as Ottessa Moshfegh (Sams is a big fan), she refuses to be coy about sex and body parts. “I’m really interested in bodies, particularly women’s bodies, periods and all of that,” she says. “To me that feels overdue.” You can’t write about women’s bodies without also writing about shame. “I was a chubby kid, and I felt bad about my body from around the age of six,” she says. “I don’t think it felt, like, rare.”She was determined to write a truthful delivery room scene, breaking waters and all. “I was filling chapters,” she laughs. “I was forcing my reader to witness this massive birth scene, because you give birth and no one cares. You’re like: ‘Listen to this – it’s insane!’” And, rather than being an act of feminist subversion, she simply enjoys writing about sex. “There’s only so long you can write before you’re like: ‘Let’s do a sex scene.’ It’s fun.”She gave a copy of Send Nudes to her grandparents with strict instructionsnotto read it. “Obviously they would never have listened,” she jokes. “But I don’t know if they’re as scary as just, like, the whole world.”Jacob is a horticulturist at Kew Gardens – “He’s a plant guy, it’s cute” – and they have a small but lovely garden in east London. Now her middle son is at nursery, Sams likes to write in the cafe of a local independent cinema, where they don’t hassle you to buy much and she can eavesdrop on conversations about films. Generally, she’s not bothered by the buggy in the hall. Quite the opposite: “For me, having kids and writing complement each other,” she explains. “You experience time differently because toddlers are so slow and so interested in every tiny thing. Writing is the same: it takes ages and there’s so much paying attention to things that are brushed over when you’re just walking around.” Writing is the best way “to be in love with being alive”, she says, and there’s nothing sad about that.Her phone buzzes. Time’s up. It’s her grandmother. She needs to go home and feed her new baby.Gunk by Saba Sams will be published by Bloomsbury on 8 May.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

How to choose the best pet for families, city living or people with allergiesWe asked professional dog trainer Graeme Hall AKA The Dogfather to give us his suggestions for your perfect poochAs told toSarah PhillipsSun 27 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareAt the risk of pleasing a handful of the dog owning population and annoying the vast majority, we asked Graeme Hall, AKA The Dogfather, a dog trainer, presenter of TV’sDogs Behaving (Very) Badlyand author ofDoes My Dog Love Me?to suggest the best breeds for different contexts. “It would be really funny if for every category I said labrador,” laughs Hall. However, his recommendations do come with a caveat: “Dogs are individuals. All Yorkshiremen are smashing, but every now and again you might meet one who’s not. Dogs are a bit like that.”Which dogs are best for:FamiliesA labrador is a good bet for a first family dog. They are pretty calm around children. But also, and this might raise a few eyebrows, Staffordshire bull terriers have always been known as the “nanny dog”. Normally they are very good with families.Urban livingSmaller dogs are best, so: companion breeds (a dog whose purpose is to provide companionship for humans, unlike a working dog). If you’ve got time to groom, pomeranians are quite cute. Or pugs, but you’ve got to be thinking about health issues, because some of the dogs with very short noses can struggle to breathe.Country livingWorking breeds, generally speaking – if you’ve got a lot of room to let them run and time to exercise them, go for spaniels and border collies.View image in fullscreenWild swimmer … a Spanish water dog.Photograph: GlobalP/Getty Images/iStockphotoOlder peopleSmaller dogs, typically, because you don’t want a lot of weight on the lead, and not too energetic. So one of the terriers. We often think of a yorkshire terrier as an old person’s dog. Or the right kind of jack russell can be a really sweet dog.People with allergiesThere is no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog, despite what some breeders have been saying for years. But some breeds shed less, such as curly coated breeds. As much as I love boxers and rottweilers, they are more slobbery, and some people are affected by the saliva.The officeIf you work in an office in the city and you are travelling by public transport, something smaller is better. I have seen big dogs on the London Underground, but they take up a lot of space. You also want a dog who is happy to sit around for long periods while you are sat in meetings, and is not too barky. A poodle cross or a cockapoo is a safe bet.Emotional supportYou want a really calm, steady dog, so that tends to be a bigger dog. Labradors are a good option in general and of course they’ve been used around the world as assistance dogs. Or try a St Bernard.SecurityThe obvious choice is a German shepherd, as used by police and the military. If you don’t like the barking and hair shedding that comes with those, a rottweiler can be a much calmer companion. But I think there needs to be a bit of a caveat, which is if you want to train a dog to be a guard dog, have a word with yourself.Aswimming companionPoodles, which were bred to retrieve game across water, or a Spanish or Portuguese water dog.A running buddyBorder collies – they will run for ever.Explore more on these topicsDogsThe Guardian guide to living with dogsAnimalsPetsShareReuse this content"

Seven all-in-one recipes testedThe duchess’s skillet spaghetti outraged purists, but there’s no shortage of single-pot pasta dishes to try. Here are some that make the grade, and others that most certainly don’tTim DowlingSun 27 Apr 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 06.31 EDTShareSadly, we cannot return to a more innocent age before the first episode of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’sNetflixcookery show, with its recipe for one-pan pasta. This was a time when typing the words “skillet spaghetti controversy” into Google produced no significant matches. Now those three words are inextricably linked.To recap: Meghan piled uncooked spaghetti and other raw ingredients into a shallow pan, poured boiling water from a kettle over them and cooked them with a lid on. Some of the attendant controversies were: the dish was unforgivably bland; the recipe may not have been Meghan’s alone; Italians, inevitably, consider skillet spaghetti to be a heresy. Subsequently a lot of people recreated Meghan’s version and, in a backlash against the backlash, pronounced it pretty good.I question the idea that one-pan spaghetti represents some great triumph of convenience. A traditional spaghetti dish may be a two-pan recipe, but one of those pans contains only boiling water, salt and spaghetti. It’s not difficult, and it takes 11 minutes tops.But there are plenty of other one-pan pasta dishes out there, some wholly non-heretical. I tried making seven of them.A technical note: the US is the white-hot centre of the one-pan pasta obsession, so most of these recipes use US cup measurements. You can translate by using 240ml to a cup, but I usually just pick a random tea mug, call it a cup, and eyeball the fractions.Another note: all one-pan pasta recipes inevitably call for what seems a preposterous volume of liquid – it can feel as if you’re making soup. You just need to be confident the pasta will soak it up. Sometimes, I have discovered, this confidence is misplaced.Orecchiette with white beans and spinach(Good Housekeeping)View image in fullscreenOff to a good start … orecchiette with white beans and spinach.Photograph: Tim DowlingSaute four minced cloves of garlic in olive oil in a casserole pot, add four mugfuls of water into which a vegetable stock cube has been dissolved, then throw in half a bag of orecchiette with some chopped thyme. Simmer until done. With the heat still on chuck in a tin of white beans, drained and rinsed, a bag of baby spinach and some grated parmesan, about 45g, some black pepper, and stir for a couple of minutes. I did not have high hopes for this recipe, but it turned out to be not only palatable, but ready in under 15 minutes. Things were off to a surprisingly good start.Skillet spaghetti carbonara(Recipe Girl)View image in fullscreenA little gloopy, but not bad … skillet spaghetti carbonara.Photograph: Tim DowlingThe best way to make carbonara already exercises the minds of culinary purists, so a method for cooking the whole thing in a single skillet seems destined to stir up trouble. As with Meghan’s recipe, you’ll need a skillet big enough to accommodate dried spaghetti. Then put some olive oil in it, fry some bacon or pancetta on medium heat and put aside when crispy.Next add minced garlic to the pan (I know there’s no garlic in a real carbonara). Saute for less than a minute before adding white wine, chicken stock (I know) and water – just under a litre and a half in total – and 340g dried spaghetti. Turn the heat up until boiling and cook until the pasta is tender – a bit longer than normal, possibly up to 18 minutes – stirring often.View image in fullscreenThe lot in a pot … skillet spaghetti carbonara in progress.Photograph: Tim DowlingOnce it’s done take it off the heat and whisk in two whole eggs that have been beaten with 80ml of double cream (yes, I know) and 60g of grated parmesan. Really, it should be pecorino, but it’s no use being doctrinaire at this point. It’s in askillet.To be fair I’ve had worse carbonaras than this one – in fact I’ve had worse carbonaras in restaurants. It’s a bit gloopier than it should be, but using slightly less water would probably remedy that. Is it better than a traditional carbonara? No. Is it easier? No. But this is probably how I would make it if I was camping.Mushroom and Swiss chard pasta(How Sweet Eats)View image in fullscreenJust fine … mushroom and Swiss chard pasta.Photograph: Tim DowlingI chose this recipe because I happened to have a lot of chard on my hands, and it seemed like an easy way to use it up. It’s possible – allegedly – to slap all the ingredients into a pot, pour water on top, cook for 10 minutes and have it ready to eat, but I took the sensible precaution of sauteing the mushroom and garlic in the butter for a few minutes first. The recommended pasta shape here is gemelli. I used a near-lookalike – casarecce – but any short pasta should work.The result is … fine. Like a lot of these recipes, it tastes of less than the sum of its parts – which figures when you’re dumping a load of water over the ingredients early on in the proceedings. There’s a good idea for a two-pan pasta dish here. I wish I’d made that.Greek baked orzo(Pinch of Yum)View image in fullscreenTasty enough … Greek baked orzo.Photograph: Tim DowlingI was well into adulthood before I learned that orzo was a small form of pasta, rather than a large form of rice. Because of the residual embarrassment I don’t buy it often, but it’s a sound choice for one-pan meals, because it cooks quickly and therefore doesn’t give the other ingredients time to go soggy while submerged. This dish is prepared in a large pan that can then go in the oven, so make sure you own such a thing.After softening some chopped onions in a pan on the hob, add in two minced cloves of garlic, some chilli flakes, dried oregano and salt, four handfuls of chopped kale (I used chard instead, because I still had a lot left and I hate kale). When the greens are wilted add three tablespoons of tomato paste, a tin of tomatoes, a tin of chickpeas (drained and rinsed), one cup or half a bag of orzo and about 600ml of vegetable stock. Stir, bring to a simmer and stick it in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes at 200C. Serve topped with cubes of feta, fresh dill if you’ve got any and a squeeze of lemon.The result is quite heavy but tasty enough. I’d recommend halving all the amounts. A big skillet of this is way too much, even for four people.Pasta e fagioli(Simply Recipes)View image in fullscreenThumbs up … pasta e fagioli.Photograph: Tim DowlingA safe bet – a traditional Italian one-pan meal with many variations, but almost certainly containing carrot, onion, celery, garlic, tinned tomatoes and borlotti or cannellini beans. As a meal, pasta e fagioli lies somewhere between a pasta dish and a soup, so it’s amazingly forgiving. Sweat chopped onions, carrot and celery. Add garlic and chilli flakes, cook for another minute or so, add a tin of tomatoes and about 1.4 litres of chicken stock. Bring to a low boil and add 225g of pasta – ditalini is recommended, but the closest I could come up with was mezzi rigatoni, which is rigatoni cut in half.When the pasta is done add a tin of drained, rinsed cannellini beans and a handful of parsley, and warm through. Of all the dishes I made, this is the only one my wife had a good word to say about, but then she wouldn’t even try three of the seven.Pasta e ceci(Bon Appétit)Pasta e fagioli’s chickpea-based cousin, in a one-pot version that uses tinned chickpeas and a squid ring-shaped pasta called calamarata.This can be hard to source, but again, any short pasta will work, even – at a pinch – smashed-up lasagne sheets. Chances are you have everything you need to make it already, and it takes 20 minutes.Heat some oil in a big pot and saute one chopped onion, then three minced cloves of garlic, followed by a tin of rinsed chickpeas, lightly bashing up about a quarter of them with the edge of a wooden spoon (it will release starch to make the sauce thicker). Throw in some chilli flakes, a bit of salt and a sprig or two of rosemary – don’t bother chopping it up.Saute until the rosemary goes bendy before adding in one tin of tomatoes – chopped or whole. Reduce for about five minutes. Pour in a litre of water, bring to a simmer and throw in the pasta – again, about half the bag or box, say 250g. Once it’s cooked, finish with parmesan, chopped parsley and serve. I love this.One-bowl microwave macaroni cheese(The Kitchn)View image in fullscreenThin, gluey, tasteless … microwave macaroni cheese gets started.Photograph: Tim DowlingYou’re supposed to be able to produce a passable single serving of macaroni cheese in a microwave, from equal volumes of dried macaroni and water (half a mugful each, say) and half as much of milk, a fistful of shredded cheddar and a pinch of salt. I realise this already doesn’t sound like a good idea. Spoiler alert: it isn’t.The idea is you microwave the macaroni, salt and water in a bowl for two minutes at a time, stirring in between, until the macaroni is cooked. This could take 10 minutes or more (it took me 14) depending on your microwave. Then you add the milk and cheese, stirring some more while microwaving in 30-second bursts until you’re satisfied it’s never going to get any better than it looks – probably two minutes.The result was thin, gluey and tasteless, and the macaroni had an unfortunate, licorice-like texture. It could be my fault – I may have made a mistake somewhere along the line – but I’m not going to try this again.

Now, initiating intimacy makes her feel powerful and liberatedHow do you do it? Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Naomi Larsson PiñedaSun 27 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShareAmelia, 35I’m heartbroken for my young self and angry at how much fear I had around feeling sexualI grew up in an evangelical Christian community and there was a huge emphasis placed on saving sex until marriage. From a young age, I believed I had to save this precious part of myself if I wanted to remain “pure”.I don’t align myself with that faith any more, but the complications of that culture have stayed with me until quite recently. It built a foundation of shame and fear around sex that I’ve struggled with for most of my life. I didn’t discover my clitoris or know what an orgasm was until I was 24.I met Ben 10 years ago, and he said he loved me after a few weeks. I told him: “I’m still a virgin, I grew up in a Christian family and it’s something I’m still wrestling with.” I could see his eyes getting wider. But he said he would wait. I was blown away.I felt comfortable with oral and using hands to experience pleasure, but we didn’t have penetrative sex until we married four years later. I was so scared that if I had premarital sex the shame would eat me up and destroy my relationship. When I look back, I’m so heartbroken for that young woman and angry at how much fear I had around feeling sexual and embracing my femininity.I wanted sex because I was in charge – it was a reframing of power and I felt liberatedThat disconnection with my sexuality meant that when we were married, I found myself not wanting to have sex much. I felt indifferent towards this thing I’d waited my whole life for, which was very confusing. Ben would have to initiate, and I think he became really concerned about that. All of a sudden, this anger stirred up in me because I’d grown up believing that, as a woman, my body was not my own.When I spoke to Ben, we decided that, for a period of time, only I would initiate sex. Straight away, something changed in me; I wanted to have sex because I was in charge. It was a simple reframing of power and I felt liberated. I went to a sex shop, and got some sexy underwear. We now watch ethical porn together and use toys. For the last couple of years, I have felt comfortable in my sexuality and excited to include other elements in our sex life. I feel free from embarrassment and shame, which I’m so grateful for.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I’d done a lot of experimentation as a teenager, so when we began dating sex wasn’t as much of a priority. Of course it was something I loved to do, but I didn’t mind that we didn’t have penetrative sex straight away. It wasn’t an issue at all. Amelia is five years older than me, and very clever and gorgeous. I just really fell in love with her.When she told me about her background I was a bit shocked. I didn’t know anyone who had waited for marriage before having sex. But I was more concerned that she was experiencing that trauma from her past.I’d experimented as a teenager, so when we began dating sex wasn’t as much of a priorityBefore we got married we were having sex without penetration, which we called hanky-panky. We both explored pleasure through touching, so I was honestly sexually satisfied. I got my orgasms, and she had hers. I enjoyed that it was new for her and, in many ways, it was also new for me because I had never had sex without penetration, so it was still very exciting.The only time I became frustrated about our sex life was after we got married. Amelia didn’t feel lust any more. As soon as we were allowed to do it, it was like the excitement went away and she didn’t want to have sex with me. I felt that I was always the one initiating it, and it made me feel bad about myself. We were having normal, even boring, sex because she didn’t want to do much. I didn’t love that, but I never wanted her to feel pressured – I just wanted to be physically close to her and touch her, as that’s my love language.Things are much better now. We have sex three times a week, sometimes more, and it’s very passionate. Amelia has her power back. We’re very content.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Roughly chop the tomatoes; if using tinned, save the juice.View image in fullscreen4 Start cookingView image in fullscreenPut a wide pan for which you have a lidon a medium-high heat, toast the coriander seeds until aromatic, then tip out on to a small plate.Pour in half the oil, fry the cumin and nigella seeds for a few seconds and, when they start to pop, add the potatoes and saute until lightly golden (they don’t need to be cooked through just yet).View image in fullscreen5 Fry the cauliflowerView image in fullscreenUsing a slotted spoon, scoop the potatoes into a large bowl, leaving as much oil as possible behind in the pan, then saute the cauliflower, frying just to colour it slightly.Scoop into the potato bowl (if you’re using the leaves, shred them, saute them separately until wilted, then put in a different bowl from the florets and stalk).6 Start on the sauceView image in fullscreenTurn down the heat a little, add the remaining oil and fry the onion until softened but not browned. While the onion is cooking, grind the coriander seeds. Add the garlic and ginger paste to the hot pan, fry, stirring, for a couple of minutes, then stir in the ground coriander, chilli and turmeric, and cook for 30 seconds or so.7 Finish the sauceView image in fullscreenTip in the tomatoes (and tomato puree, if using) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil starts to separate out from the sauce and bead around the edges of the pan, and the sauce thickens slightly. Meanwhile, slit the fresh chillies down their length (finger chillies can be quite hot, so adjust the number according to your liking for heat).8 Cover and cook for half an hourReturn the potatoes and cauliflower to the pan, add the fresh chillies and salt, stir to coat everything with the sauce, then bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat, cover and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, until both the spuds and cauliflower are tender. Stir occasionally, to make sure it doesn’t catch, and add a splash of water if it threatens to do so.View image in fullscreen9 Finishing touchesTake the pan off the heat, stir in the methi and garam masala, plus the sauteed cauliflower leaves, if you have any, and leave the rest, still covered, for 10 minutes. Stir in the lime juice and check the seasoning, adjusting as necessary, then decant into a large bowl. Chop the coriander, scatter over the top and serve with rice or flatbreads.Explore more on these topicsCurryFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodVegetablesPotatoesTomatoesIndian food and drinkVegan food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

First, it reinforces the message that being fat is bad, thereby perpetuating stigma, instilling a belief that only some body types are acceptable, and eliciting fear around weight gain. Second, it focuses on bigger bodies being the problem, rather than name-calling and stigmatising behaviour. And third, it insinuates that you can’t be fat and beautiful.Instead, you might say: “That sounds so hurtful. What was that like for you?” or “What do you think they meant by that?” to help validate their feelings before encouraging self-acceptance by saying something like: “Sometimes people say hurtful things because they’re struggling with their own feelings. Or, they might just be repeating harmful things they’ve heard about bodies without really thinking. Remember, all bodies are good bodies, and being in a bigger or smaller body doesn’t make someone better or worse. What matters is how we treat ourselves and others.”These type of conversations help promote emotional intelligence, critical thinking, self-compassion and coping skills (all of which underpin self-acceptance). They also invite valuable discussions about natural body diversity, beauty standards, and how others’ words are reflective of their own biases and coping mechanisms, not an objective truth.If you discover it’syourkid who has been doing the fat-calling, explore what happened with empathy and curiosity. Was it a neutral observation, like calling someone tall, or brunette? Or was it intended as an insult? What were they thinking or feeling at the time? There may be signs they’re adopting body-shaming attitudes from their environment, which need addressing.If you realise those attitudes have come from you, be compassionate with yourself. You have been embedded in a diet culture that reveres thinness and demonises fatness, and this conditioning will take some mindful undoing. Surround yourself with people, books, podcasts and resources that affirm self-acceptance (communities such asHealthat Every Size can be really helpful).‘Daddy, am Ihandsome?’It’s a reality that physical attractiveness, especially when it conforms to societal beauty standards, can affect how adults and peers interact with children. Research indicates that kids as young as three can develop anti-fat biases from their surroundings. Being considered attractive often feels integral to kids’ sense of social acceptance and peer approval. It’s therefore our job to buffer this by amplifying the value of non-appearance-based qualities and what our bodies can do beyond the way they look.Questions such as: “Am I handsome?” or “Am I pretty?” are an opportunity not only to learn more about what matters to your child and how they’re feeling, but also to reinforce the intrinsic qualities they possess, promoting a more stable sense of self-worth. You might respond with, “You are beautiful inside and out! But what matters most to me is how kind, thoughtful and curious you are.”‘Please, please can I have that serum? I need it!’Makeup, skincare and supplement products aimed at kids are now big business. Companies recognise that individuals who experience shame or dissatisfaction with themselves tend to buy more, so it’s not in their best interest to promote self-acceptance.Children will naturally want to emulate their role models, including their parents, so it’s beneficial to validate their curiosity about using these products by saying something like: “I love how curious you are, and I can see you’re excited about trying new things.”If you have a younger child who wants to try makeup, remind them that some products are intended for adults and older children only. However, there may be suitable, age-appropriate alternatives for them to try that you can emphasise are for fun, sensory experience and creativity rather than meeting beauty standards. These might include face paints, lip balm or glitter gel.When it comes to skincare products, explain to your child that, like brushing your teeth, taking care of your skin is about maintaining your health, not just appearance. Their skin is young and sensitive, so using too many products can be harmful; therefore, they need to treat their skin gently. This might include helping them choose an age-appropriate cleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen.‘Do I need protein shakes to get hench?’For boys, the lean, muscular idealised body standard depicted by the media and fitness culture often makes protein supplementation and gym workouts appealing. You can encourage their interest in building strength and taking care of their body, while also providing reassurance that most people can meet their nutritional needs without the need for supplements.Given that boys also struggle with body image concerns, it’s key to also emphasise that boys and men come in all shapes and sizes, encouraging self-acceptance and self-care over rigid physical standards.‘Mummy, is this food bad for me?’Thinking about how you talk about food is another way parents can support a healthy body image. Start by avoiding language that labels foods as good or bad, and resist the urge to heavily restrict specific foods. When a food is demonised or limited, kids tend to covet it more, and are more likely to experience guilt and shame when they do eat it. All foods can be part of a healthy diet, and the more variety kids are offered, the more likely their intuition about what their body really needs will remain intact.Speaking neutrally about all food types doesn’t mean you should give your kids free rein to eat exactly what they want all of the time. However, it does mean offering a variety of foods whenever possible and allowing your child to choose how much of each provided food type they would like.As outlined in thedivision of responsibility modelby dietitian Ellyn Satter, your job is to decide when, what and where your children are offered food, providing regular meals and snacks; your kid’s job is to decide whether to eat each food type, and how much of it they want to consume.Dr Charlotte Ord’s new bookBody Confident You, Body Confident Kidis published by BluebirdExplore more on these topicsBody imageHealthHealth & wellbeingChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But privately, Lib Dem activists say it could move into no overall control next week.“I think it feels even better than the general election,” Davey said, truffles cooling in a fridge before he headed off for some door-knocking. And this, remember, was the Lib Dems’ best general electionfor a century, in which – helped in part by Davey’s succession ofcamera-friendly stunts– the party won 72 seats, mostly from the Conservatives.With much of the focus before the local elections on Reform UK’s rise and the impact this could have on Labour, the Lib Dems have just been, as one party strategist called it, “getting on with the job”.Part of this is the sheer graft so admired by Farage that he wants to use it as a model for Reform, with 500,000 doors knocked on during March, and 1m leaflets delivered before election spending limits kicked in.Kemi Badenoch says Lib Dems are people who fix church roofs. Yes: that’s why we’re popular and she isn‘t | Ed DaveyRead moreBut also to the Lib Dems’ advantage is that many of next Thursday’s battles take place in traditionally Conservative counties, where the Tories won heavily amid the brief if spectacular Boris Johnson vaccine bounce of 2021, the last time they were contested.According to Davey, the general election trend of less ideologically minded Conservative voters fleeing a party they see as overly weighted towards populism and culture wars has shown no signs of slowing under Badenoch.“People who were lifelong Conservatives haven’t forgiven them, they’re not impressed by the leader, and some are put off by this talk ofsome sort of arrangement with Reform,” he said.View image in fullscreenEd Davey helping local campaigners maintain a chalk stream of the River Chess in Chesham, Buckinghamshire.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThings are not entirely the same as they were last July, however. One paradox of the spectacular general election result is that in some places, including Warwickshire, the Lib Dems have reversed their usual tactic of patiently building up a mass of councillors before making a tilt at the parliamentary seat.Instead, as in Warwickshire, they hope to use a surprise parliamentary win – Perteghella overcame a 20,000 Conservative majority to win by 7,000 votes – to create momentum for the council.Plus there is the advent of some early Lib Dem-Reform battles, notably for the new mayoralty in Hull and East Yorkshire. While Davey is making no predictions, he is scornful about Farage’s success thus far in building up a Lib Dem-style on-the-ground army.“This is just anecdotal, but Reform have tried door-knocking one or two places, and they got such a hostile reception from quite a lot of doors, they quickly give up. So they’re not fighting the campaign that we do.”But the bulk of the party’s targets of councils to potentially win – Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Devon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire – or to make gains, such as Warwickshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, are still mainly in the once Tory-loyal commuter belt areas loosely known as the “blue wall”.Davey, who gets recognised more regularly on doorsteps after hisbungee jumping and water sliding of the general election, faces a Conservative party that seems vastly more focused on tackling Reform than trying to win back the voters and seats taken by the Lib Dems.Asked if he is surprised at this, Davey said: “Well, not really, given the MPs they’ve got. All the moderate Conservatives, the liberal conservatives, one-nation Conservatives, pro-European Conservatives, they’ve all gone.”In their place are people such as Badenoch, who memorably dismissed the Lib Dems as people who spurn social media to instead focus on “fixing their church roof”, a quote party insiders delightedly say could not have been phrased better if they had written it themselves.“The Conservatives are in a bit of a bubble, aren’t they?” Davey said. “They’re talking to themselves. They’re certainly not listening to the public. It’s the fact that they inhabit an X-sphere, if you like, a Twitter-sphere.”While some Tories argue that a pact with Reform would instantly give this new rightwing block a combined vote share well over 40%, Lib Dem insiders say they are unworried, saying any deal would make the Conservatives even more toxic to many voters, and inspire fervent tactical voting to keep them out.“They will decide what they want to do about a pact, but I think there would be a huge number of traditional Conservatives who would be appalled at that process,” Davey said. “I think they would look round for a different home, and see theLiberal Democratsas that home.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsLocal electionsEd DaveyLocal governmentLocal politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than developing more complex toxins for a wide variety of potential prey, as the researchers assumed, the rattlesnakes were instead producing simpler venoms containing fewer and more focused venoms.The findings indicate that, over time, the snakes were finely tuning their venom for more specific prey. The revelation challenges longstanding ideas about evolution and offers fresh insight into how species adapt naturally in habitats fragmented by geography, human activity or natural disasters.“This isn’t just about rattlesnakes, it’s about understanding the fundamental ways life evolves when isolation and biodiversity start to shift,” said Mark Margres, assistant professor at USF’sdepartment of integrative biology.“We expected that snakes in areas with more biodiversity would have more complex venoms because they’re eating more of that available diversity. Studying a trait that can rapidly evolve and reflect the biodiversity of that habitat patch is really powerful.View image in fullscreenAgua Verde Bay on the Sea of Cortés in Baja California Sur, Mexico.Photograph: VW Pics/Universal Images Group/Getty Images“Habitat fragmentation is like breaking apart a completed puzzle. A healthy, intact ecosystem is like a 1,000-piece puzzle where every piece is in place, you can clearly see the full picture. But when you start fragmenting it, pieces go missing or get rearranged, and the image becomes distorted. That distortion represents the disruption of ecosystem function.”Samuel Hirst, a USF doctoral student who helped organize the expeditions with the National Geographic Society, conservation partners inMexico, and the Mexican government, said the islands were a perfect habitat for the study.“The Baja California islands are pristine and largely untouched by human activity, making them an extraordinary place to study evolutionary processes in isolation,” he said.“We initially hypothesized that the larger islands would be associated with more complex venoms, however we found the opposite pattern. This unexpected result suggests that factors such as competition or ecological specialization may be at play, opening exciting avenues for future research.”Margres added that rattlesnake venom had been shown to evolve rapidly.“Evolution typically requires many generations, and all of these changes, the most severe human impacts, are happening right now,” he said.“We don’t want to wait 20, 100, 1,000 years from now to understand the evolutionary consequences.”View image in fullscreenA rattlesnake in Isla Santa Catalina, Baja California Sur, Mexico.Photograph: VWPics/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe USF research waspublished this weekin Evolution, part of the Oxford University Press’s academic research platform.In all, the team captured and released 83 rattlesnakes, the largest 4ft in length, belonging to four separate species, speckled, red diamond, Baja California and south-western speckled. The snakes were stimulated to bite on special sample collection cups and the venoms dried and analyzed.Margres said that the next steps in his team’s research would be to look at the snake’s blood.“Our next question is whether we see the same thing at the genetic level,” he said.“When we catch these rattlesnakes we measure them, we see what sex they are, we collect a venom sample, but we also collect a blood sample.“Unlike mammals, reptiles have nucleated blood cells and that means they have a ton of DNA. We’ll look at the genomes of each of these individual snakes and see if genetic diversity shows similar patterns.“In conservation biology we want to maintain or increase genetic variation for endangered species, because things like inbreeding can have really dire consequences, so we want to see things like island area, do they also predict genetic diversity, not just venom diversity?”"

He trusted no politicians, no organized religion and definitely no strangers knocking unannounced.Lately, his words echo louder than ever.In California, where I teach at university, the year began with wildfires. They’re out now, but there is no containment for the political blaze sweeping through higher education. One after another,Donald Trump’s executive orders have scorched the landscape: slashing funding, silencing communication, terminating grants, capping research.Each one feeds the fire. As Trump remarked in his address to Congress, he’s “just getting started”.So between grading papers and making dinner, the real questions linger: will I still have a job next year? Will my department survive? Will my students be safe? Will my work be banned for using words likedisabilityorinequality?These questions aren’t paranoid. They’re familiar.They’re the same kinds of questions my father asked himself in 1975 before fleeingChilefor the US, trading a brutal dictatorship for freedom.The speed and ease with which words like “purge”, “erasure” and “forced removal” have flooded our lexicon, crammed into news updates about attacks on minority groups and immigrants, brings to mind 11 September 1973.Though I wasn’t born yet, that day lives beneath my skin as one of Chile’s daughters. On that day, the military overthrew the democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, and ushered in a 17-year dictatorship under Gen Augusto Pinochet.View image in fullscreenSoldiers burn Marxist books and leaflets in downtown Santiago on 23 September 1973.Photograph: APThe new regime tortured and murdered thousands of Allende supporters. And because Pinochet feared free speech and a free press, public debate and intellectual freedoms, he specifically targeted writers, academics, students and artists.Authoritarian regimes always do.Now consider what’s happening today to thoseon Trump’s growing enemy list. This includes the recently detained Palestinian activist and legal permanent residentMahmoud Khalilat Columbia University, my alma mater. Trump hasn’t even tried to hide his desire for retribution; instead, he vowed that Khalil’s arrest would be the first of “many to come”.Since then, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, hasrevoked 300 scholars’ visasand federal agents have detained at least a dozen students and professors, often without clarity on charges or alleged crimes other than protesting and speaking out.The case of the Tufts doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk– arrested in broad daylight by plainclothes Ice agents – stands out for me. Her only known offense was co-authoring an op-ed in the campus newspaper that criticized the university’s response to students’ demands to divest from companies with ties to Israel over the Gaza conflict.Some ideas are now deemed so dangerous they must be erased, free speech be damned.View image in fullscreenWith the thought police now in full force inmycountry –ourcountry – I can’t help but think of the killing of Víctor Jara, the Chilean singer-songwriter oftendubbedthe Bob Dylan of Chile. His curly hair, olive skin and Mapuche features so resemble my father’s that I tear up watching black-and-white performances ofEl Derecho de Vivir en Paz(The Right to Live in Peace).Born into an impoverished peasant family and a fierce supporter of working-class and Indigenous people, he threaded their stories into song. “We’ve had enough of that music that doesn’t speak to us, that entertains us only for a moment, but leaves us empty,” he said. “We began to create a new kind of song. It was music that was born out of total necessity.”Jara was closely aligned with Allende’s leftistPopular Unitycoalition, even rewriting the lyrics to its anthem,Venceremos(We Shall Prevail), which made him a prime target for the opposition.Like many workers, Jara responded to Allende’s call on the morning of 11 September to occupy their workplaces in defiance of the unfolding coup. As a professor at the State Technical University, he went to campus. Despite a strict curfew – anyone found on the streets risked being shot – hundreds of students and faculty sought refuge in university buildings, which were later shelled by tanks and raked with machine gun fire.A survivor, Osiel Núñez Quevado, recalled in adocumentary: “Without absolutely no warning, they began machine-gunning the university’s central building. They got everybody out, putting professors and students on the floor with hands on their heads. There among them, was Víctor.”Pinochet’s forces found Jara’s message so threatening that when he was identified among the prisoners brought to Estadio Chile – the stadium later turned into a detention center and renamed to honor the singer’s memory – he was singled out for torture in an especially cruel way.Soldiers broke his hands and wrists, thentaunted himto play his guitar and sing. Badly beaten and bloodied, in the two hours before his death he secured a pen and paper from a friend and gathered the strength to write his final song,Estadio Chile.He defiantly performed Venceremos before his captors killed him with a gunshot to the head, further riddling his body with44 bullet woundsbefore dumping his corpse in the street.View image in fullscreenA riot policeman fires teargas at demonstrators demanding an end to Chile’s military government, in Santiago in September 1983.Photograph: Bettmann/Getty ImagesSuch brutality, forever seared into the consciousness of Chileans like my father, has shaped generations across national borders, thousands of miles, and decades. The ghosts of a decimated democracy haunted Dad’s nightmares, and they continue to haunt me.When I turned 18, my father actively discouraged me from voting, fearing that my name could end up on a list used against me one day, that I could be killed like one oflos desaparecidos –the thousands of Chileans who wereabducted by state forcesduring Pinochet’s rule, never to be seen again.The deeper I dig into history, the more parallels I uncover between then and now.I recently learned about Chile’sfailed coupin June 1973, which eerily resembles the January 6 assault on the US Capitol. Riding on growing discontent within the military, Lt Col Roberto Souper launched an unsuccessful attempt against Allende. Though poorly coordinated, it served as a kind of dress rehearsal, helping the military understand the conditions necessary for success in a future attempt.Fifty years on: the lasting tragedy of Chile’s coupRead moreThe commander-in-chief of the Chilean army, Gen Carlos Prats, helped squelch the rebellion. But by August, having lost the military’s support, Prats resigned and personally recommended his replacement: his second-in-command, Pinochet. (The following year, while in exile, Prats and his wife Sofía were killed in a car bombing in Buenos Aires, carried out by Chile’s secret police.)Pinochet swiftly pardoned those arrested during the failed coup attempt – mostly men from various branches of the military – and assigned them to guard the Estadio Nacional, where so many were tortured and killed.The similarities are impossible to ignore: a failed insurrection, full pardons for the perpetrators, and ensuing vengeance.As the attorney Almudena Bernabéuobserves, “Dictatorial regimes are fueled by arrogance and by the ability to deny that their power will ever end.”View image in fullscreenEmboldened and once again in power, Trump’s ire threatens most of the American public, save for a small segment of wealthy oligarchs.And just as in Chile, wherepoverty soaredin the dictatorship years, the most vulnerable Trump voters will suffer most from rising prices and cuts to crucial social safety net programs.Allende’s wide-ranging platform had promised to alleviate extreme inequality, at a time when28.5% of Chileans lived in poverty. He had pursued a number of reforms including increasing wages, providing free milk to poor children and nationalizing the copper industry. He won a close race, after having garnered nearly37%of the vote, partly thanks toworker and peasant turnout.But his victory came at a time of extreme political polarization and foreign interference. TheNational Security Archivecontains a trove of documents exposing the US government’s efforts to eradicate the perceived communist threat by attempting to prevent Allende’s win and then undermining his presidency with anti-leftist propaganda and economic encroachment to destabilize the country.Severe inflation and scarcity had left people like my father – an intended beneficiary of Allende’s policies – disgruntled. His frustrations help me understand the deep dissatisfaction and distrust felt by the large swathes of midwestern voters who supported Trump.Dad had never graduated from high school. He had toiled in nitrate mines in the Atacama desert, loaded cargo on ships, hauled trash in buildings – dirty jobs that left his hands calloused and his psyche bruised – eventually securing a union job as an elevator operator and later doorman.He would often recount his dissatisfaction with Allende, given long food lines and the exorbitant prices for black market goods, andhad been especially stung by the indignity of a waiter at a “nice” restaurant handing him newspaper to wipe his hands instead of napkins.Between the lack of economic opportunity, especially for those like Dad born into the working class, and the violence and repression during the dictatorship, my father emigrated in 1975. He joked: “I left because I wanted to be rich.”Chile’s right wing capitalized on growing discontent, organizing the 1971 protestMarch of Empty Pots and Pans, which, according to aCIA memorandum, “drew more support from angry Chilean housewives than had been anticipated even by the sponsors”.View image in fullscreenThe Chilean dictator Gen Augusto Pinochet addresses supporters in a downtown Santiago theater in May 1984.Photograph: Bettmann/Getty ImagesArtists, writers and intellectuals continued to offer Allendestrong support, including Chile’s celebrated poet Pablo Neruda, his friend and adviser. Nerudadied just 12 days after the coup, before he could seek refuge in Mexico, prompting therecently confirmed speculationthat he had been poisoned.This is Pinochet’s legacy: layers and layers of horrific secrets that are still being unveiled, which might explain why Dad urged me never to vote for fear of being tracked down.I had the privilege, then, of laughing off such worries. “Don’t be paranoid, Dad. They don’t keep track of who you voted for here,” I said, explaining secret ballots. He wasn’t convinced.Suddenly, Dad doesn’t seem so paranoid any more.I’ve never been good at keeping my big mouth shut. My father was a masterly kvetcher and, as a New Yorker, I consider complaining my birthright. While I enjoy commiserating as a way to connect with others, my griping also helps me search for answers, question what we take for granted, and untangle vexing puzzles.Perhaps naively, I once believed tenure would grant more academic freedom – that our right to dissent would be protected. But as we slide toward authoritarianism, the train’s moving in reverse. Instead of my horizon expanding as I near that milestone, I feel the walls closing in.Earlier in my career, when I voiced doubts, a mentor wisely cautioned: “You don’t want to twist yourself into a pretzel for a job you don’t want any more.” How far will we twist, bend, compromise, modify, avoid – or hide? One of my personal heroes, the photographer Bill Cunningham, memorably declined food and drink while working events, explaining:“Money is the cheapest thing. Liberty is the most expensive.”What price are we willing to pay for an academic job?I inherited many things from my father – his hazel eyes, his acid reflux, his politics of fear – and his stubbornness. I’ve come too far to hide now. I spent years ashamed of my socioeconomic background and ethnic surname, but I’ve come to see that what once made me feel like an outsider also sharpened my tools – especially the way I observe the world as a sociologist.And I’ve gained a deeper respect for my father’s distrust. He never returned to Chile, yet despite the pain bound up in that homeland, he held on to a fierce love for it –he never burned the bridge back. That bridge may one day provide me with an escape route, thanks to my eligibility for Chilean residency through him.Dad’s lifelong fear kept him metaphorically sleeping with one eye open, always listening for danger in the distance. Now, it’s helping me prepare for a new era of terror. I will still vote. I will still speak my mind – because he often couldn’t. But I’m no longer naive about the repercussions.Lately, I’ve caught myself practicing the words:“I was once a college professor.”It’s been a meaningful ride, but if it ends, so be it. I’d rather say,“I used to be a college professor”than“I once stood up for my beliefs and values.”Because what good is all this education if I haven’t learned the most important lesson?In that case, I might as well light the match myself.Stacy Torresis an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, San Francisco, and author ofAt Home in the City: Growing Old in Urban America.Spot illustrations by Angelica Alzona."

Mahogany-coloured shelves are stacked with pots containing beans from Ethiopia, Java, India, alongside bric-a-brac, such as vintage tea tins and old master-style pictures.But in less than two months, the sun will set for good on this cosy shop in Amsterdam, which was founded in 1642. For the owner, the rent is just too high.Velder, an energetic 76-year-old, who took over the business 26 years ago from an English family, paid 975 guilders (about €440 or £376) rent a month in 1999. Now she expects a monthly bill of up to €4,500, backdated to last September, after a legal dispute with her landlord. That was reduced from €6,000 by an independent arbiter, but still represents a hefty increase on the €3,000 she pays now.“It makes me sick, that’s all I can say,” she said over a cup of Ceylon tea. Traditional shops, she said, “are all dying” because of soaring rents.View image in fullscreenThe shop has sold tea on Haarlemmerdijk since the 17th century.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianSince the Amsterdam-based newspaper Het Paroolrevealed the closure last week, she said she had received a huge response from customers – “love, only love”.As another independent shop closes, fears are growing that the city will be increasingly dominated by chain stores and shops catering to tourists.Johannes Wilhelm, a 63-year-old local businessman, who had cycled over for some lapsang souchong, described ‘t Zonnetje’s imminent disappearance as a real pity. “There are a lot of cheese and Nutella-pancakes and all kinds of tourist shops. Tourists are fine [and] good. But this should be here as well,” he said.Rents have been growing in the “most sought after high street retail locations” across the Netherlands, according toone market analyst.Although the future of the shop site is uncertain, Karel Loeff, the director of the conservation organisation Heemschut, has observed that higher rents tend to mean bigger companies with more standardised offers move in when sole traders move out.Founded in 1642, the shop on Haarlemmerdijk began by selling herbs, coal and buckets of water, but as the Dutch empire prospered it offered tea and coffee.In the modern shop, Velder makes Earl Grey in the chilly basement by steeping Assam leaves in bergamot for three days, a blend that took two and a half years to perfect. She once sold 350 varieties of tea, but her offer is sharply reduced as she runs down her stock.View image in fullscreenVelder feels she has no choice but to close the shop and move on after 26 years.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianLoeff said preserving living heritage – one of the aims of Heemschut – was very hard.“We can preserve the wooden beams and shelves … but we can’t preserve a function. We can’t say this is an original tea shop and you should preserve this for the future.”Local shops run by private owners for decades “are what make cities unique”, he continued. “If you push them away and you only have standard brands and shops, the attractiveness of the city disappears.”Amsterdam has been grappling for years with how to preserve its heritage in the face of increasing numbers of homogenous chain stores and tourist-friendly novelty shops selling sweets or rubber ducks in the historic centre. In 2017, the city government announced that retailers catering mainly to tourists, such as bike-rental companies or cheese shops,would be prevented from openingin parts of the city centre.Iris Hagemans, an urban geographer at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, cautioned about generalising. Amsterdam has places where tourism has created a “monoculture in the shopping landscape”, she said, citing the congested central Damstraat. But just a few hundred metres away “the atmosphere is completely different” and shops confronted with dwindling demand from residents and competition from online shopping are benefiting from tourist footfall. “I think this monoculture is sometimes portrayed as a kind of oil spill that will eventually spread throughout the city, but the effect is much more local.”Renowned Dutch tulip garden makes space for selfie generation to bloomRead moreGovernment support for independent businesses, such as intervention to control commercial rents, was a tricky area, she said. “There can be quite a big gap between the type of shops that people claim to want to see in their neighbourhood and … the kind of shop that they actually frequent … I think there’s a risk there of supporting a function for which there is not really a demand.”Hagemans favours government action to protect basic needs, such as access to healthy food, healthcare and other essential services, but cautions against the state as an arbiter of taste. “The retail landscape should be able to respond to the market and be dynamic. And it’s democratic in the way that you vote with your wallet.”Down the road from ‘t Zonnetje, near a pizza joint and lemonade shop, a banner has gone up tomark the 750th anniversary of Amsterdam, which falls in October. Velder has heard there are plans afoot to support small business owners in this anniversary year, “but it is too late for me”.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they’re not wielding Top Trumps, Pokemon, superheroes or sports stars.Instead, the faces on the cards belong to real people – local men over a certain age whose competing professional qualities determine the outcome of each game. There is Hiroyuki Fukushima, a former train driver; Fumiaki Kawai, a retired robotics expert; and even Kawara’s mayor, Shigekazu Tsuruga.They have all become unlikely local heroes, thanks to the “OjisanTrading Card Game”, which began as a fun distraction but is now an inspiration for other dwindling rural communities in Japan.Ojisanmeans uncle or middle-aged man.View image in fullscreenKawara schoolboys Ataru, front left, Eitaro, left, and Sasuke play a game of ojisan trading cards in Kawara.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian“It feels great when you win, but it’s even more fun when you use a card featuring someone you actually know,” says 12-year-old Sasuke, who plays about three times a week.The team behind the game are taken aback by the attention. “We’ve had visitors from Holland and Czech Republic, who came just to see the cards and buy a starter pack,” says Yuki Murakami, a town official.“We made the cards so local kids and older people would get together. We think it’s been a success. Children are really good at remembering faces, and they’ve even persuaded some of the shyer adults to become characters.”View image in fullscreenShinya Mimura, a member of the town council, appears on six separate trading cards.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianNeighbouring communities are about to launch their own versions, while trading cards have appeared in other parts of Japan, including one featuring local fishermen.“Not many people knew of Kawara, but that has changed thanks to the card game,” says Tsuruga. “It’s true we have a depopulation problem, so if the game gets people to come here, who knows, some might even decide to live here. Above all, it’s done wonders for the psychology of the town.”The cast of 22 characters, some of whom appear on more than one card, includes Mr Honda, the former head of the local fire brigade who is skilled in first aid and rescue work; soba chef Mr Takeshita, who teaches noodle-making classes; Mr Kitamura, who has never encountered a broken electrical appliance he can’t fix; and Mr Fujii, a former prison correctional officer who now works as a volunteer driver for older residents.View image in fullscreenA trading card game featuring middle-aged men has become an unlikely hit in a rural town in Japan.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianEach card carries “hit points” and “magic points”, with the owner of the most cards at the end of a game declared the winner.Eri Miyahara, secretary general of a local community council, came up with the idea of using collectible cards to bring the community together after noticing how little social interaction there was between children and older people.“I thought the card game was a fun way to introduce people to each other,” says Miyahara. “The kids read the cards very carefully and seem to remember each character’s qualities right away.”Initially intended as collectibles, the cards were turned into Pokemon-style trading cards at the urging of children who saw the competitive potential behind their disarmingly analogue pastime.View image in fullscreenFor Japan trading cards story. Eitaro, a schoolboy from Kawara, considers his options during a game.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianWhen theojisancards appeared in late 2023, Kawara was battling the same challenges faced by other rural communities – an ageing, shrinking population that was losing its sense of cohesion.Kawara’s population peaked at about 19,000 after the second world war, but has since fallen below 10,000. More than 40% of the population are aged 65 or over. Its four primary schools and two middle schools are now under the same roof, with a total of just 220 pupils.‘People even ask for my autograph’“I used a photo of each person and gave them the anime treatment, so they all look a bit like AI versions of themselves,” says Hiroe Nishiu, the cards’ designer. She made an initial batch of 100 cards, but can barely keep up with demand.Kawai, a retired employee of a robotics firm who can build just about anything once he puts his mind to it, is among the unlikely cast of Kawara heroes.“I was asked to provide a photo, but I had no idea about how I’d look on a card game,” says Kawai. “Now I come across kids and hear them say, ‘Oh look, there’s that guy on the trading cards.’ It’s made it much easier for everyone to communicate … it was nothing like that before the game appeared.”Hiroyuki Fukushima, a former train driver who does volunteer work, is similarly nonplussed by his unlikely celebrity status. “When I saw the cards for the first time, I have to admit I was a bit embarrassed,” he says. “I still feel that way. People even come up to me to ask for my autograph.”The game has been a success. Locals say more children are involved in community activities, and the invisible barriers between the generations are beginning to come down.“Take Kawai-san,” says Miyahara. “He’s done lots of amazing things with robots, but no one knew.”View image in fullscreenHiroyuki Fukushima, a former train driver, is one of 22 Kawara men who appear in the ojisan trading card game.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianKawai, Fukushima and Shinya Mimura, a multitalented member of the town council who appears on no fewer than six different cards, joke that the game has spawned friendly rivalries, even though the game itself tries to be as egalitarian as it is competitive.“It’s not like one character is dramatically stronger than the others,” says Miyahara. “And all of them are all alive and well, so unlike other trading games, they don’t ‘die’ when they lose. That would be way too dark.”Instead, defeated characters take a break in the Yuzu Room – the nickname for the old primary school nurse’s office – where they remain until the end of the game.Eitaro, 10, pronounces the localojisanheroes the “best” trading card game he’s ever played. “The rules are easy to understand,” he says. “But, best of all, it’s something you can only play here in Kawara.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The penitentiary became TdA’s headquarters – whereleaderson the inside directed criminal activity on the outside – until 2023, when the Venezuelan governmentraidedTocorón and the gang began to fragment.One scholarwrote: “The TdA is of modest prominence and is nowhere near as established as other gangs in Central and South America.” Some of those more influential criminal organizations, such as MS-13 andMexico’s cartels, have long had a foothold in – or even have theiroriginsin – the US.That said, TdAhasbeen powerful enough to torment and exploit other Venezuelans at home and abroad, preying particularly on vulnerable women, who are forced into the sex industry to pay off their debt after the gangsmuggles themto nearbycountriessuch as Chile, Colombia or Peru.TdA members have also startedworkingwith Mexican cartels, infiltrating groups of immigrants and then colluding with Mexico’s organized crime networks to extort them.Has Tren de Aragua ‘invaded’ the US?Tren de Aragua does have apresencein the US, but that presence is diffuse, uncoordinated, and on a smaller scale than the Trump administration’s repeatedly sounding the alarm and citing TdA in immigration-related arrests might make it seem. Three experts put it bluntly when theywrotefor the New York Times: “Tren de Aragua is not invading America.”That’s not to say that individual TdA members – or peoplepurportingto be TdA members for clout – haven’t caused real harm and suffering for many communities across the US. In Miami, a former Venezuelan police officer was reportedlyabductedand murdered by a TdA member. Another supposed gang member allegedlyshottwo New York police officers. And the criminal organization has seeminglyimportedits sex-trafficking model, exploiting Venezuelan women who owe them for transportation into the US.Even so,InSight Crime, a thinktank that studies organized crime across the Americas, has said that TdA is growing weaker, not stronger, and “now operates more as a loose collection of franchises than a cohesive organization”.Earlier this month, US authoritiesrevealedfederal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, firearm offenses and robbery against 27 alleged current or alleged former TdA members and associates, indictments and arrests that attorney general Pam Bondisaidwould “devastate TdA’s infrastructure”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His justification is that the gang is acting “at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela”.That’s unlikely. TdAwasprotected by the Venezuelan government in the past, according toInSight Crime. But that agreement no longer stands, with the raid on the criminal organization’s prison headquarters a case in point.The Washington Postreports that a recent National Intelligence Council internal assessment – which relied on information from the US’s 18 intelligence agencies – determined that while TdA has some low-level contacts in Maduro’s government, it is in no way commanded by Maduro. This makes Trump’s using the invasion argument to bypass due process flimsy – and contrary to the US supreme court’sinsistence of the rightfor individuals to challenge the government.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationAmericasUS politicsGangsUS immigrationNicolás MaduroexplainersShareReuse this content"

In what appeared to be a world exclusive interview, the Hollywood A-listerJohnny Depphad confessed his love for the bucolic county. More than that, he had bought a secret hideaway in the area.View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty/Guardian DesignNever slow to pounce on a story about the controversial Pirates of the Caribbean star, the national and international tabloid media hungrily reproduced news of Depp’s English bolt-hole. The story went viral.The British celebrity bible Hello! gushed over the star’s idyllic 12-bedroom property, featuring “a walled garden and even its own dairy farm”. The US weekly magazine People told readers that Depp was “enjoying the quiet life in England”. The Independent lured readers into the story, promising that the star had “opened up about his newfound introverted lifestyle”.The story was all the more intriguing for having been revealed in the most unlikely of places: the pages of the regional monthly magazine. The six-page feature stated: “It is true that he also bought an estate of 850 acres near Kingston St Mary which includes what is known as Somerset Mansion.”There was only one problem: according to those close to Depp, he hadn’t.In the days that followed, publicists for the actor played a frantic game of whack-a-mole, trying to correct the story they say is inaccurate, but which spread like wildfire.View image in fullscreenBernard Bale.Photograph: Mighty PensIntriguingly, the journalist behind the story was not one that Depp’s people recognised. “The whole thing was strange,” said one source close to the star.The author was, in fact, a little-known English freelance journalist called Bernard Bale. The story of how he came to land his Johnny Depp story – along with a litany of other starry interviews – gives a rare insight into the engine room of celebrity journalism, and is every bit as intriguing as the thought of Jack Sparrow tending a Somerset garden.A trawl through celebrity stories published under Bale’s byline reads like the guestlist for the glitziest of Hollywood galas – if the gala was being held in a local diner.A non-exhaustive list of those quoted in his pieces includes Barack andMichelle Obama(2019),Jennifer Aniston(2019),Céline Dion(2019) andBarbra Streisand(2020) – published, the Guardian understands, by the small, now defunct Scottish publication The Weekly News, and now hosted on the Scottish Sunday Post website.View image in fullscreenJennifer Aniston features in a Bernard Bale Sunday Post story.Photograph: Scottish Sunday PostSomerset Life readers with longer memories may have recalled a piece in 2018, when the magazine boasted how “Bernard Bale talks to Hollywood A-lister Nicolas Cage about his decision to make our county his home”.And if his apparent prolific access to A-list stars wasn’t enough, Bale appeared to have a line into the most prominent UK politicians of the day, too.In February 2022, Rishi Sunak was stewarding the UK economy through the financial upheaval caused by the global pandemic, but despite all this, the chancellor appeared to have found time foran interviewwithDogs Today.That a politician may seek to woo the dog vote is less surprising than it may seem – British people really love their dogs.But when asked how Sunak made time for such a small outlet at the height of Covid, sources close to the would-be PM said that nobody could recall an interview with either Dogs Today, or with Bale. “It is extremely unlikely. He was chancellor and no one who would know can recall this,” they said.In October 2022, Bale’s byline was again on a piece that stated Tom Cruise, “arguably the world’s most famous actor”, had taken “time out of his busy scheduleto talk exclusively to Derbyshire Life”. In February 2024, the Yorkshire Dalesman magazineposted on its social mediathat while Pickering and Scarborough were a long way from Hollywood, in its article: “Sir Ben Kingsley chats with Bernard Bale about his #yorkshire roots.”View image in fullscreenRishi Sunak features on the cover of Dogs Today.Photograph: Dogs TodayBut after the Guardian made queries about the above stories, sources close to the stars involved said they could not recall an interview taking place. A source close to Kingsley said he has “not done an interview with this person”.A spokesperson for the Dalesman said all its freelance submissions were subject “to rigorous editorial checks and published in good faith”.So far, so curious. So how did Bale land these coveted interviews? Following the trail of how journalists source their stories is, by necessity, a tricky business. Reporters do not reveal their sources as a point of principle, and when asked multiple times to confirm how he had landed these interviews, Bale declined. He said he had spent a lifetime establishing a valued professional reputation based on trust, integrity and credibility, resulting in “hundreds of interviews and even friendships” over the years.It is clear that in the world of showbiz journalism, there are many ways to do business. There are, undoubtedly, agents, managers and sources who will brief on behalf of their high-profile clients in a way that can be spun up into interviews. Some people the Guardian spoke to described Bale’s “old-school” ability to do business with PRs. And as any harassed reporter will testify – writers have little control over headlines or how stories are billed on social media.What’s more,not all those we contacted in relation to Bale’s work raised questions. The editor of Dogs Today, for example, said there had never been any complaints about his work – which appear to include two interviews with Barack Obama. Several features contained scoops that were later broken in the mainstream media, which seems to corroborate the accuracy of his sources, they added.So who is Bernard Bale, the man who seems to bridge the gap between the Hollywood Hills and theDerbyshireDales?View image in fullscreenBernard Bale interviews Michelle Obama for the Sunday Post.Photograph: Scottish Sunday PostOn his LinkedIn profile, Bale writes that his “writing career began at the age of 13 when his work was accepted – and paid for – by a local newspaper in west London. From that humble beginning came a career that has engulfed national newspapers and magazines and every element of journalism and writing except frontline war correspondent.”He describes himself as a “writer, TV and radio broadcaster, speaker, voice actor, PR and marketing consultant, co-owner of Chucklesworld Ltd and global sports and entertainment and visitor attractions partner”. But delving into newspaper archives suggests that this is only a small part of his story.An early appearance in newsprint was not, in fact, as a writer.A story in the Daily Mirror of July 1978 suggests that a Bernard Bale – bearing a striking resemblance to the now older journalist – became embroiled in a “zoo love tangle” at Cleethorpes zoo in which he was reported to have run off with the daughter of a trapeze artist.View image in fullscreenSir Ben Kingsley appears in a post from the Yorkshire Dalesman.Photograph: FacebookAt some point, Bale appears to have left the circus behind in favour of publishing celebrity interviews. In March 2022, Derbyshire Life – a stablemate of the Somerset title – published an “exclusive interview” by Bale withGeorge Clooneywith the headline “Why George Clooney is a fan of Derby County”.The Guardian understands that Bale had provided many other celebrity interviews with stars who had a link to Derbyshire – always with a quick turnaround. He had intimated to editors that he had a relationship with Clooney, and suggested he could get quotes from him about Derby County.In the article, Clooney was quoted as saying: “‘I watched a few games on TV and gradually I began to understand soccer better and began to look out for Derby County’s games and results. I have been watching ever since.”The irresistible mix of big-time celebrity and relatively small town club in the Clooney article set off another national news frenzy.The Sun picked upthe Clooney storythe next day. It published another “exclusive” with the headline: “Hollywood star George Clooney has claimed that he would love to purchase Wayne Rooney’s Derby County side”. It featured a picture of Clooney in a Derby County shirt with “Ocean’s 11” on the back.The Sun scoop was heavy on fan delight: “It’s unbelievable. But it’s also absolutely terrific. I’m gobsmacked,” said Derby fan Matthew Porter, 32. Even the local MP for Derby North, Amanda Solloway, chipped in: “[It] would be brilliant if George Clooney who loves football and has a passion was to buy [the club].” The story appeared to be based on the exact quotes published in Derbyshire Life, none of which, incidentally, appeared to back up the grabby headline.The Guardian could not reach George Clooney’s press office for comment. Bale has suggested that some of the ways his work has been presented did not match the way they were originally pitched – and that he cannot control how editors display his writing. He said he has kept records of many of the interviews he has worked on, and is “not responsible for the presentation or editing”, adding that “any assertion or inference that [he] personally [has] misled any reader” was inaccurate and defamatory.View image in fullscreenThe Sun picked up Bernard Bale’s story about George Clooney loving Derby County.Photograph: The SunThe Guardian understands that after publication editors of the Derbyshire magazine were approached about concerns regarding Bale’s work for a different title.At the time they were readying another six-page interview from Bale, this time with Keira Knightley. Asked about quotes in the Knightley story, he said they had come via one of her agents, and in the end the magazine decided not to publish.Derbyshire Life’s editor, Nathan Fearn, said that Bale had periodically supplied features for the publication on a freelance basis. However, in July 2023, the publication had become “aware of issues that had arisen with one of Mr Bale’s interviews for a different title”.He said: “His work has not been used by Derbyshire Life since.”As for Somerset Life, the source of the Johnny Depp story that is still carried by national news websites in the UK, the Guardian understands that Bale had written dozens of celebrity interviews without complaint for its pages, and that editors at the publication were under the impression that he had spoken with famous people. But after being contacted by Depp’s representatives and discussions with Bale, he was told that his services as a freelance journalist would no longer be required. A spokesperson for Somerset Life declined to comment.The Guardian has seen no evidence that the interviews were not obtained legitimately, but sources close to the stars say they do not recall speaking with Bale. Bale says that he has “kept copies of many of the original articles and emails pertaining to articles submitted” and that he has “more than enough evidence, testimonials and so on to prove [his] integrity”.Bale has had, according to hisown promotional material, a six-decade career as “one of the most experienced and successful writers of our time”. Pushing 80, he appears to still have plenty of energy for broadcasting on an online radio station, turning around books and producing celebrity stories. The Guardian understands he may have more coming down the line. The next one? Look out for Lionel Messi."

The fear I had when I first started my transition in 1979, that people will hurt me,” says Janey, who is 70. She has been living “happily and independently” as a woman for nearly half a century. Based in London, she still works in the mental health sector and is part of a large and accepting Irish family. She is also transgender.“I still go into the women’s toilets at work, but when I open the door there’s that little voice inside me: ‘Will someone shout at me?’,” she says.Last week’s supreme court ruling sent shock waves through the UK’s trans community. Theunanimous judgmentsaid the legal definition of a woman in theEquality Act 2010did not include transgender women who hold gender recognition certificates (GRCs). That feeling was compounded when Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is preparing new statutory guidance,said the judgmentmeant only biological women could use single-sex changing rooms and toilets.Janey’s colleagues don’t know she’s trans (Janey is not her real name). She remembers the 1980s all too well, when “people would beat the shit out of you just for being different”.“I always felt I didn’t have to tell people other than close friends. By my early 30s I thought: ‘I am me, end of story.’ I did what everybody else did, going out dancing, and I was treated like any other woman, which included being harassed by men.” Coming home at night, Janey still carries her keys in her hand.It’s the fragility of rights that scares her. “Just look at what is happening in the US – what worries me in this country is that it’s all about trans people now, but this is the start of something. Rights can be knocked out in a second.”View image in fullscreenIn the decade-long campaign for gender recognition, Christine Burns says it was ‘a devil’s own job’ to get ‘very shy’ trans people on to the streets protesting.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianDiana James, 66, a domestic abuse worker, says the supreme court judgment has been “a tremendous shock” to mature trans women in particular. “These are women just living their lives, coming up for retirement, pottering around their gardens, and suddenly their safety and security has been removed.”In the intervening decades since her own transition in the mid-70s, James has witnessed “an incremental increase in rights and understanding” for trans people. “The path forward wasn’t rushed but in gentle increments, so some people who had concerns could discuss them.”But she is one of many who identify 2017 as a pivot point, when Theresa May as prime minister proposed changing UK gender recognition laws to allow people to self-identify as their chosen gender, alongside the emergence of women’s campaign groups focusing on “sex-based rights”.“It became wrapped up into an issue of women’s safety from trans people, despite the lack of evidence there was a genuine threat. This muddied the water around a complex situation, so a lot of the nuance was lost and so was a lot of discussion.”Christine Burns, a retired activist and internationally recognised health adviser, charts “a fairly straight line of progress” towards the passing of theGenderRecognition Act in 2004, which allowed trans people to change gender on their birth certificate, marry to reflect their chosen identity and gave them privacy around their transition. That legislation “mattered so much to people” says Burns, while acknowledging that only a minority of the community have gone on to apply for a GRC.Pedro Pascal calls JK Rowling a ‘heinous loser’ in wake of supreme court gender rulingRead moreShe points to another significant social shift in the mid-00s. “The oddity is that the Gender Recognition Act changed lives, but the emergence of social media made it possible for there to be a revolution in how trans people engaged with the world.”In the decade-long campaign for gender recognition, it was “a devil’s own job” to get “very shy” trans people on to the streets protesting, Burns says. But with the advent of social media, “suddenly they had a space where it was safe to describe themselves to the world, and find other trans people to compare notes with”.The campaign for gender recognition was spearheaded by the group Press for Change, co-founded in 1992 by the acclaimed advocate Stephen Whittle, who says it taught trans people that “we didn’t have to take it lying down”.“In the 70s and 80s, early 90s, people were terrified [that] if they tried to fight for their rights they would lose everything,” says Whittle, now 69, who found himself denounced as a “sex pervert” by a tabloid newspaper in the early 90s.View image in fullscreenStephen Whittle at home in Stockport. ‘In the 70s and 80s, early 90s, people were terrified [that] if they tried to fight for their rights they would lose everything.’Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBut by the mid-2010s, he sensed “the world had grown up”. “I was not monstered all the time. I was accepted as a good colleague, a good teacher, a good lawyer. But since then there has been this decline, and it has been vicious. There will be some who will retreat. There will be some people who will be galvanised.”Roz Kaveney, 75, a poet and critic, says her concern about the “outrageous” supreme court judgment is that “a lot of people will think they are now entitled to act as vigilantes and that will be very unpleasant for their victims, not all of whom will be trans”.James agrees: “So many trans women are bodily indistinguishable from cis women, with breasts and a vagina. Any gender non-conforming lesbian should also be worried.”Her concern is that use of certain facilities will now come down to “passing privilege”. “So if someone fits their view of what a woman should look like, they are given permission for entry. Wasn’t that what we fought against in the 70s and 80s with our copies of Spare Rib and demands for bodily autonomy?”Whittle likewise recalls the trans community’s solidarity with women in previous decades. “We’ve always been respectful of women’s rights. In the 80s and 90s we were out on the streets along with them and they were alongside us in this fight. And any trans person will tell you they have a lifetime’s experience of sexual assault and rape. Do [gender critical groups] not think we care about those issues?”Burns says the judgment was especially shocking for those “who have grown up always knowing a respectful legal framework for trans people”.Kaveney, a former deputy chair of Liberty, says: “My generation have never had to cope with an ongoing, concerted attack on trans existence that we’re seeing in the US and now here.“It is realistic to be worried, but we’ve always been very aware of our rights in law. I’m hugely impressed with the younger generation: I’d say to them: don’t be scared, just be prepared to fight for your lives.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderGendernewsShareReuse this content"

Majorel, the company at the centre of the allegations in Ghana, is owned by the French multinational Teleperformance.One man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he attempted suicide owing to the nature of his work. His claims his contract was subsequently terminated and he has returned to his home country.Facebook and other large social media companies employ armies of content moderators, often based in the poorest parts of the world, to remove posts that breach their community standards and to train AI systems to do the same.Moderators are required to review distressing and often brutal pictures and videos to establish whether they should be removed from Meta’s platforms. According to workers in Ghana, they have seen videos of a person being skinned alive and a woman being beheaded.The moderators claim mental health care offered by the firm was unhelpful, was not delivered by medical doctors, and that personal disclosures made by staff about the effects of their work were circulated among managers.Teleperformance disputed this, saying it employed licensed mental health professionals who are registered with the local regulatory body and hold a master’s degree in psychology, counselling, or another mental health field.The legal case is being prepared by a UK-based nonprofit, Foxglove. It would be the second case brought by content moderators in Africa, after Samasource workers in Kenya sued in 2023.Foxglove said it was “urgently investigating these shocking abuses of workers” with a view to using “every tool at our disposal, including potential legal action” to improve working conditions.It is working with a Ghanaian firm, Agency Seven Seven, on preparing two possible lawsuits. One would allege psychological harms and could involve a group of moderators, and the other unfair dismissal, involving the moderator from east Africa whose contract was terminated after he attempted suicide.Foxglove’s co-executive director Martha Dark said: “These are the worst conditions I have seen in six years of working with social media content moderators around the world.“In Ghana, Meta is displaying nothing short of a complete disregard for the humanity of its key safety workers upon whom all its profits rely: content moderators. They are treated as objects who can be used up, burned out and replaced with no care whatsoever for the permanent damage to their mental and physical wellbeing.”Dark said basic wages for content moderators in Accra were below living costs, incentivising them to work overtime, for which pay is understood to be even lower than normal rates. Moderators faced deductions from their pay for failing to meet performance targets, she added.Contracts seen by the Guardian show that the base wage starts at about 1,300 Ghanaian cedis a month – just over £64. This is supplemented by a system of performance-related bonuses, the upper range of which amounts to about 4,900 cedis (£243) a month, significantly less than the estimatedcost of living in Accra.A Teleperformance spokesperson said content moderators enjoyed “strong pay and benefits, including monthly pay that is roughly 10 times the country’s minimum wage for domestic moderators, and 16 times the minimum wage for those who have relocated from other countries, when including project allowance, transportation allowance, language premium and more – all of which are automatically paid to the moderator and are not performance-based”.Foxglove’s researcher Michaela Chen said she had seen photos of moderators’ living quarters, in which they were “crammed five to a flat, two to a room”. She said there appeared to be a culture of secrecy, including surveillance from managers, who follow workers into the toilets during breaks.This extends to moderators’ work for Meta. She said: “Workers spend all day working on Meta’s platforms, moderating to Meta’s standards and using Meta’s systems, but at the same time, moderators are told constantly: ‘You do not work for Meta,’ and are forbidden from telling anyone they do.”Teleperformance said moderators were “offered housing in … one of the most upscale and well-known residential and commercial neighbourhoods in Accra”.The spokesperson described the housing as “safe, with strong security” and having air conditioning, recreation facilities, including gyms and pools.Carla Olympio, a partner at Agency Seven Seven, said she believed a personal injury case could succeed in Ghana’s courts and would set a precedent establishing that worker protections extend to psychological harms as well as physical injury.“[There is] currently a gap in our laws because they haven’t necessarily caught up with the new developments that cover technology and virtual work,” she said.Rosa Curling, a co-executive director at Foxglove, said it was seeking for the court to “order immediate changes to the content moderators’ workplace”, including proper safeguards and psychiatric care.A spokesperson for Teleperformance said: “At TP in Ghana, we take our content moderation work seriously. From the very beginning during the interview process, within the employee contract and through employee training and resiliency testing, we are fully transparent with our prospective moderators regarding the content they might see during their work to help keep the internet safe for our communities. We have robust people management systems and workplace practices, including a robust wellbeing programme staffed by fully licensed psychologists to support our content moderators throughout their content moderation journey.”Meta said the companies it worked with were “contractually obliged to pay their employees who review content on Facebook and Instagram above the industry standard in the markets they operate”.The tech company said it took “the support of content reviewers seriously”, including detailing expectations around counselling, training and other support in contracts with the companies it outsourced.It said all content moderators signed client confidentiality agreements because they were dealing with user information which needed to be protected and for their own safety, but moderators may discuss their jobs with doctors and counsellors, and some aspects with family members.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

We are working hard to get all of the answers.”He said the victims ranged from five to 65 years old, and that dozens more were injured, “some critically and some have not yet been identified”.Late on Sunday, the British Columbia Prosecution Service charged Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, with eight counts of second degree murder and said more charges were possible. Lo, a Vancouver resident, appeared in court and remains in custody, prosecutors said.Rai said officials felt confident the incident was not an act of terrorism and there were no known prior threats to the Filipino community. The suspect had a “significant history of interactions with police and police and healthcare professionals related to mental health”, Rai said.0:56Vancouver: several people killed after car ploughs into crowd at community event – videoHe later added: “It’s not policing the symptom. We’ve got to get to the root cause. We’ve got to get people help, and it’s not putting more cops on the street.”Vancouver’s mayor, Ken Sim, said he has directed a full review of the city’s “event safety measures, including barriers, traffic control and safety protocols”.Echoing Rai’s comments, he added: “We can’t create a police state here, right? It doesn’t get to the root cause. The conversation keeps coming back to mental health. We need to take care of people that are sick, get them the care they need.”The Lapu-Lapu festival, held on a balmy spring day, drew nearly 100,000 people, many of whom were families with young children. The celebration is named after Datu Lapu-Lapu, an Indigenous resistance fighter in the Philippines, who orchestrated the defeat of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in battle in 1521.Saturday’s festival was the second annual event for the city and organisers advertised a street parade, artisans, cultural activities, a basketball tournament and local food vendors.Carney, the Liberal party prime minister and former Bank of England governor who is favourite to win Monday’s election, paused campaigning to address the country on Sunday morning.“Those families are living every family’s nightmare,” said a visibly emotional Carney. “I know that I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know that Canadians are united with you.” Carney referenced “Bayanihan”, the Filipino value of community serving those in need. “This spirit upon which we must draw in this incredibly difficult time. We will comfort the grieving. We will care for each other. We will unite in common purpose.”Map of attack locationCarney said he had been briefed by national security officials who believed the attacker acted alone and that there was no active threat to the public.“Last night was extremely difficult and the community will feel this for a long time,” RJ Aquino, the chair of the festival organiser Filipino BC, told reporters, asking the media to respect the privacy of those affected. “We know that there’s a lot of questions floating about and we don’t have all the answers, but we want to tell everybody that we’re grieving.”Vancouver had more than 38,600 residents of Filipino heritage in 2021, representing 5.9% of the city’s total population, according to Statistics Canada.Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Filipino president, said he was “completely shattered” by the incident and that his government conveyed the “deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and to the strong and thriving Filipino community in Canada”.King Charles said he and his wife were “profoundly saddened” by the attack and “send our deepest possible sympathy at a most agonising time for so many in Canada”.The incident occurred shortly after 8pm local time (1300 BST), said Rai. The event was wrapping up, but many festivalgoers were in the area when the driver in an SUV approached. Aphoto posted to Xhalf an hour before showed a busy street with young people looking at the wares of food truck vendors.“It is hard to make sense of something so senseless, and I know there are questions about whether this tragedy could have been prevented,” said Rai.Footage posted online showed a black luxury SUV with a damaged bonnet parked on a street littered with debris as first aiders tended to people lying on the ground.One witness told CTV News he saw a vehicle driving erratically in the area of the festival just before the crowd was hit. The Vancouver Sun said thousands of people were in the area.“I didn’t get to see the driver, all I heard was an engine rev,” said Yoseb Vardeh, a food truck operator, in an interview with Postmedia. “I got outside my food truck, I looked down the road and there’s just bodies everywhere. He went through the whole block, he went straight down the middle.”Kris Pangilinan, a Toronto-based journalist attending the festival, told CBC News: “[The driver] just slammed the pedal down and rammed into hundreds of people. It was like seeing a bowling ball hit – all the bowling pins and all the pins flying up in the air.”“It was like a war zone … There were bodies all over the ground,” he said.Festival attenders held the suspect until police could arrive.Video circulating on social media showed a young man in a hoodie with his back against a chain-link fence, alongside a security guard and surrounded by bystanders screaming and swearing at him. “I’m sorry,” the man said, holding his hand to his head.Police set up a 24-hour assistance centre to help anyone who had been unable to contact relatives or friends who were at the festival.Harjit Sajjan, a former defence minister who previously worked as a police officer in Vancouver, told CTV News the aftermath was “the largest crime scene that I’ve seen. I’ve been to many crime scenes in that neighbourhood before … This is unfathomable.”Sim said: “Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver’s Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time.View image in fullscreenSarah Edmilao, a member of the Filipino community who says friends had attended the festival earlier in the day, places flowers at a growing memorial near the site of the attack.Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/APThe incident cast a pall over the final day of the federal election campaigning. Canadians go to the polls on Monday in a vote heavily influenced by the spectre of Donald Trump’s threats to annex Canada and a trade war he has launched against his country’s northern neighbour.The New Democratic party (NDP) leader, Jagmeet Singh, had attended the festival to meet voters. He left about an hour before the incident.“Having been at the Lapu-Lapu festival, this is a festival with kids there and families there,” Singh said. “I don’t have the words to describe the pain that I’m feeling now at the lives that were lost … We don’t know the motives, we don’t know any of the details. But, ultimately, this is something that targeted the Filipino community and the Filipino community right now is reeling.”The NDP cancelled four other events in the province schedule for Sunday. Carney’s campaign said a large rally in British Columbia had been cancelled.“All Canadians are united in solidarity with the Filipino community,” the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, said while visiting a Filipino church in Ontario. “All Canadians are united with you in mourning the loss of these treasured lives and in binding our country together to support the surviving loved ones.”The Tory leader called the SUV ramming attack a “senseless act of violence”.“I know that today will be a day of prayer and reflection for the Filipino community and for all Canadians and I want you to know that all our country is with you today as you mourn this terrible loss,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Lapu Lapu Day is named after chief Lapulapu, an Indigenous resistance fighter in the Philippines, who led his men to defeat the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in battle in 1521. Saturday’s festival was the second annual event for the city and organisers advertised a street parade, artisans, cultural activities, a giant basketball tournament and local food vendors. The six-time Grammy-winning musical group Black Eyed Peas headlined a concert event.Rai said officials felt confident the incident was not an act of terrorism and there were no known prior threats to the Filipino community. A 30-year-old man who had been driving a black Audi SUV was arrested.Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, paused general election campaigning to address the country on Sunday morning.“Those families are living every family’s nightmare,” said a visibly emotional Carney. “I know that I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know that Canadians are united with you.” Carney referenced “Bayanihan”, the Filipino value of community serving those in need. “This spirit upon which we must draw in this incredibly difficult time. We will comfort the grieving. We will care for each other. We will unite in common purpose.”Carney said he had been briefed by national security officials who believed the attacker acted alone and that there was no active threat to the public.Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Philippine president, said he was “completely shattered” by the incident and said his government conveyed the “deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and to the strong and thriving Filipino community in Canada”.The incident happened shortly after 8pm local time. Aphoto posted to Xhalf an hour before showed a busy street with young people looking at the wares of rows of food truck vendors.Footage posted online showed a black SUV with a damaged bonnet parked on a street littered with debris as first-aiders tended to people lying on the ground.One witness told CTV News he saw a vehicle driving erratically in the area of the festival just before the crowd was hit. The Vancouver Sun said thousands of people had been in the area.“I didn’t get to see the driver, all I heard was an engine rev,” Yoseb Vardeh, a food truck operator, told Postmedia. “I got outside my food truck, I looked down the road and there’s just bodies everywhere. He went through the whole block, he went straight down the middle.”Kris Pangilinan, a Toronto-based journalist attending the festival, told CBC news: “[The driver] just slammed the pedal down and rammed into hundreds of people. It was like seeing a bowling ball hit – all the bowling pins and all the pins flying up in the air.”“It was like a war zone … There were bodies all over the ground,” he said.Festival attenders held the suspect until police could arrive. Police said the man was known to them “in certain circumstances”.Vancouver mapVideo circulating on social media showed a young man in a hoodie with his back against a chain-link fence, alongside a security guard and surrounded by bystanders screaming and swearing at him. “I’m sorry,” the man said, holding his hand to his head.Police set up a 24-hour assistance centre to help anyone who had been unable to contact relatives or friends who were at the festival.Harjit Sajjan, a former defence minister who previously worked as a police officer in Vancouver, told CTV News the aftermath was the “the largest crime scene that I’ve seen. I’ve been to many crime scenes in that neighbourhood before … This is unfathomable.”The Vancouver mayor, Ken Sim, said: “Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver’s Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time.”The incident happened shortly before Canadians go to the polls on Monday after a frenetic election race where candidates have wooed voters on issues including rising living costs and tackling Donald Trump’s tariffs. Carney is favoured to win after promising voters he would stand up to Washington’s sweeping import levies.The New Democratic party (NDP) leader, Jagmeet Singh, had attended the festival to meet voters. He left about an hour before the incident.“Having been at the Lapu Lapu festival, this is a festival with kids there and families there,” Singh said. “I don’t have the words to describe the pain that I’m feeling now at the lives that were lost … We don’t know the motives, we don’t know any of the details. But, ultimately, this is something that targeted the Filipino community and the Filipino community right now is reeling.”The NDP cancelled four other events in the province schedule for Sunday. Carney’s campaign announced a large rally in British Columbia had been cancelled.“All Canadians are united in solidarity with the Filipino community,” the Conservative party leader, Pierre Poilievre, said while visiting a Filipino church in Ontario. “All Canadians are united with you in mourning the loss of these treasured lives and in binding our country together to support the surviving loved ones.”Poilievre called the attack a “senseless act of violence”, adding: “I know that today will be a day of prayer and reflection for the Filipino community and for all Canadians and I want you to know that all our country is with you today as you mourn this terrible loss.”King Charles said he and his wife were “profoundly saddened” by the attack and “send our deepest possible sympathy at a most agonising time for so many in Canada”.Vancouver had more than 38,600 residents of Filipino heritage in 2021, representing 5.9% of the city’s total population, according to Statistics Canada, the agency that conducts the national census.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He also floated the idea ofUS troops returning to Panamato “secure” its strategically vital canal, an idea that was quickly slapped down by Panama’s government.The US and China are two of the top users of the canal.Egypt’s Suez canal, a key waterway linking Europe and Asia, accounted for about 10% of global maritime trade before attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.The Iran-backed rebels began targeting vessels after the start of the Israel-Gaza war, claiming solidarity with Palestinians. It has forced ships to take a long and costly detour around the southern tip of Africa.Egypt said in 2024 that its canal revenues had plunged 60%, a loss of $7bn.The US military has been attacking Houthi positions since January 2024 and those assaults have intensified under Trump, with almost daily strikes in the past month. Trump has said military action will continue until the Houthis are no longer a threat to shipping.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpPanamaAmericasSuez canalnewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement earlier on Sunday, he conceded that the situation remained difficult in many areas including Kursk.The Central Military Commission of the North’s ruling Workers’ party said Kim made the decision to deploy North Korean troops under the comprehensive strategic partnership treaty he signed with Putin in 2024.“Under the order of the head of state, the sub-units of the armed forces of the Republic regarded the territory of Russia as the one of their country and proved the firm alliance between the two countries,” KCNA cited the commission as saying.“They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying.North Korea “regards it as an honour to have an alliance with such a powerful state as the Russian Federation,” KCNA said.North Korea sent an estimated total of 14,000 troops, including 3,000 reinforcements to replace its losses, Ukrainian officials have said. Lacking armoured vehicles and drone warfare experience, theytook heavy casualtiesbut adapted quickly.Russia confirmed on Saturday for the first time that North Korean soldiers have been fighting alongside Russians in Kursk. Neither Russia nor North Korea had previously either confirmed or denied the deployment.The US State Department said it was concerned by North Korea’s direct involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine and that Pyongyang’s military deployment for Russia must end.“We continue to be concerned by (North Korea’s) direct involvement in the war. (North Korea’s) military deployment to Russia and any support provided by the Russian Federation to (North Korea) in return must end,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email, adding third countries like North Korea “bear responsibility” for the war.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsNorth KoreaRussiaUkraineAsia PacificEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He added that Beijing’s denial that negotiations are ongoing was for a Chinese audience.“I think they’re playing to a different audience,” Bessent said. “We have a process in place and, again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable.“The first path will be, again, a de-escalation, which I think the Chinese are going to have to have. Then I think there can be an agreement in principle, these 17 or 18 important trade deals that we’re negotiating.”But Bessent warned that “a trade deal can take months” and said negotiations with other significant US trading partners were progressing. “Some of those are moving along very well, especially the – with the Asian countries,” he said, praising Trump’s negotiating strategy.“In game theory it’s called strategic uncertainty,” he said. “So, you’re not going to tell the person on the other side of the negotiation where you’re going to end up. And nobody’s better at creating this leverage than President Trump.”The treasury secretary’s comments come as top US retailers have reportedly warned the White House that tariffs will cause empty store shelves and price hikes within weeks.Bloomberg reportedthat Chinese fast-fashion giantShein raised US pricesof its products from dresses to kitchenware on Friday ahead of imminent tariffs on small parcels. The average price for the top 100 products in the beauty and health category increased by 51%, and more than 30% for home and kitchen products and toys, including a 377% increase in the price of a 10-piece set of kitchen towels.Trump predicted on Sunday that tariffs would ultimately benefit US taxpayers and boost employment. “When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated,”Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.“Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year. Also, massive numbers of jobs are already being created, with new plants and factories currently being built or planned.” He called it a “bonanza” for Americans and said “the external service is happening”.US consumer sentiment sees largest drop since 1990 after Trump tariff chaosRead moreSeparately on Sunday, US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said the US was holding daily conversations with China over tariffs. “Every day we are in conversation with China, along with those other 99, 100 countries that have come to the table,” Rollins said on CNN’s State of the Union.Rollins said the president was prepared to bail out American farmers if the trade war continues squeezing commodity exports, particularly soybean and pork sales to China.“First of all, the prayer is that that doesn’t need to happen – but secondly, if it does, for the short term, just as in Trump 1, we are preparing for that,” Rollins said.Rollins said it could take months before it is known whether a bail-out is needed.“I don’t think we’re going to need it, but if we do, it will be there,” Rollins said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsChinaXi JinpingDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In the past decade, hundreds of people have had their Taiwanese papers or passports cancelled for also holding Chinese ID, effectively revoking their citizenship.But a renewed hunt for dual ID-holders has drawn controversy after the public expulsion of three women and threats to the permanent residencies of more than 10,000 Chinese-born people, including many who had built lives and families in Taiwan over decades.‘Don’t panic, but don’t relax’: Taiwan’s plan ‘to use 7-Eleven chains’ as wartime hubsRead moreThe campaign has sparked a nationwide debate about identity, loyalty and how to balance the island’s treasured political freedoms with its national security.The current furore began in December, with an online documentary revealing local Chinese authorities were secretly offering Chinese IDs to Taiwanese people.Taiwan’s mainland affairs council (MAC) denounced the scheme as “part of China’s evil united front work that attempts to … create an illusion that it has authority over the nation”.The documentary identified three recipients who had moved to the Chinese province of Fujian and applied for Chinese identity cards.Su Shih-er was one of the three. He chose the coastal province for its large Taiwanese community and generous government subsidies for entrepreneurs opening “local” businesses. Soon after arriving, Su learned he could apply for a Chinese identity card.“I thought it’d be more convenient for my company, so I applied,” he told the Guardian.What Su did was illegal under Taiwanese law, although he disputes this. To get his Chinese ID card, Su was legally required to have Chinese household registration (known as “hukou”), which is barred under Taiwan’s cross-strait relations act, alongside Chinese passports.Su, who is still in China, said there are “loads” of Taiwanese with Fujian IDs, and that he felt “like a victim of their political games”.‘A unique dilemma’Tensions between Taiwan and China are dangerously high. China’s Communist party (CCP) government claims Taiwan as a province and ispreparing to take it militarilyif it can’t convince or coerce it to peacefully “unify”. Espionage and infiltration by pro-CCP actors – including from Taiwan’s society, government, and military –are real and ongoing dangers.But there are still close ties between the two territories. Figures from 2022 show about 170,000 Taiwanese living in China. About 380,000 Chinese-born people live in Taiwan, many married to Taiwanese people, and about half of them hold permanent residency.Taiwan jails four soldiers, including three who worked in presidential office, for spying for ChinaRead moreIn March Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te,announced new measuresto counter China’s malign efforts, which included increased scrutiny of cross-strait travel and resettlement.In March, three Chinese-born women were accused of using their popular social media accounts to advocate for a hostile Chinese takeover of Taiwan. Taiwan revoked their residency visas and they were forced to leave Taiwan, as well as their Taiwanese husbands and children.The opposition accused the government of deporting people without due process for views it didn’t like.A statementsigned by dozens of local academics said President Lai was “rapidly compressing the space for free speech”.But government figures said the posts were essentially enemy war propaganda, exempt from free-speech protection. Premier Cho Jung-tai told reporters: “There are limits to freedom of speech, and the limits are the country’s survival.” The deportations also seemed to have social support, and at a press conference held by one of the women, a crowd chanted “go home!”.View image in fullscreenPeople and cars in TaipeiPhotograph: Ann Wang/ReutersThe case highlighted “the unique dilemma of Taiwan’s existence”,wrote two local academics, Michelle Kuo and Albert Wu.“Imagine a world where an ally of China expels a Taiwanese immigrant for advocating Taiwanese independence. We would fight to the death for that person to stay in the country,” said Wu and Kuo.But, they added: “Taiwanisunder exceptional threat. Can we apply human rights principles around family unity and freedom of speech when facing such a massive danger?”‘My mother has become an international football’The Taiwan government’s next move proved even more controversial. As it became clear the number of people holding or seeking Chinese IDs waslarger than anticipated, authorities decided to sweep the island.“If the identities of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are not clearly distinguished, it will affect the national security and social stability of our country,” it said.In March the MAC sent questionnaires to public sector workers, university employees and military personnel, asking them if they ever held Chinese ID. The MAC described the survey as an opportunity to “demonstrate their loyalty”.Then, earlier this month, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) began contacting more than 10,000 Chinese-born spouses in Taiwan, claiming they had never provided proof they had given up their Chinese hukuo – a requirement for permanent residency.Social media filled with angry posts from affected people and their families, saying they felt targeted and suddenly unwelcome. Among them were people who had moved to Taiwan decades ago, before such proof was required.Rescinding hukou can only be done in person, in China. Some commenters pointed to the case of Li Yanhe, a Chinese-born, Taiwan-basedpublisher of critical booksabout the CCP.In 2023 Li was arrested in Shanghai, reportedly there to rescind his hukou. Convicted of unspecified acts of “inciting secession”, he remains in a Chinese jail.One woman posted to Threads a recording of a call between her mother and the NIA. Her mother told the NIA agent she had given proof to another agency when she arrived 22 years ago. But the agent said they had no record, and threatened to strip her Taiwanese rights and residency if she failed to cooperate.“My mother has become an international football,” her daughter posted.In another case, a woman said her mother – who had lived her for 33 years – had also received a demand for proof.“My mother has a Taiwanese ID card, a Taiwanese passport and has paid labour insurance and health insurance and taxes for more than 30 years. She is a Taiwanese!” the woman said.The MAC deputy head, Liang Wen-chieh, said last week they were demonstrating “utmost leniency towards such individuals”. But amid an outcry the government announced case-by-case exemptions, including for people who are elderly, haven’t returned to China in more than 10 years, or feared persecution if they did.The new campaign has so far resulted in at least 19 people being stripped of Taiwanese papers – and citizenship if they held it – for having Chinese ID.The NIA, told the Guardian those who cancelled their Chinese hukou could apply for permission to “restore their [Taiwan] status” and come back.But critics worry that the crackdown is only further dividing Taiwan’s already fractious society.“It is obvious that a negative impact is to tear Taiwan apart and push people to the opposite side, which is of no benefit to Taiwan’s security,” said Prof Liu Mei-jun, of Taiwan’s national Chengchi university.During the furore over the deported influencers, academics Kuo and Wu warned that the government “may have inadvertently handed Beijing an easy propaganda victory”.China’s state media has already seized on the cases, accusing Taiwan’s ruling DPP of “tearing families apart”. The Taiwan Affairs Office accused the DPP of bullying, and only applying the idea of “freedom” to those who supported Taiwan independence.The Guardian’s conversations with people in or close to the government have revealed a perplexity over the backlash, and a belief that any concerns are outweighed by the need to address any vulnerability China could exploit.“More than 360,000 Chinese spouses live in Taiwan today,” Kuo and Wu wrote in their essay. “While they may appear to be a demographic minority, their family networks make up a significant portion of society – one the government now risks alienating.”Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

So why are many in Australia missing out?Read moreThose drugs target the “feel-good” brain chemical serotonin and can take weeks or months to kick in.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterSpravato, known chemically as esketamine, works differently. It targets a neurotransmitter called glutamate that is thought to restore brain connections that help relieve depression.When it works, its effect can be felt within a matter of hours, according to Prof Ian Hickie of the University of Sydney. The co-director ofHealthand Policy at the University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre has been working with the drug for a small number of patients under a special access scheme.But from Thursday, it will be available and affordable for up to 30,000 Australians through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.It will also mark the first new type of medicine for major depression to be funded by the government in three decades.“Most of the drug development we’ve had in the last three decades has mimicked what had preceded it,” Hickie said. “This is different ... it targets a different neurochemical system – glutamate – and appears to regulate those brain circuits that regulate mood in a different way.”Australian trials using the ketamine-like drug have shown significant improvement in about 50% of people who had otherwise been resistant to conventional treatments.“Not all depression is the same, nor does it have the same chemical explanation in all people,” Hickie said.“For some people, particularly those who have failed to respond to the conventional serotonin-focused agents, or monoamine-focused agents, this is different and they appear to benefit.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They argue that the website and advertising materials of Australians for Natural Gas have failed to disclose its directors’ links to the gas industry andLiberal party, and overinflated the role of gas in the economy and energy transition.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterOn its website, Australians for Natural Gas describes itself as a “not-for-profit organisation representing the interests of Aussie households, industries and producers”. The company was registered in January 2025 with Joel Riddle and Nathaniel Smith among its directors, according to information provided to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.NSW solar farm to supply almost half the energy needs of major gas companyRead moreRiddle is the chief executive of the gas company Tamboran Resources, which holds the largest share of acreagein the Beetaloo basin, according to thecompany’s website. Smith wasinstalled as the Liberal candidate for the New South Wales seat of Whitlamafter the party’sinitial choice was disendorsed, and was a member of the NSW parliament from 2019 to 2023.The complaint to the ACCC alleges that Australians for Natural Gas has represented itself on its website and on social media as a grassroots not-for-profit organisation, failing to disclose its directors’ interests.It says the company overstates the contribution of gas to the Australian economy, by relying on out-of-date information; overstates the global demand for gas; and that its claims about the role of gas exploration in reducing electricity bills do not disclose that the cheapest electricity is from renewable sources.The complaint also alleges that claims of reduced emissions thanks to gas replacing coal are misleading because they ignore research about the emissions associated with the processing and transportation of liquefied natural gas, and assume gas would not in fact replace renewable energy.The director of Climate Integrity, Claire Snyder, said Australians for Natural Gas appeared to be “an incredibly brazen example of astroturfing”.“One thing that was concerning to us is that this website popped up right at the beginning of an election campaign, when energy is a critical and vote-deciding issue,” she said.She said Climate Integrity was raising its concerns with the ACCC to ensure a factual and evidence-based public discussion of energy and climate change, and the role of gas in the transition to zero emissions, particularly during the election.A spokesperson for Australians for Natural Gas described the complaint as “spurious”, noting that its membership included users and producers of natural gas, “as we clearly state on our website”.They did not respond when contacted in relation to Snyder’s comments.Onits website, the company says its membership “encompasses a diverse array of stakeholders across the natural gas value chain, including upstream producers, midstream infrastructure operators, and downstream users in industry”.It does not name any of its members or directors, or provide any contact email, street address or phone number.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A campaign that from the start zeroed in on Australia’s mortgage belt will be decided on the streets of outer Melbourne and Sydney, in regional Victoria and New South Wales.Labor and the Coalition are likely to win seats from each other in the mortgage belt but the X-factor in deciding who wins government will be whether the Greens pinch seats from Labor, and if Climate 200-backed independents grab a few more long-held Coalition seats.Coalition members shrug off the polls. They point to the 2019 numbers showing a likely Labor win that turned into Scott Morrison’s “miracle” victory, and they cite internal research showing the race in key seats is much closer than the national figures suggest. TheCoalitionexpect to pick up a few seats in outer Melbourne.Sharri Markson’s ‘exclusive inside information’ puts Coalition in poll position | Weekly BeastRead moreLabor, Greens and crossbench sources remain optimistic about holding or winning seats across the board, with the unpredictability of a growing third-party vote and the explosion in early voting being wildcards. The terms “toss-up” and “down to the wire” are common cliches uttered by political players across the parliament in numerous conversations we had this week for this article.The topline: Labor and the Liberals are downplaying the prospects of much shifting outside the mortgage belt seats in NSW and Victoria, where a number of seats are still up for grabs.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterBut senior Labor sources claim there is a real chance the party will retain majority government, even whispering about a potential increased majority. Labor believes Dutton is a less popular Liberal leader than Scott Morrison.Labor is confident of holding all its seats in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and sources believe the party has stemmed some of the bleeding in Sydney.The Liberal focus on Victoria, where the Coalition earlier talked up its chances of a decent haul, has narrowed to a handful of seats: Aston, Chisholm, McEwen and, at longer odds,Hawkeor Gorton. Labor sources are resigned to losing a few Victorian seats, conceding there are tough challenges especially in Aston and McEwen, which Dutton has visited many times during the campaign.The Coalition is adamant its internal research paints a rosier picture of marginal seats than that indicated by published polls. Labor is not talking up chances of grabbing Victoria’s ultra-marginal seats of Menzies or Deakin from the Liberals.3:19Voting 101: What are you actually voting for with your election ballots? - video“It is closer than the national polls are suggesting,” one Coalition source said. Another said it would be tighter than most people expected and downplayed the prospect of a Labor majority. A final blitz, including last-minute ad spending, could affect a few more seats.Liberal strategists are also quietly confident of gaining the NSW seats ofBennelong, Gilmore and Paterson and possiblyBullwinkel, Tangney andCurtinin Western Australia; there are whispers aboutWhitlam. Sources point to a last-minute Labor ad blitz in Boothby,Paterson and Robertson, and Albanese’s decision to hold events with Labor MPs in Bruce and Chisholm, as signs of Labor concern about those seats.Labor, conversely, believes it is on track to hold Tangney and win the new seat of Bullwinkel. ALP sources are also confident of hanging on to all the Hunter region seats, formerly high targets for the Coalition.Sources close to the Climate 200 movement admitted the race to win Curtin was proving tough. Held by the teal independent Kate Chaney, it is thought the first-term MP has her “nose in front”.The Liberals have relished stumbles from the teal independent Monique Ryan in Kooyong but one source admits winning back the seat after one term is a tough ask. They would also love Tim Wilson to win back Goldstein from the independent Zoe Daniel.Climate 200 sources believe the fight to win all the seats won by teal independents in the 2022 election will be a tough one but they believe they can hold them all against Liberal challengers, with Allegra Spender’s seat of Wentworth in Sydney considered safest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Climate 200 says the candidates it has backed in the Coalition-held seats of Cowper, Bradfield andWannonare doing well and may spring surprises on election night. The marginal seat of Forrest in WA, long held by the Liberals, could also be an interesting race, with a new teal candidate facing off against a new Liberal candidate.Australia’s mini and micro-parties: how to avoid a vote you might regret in the SenateRead moreLabor and the Liberals believe they stand a chance of winningBrisbane, and sources in the Greens – who hold that seat via the first-term MP Stephen Bates – admit it will be hard work to hold on to it.The Greens are more confident about holding on to the neighbouring seat of Griffith, held by Max Chandler-Mather, and they are increasingly positive about retaining Ryan in Brisbane’s western suburbs. Chandler-Mather, the outspoken housing spokesperson, has helped transform the Greens into a self-described “party for renters” – but Labor is desperate to dislodge him.The Greens remain confident of taking Labor’s Victorian seat of Wills, held by Peter Khalil, with their candidate Samantha Ratnam, the former state Greens leader. Labor believes it will hang on to Wills but the Greens believe there’s a groundswell of anger in north Melbourne about Labor’s position on the Gaza war and the cost of living that could push voters to the smaller party.There’s anotherthree-cornered contest in Macnamara, held by Labor’s Josh Burns. The Middle East conflict is also important to many voters in the Melbourne Port-side seat, which has a large Jewish community. The 2022 vote count between Labor, Liberals and the Greens was so close it took several days to finalise.The Greens are quietly confident of taking Richmond, centred on Byron Bay, from Labor’s Justine Elliott. The seat has a high proportion of renters, high house prices and several Greens sit on the local council. Adam Bandt visited the seat on Saturday with the party’s candidate, Mandy Nolan, to launch a plan to raise the aged pension.Labor believes it could win in Leichhardt, the north Queensland seat held by the retiring Liberal MP Warren Entsch. Anthony Albanese’s visit to the seat with the ALP candidate, Matt Smith, generated some of the more interesting photos of the campaign, with the former pro basketball player towering over the prime minister.Now for the wildcard: Labor has been throwing resources at Dickson, Dutton’s seat in Brisbane. Albanese visited Dickson on the first morning of the campaign and the party has dispatched a conga line of senior ministers to campaign there with the Labor candidate, Ali France. Albanese told Guardian Australia last week that Labor genuinely wanted to unseat Dutton, noting that Dickson was Queensland’s most marginal seat on 1.7%.Dutton has laughed off the challenge, saying he has always held on in tight contests. But one senior Labor source said that although the party wouldn’t bank its win just yet, internal polling showed the race was tight.Albanese’s path to majority government seems tough but Dutton’s is nearly invisible. A Labor minority is still considered by many as the most likely outcome. But with so many marginal seats and several electoral X-factors muddying the water, it would be a brave soul who would say what the final numbers will be.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsPeter DuttonAnthony AlbaneseCoalitionLabor partyAustralian GreensanalysisShareReuse this content"

After a bruising referendum campaign for Labor, Indigenous affairs has barely featured in this election campaign. So far,there has been scant detail about policies directly affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Labor says it remains committed to the “principles of truth-telling” but both parties have pledged to focus on practical rather than symbolic ways to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.Gambling ad banThe Albanese government was planning to introduce a range of reforms last year in response to a major inquiry into gambling harm that called for a total ban on ads after a three-year transition period. This never happened, thanks to pressure from broadcasters and sporting codes. No policy has been taken to this election by Labor. The Coalition has not changed its policy announced in mid-2023. Labor has vowed to do more if elected but has not provided any details. Inaction has beenhighlighted by several backbenchersin marginal seats.1:09'Let Rome burn': Coalition MP calls for blackouts in metropolitan Australia – videoEnvironmental protectionBefore the 2022 federal election, Labor vowed to introduce a national Environmental Protection Agency. This never happened, again, because of pressure from vested interests.Labor has flagged it would introduce some form of an agency if re-electedbut has not provided details on how it would differ from what it didn’t deliver in 2024.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThe Great Barrier ReefIn previous elections, the major parties were keen to splash cash on the reef to boost their environmental credentials and support the tourism industry. In 2022 Scott Morrison promised$1bn worth of conservation programsover the next decade. This year the Albanese government announced a $10m package for educational programs highlighting the importance of sustainable tourism. More than half of this money provides rebates for students to visit the reef. The major parties have mentioned the reef but the money committed to its protection is marginal compared with previous campaigns.JobseekerThe fortnightlywelfarepayment is only $781 for single people,helping keep about 858,000 Australians in poverty. A long list of organisations want it and the youth allowance increased buttheir callshave fallen on deaf ears in the major parties, although the crossbench and the Greens have highlighted the need for change.RentersThe major parties haveconcentrated on helping first home buyersbut have offered no support to renters and said little about affordable housing. The peak housing body Everybody’s Home wants limits onrent increases, longer tenancy agreements and national minimum standards. It has also asked for a more ambitious target of 940,000 social homes to be built within the next two decades.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its promise to begin by building the Sydney-Newcastle section was a flagship policy of its 2022 election campaign. Despite all that Labor has yet to announce a plan for high-speed rail. Meanwhile, the Coalition has talked down the project’s likely huge cost.Employment servicesCountless reviews and inquiries have found that Australia’s employment services system is expensive and ineffective but any talk of reforming it has been omitted from this campaign. Economic Justice Australia and the Antipoverty Centre wantthe mutual obligation systemabolished, with Acosscalling for an immediate end to the targeted compliance framework and automated payment suspensions.AirlinesLabor has largely avoided talking about aviation despite widespread discussion about Australia’s lack of airline competition, high air fares, poor service and speculation about the government’s relationship with Qantas. In contrast, the Coalition hasproposed loosening restrictions barring foreign airlines from operating domestic flightsto boost competition and reduce ticket costs – but this would be a trial limited to the Northern Territory.The NBNMention of the national broadband network,once an election-deciding issue, is notably absent from this campaign. There was a one-line mention of it from the prime minister in Labor’s campaign launch – just about the fibre-to-the-premises upgrade announced before the election, and saying Labor would keep the network in public hands – despite the Coalition ruling out privatising it. There has been no mention of the NBN so far from the Coalition. But the Liberal policy page says the party would “improve access to telecommunications and high-speed internet, including investing $3bn for further work on the NBN”.Social mediaLabor and the oppositionsupport a social media ban for users under the age of 16so the idea is not up for debate. Both parties also matched each other with $6m for digital literacy courses for school students. Perhaps not wanting to risk the ire of Donald Trump and the tech oligarchs, neither party has campaigned about regulating social media platforms, or getting Facebook, Google and TikTok to pay for news.Aged careThis was a huge issue in the 2022 election campaign but has so far barely rated a mention. It could be because the main parties supporteda new Aged Care Actbut the chair of Palliative Care Australia, Dr Peter Allcroft, is frustrated about how little has been said during the campaign about improving access to care in a sector that faces chronic workforce shortages.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025RentingTransportHousingPeter DuttonAnthony AlbaneseCoalitionnewsShareReuse this content"

In a drone attack on the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipro region, a person was killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded after a third consecutive night of assaults, the local governor, Serhiy Lysak, said.The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, described the coming week as “very critical” for US attempts to end the war, telling the American broadcaster NBC that the administration would need to “make a determination about whether this is an endeavour that we want to continue to be involved in”.He was speaking after what was described in diplomatic circles as a potentiallyhistoric meetingbetween Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the US president, albeit only a 15-minute conversation, on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday.Amid plea to build bridges at papal funeral, Trump has a revelation – about RussiaRead moreIn a social media post sent during his flight back to the US afterwards, Trump suggestedRussia was not committedto negotiating a ceasefire.“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” he wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.” He also implied he was considering further sanctions againstRussia.The meeting had been the two men’s first encounter since their highly antagonistic confrontation in the Oval Office two months ago.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Russia would not stop targeting sites used by the Ukrainian military, including those involving European contributions to aid Kyiv or connected to foreign fighting forces. He claimed in an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation that a residential building in Kyiv last week, which washit by a Russian missilekilling at least 12 people, had not been an “absolutely civilian” target.View image in fullscreenUkraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, met Donald Trump on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday.Photograph: Ukraine Presidency/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock“We will continue to target the sites used by the military ofUkraine, by some mercenaries from foreign countries and by instructors who the Europeans officially sent to help target Russian civilian sites,” he said in the interview, which was recorded on Thursday.Zelenskyy denied Moscow’s claims made on Saturday that Ukraine’s army had been forced out of Russia’s Kursk region. “Our military continues to actively defend the designated areas of the Kursk and Belgorod regions,” he wrote on Telegram, admitting that the situation remained difficult in those, and many other, areas.Ukraine’s army has dismissed as “propaganda tricks” Russia’s claims to have carried out the “full liberation” of the Kursk region, where Ukraine made considerable gains during a surprise offensive in August 2024.Zelenskyy said the tense situation on the frontlines and the position of the Russian army were an indication of the inadequacy of the “current pressure on Russia to end this war”. He said increased pressure on Moscow could bring more opportunities for “real diplomacy”.A carve-up in gift wrapping: Trump’s peace plan puts the sacrifice on UkraineRead moreIn Moscow, a man suspected of killing a Russian general in a car bomb explosion on Friday has said he was paid by the Ukrainian security service to carry out the deed, according to Russian authorities who said he had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges.Ignat Kuzinsaid he had received payment from Ukraine for killing Lt Gen Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the general staff of the Russian armed forces, who died just outside Moscow on Friday after a car bomb exploded as he was walking past.Ukraine has yet to respond to the accusations that it was involved in the second attack of its kind in four months in which a high-ranking Russian military officer was killed.Asked in his Sunday appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press about possible concessions to Russia, Rubio stressed the need to be “grownups and realistic”.“There is no military solution to this war. The only solution to this war is a negotiated settlement where both sides are going to have to give up something they claim to want and are going to have to give the other side something they wish they didn’t,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeMarco RubioDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

I often say that I absorbed the Holocaust with my mother’s milk – that’s how deeply it is connected to me.”Accompanying about 180 British Jews, including survivors and their relatives, the UK’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, read a psalm.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner was among those in attendance.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PALola Hassid Angel, 88, from Greece, described the camp in an interview with the Guardian earlier this month as “an abomination that historians will one day refer to as a dark page but which we, as the last survivors, are duty-bound to describe”.At the ceremony, another survivor, 100-year-oldAlbrecht Weinberg, from Germany, recalled being taken half-dead by train from Auschwitz to Belsen. “I found myself lying amid the dead and the living on a wagon in Bergen-Belsen. Our bodies were tipped out. Two days later, a tank drove in. I thought now I’ll finally be freed by death, but it was British soldiers coming to liberate us. They later told me I’d weighed 29kg [4st 8lb].”At the time in April 1945, the Guardianreportedhow a senior medical officer with the British army had witnessed thousands of typhus, typhoid and tuberculosis cases on entering the camp, calling it “the most horrible, frightful place” he had ever seen.“There was a pile – 60 to 80 yards long, 30 yards wide, and 4ft high – of the unclothed bodies of women all within sight of several hundred children. Gutters were filled with rotting dead and men had come to the gutters to die, using the kerbstones as back rests,” the correspondent David Woodward wrote.‘I want to tell the world’: Bergen-Belsen survivor recounts horrors of HolocaustRead moreAccounts from the camp by soldiers and journalists were spread around the world and proved more shocking in many ways than other discoveries of death camps to the east, such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Auschwitz, as they had either been demolished to hide evidence of the crimes committed there, or emptied of their inmates, who, like Weinberg, were sent on death marches.At Belsen, the camp construction and the evidence of what had taken place there remained intact. Some of the Nazi soldiers involved in the death machine were still on site.The sheer number of prisoners and the conditions at the camp led to mass outbreaks of dysentery, typhus and malnutrition, leading to about 500 deaths a day, most during the final weeks of the war. A documented 14,000 survivors died by the end of June 1945, many of whose digestive systems had been unable to cope with the food they were given after the liberation of the camp.Explore more on these topicsHolocaustSecond world warGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities have refused to give more details other than saying forensic evidence had been gathered and a coroner’s report submitted.According to the local broadcaster NDR, citing police sources, Fröhlich was shot. Investigators have issued an appeal for potential witnesses who may have observed suspicious activity on or around the long cerise houseboat in which Fröhlich resided, on the Holzhafen bank of the Elbe River in the eastern Moorfleet district.Her son discovered her body on Tuesday morning, according to police, who believe she died between midnight and 5.30am.“According to current information, relatives found the 58-year-old woman lifeless on her houseboat and alerted the fire brigade, who were only able to confirm the woman’s death,” a police spokesperson told local media.“After evaluating traces and evidence, the investigating authorities now believe that the woman died as a result of violence.”The spokesperson said investigators were looking into possible suspects and whether the killer may have been known to Fröhlich. “Given the ongoing investigation, no further information can be provided at this time,” he said.Media reported that divers were at the scene of the crime, amid speculation that the weapon could have been thrown into the Elbe.Fröhlich started out as a journalist, initially in Ukraine where she founded a women’s magazine in Kyiv. She later worked as a freelance journalist in Germany for women’s and other magazines such as Stern, before turning her hand to writing novels.In 2012 she published her debut novel, My Russian Mother-in-Law and other Catastrophes, which she said was based on her own experience of being married to a Russian.It entered the bestseller list of Der Spiegel magazine, one of the closest-observed indicators of fiction and nonfiction sales in Germany, where it remained for several months. It was subsequently translated into French. A critic at the time described it as “a hilarious west-east satire”.In 2016 she published the crime novel Death is a Certainty, which was similarly successful, and in 2019 she followed this with Skeletons in the Closet. Both were published by Penguin. Her novels were characterised by a mix of humour, family tales and social topics.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s sad that we don’t get popes like this very often.”View image in fullscreenPeople queue to visit the tomb of Pope Francis.Photograph: Fabio Cimaglia/EPAMany of those mourning the late pope were anxious about who would succeed him.Romina Cacciatore, 48, an Argentinian translator living inItaly, said Pope Francis had transformed the Roman Catholic church into “something more normal, more human. I’m worried about what’s coming.”Maria Simoni, 53, from Rome, said: “I hope we get another pope as skilled as Francis at speaking to people’s hearts, at being close to every person, no matter who they are.”Tatiana Alva, 49, from Peru, said Francis had been “very kind, humble. He used language young people could understand. I don’t think the next pope can be the same but I hope he will have an open mind and be realistic about the challenges in the world right now.”A special mass was held on Sunday morning in St Peter’s Square led by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, who is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Francis. About 200,000 people attended, according to theVatican.More than 220 cardinals will meet at the Vatican on Monday morning to decide the date that the conclave to elect the next pope will begin.Only cardinals under the age of 80 – 135 in total – are eligible to take part inthe conclave, which will begin its deliberations after the completion of nine days of official mourning for Francis.Something to look up to: how Michelangelo’s love and humility could influence the Sistine Chapel conclaveRead moreJean-Claude Hollerich, a cardinal from Luxembourg, has said he expects the conclave to start within a day or two of the end of the mourning period on 4 May. It must start by 10 May.Reinhard Marx, a German cardinal, said on Saturday the conclave would last just “a few days”.The cardinal-electors – about 80% of whom were appointed by Francis – will cast four votes a day until one candidate secures a two-thirds majority.

In mid-April, Latvia’s parliament became the first to formallyback the idea, after lawmakers voted to pull out of the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which bans the use, production and stockpiling of landmines designed for use against humans.Campaigners described the decisions – the first reversals among its more than 165 signatories – as a shocking step backwards.“It feels like a punch to the face,” said Zoran Ješić, who lost his right leg to a landmine in Bosnia and now leads UDAS, a Bosnian organisation that supports landmine survivors. “Antipersonnel landmines do horrible things to innocent people. They belong to a small group of weapons, including chemical and biological weapons, that are so abhorrent they must never be used again.”Ješić was a 21-year-old soldier for the Bosnian army when he stepped on a mine in a forest, leaving him grappling with a lifetime of trauma and disability. “As I later heard, it was our mine,” said Ješić. “The point is that when you put a mine in the ground, you never know what will happen. Will it wait for your soldiers, your civilians or the enemies? Usually, it hurts your people.”His view is backed up by statistics. Each yearbetween70% and 85% of those who are killed or injured by landmines around the world are civilians. Nearly half of these victims are children, hinting at the indiscriminate nature of these weapons.Campaigners had long assumed that there was little probability of countries reversing their stances against landmines, said Alma Taslidžan of Humanity & Inclusion, which works to help disabled and vulnerable people around the world. “We really thought this kind of movement could never happen with landmines, because who wants landmines?”Instead her organisation and many others have been left scrambling to again warn of the overwhelming dangers of these weapons.“This is really a tipping point for us,” said Taslidžan. “It’s not only about landmines. It is about the norms that are written for the situation of wartimes – we’re afraid this is going to create a wave of weakening the international humanitarian law that has the first obligation to protect civilians.”The first public hint of the reversals came in March, when the defence ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland publisheda joint statementexplaining their interest in leaving the treaty.“Military threats to Nato member states borderingRussiaand Belarus have significantly increased,” the statement noted. “With this decision, we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our security needs.”Russia, which is not a signatory to the 1997 treaty, has used landmines extensively since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in-turn helping to make the country themost heavily minedin the world.Soon after, Finland, whose shared border with Russia runs for more than 800 miles, joined the list of countries threatening to leave the treaty.Doing so, the country’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, told reporters, would give the country “the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way”.Taslidžan stressed that there was little argument about the threat the five Nato countries were facing. “The security situation is real, it is a problem,” she said. “But choosing the most indiscriminate weapon amongst all to say that you are going to defend your country, that is wrong. Security cannot be built on a weapon that kills indiscriminately, that remains in the ground long after the conflict has ended and that specifically maims civilians.”Some of these countries’ readiness to embrace these long-banned weapons was likely due to misinformation that had circulated about “smart landmines” capable of curtailing civilian harms, she said. “It’s just bizarre information. There is not a smart landmine that can think for itself and say ‘Oh oh, civilians, we won’t explode now.’”While some landmines come with self-destruct mechanisms that enable them to detonate after a set period of time, campaigners have pointed out that they remain incapable of distinguishing between civilians and soldiers and thatmalfunction ratescan run as high as 10%, meaning a significant number may fail to destroy on command.At the International Committee of the Red Cross, the potential reversals were being seen as “extremely alarming,” said Maya Brehm, the legal adviser for the organisation’s unit focused on arms and conduct of hostilities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conflicts inSyria, Myanmar and Ukraine haveled to an uptickin the number of landmine victims, while funding cuts threatened by US president Donald Trump’s administrationhave leftmine-clearance projects around the world facing uncertainty.Brehm worried that the withdrawals could set a wider precedent by suggesting that states could adopt rules in times of peace and later abandon these rules in times of conflict. “These treaties are for the protection of people, they’re humanitarian treaties. They are meant to be upheld at the darkest of times, when civilians depend on their protection for their very survival.”The concern was echoed by Norway’s foreign affairs minister, Espen Barth Eide, in explaining why the country, which also borders Russia, was opting to remain in the treaty.“This particular decision [by Finland] is something we regret,” he told Reutersthis month. “If we start weakening our commitment, it makes it easier for warring factions around the world to use these weapons again, because it reduces the stigma.”In Bosnia and Herzegovina, where conflict in the early 1990s left behind anestimated3 million unexploded landmines – amounting to about 152 mines per square mile – landmines continue to be a threat for many, said Ješić from the Bosnian organisation that provides support to landmine victims.“We’re not even close to having a land free of mines,” he added. “This is not just something that you can put in the ground and then you take it out when the war finishes.”As a result, three decades after the factions had put down their weapons, the lingering landmineshad perpetuatedthe violence, killing and injuring hundreds across the country.Ješić described it as a cautionary tale for any country thinking about scattering these weapons across their lands. “Tens of decades will probably be needed to clear the land of mines,” he said. “And in the meantime, who knows how many civilians will be killed and hurt by this terrible weapon.”Explore more on these topicsWeapons technologyEuropeHuman rightsUkraineRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli military issued an evacuation warning before the bombing, prompting panic as residents fled the area.A spokesperson for the Israeli army said in a post on X that Israeli warplanes destroyed storage sites housing Hezbollah precision missiles.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the defence minister, Israel Katz, said in a joint statement: “Israel will not allow Hezbollah to grow stronger and pose any threat to it – anywhere inLebanon.”The Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, called on the US and France – both partners in the Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire deal – to put pressure on Israel to stop its strikes on Lebanon.“The ongoing Israeli attacks on Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are unacceptable under any pretext,” Aoun said.Israel’s strikes on the greater Beirut area on Sunday pointed to the fragility of a November ceasefire agreement that put an end to evermore than 13 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Fighting started after Hezbollah launched rockets at northern Israel on 8 October 2023 “in solidarity” with its ally Hamas’s attack on southern Israel a day earlier.In late September, Israel launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon and wide-ranging airstrikes across Lebanon that killed about 3,900 people and displaced almost a million people in Lebanon.Despite the implementation of the ceasefire, Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes across Lebanon since November, which it says are targeting members of Hezbollah or the group’s infrastructure.Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for one rocket attack in north Israel which it called a “warning shot” since the ceasefire. Two additional rockets were launched at Israel from Lebanon in March, which Lebanese authoritiesblamedon a separate armed group.As of yet, Hezbollah has not responded to the near-daily Israeli strikes, instead deferring to the Lebanese state. The capabilities of the group, most of whose senior leadership have been killed over the last two years of fighting, are severely diminished.Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah is to withdraw and be replaced by the Lebanese army south of the Litani river – about 18 miles from the Israel-Lebanon border – and Israel is to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon. Most Israeli troops have withdrawn from south Lebanon, with the exception of five military points it maintains in Lebanon.Ceasefire violations in south Lebanon are meant to be referred to an independent committee and addressed by the Lebanese army, but Lebanese officials have complained that Israel is bypassing this process by unilaterally conducting strikes in Lebanon.The UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert,saidSunday’s strike “generated panic and fear of renewed violence among those desperate for a return to normalcy”.Since the end of the fighting, Lebanon’s government has worked towards reestablishing a monopoly on arms within the country, under immense US pressure to disarm the group.Previously, the Iran-backed militia and political party’s resources dwarfed the Lebanese army, and the group dominated domestic politics for the two decades preceding the latest Israel-Hezbollah war.Hezbollah has said that it is in compliance with the terms of the ceasefire agreement as far as withdrawing from south Lebanon but its leader, Naim Qassem, said in an April speech that the group “will not let anyone disarm it”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelLebanonHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They are now empty.“There isn’t anything left to give them now, so once the last supplies have been used up, the kitchens will have to close,” said one senior UN official. “At the moment people are holding up OK but we know from other crises that when things deteriorate, they deteriorate very fast, and we are not far from that point.”Within hours of the ceasefire’s collapse almost two months ago, Israel blocked food, fuel, medicine or other items from entering Gaza. Dozens of bakeries that provided bread for hundreds of thousands have already shut down.The 47 community kitchens, which provide only lentils, plain pasta or rice, have already reduced portions.“These people who depend on us are threatened with starvation if this kitchen closes,” said Hani Abu Qasim, of the Rafah Charity Kitchen in Gaza.Markets across Gaza are nearly bare and anything on sale is now too expensive for the vast majority.Since the end of the ceasefire, the price of a kilogram of tomatoes has quadrupled to $8, sugar has gone up seven times and flour 10 to 15 times. Meat or dairy products are unobtainable.Um Aboud, 45, an academic and journalist in Gaza City, said: “We eat two meals a day, sometimes just one. We have only a small amount of food left.“The living conditions are extremely difficult. Hospitals are destroyed, with no treatment or medicine available. There is no clean water or electricity. Garbage surrounds us from every direction. Gaza has become a disease-ridden place. People are dying slowly, as if we have been sentenced to death.”Almost70% of Gazais now covered by evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military or is part of an expanded buffer zone controlled by Israeli troops. More than 400,000 people have been displaced since the collapse of the ceasefire.Israeli officials justify the blockade with claims that Hamas routinely steals aid, distributing it to its fighters or selling it to raise vital funds. Aid officials in Gaza deny any widespread theft of aid in recent months.In a sprawling tent camp outside the southern city of Khan Younis, Mariam al-Najjar and her mother-in-law prepared a meal for their family of 11 with four cans of peas and carrots, some rice, stock cubes and spices.View image in fullscreenThe al-Najjar family eats peas with rice – the family sometimes eat just one meal a day.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APBefore the war, her family would eat a large meal of meat, stuffed vegetables or other traditional dishes on Fridays, Najjar said. “Now we eat peas and rice. We never ate canned peas before the war. Only in this war that has destroyed our lives.”The UN said it identified 3,700 children suffering from acute malnutrition in March, up 80% from February.Specialists from the UN’shunger monitoring system, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), are preparing a new assessment in Gaza, to be released next month, UN officials in Gaza said.There is also a growing shortage of medical supplies. “Everything from sterile gloves to body bags needs replenishment,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said. “This is an ongoing and particularly acute challenge as we unfortunately continue to see shockingly high numbers of sick people, including severely wounded patients, which increases pressure on the system.”The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel in October 2023, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say 59 hostages remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are thought to be dead.Israel says its blockade also aims to force Hamas into releasing hostages. Rights groups accuse Israel of using a “starvation tactic”, endangering the entire population and so making it a potential war crime.Hospitals in Gaza received the remains of 51 Palestinians over the past 24 hours who were killed in Israeli strikes, the local health ministry said on Sunday, bringing the Palestinian death toll from the war to 52,243.The overall toll includes nearly 700 bodies for which the documentation process was recently completed, the ministry said in its latest update.On Monday, the international court of justice (ICJ), the United Nation’s principal court, willbegin hearingsto establish if Israel’sban on all cooperationwith Unrwa’s activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank is unlawful. Israel claims Unrwa has been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested.South Africafiled a complaintwith the ICJ in December 2023 alleging Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, which Israel denies.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The death toll had risen to at least 28 and the numbers injured had risen to more than 1,000.Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, flew to Bandar Abbas, a city 20 miles to the west of the port in Hormozgan province, to be briefed on the investigation and rescue operation.With choking smoke and air pollution spreading across the area, schools and offices in Bandar Abbaswere ordered closed on Sunday, state TV reported. The health ministry urged residents to avoid going outside until further notice and to use protective masks.Early indications were that the explosion appears to have been an accident rather than a deliberate attack. The Tehran prosecutor’s office said it had filed charges against a variety of media outlets of different political persuasions, a reflection of officials’ concern at speculation that the explosion was an act of terror or due to mistakes by the army.CCTV footage circulating on Iranian media showed a localised fire starting five minutes after midday in a single container and then spreading rapidly to other containers, and port workers starting to run away. A vast explosion then occurs within two minutes, knocking out the camera.View image in fullscreenCCTV image of people running from a fire at the port.Photograph: Social Media/ReutersThe interior ministry launched an inquiry. No official explanation has been given for the explosion yet but there were growing reports that the storage of chemicals in containers in high temperatures may have been to blame.Evidence of previous, smaller incidents was being cited, as well as claims that much of the regime surrounding health and safety protocols, especially concerning the inspection of chemical storage, had been contracted out.The Kremlin website said Putin had conveyed his “words of sincere sympathy and support to the families of the victims as well as his wishes for a recovery to all those injured”.Russiadispatched planes carrying specialist firefighters.The explosion happened just as a third round of talks between the US and Iran started, designed to lead to fresh controls being placed on Iran’s nuclear programme in return for the lifting of US sanctions.The Iranian foreign ministry described the talks, mediated by Oman and held in Muscat, as serious, practical and more detailed than those previously. Another round of talks is due to be held in a week’s time.Explore more on these topicsIranRussiaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel ended all contact and cooperation with Unrwa operations in Gaza, West Bank and East Jerusalem in November, claiming the agency had been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been contested.Unrwa supplies food, schooling and medical services to 2 million people inGaza. The UN World Food Programme said on Friday it had run out of stocks for kitchens serving hot food inside Gaza. The Unrwa commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, accused Israel of engineering a human-made famine, and even the US president, Donald Trump, said he had urged Israel to allow food into Gaza.A total of 45 countries and organisations, including the UN itself, have requested an advisory opinion from the 15-strong judging panel on Israel’s actions. The only countries likely to defend Israel in court are the US and Hungary.Israel has submitted a written defence, but is not due to make an oral submission this week.The hearings represent the biggest test of Israel’s defiance of international law since the ICJ’s landmark rulings in January, March and June of 2024 that ordered it to take immediate steps to allow aid to enter Gaza unhindered. In July 2024, the ICJ also found Israel’s occupation of thePalestinian territorieswas unlawful.Israel has largely refused to comply with the advisory orders attached to these rulings, adding to the crisis of confidence in the credibility of the international legal system.The Palestinian rights group Al-Haq said it was “imperative” that Israel’s seat at the UN general assembly be withdrawn if Israel ignored another ICJ advisory opinion, saying the public’s faith in international law “hangs in the balance”.The legal challenge arose from a 137 to 12 vote at the UN general assembly in December to seek an ICJ advisory opinion on whether Israel, as a signatory to the UN charter, was violating the immunities and privileges that member states are required to give to UN bodies such as Unrwa.The agency does not just supply aid to Palestinians, but also runs medical services and schools in Gaza,West Bankand neighbouring states. Six Unrwa schools in East Jerusalem have already been shut, the subject of a separate domestic court challenge brought by Adalah, a Palestinian legal rights group.Israel ends mention of humanitarian zones as Gaza war grinds onRead moreThe UN’s legal claim is backed by more than 1,500 pieces of documentation, including proceedings of the UN security council, the general assembly and UN agencies setting out Unrwa’s genesis, its status within the UN structure and its 1967 operational agreements with Israel.The ICJ, as the UN’s top court responsible for inter-state disputes, sets store by UN findings. The UN will be represented by its new legal counsel, Elinor Hammarskjöld, a Swedish lawyer and diplomat.At issue are two Knesset bills passed on 28 October that declared Unrwa harboured terrorists, and instructed the government to end all cooperation and contact with the organisation, including the supply of visas to Unrwa international staff. It has become part of a wider Israeli threat to withhold visas to staff of NGOs that criticise Israel.On 2 March, Israel, independently of its decision to freeze out Unrwa, suspended the supply of all aid into Gaza in a bid to crush Hamas. France, Germany and the UK last week condemned as unacceptable remarks by the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, linking the supply of aid to political pressure on Hamas.In a version of the Israeli government’s defence, UK Lawyers for Israel said in a paper last week that Israel had a right to terminate its agreement with Unrwa and to ban the UN and its agencies from carrying out activities on its sovereign territory, especially in wartime. Moreover, Israel was free to choose how to comply with its obligations to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population, and was not required to do so under the auspices of Unrwa, the paper claimed.The group also claims that the ICJ does not have the capacity, or neutrality, to determine a case that largely turns on disputed facts, including whether Unrwa had been fatally infiltrated by Hamas, and whether alternatives to Unrwa such as the WFP can deliver aid.In what looked like a shot across UN’s bows before the case, the US justice department told the New York district court on Thursday that Unrwa and its staff did not enjoy immunity in the US courts, reversing the Biden administration’s view. The move, in theory, opens the way for victims of Hamas terrorism to seek compensation from Unrwa officials.In a measure of the existential crisis facing Unrwa, the UN has appointed a former British diplomat, Ian Martin, to undertake a review of the agency’s future role and finances.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaInternational court of justiceMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesRefugeesUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

His words echoed previous statements where he vowed to hunt down the attackers “to the ends of the Earth” and turn terrorist hideouts “into dust”.The missiles launched are designed for powerful, long-range, high-precision strikes. The navy stressed the importance of the drills in maintaining “operational” readiness as military rhetoric intensified on both sides.Pakistan’s railway minister, Hanif Abbasi, warned over the weekend that the country’s nuclear arsenal of more than 130 missiles was “not kept as models” and was aimed “only for India … these ballistic missiles, all of them are targeted at you”.The domestic pressures shaping India’s response to Kashmir attacksRead moreAbbasi’s comments fuelled concerns the nuclear-armed neighbours were headed for a wider confrontation. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two overKashmir, which each holds in part but claims in full. They have come to the brink many other times, leading the former US president Bill Clinton to call the Himalayan region the world’s “most dangerous place”.Pakistan’s military doctrine of Full Spectrum Deterrence focuses on using tactical nuclear weapons to deter conventional threats, while India’s Cold Start doctrine is designed to deliver swift conventional strikes before escalation. These contrasting strategies have raised fears any confrontation could quickly spin out of control.“From Delhi’s perspective, given public pressure, the egregiousness of last week’s attack, and a desire to restore deterrence, some type of military response is quite likely. And if it happens, Pakistan, not wishing to look weak, would most certainly retaliate,” said the foreign policy author and analyst Michael Kugelman.“An all-out war is unlikely, as India, despite its relentless tough talk, is most focused on limited options like degrading anti-Indian terrorists and restoring deterrence,” he said.“That said, one can’t completely rule out worst-case scenarios, depending on the nature of a potential Indian strike, how Pakistan might respond to any initial Indian military action, and the ever-present miscalculation risk,” Kugelman added. “And given that these are nuclear-armed rivals, the stakes are quite high.”New Delhi has accused Islamabad of links to the attack, in which terrorists singled out Hindu men and killed them. While presenting no public proof, it has pointed to Islamabad’s past support for terrorists targeting India.In tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus waters treaty, expelled Pakistani diplomats, and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians’ visas, closing its airspace, and suspending the 1972 Shimla agreement, a key dialogue framework.While Modi’s speech marked a continued commitment to retaliation, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, sounded more conciliatory, saying Pakistan was “fully prepared to cooperate with any neutral investigators” and reaffirmed “Pakistan’s strong desire for peace”. At the same time, he reiterated Kashmir remained Pakistan’s “jugular vein”, a position enunciated by the late founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.As tensions escalated, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged fire on Sunday for a third day along the line of control dividing Kashmir, a frequent flashpoint.Fuelling speculation about possible Indian military action, India’s information ministry issued a media advisory warning against live broadcasting of military operations. Echoing concerns from past crises such as the 1999 Kargil war and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the advisory reflected fears about real-time broadcasts compromising sensitive strategies.In Kashmir, Indian forces have launched an extensive crackdown. Security forces have targeted suspected terrorists, demolishing at least 10 homes linked to militants as part of a wider effort to dismantle what India calls the “terrorism ecosystem”. Rights groups have raised concerns, and reports have estimated up to 1,500 young men have been detained or questioned.Tensions have flared over water usage. India’s release of water from the Uri Dam caused the Jhelum River to surge, flooding parts of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It followed India’s suspension of the treaty governing the region’s rivers. Pakistan has warned any water interference would be an “act of war”.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanNarendra ModiKashmirSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Just 7% of Britons think the economy will improve, while 13% thought it would stay the same, equating to a net score of -68.IMF warns of ‘major negative shock’ from Trump’s tariffsRead moreEY’s forecast said it now expects UK gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 0.8% this year, down from a projection of 1% in February, and has cut its 2026 forecast from 1.6% to 0.9% as longer-term effects hit the UK.Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded itsgrowth forecast for the UK this year to 1.1%, from the 1.6% it had been forecasting as recently as January, while the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the UK faced a“growth shock”from Trump’s trade policies.About 16% of UK goods exports go to the US – where there is a “baseline” 10% import tariff for most countries and 25% for cars, steel and aluminium – which will directly affect growth by driving down demand for UK products.However, EY Item Club said that the bigger hit is likely to come from the indirect impact of the new policies weighing on British consumers already cautious about committing to spending on bigger ticket items. Businesses are also likely to limit the amount they invest over the next two years as a result.Research indicates British businesses are reacting to potential supply chain disruption from tariffs by targeting new export markets in Asia, Africa and Australia.Expanding or exporting overseas is a top priority for almost a third of mid-size UK businesses over the next year, a survey of 500 businesses by advisory and accountancy firm BDO found.Overall, almost 40% of firms polled expect to increase exports over the next year, rising to more than half of businesses in the retail, wholesale and tech sectors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Earl described him as a “big character with lots of energy”.She said: “Sam is very, very present on social media, he’s such a passionate person about sports.“He flew on the 13th, I’ve got confirmation that he landed, I absolutely know Sam was in Vegas. The concerning part is he went silent from the 16th and, because he is such a big presence on social media, people were quite fast to notice.”Earl said Ruddock was an “infectious” person and a “phenomenal” human being. She said she has started a social media campaign to try to get information.A spokesperson for British Cycling said: “British Cycling understands that para-cyclist Sam Ruddock was reported missing to UK and US police and Interpol after not being heard from since Wednesday 16 April 2025, while visiting Las Vegas, USA.“We urge anyone who has been in contact with Sam since 16 April or may have any information of his whereabouts to contact their local police department as soon as possible.”Lincolnshire police confirmed it has an active missing person investigation for Ruddock.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British man reported missing in Las Vegas and are in contact with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsSportParalympicsGBWarwickshireLas VegasnewsShareReuse this content"

We believe it was an isolated incident.”Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, said he had spoken to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, on Sunday afternoon and would remain in touch with her as well as the security minister, Dan Jarvis, regarding aspects of the incident.“I want to thank local people and the blue light services in how they responded to this and the fact that the area has now been cleared and is no longer a live crime scene,” he said.“The broader implications of an attack in which lethal weapons were found in a very busy area where the country’s most populous pub crawl takes place is a real concern,” he added.Sobel said he would be raising the issue of the availability of weapons linked to the incident, and how to keep people safe when they are standing in large groups and queueing.Counter-terror police are examining a number of Facebook posts – including one which appeared to include plans for a “mass-murder” attack – to determine if they are linked to the attacker or the incident.The post appeared before the attack on a Facebook account that indicated far-right sympathies as well as reflecting the “mixed ideology” that has increasingly been on the radar of counter-terrorism police.The posts listed as “targets” students, nightclub goers and “neurotypicals”. Reference was made to a “manifesto” written by a man who killed 51 people during shootings at a mosque and Islamic centre in New Zealand in 2019.Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told the Guardian that it had taken action to remove an account apparentlyassociated with the incident.The home secretary received further updates on Sunday from counter-terrorism police after she was first briefed in the wake of the attack.The incident caused shock across the community in the Headingley area of Leeds over the weekend, where large numbers of students and others routinely take part in the pub crawl route, days before the summer term starts for many university courses.One venue, Taylor’s Sports Bar and Grill, remained closed all weekend due to the police investigation but posted on Facebook that it intended to reopen on Monday,“While appalling to witness some of the scenes first-hand, lowlife scum like this will never win in our society,” the statement added.A member of staff at another bar said they had seen dozens of emergency service vehicles descend on the area on Saturday afternoon after the attack, although it took hours for people to become fully aware of what had happened.“We were told and were on high alert, but otherwise you wouldn’t have known. It wasn’t until the evening that people started asking about it,” they said. “I think people have been really shaken by it.”A fortnight ago, the Guardian revealed that counter-terrorism police and the National Crime Agency had set up a new joint taskforce to tackle young males fixated with violence online which is often also fuelled by “strongly misogynistic” online material.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I’d be absolutely gobsmacked if it wasn’t a record crowd.”Those running includedSergio Aguiar and David Stancombe, who were raising money for projects set up in their daughters’ memory after they were murdered in the Southport attack. Both finished in just over four hours; however, Aguair collapsed to the ground shortly after crossing the line.In a video message, played to the families before the race, Keir Starmer paid tribute to the two men, who lost their daughters Alice Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, while they attended a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in July.View image in fullscreenBritish Olympic triathlon gold medallist Alex Yee came 14th in his debut marathon.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“This is an incredible way to honour the memory of your precious daughters and the entire nation is in awe of your courage and your resilience,” the UK prime minister said.The finishers also includedLindsay Burrow, the wife of rugby league great Rob Burrow, who died in June 2024 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2019. Burrow, who said that running had given her a “focus and purpose”, finished the race in just under five hours.Thewomen’s race was won by the Ethiopian Tigist Assefa, who set a new women’s-only world record of 2:15.50. However, that record, which applies to races without a male pacemaker, was six minutes behind the official women’s record, set last year.View image in fullscreenEilish McColgan crosses the line to finish eighth in the London Marathon women’s race on Sunday 27 April.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEilish McColgan was the leading British woman home, coming eighth in her first marathon in a time of 2:24.25 – although it was several minutes slower than she had hoped after the warmer than expected weather.“I was just determined to put one foot in front of the other,” she said. “I think if you look at a lot of British athletes, everyone was a little bit off where they wanted. Maybe it did have a bit more of an impact than we thought.”View image in fullscreenHugh Brasher.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersMeanwhile in the men’s race,won by the Kenyan Sabastian Sawe, there was a creditable performance by Britain’s Olympic triathlon gold medallist Alex Yee.Yee, who was running in his first marathon, finished in 2:11.8, and afterwards paid tribute to the crowds. “That was seriously tough but probably one of the best moments of my life,” he said. “I expected the crowds to be good but that was a whole other level.“I am just immensely proud to have run the London Marathon,” he added. “Obviously, in the second half I faded quite a lot. But I am so proud to be part of such an amazing day.”The Guinness World Records team were also kept busy, with 42 unusual records being set – including by Chris “Rhino Boy” Green, who broke one for the most marathons run in a 3D costume.‘The costume develops its own microclimate’: what it’s like to run a marathon in a novelty outfitRead more“You could not find a happier rhino right now,” said Green after completing his 113rd marathon as a rhino and raising money for the Save the Rhino charity.As the day came to an end, Brasher said that the celebration and joy he had seen once again painted London in its best light.“Three-quarters of the people out there are running for a charity – and everyone has a reason to run,” he said. “People have asked: ‘Why are you trying to break the world record for finishers?’ But it’s not about that.“What we’re trying to do is give as many people as we can the opportunity to experience something that is life affirming, that is community building, that is good for their physical and mental health, and truly will give them an experience like no other.”And, once again, the London Marathon duly delivered.Explore more on these topicsLondon MarathonRunningAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sit down and sign the deal. We have the confines of a deal, I believe, and I want him to sign it and be done with it.”“Do you trust President Putin?” Trump was asked.“I’ll let you know in about two weeks,” Trump said. Pressed to elaborate on what he expects to happen in two weeks, Trump evaded the question. “Two weeks or less,” he said, vaguely, “but you know they’re losing a lot of people. We have 3, 4,000 people dying every week.”Trump also said that his relationship with Zelenskyy was improved by the face-to-face at the Vatican: “Look, it was never bad. We had a little dispute, because I disagreed with something he said, and the cameras were rolling and that was OK with me.”“Look, he’s in a tough situation, a very tough situation. He’s fighting a much bigger force, much bigger,” Trump added. The president then repeated his frequent false claim that the United States had givenUkraine$350bn to aid its defense from the Russian invasion.“I see him as calmer,” Trump said, comparing the Zelenskyy he met at the Vatican with the one he confronted in the Oval Office in February. “I think he understands the picture, and I think he wants to make a deal.”The president also claimed that there had been “a little bit” of progress in trade talks with China, talks that Chinese officials have said are not taking place. “They want to make a deal, obviously,” Trump said. “Now, they’re not doing any business with us, you know, because, not because of them, because of me. Because at 145%, you can’t do business,” he said, in reference to the import tariff rate he imposed this month. “But something’s going to happen, that’s going to be possible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The unorthodox policy and the frequent avoidance of due process has brought about aclash with the judicialbranch of the US government in a battle over the constitution.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the National Immigration Project and several other allied groups said in a statement that such actions are a “shocking – although increasingly common – abuse of power”.The US district judge Terry Doughty in Monroe,Louisiana, said the two-year-old girl, who was referred to as VML in court documents, was sent with her deported mother to Honduras.Denied, detained, deported: the most high-profile cases in Trump’s immigration crackdownRead more“It is illegal and unconstitutional to deport, detain for deportation, or recommend deportation of a US citizen,” said the judge.He scheduled a hearing for 19 May “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”.VML was apprehended by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on Tuesday with her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, and older sister when Villela attended a routine appointment at itsNew Orleansoffice, according to a filing by Trish Mack, who said the child’s father asked her to act as the child’s custodian. The girl’s father is seeking to have her returned to the United States.Immigrants of all sorts with cases in process, pending appeals or parole, have routinely been required to regularlycheck in with Ice officers, sometimes for many years. And so long as they had not violated any regulations or committed any crimes, they were usually sent on their way. Now, as the Trump administration pushes for the massarrestanddeportationof immigrants, check-ins have become increasingly fraught.According to Mack, when VML’s father briefly spoke to Villela, he could hear her and the children crying. According to a court document, he reminded her that a US citizen “could not be deported”.However, prosecutors said Villela, who has legal custody, told Ice that she wanted to retain custody of the girl and take her toHonduras. They said the man claiming to be VML’s father had not presented himself to Ice despite requests to do so.VML is not prohibited from entering the US, federal prosecutors said.She was among two families deported from Louisiana, also including one pregnant woman, the advocacy groups noted.The Department of Homeland Security and the justice department did not immediately respond to requests from news agencies for comment.Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, later sent a statement to the Guardian that read: “This parent made the decision to take the child with them toHonduras. It is common that parents want to be removed with their children. Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children or Ice will place the children with someone the parent designates. In this case, the parent stated they wanted to be removed with the children.”It continued: “We take our responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is still breastfeeding her daughter, who suffers from seizures, her lawyer, Claudia Cañizares, said.As deportations ramp up, immigrants increasingly fear Ice check-ins: ‘All bets are off’Read moreCañizares said she tried to file paperwork with Ice to contest the deportation on Thursday morning but Ice refused to accept it, saying Sánchez was already gone. Sánchez is not a criminal and has a strong case on humanitarian grounds for staying in the US, Cañizares said.Donald Trump, whose presidential campaigns havefocused heavilyon immigration, said earlier this month he wanted to deport some violent criminals who are US citizens to Salvadorian prisons, where he moved hundreds of Venezuelans and some Salvadorians to last month without even a court hearing. He sent them toa brutal prisonfor suspected gangsters and terrorists, claiming they were all violent criminals; it has since been argued that most were not and those who might have been had the right to due process.The comments from Trump about sending US citizens or what he termed “homegrown” criminals to another country to be incarcerated have alarmed civil rights advocates, and the move is viewed by many legal scholars as unconstitutional.TheUS supreme courthas ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” the return of Maryland residentKilmar Ábrego García, whowas sentto El Salvador on 15 March with hundreds of others despite a US court order protecting him from deportation.Opinion polls in the last week show Trumpstruggling for approvalwith voters who were surveyed, including on some of his hardline anti-immigration tactics.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingThis article was amended on 27 April 2025. An earlier version said that the US supreme court ordered theTrump administrationto “facilitate and effectuate” Ábrego García’s return. In fact, it was the US district court that so ordered. However, the supreme court said the additional requirement to “effectuate” his return was unclear and may have exceeded the judge’s authority.

The event features several anti-vaxxers and other conspiracy theorists who have been brought together by the far-right commentator Charlie Ward.Kalcker, a German national thought to be living in Switzerland, markets the bleach under the brand name “CDS”, for chlorine dioxide solution. Hisonline brochuresclaim that the toxic chemical, which he admits is adisinfectant, can “eliminate pathogens” that cause disease.He boasts it is “possibly the greatest medical discovery of the last 100 years”.Government health authorities in the US and Spain have denounced the remedy as fraudulent, saying it is no different from drinking bleach. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that it can cause serious and even life-threatening side-effects, including dehydration, diarrhoea andkidney injury.Kalcker’s appearance at Thursday’s conference is the latest indication that potentially dangerous alternative health approaches are being emboldened and are proliferating during Trump’s second term in the White House. The US president’s choice of the prominent vaccine skeptic, Robert Kennedy Jr, to head the Department of Health and Human Services has spread alarm through medical circles.Kennedy, who until 2023 led the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, has talked about treating the current measles outbreak in Texas withcod liver oil. He also praised without any evidence two doctors in Texas whomhe claimedhad “healed” 300 children with measles using the inhaled steroid budesonide.At hisconfirmation hearingsfor the health secretary job, Kennedy directly mentioned chlorine dioxide. He praised Trump’s handling of pandemic, saying the president had not only speeded up the search for a Covid vaccine but had looked at “all of the different remedies including … even chlorine dioxide”.Kennedy’s remark helped solve one of the enduring mysteries of Trump’s first term. In April 2020, early in the pandemic, he astonished medical scientists around the world by advocating the use of “disinfectant” as a treatment for Covid.At a White House press conference,Trump said: “I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?”Kennedy’s confirmation comments clarified that Trump was indeed referring to chlorine dioxide, a toxin that been falsely claimed as a “miracle cure” for autism, cancer, malaria and HIV/Aids.Since Trump re-entered the White House in January his new administration has overseen an unprecedented censorship of government information relating to science. Several federal public health websites and databases havegone dark.The FDAwebsite pagethat describes chlorine dioxide as a “powerful bleach typically used for industrial water treatment”, and warning that it can be life threatening, has been taken down and replaced with a “page not found” notice.However, apress releasefrom 2019 publicizing an FDA announcement on the dangers of chlorine dioxide can still be found on the FDA website.It states: “The US Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to purchase or drink a product sold online as a medical treatment due to a recent rise in reported health issues. Chlorine dioxide products, when mixed, develop into a dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.”The main distributor of “miracle cure” bleach in the US, Mark Grenon, was sentenced tofive years in prisonfor selling an “unapproved and misbranded drug” in October 2023. His sons Jonathan and Jordan Grenon were sentenced to more than 12 years in federal prison.Kalcker is one of the most prominent peddlers of the bleach remedy. He has had success selling chlorine dioxide through many Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Mexico.He wraps his product in pseudo-scientific language, calling himself Dr Kalcker and claiming he is a specialist in “electromolecular medicine”. He has set up what he calls atraining institute, and claims without evidence that his products can lead to “recovery” from autism, dramatic improvement in Parkinson’s disease, and healing from “vaccine damage”.“Kalcker presents himself as a doctor, is very clever, and has created a product that sounds and looks plausible. But at the same time he is promoting the lunatic idea that autism is caused by parasites,” said Fiona O’Leary, a campaigner against pseudoscience who has autistic children.In 2021, Kalcker wasinvestigatedby Argentinian authorities and charged with falsely promoting bleach as a medical cure following the death of a five-year-old boy who had been given chlorine dioxide by his parents.In addition to promoting his remedy on stage at Trump’s Doral resort, Kalcker will be selling books about his bleach product at a vendor stall.The Guardian asked Trump’s resort whether it was appropriate to allow its space to be used to promote a potentially dangerous bleach remedy, but received no immediate reply.The organiser of the Doral conference, Charlie Ward, is an associate of the president’s son, Eric Trump. He has promoted a number of conspiracy theories including QAnon.In aspeech in 2022recorded by the monitoring group Media Matters he downplayed the Holocaust, saying that fewer people had died as a result of it than through vaccines. “More people have been killed by the jab than were killed in the Holocaust,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

Throughout the day, they were joined by other Democratic lawmakers, including the senator Raphael Warnock,who spokeas the sit-in passed the 10-hour mark.The proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year,the New York Times reported on Friday, includes cuts to programs that support childcare, health research, education, housing assistance, community development and the elderly.“Republican leaders have made clear their intention to use the coming weeks to advance a reckless budget scheme to President Trump’s desk that seeks to gut Medicaid, food assistance and basic needs programs that help people, all to give tax breaks to billionaires,” Booker and Jeffries aid in a statement.“Given what’s at stake, these could be some of the most consequential weeks for seniors, kids and families in generations,” they added.Bookerwrote separately on X: “This is a moral moment in America. Sitting on the Capitol steps with Leader Hakeem Jeffries this morning to discuss what’s at stake with Trump’s budget and affirm the need for action to protect Medicaid, food assistance, and other safety net programs.”Booker and Jeffries started their sit-in around 6am and were joined by lawmakers including Democratic senators Chris Coons and Angela Alsobrooks and representatives Sarah McBride, Maxwell Frost, Gil Cisneros and Gabe Amo, among others. Labor leaders, including Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, also took part in the event that stretched for more than 12 hours.Republican unity to be tested in talks over Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’Read moreReverend Dr William J Barber II and the National Education Association president, Becky Pringle, also joined. Pringle said the Trump administration was perpetuating “the greatest assault on public education that we’ve ever seen in this country”.Democrats and independents have added a new degree of physicality to their opposition to the Trump agenda. Earlier this month, Booker set a new record for the chamber’s longest speech when he held the floor, without a bathroom break, for more than 25 hours.Booker said he was doing so with the “intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States senate for as long as I am physically able” in order to protest the actions of Trump and his administration.The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been on a “Fighting Oligarchy” nationwide tour of the US to protest the “oligarchs and corporate interests that have so much power and influence in this country”.On Sunday, Sanders, who has accused Democrats of significantly ignoring working-class priorities, said that the party does not have “a vision for the future”.“You have Democrats appropriately, and I’m working with them, talking about Trump’s movement toward authoritarianism, vigorously opposing the so-called reconciliation bill to give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks for the 1% and make massive cuts to Medicaid, nutrition and housing, opposing what Musk is doing to dismember the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration, making it hard for our veterans to get decent healthcare or benefits on time,” Sanders told NBC’s Meet the Press.Throughout Sunday’s livestreamed sit-in, groups of curious passersby also found themselves sitting on the Capitol steps listening and weighing in on the discussion.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsCory BookerHakeem JeffriesRepublicansWashington DCUS politicsUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

The performer, whose real name was Bianca Castro-Arabejo, rose to fame after taking part in the fourth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race.Caliente’s family announced on Thursday that the Filipino-American drag performer had part of her leg amputated due to the infection.Her family wrote on Instagram that she was “cherished by many” for her career, and died on Sunday at 4.42am “surrounded by her loving family and close friends”.On Instagram, the BBC Radio 2 DJ andRuPaul’s Drag RacejudgeMichelle Visagewrote: “My jiggles …. The laughter was endless, our talks were special, your energy was contagious.“You were and remain so very loved. This world has lost an angel and we want you to soar high ….. I love you so much honey.”A statement from Caliente’s family said the star was a “luminous presence” in the worlds of entertainment and advocacy, adding that she would be deeply missed and eternally remembered.Her family said: “She touched countless lives through her artistry, activism, and the genuine connection she fostered with fans around the world.“Though her physical presence is gone, the joy she shared and the space she helped create for so many will remain for ever.”After publicly coming out as transgender, Caliente was a contestant on RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season six and was set to judge the latest season of the spin-off programme Drag Race Philippines, after being appointed as a judge when the show began airing in 2022.A statement shared by the show and producers World of Wonder on social media said they were “devastated” and asked for Caliente’s family to be given the privacy and space to grieve their “tremendous loss”.They added: “Jiggly’s humour, love, and light touched so many in the Drag Race family and beyond. Her legacy will continue to uplift the communities she advocated for.”Born on 29 November 1980, Caliente moved from the Philippines to New York when she was a child. She was praised in her first Drag Race series by the judges for her sense of humour, and impressive lip-syncs when she battled not to leave the competition early, while also struggling with sewing garments during some challenges.She was eliminated before the final, with Sharon Needles going on to be crowned champion in 2012.Since the franchise began in 2009, the reality show has been hit by the deaths of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK starsCherry Valentine, 28, andThe Vivienne, 32, as well as US competitors Sahara Davenport, 27, and Chi Chi DeVayne, 34.Explore more on these topicsDragRuPaulnewsShareReuse this content"

Expect less Hallmark, more stressJoining Mom and Dad can work as long as you know what you’re bringing – and what you’re giving upGene MarksSun 27 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 10.01 EDTShareIt happens all the time. And not just in Hallmark movies.The son or the daughter pooh-poohs their family business and moves away from the heartland to pursue their fortune in New York or Chicago. Then – penniless and more than a little hungover – they return to their home town, hat in hand.“Actually,” they say, “ever since I was a child, I’ve always dreamed of owning a company that manufactures electronic components for the automotive aftermarket industry. And now my dream can be realized.”I’m not knocking it. Young people should have their fun. Boring old Mom and Dad can run their boring old unsexy business in their boring old unsexy little Nebraska town while that happens. It’ll all be there when the inevitable reality sinks in – the reality that it’s a cold, hard world out there and spending one’s life working for someone else isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.And, if you’re going to spend 12 hours a day at a job, does it have to be preparing spreadsheets, editing press releases or revising HR policies for a big company? Why not build value for your family?Most small-business owners are over the age of 50, according to theSmall Business Administration. Even theWall Street Journalreports that “a growing number of young adults are joining the family business due to a cooling labor market and a sense of urgency among older business owners to make succession plans”. Why not be that successor?You can. But know this: if you’re planning on leaving your corporate job to join Mom and Dad, at least understand the real reason why. Because it’s not going to be so easy.For starters, you have a business to learn. You will need to establish trust with people – employees, customers, suppliers – who only know your parents. You will face a serious credibility gap because you will have little credibility. You will probably face accusations of nepotism. There could be a potential conflict with the children of other partners or with managers who have been in the business for a much longer time. Then there are Mom and Dad sticking their nose in and refusing to retire in peace.There will also be problems unlike any problems you saw while at your corporate job. You will battle every day with customers who don’t pay, employees who don’t show up to work and people who lie, cheat and steal to keep their money out of your bank account and renege on the promises they made. Business owners deal with countless problems and risks that a paycheck-receiving employee never does.Also, know that your parents will have their concerns. You’re probably not the white knight that you think you are. For all you know, your parents don’t really need you. They’re struggling to control their overhead and may not be thrilled at the added expense of bringing you on. They’re worried about what other family members will think. They’re worried that you’ll have tantrums like you did when you were eight.They’ve worked hard to build something of value and you haven’t been part of those plans. They have their set ways of doing things – ways that have worked for decades and will continue to work – and are not in a mind to have to argue with you about them. More importantly, they may have other, more lucrative succession plans that don’t involve their children, like selling to that private-equity firm that’s been nosing around, or to their employees or to that competitor who keeps making offers every year at the annual trade show.Do those so-called US recession indicators actually mean anything? | Gene MarksRead moreBut a return to the family business can work as long as you, the returning child, know what you’re bringing – and what you’re giving up.You’re hopefully bringing some form of expertise learned in the corporate world that could make your parents’ company better. Maybe it’s marketing or branding or financial management or even just upgrading from that 1985 version of QuickBooks to something that will not only increase productivity but give the perception that the company is progressing in a forward direction. You could also be bringing the vision of a new future, new ideas, new products and comfort for both employees and customers so your parents’ company will not only continue to exist but grow. You’re hopefully giving your parents peace of mind and financial stability.What you’re probably giving up is money. Lots of it. I know too many corporate employees in mid-level positions who make multiple times more than my typical client running a family-owned business. You’re also giving up the prestige of saying you work for a big corporate brand. You’re giving up the perks like generous healthcare plans, 100% matching retirement contributions, trips to Hawaii for that internal sales meeting and dinners at Ruth’s Chris paid for by the company’s card.But in return, you may be able to get the one thing that everyone desires: more control over your life. Running a business doesn’t provide complete control. But the smart clients I know frequently take advantage of being the boss by exercising a little more control over their lives as opposed to working for a boss. That’s the real value of being a business owner. And it’s something a corporate job, despite its perks, will always lack.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessnewsShareReuse this content"

I’ll never forget youI spent entire nights in 2011 gabbing on Skype. As it shutters, I’m reminded of a bygone era of online intimacyAdrian HortonSun 27 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 03.45 EDTShareIdoubt many people are mourning the demise ofSkype. The sky-blue platform that revolutionized the video call,themedium for long-distance relationships in the early 2010s, had not been relevant for almost a decade when Microsoft announced its impending death. My own relationship with Skype’s clunky tangle of video, voice and chat peaked in 2011 – the same year Microsoft purchased it for a headline-making $8.5bn, only to let it wither in the shadow of professionalized, less-pixelated options. By 2014, it was basically obsolete, as video calls shifted to more integrated apps like FaceTime, and my college schedule did not allow for glitchy, hours-long catchups. Snapchat was far more efficient.Like most people, I barely touched Skype from the mid-2010s on; the news that Microsoft will shutter it on 4 May and fold its data into the free version of Teams prompted me to log back in for the first time in five years. All that remained of my formerly thriving Skype life – once a log of video calls picked up and put down, peppered with chats pleading to “pleaseeeeeeee call me back bitchhhh (:” – were a handful of spam crypto chats and phishing links from former favorites who had long quit the platform, as well.Skype shutdown surfaces sweet memories: ‘I proposed marriage’Read moreStill, I must pour one out for Skype, a place where I would spend whole nights in 2011 gabbing over murky video, a form and era of technology I associate with a spectral, critical, inarticulable valence of intimacy that also feels bygone. I lavished hours and hours and hours on the platform in high school, catching up with my older friends who slipped the bounds of our town for university, or sussing out kids from other states I met on college visits, or desperately trying to keep my older unofficial boyfriend’s attention despite all signs pointing to him moving on.Skype was an island of intimacy – more than text but not quite the real thing – that tangled emotions and refracted IRL life in ways difficult to explain. It was the tether to people outside my small world – people older than me, cooler than me, going to more parties than me. A whole night on Skype video hearing a friend recap his escapades of pledging a fraternity, clinging to the fact that he still wanted to talk to me. A nebulous romantic relationship kept alive by the semblance of intimacy and the promise of access – we could do homework together, my bedroom to his student lounge. I could meet the two-dimensional versions of his friends. A perpetual state of will-they-won’t-they without any prospect of seeing each other, or a fleeting new friendship processing the death of a mutual friend in long, desperate gulps of connection – that was all over Skype.And that was all forgotten, siloed to a particular platform and a particular time, when digital relationships seemed to me a strange, new liminal realm, not an everyday facet of life and before my attention splintered into minute-long intervals. If people are talking about Skype these days, it’s probably in relation to the movie Past Lives, which depicted a relationship over several decades and captured that peculiar intimacy in a chapter of intense, inexpressibly important reconnection over video call. For the film’s release in 2023, Iwroteabout how the writer-director Celine Song’s inclusion of the classicSkype theme music– that interminable and annoyingly peppy sonar into the deep digital abyss – portaled me straight back to 2011, the same year Nora Moon (Greta Lee) began long-distance video-chatting with her childhood sweetheart Hae Sung (Teo Yoo). Song effectively and accurately rendered the heady rush of long-distance intimacy, the formative kind forgotten under the layers of real life that came after – curled up in bed on hours-long calls, rushing to beat the ringtone clock, awkwardly papering over glitches and lags.The predominant feeling of Past Lives is the predominant feeling, for me, of Skype: yearning – for a bigger world, for renewed attention, for a bond to remain in place. For a person you could not actually be with. For some way to describe all the emotions caught up in “Skyping”. For the hope that these long video calls could actually substitute for the real thing. It is admittedly difficult to disentangle this yearning from nostalgia for a simpler time with fewer demands on our attention, less omnipresent connection, less overwhelm. When now-faded relationships still had some road left, when tech interfaces felt clumsy and rough, because they were so new. When youth allowed for an endless sense of possibility, and when the intangible weight of relationships, friend or lover or somewhere in between, rested on this hallowed, janky portal to another laptop. The other person haloed in blue light, there but not.The locus of long-distance connection has long shifted elsewhere, taken root and entwined with normal life. You can now FaceTime someone, text them and check their other digital beams – their Instagram Stories, their Letterboxd logs, their Strava workouts, even their real-time location – from the same screen, in the same minute, with the same impulse. The video quality evolved and proliferated. I got older, and long-distance connection became more a puzzle of screens and streams and time to optimize, less an escape. And Skype straggled on as one of our most ephemeral digital artifacts; there islittle for the digital hoarderin its remnants. Unlike text messages or camcorder video or iPhotos or the never-deleting Facebook timelines, there is no archive, no vastlibrary of video to parse through.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes it justistheatre. With 63 minutes gone at Anfield, and Liverpool already 3-1 up,Mohamed Salahtook the ball on the right in an empty square of deep green, veered inside, and then paused, leaving just enough time for the entire home crowd to freeze the moment, to see a snapshot of what was about to happen.Salah rolled the ball to his left then spanked it hard into the near corner, drawing a vast, rolling cheer that just didn’t want to stop, a self‑fuelling cheer for this relentless one-man highlights reel,face of an era, the curator of moments, who then made another one here by taking a mid-match celebration selfie with the Kop.Liverpool surge to Premier League title after emphatic 5-1 win against SpursRead moreHas anyone ever taken a mid‑match selfie with the Kop before? What would Reuben Bennett say? Apart from something like “this isLiverpooland we do the best selfies here, son”.And so, as widely trailed, and perfectly choreographed on a lovely powder-blue day, Liverpool won the title with four games to spare. Arne Slot’s team have led from the start right through to that romp along the final straight, and done it all with a sense of strength in reserve, one of the most unruffled displays of frontrunning in recent Premier League memory.The only real question here was, would it still feel like a party, such was the buildup to a title win that has for some non-neutrals been somehow too easy, too free of jeopardy, basically too good.Well, it did. They know how to do this around here, rolling out the grand old livery, firing up the familiar songs, slipping into the well-worn euphoria of a title day.A 5-1 cuffing aside of a sleepy Spurs team was always going to have an end-of-term feel, a day for board games and Toy Story on the wheelie TV. But this was also a roll‑over party in many ways, a dual celebration for the plague season, and for all those empty years before the last one. At which point there are two things worth talking about, and one thing not worth talking about, which will still be talked about all the same.The last of these is the only real threat to the notion of this Liverpool team as significant title winners. This is the post-truth take, the idea that, yes, this team has run away with the league, but the real meaning here is that the league itself is flawed, that even a win is also somehow a loss.Even if this were true – which it isn’t – it requires a feat of genuine cognitive dissonance to blame the champion team for the fact others are below par. It is also demonstrably untrue. English teams have thrived in Europe. The mid-tier is as strong as it has ever been.Watch some old football. Check out the centre-backs out there lolloping around like shopping trolleys with a broken wheel. The real story of the Premier League this year is the big-brand teams being caught out by well‑managed, agile middleweights. This is a sign of quality, ambition over entitlement, the lesson that too much flux is not what builds teams.Not that anyone cared here. From the morning it felt like a flag day in the city, the streets dappled red, every corner thronged, like a street party for a republican coronation. Liverpool sunshine has its own distinct palette, something to do with the sea, the angles, the open sky, and this was a lovely, milky spring day.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold celebrates in front of fans after Liverpool’s victory and title win.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAEven the trains north had carried a gathering excitement, like a Whitsun wedding weekend, whoops and skirls down the platform at each stopping point, the feeling of Liverpool spread out in the sun up ahead. You got to smell Anfield before you saw it, the tang of flares in the air as the crowd thickened into strolling families and tourists here just for the event glamour. At the Stanley Park end the pre‑match smoke became a genuine peasouper, the Liverpool bus appearing like an icebreaker emerging out of the mist.It is a very nicely managed kind of theatre, the pre‑match veneration, the papal welcomes, and a modern thing too, related in part to the difficulty of actually getting inside the ground. It is of course easy to dismiss all this as schlocky or over the top. But it is also a significant act, a reassertion of ownership over the spectacle. Football grounds are either income machines for a hedge fund or magical places just because people keep saying they are. One of these is better than the other.Arne Slot’s team were up against perfect opponents. Ange Postecoglou had made eight changes before more urgent concerns in midweek. And Tottenham weren’t simply spectres at this feast, they were here just to service the feast, to the extent you half-expected the players to turn out for the second half in name badges and catering aprons.

The colours were good, huge lush blocks of red, green, Spurs in just the right shade of complementary limp blue.There was even an agreeable twist in the opening exchanges, Spurs taking the lead through Dominic Solanke’s header, then Luis Díaz equalising with a goal that was ruled out for offside, then reinstated by VAR, creating a static field that rolled around the Kenny Dalglish Stand, then leapt into the players on the pitch even before the referee pointed solemnly towards the centre-spot.It was 2-1 on 24 minutes after a Klopp-tribute piece of counterpressing, Alexis Mac Allister smashing a shot into the top corner with exhilarating power. Cody Gakpo got the third before half-time, tiptoeing through the Spurs defence, realising the Spurs defence wasn’t actually there, then deciding to stop tiptoeing and just smash the ball into the corner.It felt fitting Liverpool’s best players on the day were their midfielders, all three of them Slot projects carefully reconfigured this season.Dominik Szoboszlai is such a fun footballer to watch, impossibly handsome in a skiing-out-of-a-helicopter kind of way, but also, in a piece of sporting irony, prosaic in his day job, which is to work and chase and create a weather front of pressing. Mac Allister was spiky and creative. Ryan Gravenberch cruised about creating order.Liverpool’s Premier League title winners: player-by-player ratingsRead moreThis was a great day for Slot, the best of his career, and one that sets up its second half, the ever-changing challenges at this level. As ever Slot was out on his touchline looking shiny and spiffily dressed, like a much loved local dairy farm magnate here to collect a municipal award. But what has impressed most is his understated toughness, a triumph of intellect and care over show and bombast.The entire Slot persona is an interesting comment on what it means to win, and on what confidence looks like. Slot is not buccaneering or openly aggressive. But he has also been quietly insistent from the start, never talking about rebuilds only the need to win. He has accepted this was always, to some degree, going to be a case of flowers for the Klopp era, but also marked this triumph as his own, most notably in the sunlit stroll of the early season, that sense of a team falling back in love with itself.The real test of all this will come in the necessary rebuild of the next couple of years, the need to add rather than just reconfigure. The defeat by a very good Paris Saint‑Germain and the lack of energy in the Carabao Cup final are the only marks on the season. The best part of Slot is that he will clearly have these in mind just as much as the notes of glory along the way.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahArne SlotTottenham HotspuranalysisShareReuse this content"

The NFL will demand even moreRead moreSanders wound up waiting until the fifth round, when theCleveland Browns drafted himwith the 144th pick overall.“Earlier in the week, Jax Ulbrich, the 21-year-old son of defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, unintentionally came across the draft contact phone number for Shedeur Sanders off an open iPad while visiting his parent’s home and wrote the number down to later conduct a prank call,” the Falcons said in their statement. “Jeff Ulbrich was unaware of the data exposure or any facets of the prank and was made aware of the above only after the fact.“The Atlanta Falcons do not condone this behavior and send our sincere apologies to Shedeur Sanders and his family, who we have been in contact with to apologize to, as well as facilitate an apology directly from Jax to the Sanders family.”Jax Ulbrich released his own statement on Instagram. “I’m so sorry I took away from your moment, it was selfish and childish,”he wrote. “I could never imagine getting ready to celebrate one of the greatest moments of your life and I made a terrible mistake and messed with that moment. Thank you for accepting my call earlier today, I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.”For his part, Sanders did not seem too concerned about the matter when he spoke about it on Saturday.Bucs sign 464lb ‘unicorn’ Desmond Watson as undrafted free agentRead more“It didn’t really have an impact on me,” Sanders told reporters. “Of course, I feel like it was a childish act, but everybody does childish things here and there.“Sanders’ father, Colorado coach Deion Sanders, spent the first five seasons of his Hall of Fame playing career with the Falcons.Ulbrich, 48, returned to Atlanta this offseason after serving as the interim head coach of the New York Jets last season.Sanders was not the only draft prospect who received a prank call in recent days.Fox Sports reportedthat Penn State tight end Tyler Warren received a call several picks before he was selected 14th overall by the Indianapolis Colts.Explore more on these topicsNFLCleveland BrownsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He had been hoping to get selected in the later rounds of the draft on Saturday, where he wouldhave become the heaviest pick in NFL history. But no team gambled on the run-stopper.Built different: Is the 6XL, 464lb Desmond Watson too large for the NFL?Read moreThe Bucs, though, took a chance by signing him after the draft ended. He will get $50,000 guaranteed, the Athletic reported, including a $20,000 signing bonus.Watson impressedNFLscouts last month by repping 225lb 36 times, which topped any bench-press performance at this year’s combine. He covered the 40-yard dash in 5.93 seconds and recorded 25 inches in the vertical jump.He looked winded during position drills, but his size and strength stood out during perhaps the most important day in his professional journey.“Dez, obviously, he’s a unicorn,” Gators coach Billy Napier said. “You’ll go the rest of your career and you’ll never be around a guy that’s that stature. And then you get to know Dez. He’s extremely intelligent. He’s got a great sense of humor. He was a great teammate. He’ll get his shot, and I’m hoping he’ll make the most of it.”Watson stepping on the scale was as eye-popping as his bench press. He was listed at 449lb last season, up from 415lb as a sophomore. He’s had to manage his weight since he first stepped foot on campus in 2021, when then-Florida coach Dan Mullen called him “a 385lb athlete.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His highlights, though, are few and far between. He rag-dolled South Florida running back Brian Battie in 2022 and ripped the ball out of South Carolina running back Jaheim Bell’s hands for a forced fumble and a fumble return later that year.Watson finished his collegiate career with 63 tackles and 1.5 sacks. He also carried the ball for a one-yard gain and lined up at fullback for a few more plays against Tulane in the Gasparilla Bowl in December.Explore more on these topicsTampa Bay BuccaneersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But after beating Forest, Guardiola focused on Liverpool’s title win that came after Tottenham were beaten 5-1 at Anfield.Lewis and Gvardiol guide Manchester City past Forest and into FA Cup finalRead more“On behalf of myself and all the club we want to congratulate Liverpool Football Club for their Premier League victory,” Guardiola said. “Well deserved, no doubts about that. A fantastic team. During [next] year, like it happened the last four years [with City], they’re going to try and retain the title and hopefully next season we can be better, to compete until the end for the title. This season was not possible. So congratulations to Liverpool.”City are in fourth place with 61 points, one ahead of Forest, who have a match in hand in sixth. The top five teams will qualify for the Champions League. But Guardiola denied that sealing a top-five finish plus claiming theFA Cupwill make it a successful campaign.“No,” he said. “This season has not been good. We are a thousand million points behind Liverpool [actually 21]. It’s not good. Look at the Champions League. We won one game? Two games? We were not good. The club has to take the right decisions [this summer] so next season will be better.”Of reaching three consecutive FA Cup finals, he said: “It speaks highly of this generation of players, the club itself. We have to be calm now and recover. We have five days now [ahead of Wolves, at home on Friday].”Forest can leapfrog City into third place if they beat Brentford on Thursday.

The defending champion made his move about 35km (22 miles) from the end of the undulating 252km (156-mile) trek to open up a gap of 10sec at the top, and then kept increasing it all the way to the line.It was his third victory overall at the spring classic race, which is also one of the five “monuments” in one-day cycling along with Paris-Roubaix on the cobbles, the Tour of Lombardy, Milan-San Remo and the Tour of Flanders. Pogacar now has nine “monument” victories.Tadej Pogacar dances up Mur de Huy to claim victory in Flèche WallonneRead moreThe Slovenian was so far ahead on Sunday that he even had time to turn and smile at the roadside camera filming him, then touched hands with fans near the finish before raising his arms in the air with victory assured. Pogacar won in just over six hours and finished 1min 3sec before Italian Giulio Ciccone in second and Irishman Ben Healy in third. Ciccone and Healy contested a sprint to the line for second place.In decent racing conditions, Pogacar’s UAE Team-Emirates teammates increased the speed at the front of the main pack and the peloton caught a small group of frontrunners with 60km to go, and with the main favourites still in contention. But when Pogačar surged ahead on the Côte de La Redoute climb, no rider could follow him. It was a similar story to Wednesday, when Pogacar launched a trademark uphill attack to win the Flèche Wallonne classic for the second time.It was a disappointing race for the two-time champion Remco Evenepoel as the Belgian rider was dropped by Pogacar on the Redoute climb. Evenepoel could not gain any time back and instead dropped down to finish in 59th place, 3min 11sec behind Pogačar.View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar greets fans on his way to a comfortable victory.Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/APThe Mauritian rider Kim Le Court won the women’s race for the first time as four riders contested a sprint finish. The 2023 champion, Demi Vollering, attacked first but Le Court countered her and then held off Dutch rider Puck Pieterse, who won the Flèche Wallonne on Wednesday. Pieterse finished second ahead of her compatriot Vollering and the French rider Cédrine Kerbaol in fourth. The four riders completed the 152.9km (94.8-mile) route in 4:15:42. It was the first classics win for the 29-year-old Le Court.Kerbaol broke away near the end and led by 14sec with 11km left and threatened to extend her advantage, but Pieterse went after her. The world road race champion, Lotte Kopecky of Belgium, could not follow and cracked in the final climb up Roche aux Faucons. But Pieterse, Vollering and Le Court caught Kerbaol with a few kilometres remaining to make it a four-way sprint finish. Kopecky rolled in fifth, 24sec behind.Explore more on these topicsSpring ClassicsCyclingTadej PogačarnewsShareReuse this content"

Earl described him as a “big character with lots of energy”.She said: “Sam is very, very present on social media, he’s such a passionate person about sports.“He flew on the 13th, I’ve got confirmation that he landed, I absolutely know Sam was in Vegas. The concerning part is he went silent from the 16th and, because he is such a big presence on social media, people were quite fast to notice.”Earl said Ruddock was an “infectious” person and a “phenomenal” human being. She said she has started a social media campaign to try to get information.A spokesperson for British Cycling said: “British Cycling understands that para-cyclist Sam Ruddock was reported missing to UK and US police and Interpol after not being heard from since Wednesday 16 April 2025, while visiting Las Vegas, USA.“We urge anyone who has been in contact with Sam since 16 April or may have any information of his whereabouts to contact their local police department as soon as possible.”Lincolnshire police confirmed it has an active missing person investigation for Ruddock.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British man reported missing in Las Vegas and are in contact with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsSportParalympicsGBWarwickshireLas VegasnewsShareReuse this content"

As temperatures climbed towards 20C, almost everyone in the elite men’s field – including Eliud Kipchoge, the greatest ever, and the Olympic champion Tamirat Tola – slowed at the 30km drinks station to grab their bottles and quench their thirst.However one athlete, Sabastian Sawe, decided water could wait and in only his second marathon the 29‑year‑old Kenyan summoned a kick so devastating that he left everyone else floundering within seconds. “I saw that I had an opportunity to push and I did,” Sawe said after crossing the line in 2hr 2min 27sec, the second quickest time in London marathon history.London Marathon 2025: Tigst Assefa and Sabastian Sawe win elite races – as it happenedRead moreIt was not just the sudden injection of pace that caught everybody by surprise. It was the staggering 13min 56sec surge between 30km and 35km that followed. To put that time into context, it is just 12sec slower than the world record for a 5km parkrun, set by the Irish international runner Nick Griggs.What makes Sawe’s story even more extraordinary is that he only started training seriously in his early 20s and began competing extensively on the international circuit at 27. “My focus was education first, and then I run,” he said. “I think the secret is training and discipline and trusting the process. With that everything is possible.”Second place was claimed by the half-marathon world record-holder, Jacob Kiplimo, who was 70sec back. Tola was fifth in 2:04.42 while Kipchoge, a four-time winner, was sixth in 2:05.25.View image in fullscreenRunners go over Tower Bridge on a hot day for the London Marathon.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/ReutersThe leading British man, Mahamed Mahamed, was ninth in 2:08.52 while the Paris Olympic triathlon champion, Alex Yee, was 14th in his debut marathon in 2:11.08.“My legs have never felt like this before,” Yee said. “There were definitely a lot more dark moments than in Paris today. Once I got to 32k-33k, there was a lot of pain there. My legs were cramping. I had to keep fighting through that, and I am pretty proud to get to the finish line. To be the second Brit is pretty special.”However, one man who appreciated Yee’s efforts was Kipchoge, who texted the Briton before the race. “He gave me a punch on the back when he ran past at the finish,” Yee said. “It seemed like he had way more energy to go.”The women’s race broke up quickly and soon there were only three out in front: Sifan Hassan, the Olympic champion and 2023 winner; Tigst Assefa, the second fastest woman in history and the Paris silver medallist; and Joyciline Jepkosgei, the 2021 winner and no slouch herself.View image in fullscreenThe Olympic triathlon gold medallist, Alex Yee, finished 14th in the men’s race.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEveryone knew that Hassan had the fastest finish. But Assefa and Jepkosgei were determined not to let it get that far. One surge, just after 10 miles, briefly left the Dutchwoman 20 metres back. Another, before halfway, broke her.Assefa and Jepkosgei were through 13.1 miles in 66min 40sec, but as the miles ticked by they increasingly began to watch each other rather than the clock. But Assefa had plenty left in the tank to ensure that when she made her move after 23 miles it quickly proved decisive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arne Slot made sure they were unmissable from the start.At the plush Fairmont hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, first port of call on Liverpool’s pre-season tour of the US and their first bonding trip abroad last July, names would be written on a board giving advance notice of that day’s meeting schedule. There were one-on-one meetings for players with a member of Slot’s coaching team, squad meetings with all of the new backroom staff, meetings to analyse the double training sessions and meetings to analyse individual performances within them. There had been two meetings a day at Liverpool’s Axa Training Centre before the trip but this was another level.Liverpool’s Premier League title winners: player-by-player ratingsRead more“I remember he showed a lot of clips from training,” recalled Ibrahima Konaté, one of several players to step up a level this season. “He showed one player who didn’t run well or stopped running and said: ‘He didn’t run now. Why, because I give you a compliment?’ He said the truth to everyone. Mo [Salah], Virgil [van Dijk], every player if something is wrong. Every player was like: ‘Oh, he looks at me every day, he looks at me every training session. I have to give 2,000% always.’”Jürgen Klopp won hearts duringnine transformative years as Liverpool’s manager. Slot, with his more educationist approach, absolute trust in the players bequeathed by Klopp and his own methods, sought to win over minds. The buy-in from a squad blessed with leaders and a mentality to match its talent, the strongest that Slot has encountered in both aspects, ensured it was possible. A record-equalling 20th league title is the reward.Liverpool appointed a football nerd whenRichard Hughes, their sporting director, met Slot at his home in Zwolle 12 months ago and presented the data analysis and character references that made him the club’s preferred choice to succeed Klopp. The timing of the German’s departure, announced in private to Liverpool’s owners in November 2023 andto a stunned publicin January 2024, offered the rare luxury of time in the search for a replacement and it was not squandered.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah’s extraordinary tally of goals and assists have made him the envy of the Premier League and beyond.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersMeetings that have become an established part of daily life at the training ground helped ingrain Slot’s tactical ideas into players during a pre-season disrupted by the European Championship. The head coach had his entire squad together for only 13 days before thePremier League opener at Ipswichbut, in another sign of how things were changing, there were no complaints.“It is a disadvantage,” said the phlegmatic Dutchman of the schedule. “But not an excuse.” Impromptu tactical discussions form part of Slot’s approach too. If the head coach bumps into a player in the corridors of the training ground he will grab a nearby tactics board and outline his thoughts. Rather than lambast below-par first-half performances, and there have been several, Slot heads for the tactics board during the interval and calmly explains the changes required. Immediate and vast improvements in the second half have been a feature of Liverpool’s campaign. Southampton at home in March was an exception. Slot slaughtered his players before talking tactics. It had a similar effect. A 1-0 half-time deficit became a 2-1 lead by the 55th minute andLiverpool won 3-1.The 46-year-old has lived alone since moving to England. With his two children in exam years, he and his wife, Mirjam, agreed they should continue their schooling in the Netherlands. The separation has been a wrench but has enabled Slot to devote even more time to watching matches and opponents. His family visit whenever possible, as do his parents. Slot’s father, Arend, wasportrayed as his harshest criticfor bemoaning Liverpool’s performancein victory against Lillein January. The reality is different. Arend will accompany his son on post-match media rounds when he visits, standing in the background and beaming the smile of the proudest dad as Slot takes another victory in his stride. Slot’s reaction is not much different after a rare defeat; level-headed and refreshingly honest.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk – celebrating a Mohamed Salah goal against Newcastle in December – has assumed greater authority on and off the pitch.Photograph: Ian Hodgson/APWhereas Klopp was a collider of emotional energy before, during and after games, match-day Slot is Zen by comparison. Most of the time. Before his uncharacteristic meltdown aftertwo points ebbed awayat Goodison Park, wherehis words to the referee Michael Oliverresulted in a two-match touchline ban, there was a pre-match scene that captured Slot’s coolness to perfection. David Moyes was engaged in conversation with Liverpool staff for several minutes before recognising his opposite number outside the away changing room. Slot had been on his haunches all that time, reading the programme. His demeanour reflected a coach with complete confidence in the work done on the training ground. No point stressing now.Trust in the process was evident after thehome defeat by Nottingham Forestlast September. Slot was stunned to lose to a team that had been in relegation trouble the season before – he has changed his opinion on Forest now of course – but, even afterfalling behind in the next game in Milan, there was never any question of changing course. A 26-game unbeaten run in the league followed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Feyenoord coach had been in the job five weeks before he was presented to the media alongside Hughes. The delay was deliberate and resisted a growing clamour for him to speak. Slot wanted to put a respectful distance between his introduction as Liverpool head coach andthe German’s emotional exit. There was also an acknowledgment that Slot could not match his charismatic predecessor’s oratory skills and it would therefore help the transition to put space between them.Slot’s lack of ego is reflected in his style of play. He embraced Klopp’s players along with elements of Klopp’s game – see the second-half onslaughtagainst Brighton that took Liverpool topon 2 November, a position they never relinquished – while introducing more control and composure on the ball. Midfield has flourished as a result. The deployment ofRyan Gravenberch as a No 6has been a revelation. Slot planned the switch before Liverpool missed out on their main transfer target of last summer, Real Sociedad’s defensive midfielder Martín Zubimendi. Gravenberch was not thrust there out of necessity after. Slot and Liverpool’s chief scout, Barry Hunter, were aware of the Netherland international’s ability to play a more defensive role from watching him at Ajax. A standout display in the 3-0 pre-season win over Manchester United in Columbia, South Carolina convinced them to press ahead.View image in fullscreenRyan Gravenberch has proved a revelation in the No 6 role for Arne Slot’s Liverpool this season.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockDid the Liverpool head coach get lucky? A kind fixture list that enabled the champions to build momentum from day one anda Manchester City collapsethat Klopp could only dream of have been cited in favour of that argument. However, Slot’s real fortune was to inherit an outstanding dressing-room culture and a gifted, balanced squad that did not require upgrading, as last summer’s quiet transfer window and results have demonstrated.Against a potentially destabilising backdrop of contract uncertainty, Van Dijk took on more responsibility to become a Liverpool captain with greater authority on and off the pitch. A true leader. Mohamed Salah produced more goals and assists than any other player in Europe’s top five leagues to confirm he is not merely one of the finest players in the world, but one of the most dedicated at the age of 32. Together they made a mockery of suggestions that this season would prove the end of an era for Liverpool. There is seniority throughout the team, however, eclipsing that of domestic rivals. Konaté has captained France this season, Dominik Szoboszlai is the captain of Hungary, Andy Robertson is Scotland’s captain, and Alisson and Trent Alexander-Arnold enhance the leadership group. They have helped make the transition seamless.“I am not a clone of Jürgen,”Slot insisted when he faced the media for the first time as Liverpool’s head coach last July. That is not strictly true. Both can now say they have delivered the Premier League trophy to Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

The scary thought for the rest of the Premier League must be that Guardiola, who looked and sounded like a man ready to pack it in and head for the golf course earlier this season, is finding fresh motivation in puttingManchester Cityback together. Enjoy it while it lasts, you can imagine him saying to his rivals, but just be aware that I have revenge planned for anyone who dared to wonder if I was finished when we were losing 4-0 at home against Tottenham.It is, of course, worth pointing out that it is too soon to assume that a new imperial era is taking shape. City are deservedly through to their third consecutive FA Cup final, a date with Crystal Palace secured thanks to a well-crafted2-0 win against Nottingham Forest, but Guardiola still has damage to repair. Ever the perfectionist, he will look back at his team’s performance against Forest and conclude that there were moments when this semi-final could have slipped from their grasp. Anthony Elanga had a glorious chance to make it 1-1 early in the second half, only to miss from close range, while City will know that they were fortunate not to concede after going 2-0 up.‘It has not been good’: Guardiola says FA Cup win will not save City’s seasonRead moreYet defeat was deflating rather than heartbreaking for Forest, who cannot let it affect their push for Champions League qualification. There was more knowhow to City, accompanied by a sense of a team embracing the process of renewal. It was striking that Kevin De Bruyne, who will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season, was an unused substitute.Although City’s starting lineup was not short of leadership and experience – Rúben Dias, Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva have seen and done it all – it was one capable of coping with Forest’s energy.There has been an injection of youth, replenishing enthusiasm levels. Nico O’Reilly and Rico Lewis, 20-year-old homegrown talents, showed again that they are versatile, technical and comfortable at this level. Savinho, raw but dangerous on the right wing, is 21 and learning as he goes. Josko Gvardiol, whose big dark beard makes him look older than 23, is thriving after shifting into central defence; he delighted in powering in the second goal from an Omar Marmoush corner in the 51st minute.Guardiola has spoken about his possession football becoming outdated this season. He is reacting, adapting and reshaping his squad. City spent heavily on youth in January. If the 26‑year‑old Marmoush is a signing for the here and now, then Vitor Reis, Abdukodir Khusanov and Nico González look like bets on potential. Space will be made by old timers leaving. De Bruyne is on his way and Ilkay Gündogan could go too. There is talk of additions in attacking midfield. Phil Foden, who did not come on until the 81st minute here, has struggled this season but is only 24.There are hints of a resurgence. Sir Alex Ferguson went through dips at Manchester United but always responded. Guardiola has seemed weary since leading City to the treble and four consecutive league titles. Losing Rodri to injury was a devastating blow. City have been slow and fragile. The talk has been of Guardiola’s approach being replaced by a more vertical, dynamic style of play.Having seen off Andoni Iraola’s front-foot Bournemouth in the quarter-finals, Guardiola approached the challenge of breaking down Forest’s resolute defence with typical imagination and counterintuitiveness. How to cope without Erling Haaland leading the line? Simple: confound the Forest centre-backs by sending out a team with no fixed point in attack and a host of diminutive technicians spreading confusion with decoy runs and dizzying movement.It was a classic Guardiola ploy. The conventional approach would have been a 4-2-3-1 system with Jack Grealish sticking to the left, Bernardo Silva as a No 10 and Marmoush playing up front. Not here, though. City used a box midfield. Silva and Kovacic were deep, Lewis and Grealish operated in advanced central positions, Marmoush and Savinho drifted wide and Forest were confused.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was more to it than Kovacic surging from deep in the second minute and nutmegging Danilo with a pass to Lewis, who had time to drill a low shot past Matz Sels from 20 yards. There was also the way that first Marmoush and then Savinho distracted Murillo with darts into the defender’s zone, ensuring that Lewis was in space when he received the ball in between the lines.Forest, who did not have a shot before half-time, never got to grips with City’s system. City pressed aggressively during the first half, repeatedly forcing turnovers. Silva and Kovacic were excellent. Lewis, a right-left, left‑back, No 6 and No 8 rolled into one, was exceptional. There was a moment when O’Reilly won the ball, pirouetted and shot wide from 25 yards.City’s belief has returned. Guardiola, though, is far from satisfied. Would winning this competition make this season a success? There was something ominous about the way he heard the question, laughed and made it very clear that he expects far more than glory in the Cup.Explore more on these topicsFA CupNottingham ForestManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

They beat the last season’s runners-up 4-1 thanks to an own goal from Christiane Endler and strikes from Mariona Caldentey, Alessia Russo and Caitlin Foord.The final in May will be the first of Slegers’s fledgling management career. The 36-year-old was delighted with her team’s success as they reached a European final at her first attempt.“I’m so proud of the whole team,” she said. “I am so happy for everyone that we have achieved this. It’s a team performance and I don’t take myself out of the team … There is so much work that has been done before both to qualify this season and also all the work the club has done through many years to get us into this position. It is so good as an organisation to be able to compete in this final.”Lyon 1-4 Arsenal (3-5 on agg): Women’s Champions League semi-final – live reactionRead moreOn a balmy day in the south-east of France, there was a discernible buzz surrounding the stadium. The local bars were awash with fans, enjoying the afternoon sun in nervous anticipation for the match ahead. Among them the several hundred travelling Arsenal fans, decked out in their customary red and white, seemed in a jubilant if wary mood as they contemplated their side’s chances. The 2-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium inthe first leghad been frustrating but these fans have witnessed this side come back from the brink on more than one occasion and there was optimism that they could do it once more.There had been clear belief emanating from the Arsenal camp since the final whistle on 19 April. They had been disappointed with the result but clearly felt that they had produced a performance to merit coming away with more. The Arsenal manager had spoken about her faith in her team’s ability to continue to exploit Lyon but stressed their need to “remain humble” throughout.Slegers made two alterations to the side that started in the first leg. The big surprise was the return of Daphne van Domselaar in goal. The Dutch international had picked up an ankle injury during the last international break which was meant to keep her out for about five weeks, but she appeared to have made a remarkable recovery. Chloe Kelly, meanwhile, came into attack in place of Beth Mead.Joe Montemurro also made two changes as he opted to bring in a wealth of experience. The imperious Wendie Renard had recovered to full fitness to take a place at the heart of the Lyon defence, making her 500th appearance for the club. Ada Hegerberg, the all-time record goalscorer in the Women’s Champions League, also returned to lead the line, with the exciting Melchie Dumornay dropping into midfield.View image in fullscreenVanessa Gilles’ reaction to Arsenal’s fourth goal.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersArsenal had been criticised for their slow start in the first leg but there were no such issues on Sunday. The Gunners seem to enjoy playing on this expansive pitch – on their last visit to Lyon in 2022 they came away with a 5-1 win – and they were immediately exploiting the spaces afforded to them. They did not have to wait long for the breakthrough, striking within five minutes to level the tie on aggregate. The Chilean goalkeeper Endler made a superb stop in the buildup, turning Kim Little’s effort instinctively past the post. The hosts, however, were all at sea when defending the subsequent corner. The ball bounced off Frida Maanum and then the unfortunate home goalkeeper before rolling into the net.It was inevitable that there would be some nervy moments for Arsenal’s defence to deal with but they held their own and restricted Lyon to one shot on target in the first half. Foord, meanwhile, stung Endler’s gloves once more before Russo misdirected a header from an unmarked position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Caldentey has been the signing of the season for the Gunners and produced a superb curling effort for her seventh in the competition.Lyon were visibly shellshocked, and their fortunes failed to change after the break. In fact, their afternoon got even worse as Foord and Maanum won their respective duels to send through Russo to score. The visitors were enjoying themselves and added a fourth with half an hour to play when Foord pounced to put the visitors in complete control.The hosts rallied in the closing stages, finding a consolation through Dumornay, but Arsenal showed their resilience. It was a famous occasion for the Gunners as they progressed to the final in Lisbon on 24 May.

Otherwise, things have gone truly pear-shaped. A Sunday where their fans lived vicariously through hopes of Tottenham delaying Liverpool’s title celebrations and Nottingham Forest stopping City winning another FA Cup counts as a ground-zero level ebb, even considering United’s decline and fall. Rescuing a point from 10-man Bournemouth might have arrested some of the helpless, listless doom but probably not for too long.Perhaps United’s team spirit, that which carried them past Lyon in the Europa League, is evidencing itself, though far more than that is required. As with Lyon, it took an opposing red card - Evanilson, a tad unluckily - to add momentum to a muddle.Bournemouth 1-1 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happenedRead moreReports of Ruben Amorim playing the kids ahead of Athletic Club were proven exaggerated, his selection as strong as can be expected from the Frankenstein-like horror of United’s bolted-together squad. With Ernesto Valverde’s Athletic in mind, Amorim was running a case study against a team of a similar style, coached by a Basque bred by the same club. It didn’t go too well. Even if this group somehow lifts a European trophy, it will surely be broken up for scrap. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, sometime renewables enthusiast, was watching on.If the past was United’s, how long until the future is theirs? “We are in the different levels at this moment,” said Amorim, referencing Liverpool’s imminent triumph. “Everything can change, so we need to focus and step by step, not trying to to to think too far ahead. We have a ultimate goal that is winning thePremier League. And again, I’m not crazy, I know that it is not going to be next year, but we are trying to build something and the small things are really important.”Luke Shaw,signed for Louis van Gaal in 2014, was making a first United start since February 2024, his only other startthe Euro 2024 final. Shaw played part in the farce that resulted in Antoine Semenyo’s goal but hardly looked more rusty than his colleagues. He completed the full match. “When you are losing, you are not thinking about the next game,” said Amorim.André Onana’s goal-kick had played Shaw and Patrick Dorgu into trouble, an area of malfunction repeated to the point of insanity. If dodgy keeping and defending have been a problem, so too goalscoring. It took Hojlund’s second of 2025 to win a point.United’s away support was, as ever, loud though songs of Matt Busby, Wayne Rooney, Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo cast gloomy shade, even if Amorim was hailed lustily. His team began slowly and stayed that way. Onana’s ball-playing from the back soon attracted the mockery of home fans eventually disappointed their team failed to climb above Fulham and Brighton, sunk by the type of late goal sinking Andoni Iraola’s team’s quest for Europe.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo took advantage of United’s muddled defence to score early in the first half.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images“This win would have meant a lot to us,” said Iraola. “A point is a big difference. It is difficult to look in a positive way at the moment. We need a few hours.”CouldBournemouthhave been down to ten earlier? Alejandro Garnacho was on the receiving end of a tackle from Tyler Adams that required the video assistant referee to rule out a straight red. That incident only loosened United’s concentration, Onana, Shaw and Patrick Dorgu getting in that mess before Semenyo stole in to score. Bournemouth had early second-half chances to kill the contest through Semenyo and Evanilson before Dango Ouattara smashed a post with a free-kick from a near-impossible angle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their salvation arrived very late. Substitute Mason Mount had a shot deflected wide and Shaw volley the resulting corner off-target. Chido Obi, the teenager on as a sub, forced a save from Kepa, Fernandes agonised at a miss. Eventually Hojlund, from inches out, tapped in the result of a ricochet begun by Ugarte’s hopeful hack forwards. “He can be a little bit lighter during the week,” said Amorim of his No 9. “He now needs to score many more.”Cue celebrations in the away end, previously running through their greatest hits playlist, including a celebration of 20 league titles collected increasingly long ago.

This was a harsh illustration of how far they are behind ­Barcelona, who pose a huge obstacle for Arsenal in the final.Asked if her team had fallen short of their objective for the season – despite the fact Chelsea could still win a domestic treble – Bompastor said: “Yes, I’m not going to shy away from the ambitions of the club.“That’s really easy for some managers, maybe not to assume the ­ambitions, but I want to assume them [the ambitions] because I’m really competitive, and I just think this club has everything to perform and to be able to make the quadruple.“It didn’t happen this year and we are all sad and frustrated about it, but yes, we need now to reflect ‘how can we make it possible?’, but again, I think coming to Chelsea as a competitive person, I want to make sure we fight for every trophy possible.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Anfield exploded with emotion, passion and noise as its long wait to celebrate aPremier Leaguetriumph in unison ended in a style befitting Arne Slot’s new champions. Tottenham were dismantled, just as the rest of the Premier League has been in Slot’s superb debut season, as Liverpool took the crown with a flourish.Even Slot, the calmest man in the house, indulged in a spot of dad‑dancing, sang Jürgen Klopp’s name and led a moving rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone after Liverpool’s record-equalling title. Alisson fell to the ground in prayer. He and his teammates have answered Anfield’s. A five-star performance – with goals from Luis Díaz, the brilliant Alexis Mac Allister, Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah, the man of the season, who took a selfie with the Kop – sealed the title with four games to spare.Liverpool win Premier League title – live reactionRead moreThe celebrations started long before the coronation. Denied a mass communal party by the Covid pandemic in 2020, Liverpool fans were determined to make up for lost time. Not since 28 April 1990 had they and their team savoured a championship triumph together. This opportunity would not be missed.Thousands lined Anfield Road to greet the team coach before kick‑off, many with “Champions 20” printed on the back of their replica shirts. The air around Anfield was filled with an overwhelming smell of sulphur from flares that added to the sense of expectation. Someone did not get the memo and let off a blue one. Tottenham’s coach was diverted away from the crowds and dropped the squad off behind the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand, requiring Ange Postecoglou and his players to walk around the pitch to their changing room. The Courteeners’ song Not Nineteen Forever blared from the PA system as Liverpool warmed up. Such was the expectation that even the principal owner, John W Henry, made an appearance from Boston.The possibility of Spurs spoiling the fun had not been given a second thought. It was seemingly a matter of how Liverpool would win the league, not if, and so Anfield was briefly stunned into silence when Dominic Solanke headed the visitors in front. The former Liverpool striker towered above Ryan Gravenberch to convert a James Maddison corner. Spurs had started brightly but are not a team to ruin a script.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah fires home Liverpool’s fourth goal.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAPostecoglou had complained about the negative narrative that surrounds Spurs in his pre-match press conference. It was a bit rich given how often his team have fed that narrative this season, and they duly succumbed to an 11th away defeat of a dreadful Premier League campaign.Their subsequent performance suggested Solanke’s surprise opening goal, and defying expectations briefly, was enough. There was a gulf in hunger and desire between the new champions and the visitors. Each one of Liverpool’s three first‑half goals resulted in Spurs’ players arguing among themselves over their weak defending.Liverpool levelled four minutes later when Salah released Dominik Szoboszlai behind Archie Gray with a superbly weighted pass. The midfielder squared for Díaz to slide home but his celebrations were curtailed by an offside flag against Szoboszlai. The video assistant referee confirmed the Hungary captain had timed his run to perfection, however, and Liverpool players swarmed over Díaz when the equaliser was given.A draw was enough for Slot’s side to seal the deal but they naturally wanted more, as the outstanding Mac Allister demonstrated throughout. The World Cup winner fired Liverpool ahead from 20 yards after Destiny Udogie played a dangerous pass across his own area towards Gray, who was beaten to the ball by the more determined Gravenberch. Mac Allister gave the Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario no chance with an emphatic drive into the roof of the net. No doubts now. This would be the day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lucas Bergvall failed to deal with a Mac Allister corner to the near post and steered his headed clearance straight to the Netherlands international. Gakpo collected, stepped easily away from Brennan Johnson and Solanke, and swept a shot into Vicario’s bottom right hand corner.Liverpool win record-equalling 20th league title with rout of TottenhamRead moreLiverpool performed with a freedom and style their superiority allowed. The players were as determined to enjoy themselves as the fans. All that was missing from a perfect afternoon for Liverpool was a goal for Salah, the remarkable driving force behind the 20th title. It arrived at the end of a move that underlined why Slot’s team have been a class apart. The immovable force that was Mac Allister halted Bergvall on the edge of the Liverpool area and released Szoboszlai, who swept half the length of the pitch before finding Salah in space on the right. Liverpool’s leading marksman cut inside Udogie and sent an unerring finish into the bottom corner. Salah celebrated his 28th league goal by accepting a fan’s offer of their mobile phone to take a selfie in front of the Kop.It was soon five when the hapless Udogie, attempting to stop Salah reaching Trent Alexander-Arnold’s flick across the Spurs goal, bundled the ball into his own net. That was the cue for a resounding version of “Champions” to reverberate from the Kop and Anfield to experience ecstasy.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Soon there was the bizarre sight of Bartley consoling those players in blue shirts, who at the final whistle collapsed to the turf like dominoes.Championship roundup: Cardiff relegated while Luton stun CoventryRead moreThe reality of relegation was not lost onAaron Ramsey, the emotion etched across his face as he began to digest the damage. He used to whizz to training in a lime green Ford Fiesta as a teenager. Ramsey, who grew up in nearby Caerphilly, joined the club aged eight and last summer returned to the club for a third spell with aspirations of returning Cardiff to the Premier League, from which they were relegated in 2018-19.Since then, there have been a couple of near-misses at both ends of the table. Soon the Cardiff supporters who sang against the club’s owner, Vincent Tan, will be preparing for League One trips to Exeter and Stevenage. Relegation is a major failing considering the club are thought to have a top-eight Championship budget. It is the same club still bickering over compensation for Emiliano Sala, claiming they are owed north of £100m over the striker they hoped would save them from Premier League relegation in 2019, only for him to be killed in a plane crash en route from Nantes. The case comes to court in September.“I wanted to come back and help the team on the field, that hasn’t materialised like we all imagined and all wanted,” said the 34-year-old Ramsey. Sidelined after undergoing hamstring surgery, he agreed to take over as caretaker manager with three games to play. “Game-time, minutes on the pitch, it hasn’t been great and it’s been very frustrating because this club means a lot to me. I felt like I could have an impact and have that miracle ending. It wasn’t to be and we have to own up to that.”There was a finality to his message on a dispiriting afternoon. At least Ramsey, together with his assistant, best friend and one-time flat-mate Chris Gunter, who also started his career at Cardiff, helped generate another spirited performance. It was a punishing climax for a team who have mustered nine wins from 45 league matches, the fewest in the Championship, and only Shrewsbury have won fewer games in the English Football League this season. It was always going to be a big ask for Cardiff to fashion back-to-back wins from nowhere to give themselves a shot at survival. Even then, it might have proved insufficient.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Cardiff City hold their hands on their heads during the draw with West Brom.Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty ImagesConfirmation of relegation came after a 0-0 draw at home to a horribly out-of-form West Brom, who had lost five of their previous six matches, a run of form that cost Tony Mowbray his job; James Morrison, another former Premier League midfielder, was promoted from his role of first-team coach to take charge of his first game as caretaker manager.Just as on Easter Monday, Cardiff showed promise, but could not eke out a potentially priceless victory. Gunter furiously scratched the back of his head as Joe Ralls sent a bending shot just wide of a post with four minutes of normal time to play. Ramsey put his hands on his head.There was another what-if moment on the hour. Three points presumably flashed before Ramsey’s eyes as Josh Griffiths, the West Brom goalkeeper, somehow kept the ball out. Griffiths saved Alex Robertson’s initial shot and then repelled his acrobatic effort with his right boot. Youssef Salech sent a shot thudding into the ground and against a post before the ball boomeranged to Calum Chambers, but his shot was smothered by Griffiths. The Cardiff centre-backs, Will Fish and Jesper Daland, stood in disbelief close to halfway. That ludicrous episode brought a rallying cry. “Aaron Ramsey’s barmy army,” sang the home support.Ramsey could be mistaken for joining in but, really, he was applauding the sense of growing momentum. It was a contrasting scene at full time. Ramsey, not sure where to start, awkwardly made his way around his players, teammates until last week when taking over the reins from Omer Riza, originally a sticking plaster who had been given the job until the end of the season after Erol Bulut’s sacking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

O’Sullivan was seldom required to reach top gear as he turned a 6-2 overnight lead into a 12-4 advantage, which leaves him requiring just one more frame on Monday evening to confirm his return to the last eight.Playing in his first tournament since January, the seven-time champion often looked far from happy with his form, but still fired back-to-back centuries en route to establishing a seemingly unassailable lead over his outclassed 25-year-old opponent.Pang had briefly stirred, winning the first two frames upon the resumption and fleetingly threatening to launch a comeback to match his recovery in their first-round meeting in 2023, when he hit back from 9-4 down to win three frames in a row.O’Sullivan, Higgins and Williams stand strong as Class of 92 battle onRead moreBut frequent errors cost the Chinese player any chance of making any further impression, and O’Sullivan swiftly restored his four-frame advantage with successive half-centuries to go in 8-4 in front at the mid-session interval. Looking increasingly ill at ease, Pang failed to muster a point in the next two frames, as back-to-back hundreds took O’Sullivan further clear, and taking the next two made Monday’s final session a formality.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Judd Trump hit his 100th century break of the season – pocketing a £100,000 bonus from the WorldSnookerTour – as he moved into a 10-6 lead against Shaun Murphy.Trump shrugged off a slow start to this second-round clash to lead 5-3 at the end of the first session, his main regret being the miss of a difficult yellow when on 98 in the final frame of the session, leaving him stuck on 98 centuries for a little longer.The evening instalment began with a tense frame full of misses, fouls and snookers but from then on it was a contest of big breaks, and one which Trump edged.There was another near miss for Trump in the 12th frame as his break ended on 97, but he took the 14th with a 106. And shortly afterwards he received a rare mid-frame standing ovation after sinking a black that took his next effort to 105 – it would eventually reach 132 as he cleared the table.It is the second time Trump has reached a century of centuries with Neil Robertson, who had a record 103 in the 2013-14 campaign, the only other player to achieve it.View image in fullscreenJudd Trump has a four-frame overnight lead against Shaun Murphy.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAMonday evening’s ticket holders can expect to be short-changed as former champion Luca Brecel will also come back requiring a single frame to complete a comprehensive win over Ding Junhui.The Belgian had looked certain to clinch the match with a session to spare after reeling off 11 frames in a row after former champion Ding had opened proceedings in their first session on Saturday with a break of 141.Ding finally stopped the rot in frame 13 and after Brecel moved further clear at 12-2, Ding then summoned successive centuries out of nothing, to pull back to 12-4 and require Brecel – who had flown in for Saturday’s first session by private jet – to hang around for a final session.Zhao Xintong reached the quarter-finals for the first time after completing a 13-10 win over his Chinese compatriot Lei Peifan.

The British fighter, who holds the IBF belt, has been angling for a rematch against the WBA, WBO and WBC champion, who stopped him in the ninth round of theirprevious meeting in August 2023.Now the pair have agreed to a sequel at the national stadium and will meet face-to-face at a press conference on Tuesday. Dubois’ camp, led by promoter Frank Warren, were unhappy about the circumstances of the 27-year-old’s previous defeat in Poland. Referee Luis Pabon ruled that a fifth-round knockdown of Usyk was a low blow, allowing him a lengthy recovery period, and his call was strongly contested in the aftermath.Chris Eubank Jr beats Conor Benn by unanimous decision after frenetic brawlRead moreSince then Dubois has bounced back by defeating Jarrell Miller, claiming the vacant IBF belt with a win over Filip Hrgovic, andknocking out Anthony Joshuaat Wembley. Usyk has not boxed since beating Tyson Fury in Saudi Arabia in December.“This is the fight I wanted and demanded and now I get my chance for revenge againstOleksandr Usyk,” said Dubois. “I should have won the first fight and was denied by the judgment of the referee, so I will make no mistake this time around in front of my people at the national stadium in my home city.“I am a superior and more dangerous fighter now and Usyk will find this out for himself on July 19. I would like to thank my promoter Frank for making this happen for me and I intend to repay him by becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.”Usyk, who won his previous unification bout against Fury last May on a split decisionand beat him againseven months later, is eager to put his full collection together again. “I’m grateful to God for the opportunity to once again fight for the undisputed championship,” he said. “Thank you, Daniel, for taking care of my IBF belt – now I want it back.”The prospect of getting the two men back in the ring together rose last month amid reports that a request has been lodged with the WBO to sanction the Dubois-Usyk clash ahead of a scheduled mandatory defence against Joseph Parker.Dubois had been looking at a possible all-British affair against Derek Chisora had his hopes of a second crack at the Ukrainian fallen through.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is the 10th Liverpool manager to win the league but the first to become champion in his debut season with the club.Slot paid tribute to his predecessor for bequeathing a title-winning squad and hardworking culture and to Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group, for what he claimed was the bold decision to appoint him last summer.“I’m very, very happy of course but to a certain extent it also feels unreal,” he said. “You’ve worked so hard for this moment to happen and, when it does happen, you need time to truly feel it. The fans were so happy that it didn’t take me long to understand what we’ve achieved together this season.“It is so special. It was a proud moment when I knew I would become the new head coach here, to be part of such a great football club, and to now be part of the history of this football club is something I could have only dreamed of three or four years ago.‘The first time I came here was when Pep Lijnders [Liverpool’s former assistant manager] invited me and that was against Tottenham. We all know what happened around Tottenham one or two years ago [the VAR decision] so now to win it against them is quite special.”Victory brings Liverpool level with fallen rivals Manchester United on 20 league championships. It is their second Premier League title in five years but unlike 2020, when Klopp’s team ended the club’s 30-year wait for a 19th league crown behind closed doors, their latest triumph was celebrated in front of jubilant supporters.View image in fullscreenCody Gakpo sprays Alexis Mac Allister with champagne after winning the title.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPALiverpool were unable to hold a trophy parade five years ago because of the pandemic but one will be staged in the city on Monday 26 May. Klopp may be in attendance, having assembled the supremely talented squad that Slot inherited. The Liverpool head coach sang Klopp’s name on the pitch after the final whistle, reciprocating the welcome his predecessor gave him at Klopp’s final game in charge last season.“The only moment I was emotional today was when we arrived at the stadium to see what it meant for the fans, for these people,” Slot said. “For us to have a chance to win it was really special but we still had to do it. Everyone inside that bus felt, if the fans are with us like that, it was impossible to lose this game of football.”Slot’s side have topped the table since 2 November. After a home defeat by Nottingham Forest in the fourth game of the season, Liverpool embarked on a 26-match unbeaten league run that lasted almost seven months. The former Feyenoord coach, who said he would celebrate with a “beer or two or three”, praised FSG and Liverpool’s sporting director, Richard Hughes, for appointing him last summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For them to trust me in this position, maybe now everyone says it makes complete sense, but the moment they signed me maybe not everyone was as convinced as they are now. That tells you what a special club this is because that they don’t always go for the most simple or obvious choice. They make the choice that is best for the club. It must be a special time for them, second time in five years that they win the league and to do it in front of our fans is special, including for them.”Slot follows José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte as the fifth manager to win the title in his first season in the Premier League. The Dutch coach is also the fourth Liverpool manager to win the championship at the first attempt, following Matt McQueen in 1922-23, Joe Fagan in 1983-84 and Kenny Dalglish in 1985-86, although his predecessors were all established figures at Anfield before stepping into the role. Slot is the only one to win the league in his first season at the club.His wife and two children were present at Anfield to see him make history. “It is special to have them with me because my family, and all of the families of the players, have to make sacrifices if you do this job not only this season but your whole career,” he said. “My family was still in Holland this year so, in moments, it was hard for me but also for them. To win it, everyone feels the few sacrifices we made were definitely worth it and it is special they experience this moment as well.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

But it was as people were finishing their post-prandial pints that the game was lost, the visitors at one stage losing five for four in 34 balls. Tom Abell shouldered arms, Josh Davey played on, Tom Banton was brilliantly caught, Kasey Aldridge edged onto his stumps, and an airborne Dan Lawrence plucked James Rew out of the spring air.From 38 for seven, a total of 119 was actually something of an achievement, especially with Sean Dickson unable to bat. Rory Burns’ busy 20 quickly guided Surrey to 36 for victory, though Dom Sibley and Ollie Pope fell along the way. Pope was out for one for the second time in the game as Jordan Clark went home with eight wickets in his wallet.Nottinghamshiremarched to a nine-wicket win overSussex, buoyed by another four wickets from 17-year old Farhan Ahmed, and fifties from Haseeb Hameed and Ben Duckett – one a Penguin classic, the other an airport thriller. Fergus O’Neill leaves Trent Bridge, after 21 wickets in four games, to be replaced by Mohammad Abbas, who lands just in time for their next match – against his old club Hampshire.

His thoughts as he saw it was going to soar past the rim? “This is going to be bad,” Jokić said.Gordon’s basket was ruled good by the referees before it was automatically reviewed at the NBA’s replay center in New Jersey. The official there confirmed the ball left Gordon’s hands above the rim before the buzzer sounded after the Nuggets had blown a 22-point lead.The NBA said it was the first game-winning, buzzer-beating dunk in the playoffs since the play-by-play era began in 1997-98.It was the Clippers’ second heartbreaking loss of the series, having dropped Game 1 by two points in overtime.“It’s still a series, best-of-three,” Clippers star Kawhi Leonard said. “We’ll see what happens.”Jokić had 36 points, 21 rebounds and eight assists to lead the Nuggets. Michael Porter Jr and Christian Braun had 17 points apiece. Leonard scored 24 points.

Based on Sanders’ tape alone, he looked like a second-round talent, which – based on quarterback prospects over time – could have shoved him into the first round, given the importance of the position.Instead, Sandershad to wait and wait and wait, and everybody watching on ESPN or the NFL Network had to wade through an intolerable level of Sanders discussion, while dozens of deserving prospects had their own stories overshadowed. ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr, one of the industry’s most-respected draft analysts,was particularly strident in his argumentsthat the NFL had no idea what it was doing by letting Sanders go undrafted for so long.Shedeur Sanders’s fall exposed the cruel heart of the NFL draft industry | Oliver ConnollyRead moreBeyond the morning show-level “dialogue” is the specter of Sanders’ value to the NFL, and how he overcomes this embarrassment. The 23-year-old is certainly not the first quarterback to be drafted far below what his talent would indicate, but the reported issues that he brings to the league,if true, would explain a lot.“At the [scouting] combine, it is now well documented some of his formal interviews did not go well,”NFL Network insider Tom Pellissero saidof Sanders’ meetings with teams in the lead-up to the draft. “One assistant coach told me in all his years, it was the worst formal interview he’d ever been through. People said that Shadeur was trying to dictate how he wanted things to go, and made them feel small.”Other insiders reportedthat when NFL coaches asked the quarterback to show his work on schematic packages he’d been given and subsequently asked to explain in the room, Sanders was unable to do it, and the sense was that this was not about a lack of processing ability. Sanders simply didn’t do the work.Now, if Sanders is to transcend what has been done to his reputation in the court of public opinion – and it should be said that figures such as Jerry Jones and Sean Payton were willing togo on the record to defend Sanders’s character– he has plenty of work to do. The Browns had already selected Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel in the third round, and Gabriel – who set the FBS record for total touchdowns in his estimable collegiate tenure – will not be an easy guy to beat.Last season, Gabriel was among college football’s most efficient quarterbacks when throwing deep, when pressured, and when going through the receiver progressions everyNFLquarterback must master. Were Gabriel not a smaller (5ft 11in, 205lb) quarterback, a lefty, and 24 years old, Sanders as a backup and Gabriel as the starter probably wouldn’t be a discussion. Both quarterbacks will also have to compete with veterans Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco for the starting job in Cleveland.Beyond the off-field stuff, Sanders’ adjustments to NFL football will be interesting. Sanders did what he did in 2024 behind perhaps the NCAA’s worst offensive line, which is the main reason he was sacked 40 times and pressured 204 times on his 563 dropbacks. And he was pretty good himself under pressure – per Pro Football Focus, Sanders completed 76 of 138 passes when disrupted for 1,117 yards, 12 touchdowns, five interceptions, and a passer rating of 95.6.The two quarterbacks selected in the first round, Miami’s Cam Ward (first overall by the Tennessee Titans) and Ole Miss’s Jaxson Dart (25th overall to the New York Giants) had passer ratings under pressure of 88.7 and 83.9, respectively.Colorado’s offense also did not give Sanders the benefit of enough of the concepts far more familiar to NFL quarterbacks, like play-action, designed pocket movement, pre-snap motion, and advanced route concepts designed to give the quarterback easier openings.In one way, that gives Sanders an edge – schematically, he was swinging a weighted bat at Colorado, and now, that burden is relieved to a certain extent. But adjusting to the offense put forth by Browns head coach and offensive shot-caller Kevin Stefanski, which is filled with those positive constructs, will take more than a minute. And the history of college quarterbacks converting from simple spread-out offenses to the dimensional complexity of the NFL is not a favorable one.There’s also the fact that Sanders’ coaches will have to be completely bought into the idea of his presence on the roster. This could be fractious.Haslam strong-armed former Browns general manager Ray Farmer back in 2014to pick all-time draft bust quarterback Johnny Manziel with the 22nd overall pick in the first round ofthatdraft,andled the charge for the Deshaun Watson trade and subsequent contract in 2022, which ultimately combined to formperhaps the worst deal in sports history. If things are no different now, that’s not good for anybody involved.View image in fullscreenShedeur Sanders became a college star with Colorado.Photograph: George Walker IV/AP“We felt like he was a good solid prospect at the most important position,” Browns general managerAndrew Berry said of Sanders soon after the pick was made. “We felt like it got to a point where he was probably mispriced relative to the draft; really the acquisition cost was pretty light. And it’s a guy that we think can outproduce his draft slot.“I wouldn’t say it’s any more than that. Shadeur has kind of grown up in the spotlight. But our expectation is for him to come in here and work and compete.Nothing’s been promised; nothing will be given. So I may hesitate to characterize it as a blockbuster – that’s not necessarily how we thought of the transaction. But we are excited to work with him.”Ergo, the Browns are already hedging their bets and hoping that the spotlight that will come with the pick of Sanders doesn’t outweigh the actual football stuff.Sanders became a college star by turning around – along with his father, Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, and brilliant teammate Travis Hunter – a formerly destitute program in Colorado, and his slide in the draft was the perfect drama for every talking head in the world. But now, with minicamp workouts starting soon (the Browns’ first minicamp begins on 27 May), Sanders’ story now must be all about the tough, grueling work, and adhering to a system as opposed to calling the shots.From the first playbook installation to the crucible of the preseason, Sanders has mere months to make his point before the regular season starts in early September. He has already shown the toughness and grit to make that happen, but as to the ability to work in an environment where neither he nor his father are the alphas in the equation, the jury is still out.It’s crude to encourage Sanders to be “humbled” by this experience; that’s not what it’s all about. But if this experience provided a reality check for Sanders, letting him know in uncertain terms that the path to NFL success can be littered with obstacles (both external and self-inflicted), that may not be the worst thing in the world.Explore more on these topicsNFLCleveland BrownsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the 2023 season, he set the single-season Gators record for punt average at 48.9 yards.Crawshaw is set to compete with veteran P Matt Haack for the Broncos’ starting job. Haack signed a one-year, $US1.255 million contract with the club in March.“Played a lot of sports as a kid,’’ Crawshaw said in a media conference call following his selection. “Rugby was the main one. ... (I) pretty much started looking for something to do after school, play some sports.“They gave me a scholarship to come over to Florida and spent five years here and then (I was) lucky enough to move on and be with the Denver Broncos.”🚨 punter highlights 🚨@jeremy_crawshawx#BroncosDraftpic.twitter.com/CeyImxznpe— Denver Broncos (@Broncos)April 26, 2025Although Crawshaw will officially compete with Haack for the Broncos’ punter job theNFLtends to favour a specialist like a punter or kicker when he is drafted.“Matt Haack has already been in the league for a long time, and I’ve watched a lot of film on him,’’ Crawshaw said. “I’m kind of just looking forward to competing.”He is poised to join fellow Australian punters Tory Taylor (Chicago), Mitch Wishnowsky (San Francisco), Michael Dickson (Seattle) and Cameron Johnston (Pittsburgh) in the NFL.“Crawshaw will likely move in and become an immediate NFL starter with the potential to become a genuine field-position weapon,” reads Crawshaw’s pre-draft scouting report.“His combination of power, touch, and directional control makes him an ideal fit for teams emphasising special teams play. The Australian’s background actually works in his favor, bringing a different perspective to directional punting and spin control.“His skill set particularly suits teams playing in outdoor stadiums where wind and weather management become crucial factors. The ability to execute multiple punt styles - from traditional bombs to rugby-style rollers - gives coordinators a versatile weapon for any situation.“With his proven track record in high-pressure SEC environments and continued development throughout his college career, Crawshaw has positioned himself as the top punter in this draft class.The scouting report ends with a glowing endorsement for the former Sydneysider. “(Crawshaw’s) ceiling suggests a decade-plus career as a reliable NFL punter with Pro Bowl potential. (His) experience holding on placekicks adds valuable roster flexibility.”Crawshaw was the sixth player drafted by Denver, joining first-round defensive back Jahdae Barron, second-round running back RJ Harvey, third-round wide receiver Pat Bryant and defensive end Sai’Vion Jones, and fourth-round linebacker Que Robinson.New Broncos special teams coordinator Darren Rizzi has a proven appreciation for Australian-born punters believing their rugby background suits the NFL’s directional punting strategies.Rizzi comes from the New Orleans Saints where his recent punter was Australian-born Lou Hedley. He reputedly sought out Crawshaw during Florida’s Pro Day last month for lunch where the deal to join the Broncos was hatched.Explore more on these topicsNFLDenver BroncosAustralia sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Majorel, the company at the centre of the allegations in Ghana, is owned by the French multinational Teleperformance.One man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he attempted suicide owing to the nature of his work. His claims his contract was subsequently terminated and he has returned to his home country.Facebook and other large social media companies employ armies of content moderators, often based in the poorest parts of the world, to remove posts that breach their community standards and to train AI systems to do the same.Moderators are required to review distressing and often brutal pictures and videos to establish whether they should be removed from Meta’s platforms. According to workers in Ghana, they have seen videos of a person being skinned alive and a woman being beheaded.The moderators claim mental health care offered by the firm was unhelpful, was not delivered by medical doctors, and that personal disclosures made by staff about the effects of their work were circulated among managers.Teleperformance disputed this, saying it employed licensed mental health professionals who are registered with the local regulatory body and hold a master’s degree in psychology, counselling, or another mental health field.The legal case is being prepared by a UK-based nonprofit, Foxglove. It would be the second case brought by content moderators in Africa, after Samasource workers in Kenya sued in 2023.Foxglove said it was “urgently investigating these shocking abuses of workers” with a view to using “every tool at our disposal, including potential legal action” to improve working conditions.It is working with a Ghanaian firm, Agency Seven Seven, on preparing two possible lawsuits. One would allege psychological harms and could involve a group of moderators, and the other unfair dismissal, involving the moderator from east Africa whose contract was terminated after he attempted suicide.Foxglove’s co-executive director Martha Dark said: “These are the worst conditions I have seen in six years of working with social media content moderators around the world.“In Ghana, Meta is displaying nothing short of a complete disregard for the humanity of its key safety workers upon whom all its profits rely: content moderators. They are treated as objects who can be used up, burned out and replaced with no care whatsoever for the permanent damage to their mental and physical wellbeing.”Dark said basic wages for content moderators in Accra were below living costs, incentivising them to work overtime, for which pay is understood to be even lower than normal rates. Moderators faced deductions from their pay for failing to meet performance targets, she added.Contracts seen by the Guardian show that the base wage starts at about 1,300 Ghanaian cedis a month – just over £64. This is supplemented by a system of performance-related bonuses, the upper range of which amounts to about 4,900 cedis (£243) a month, significantly less than the estimatedcost of living in Accra.A Teleperformance spokesperson said content moderators enjoyed “strong pay and benefits, including monthly pay that is roughly 10 times the country’s minimum wage for domestic moderators, and 16 times the minimum wage for those who have relocated from other countries, when including project allowance, transportation allowance, language premium and more – all of which are automatically paid to the moderator and are not performance-based”.Foxglove’s researcher Michaela Chen said she had seen photos of moderators’ living quarters, in which they were “crammed five to a flat, two to a room”. She said there appeared to be a culture of secrecy, including surveillance from managers, who follow workers into the toilets during breaks.This extends to moderators’ work for Meta. She said: “Workers spend all day working on Meta’s platforms, moderating to Meta’s standards and using Meta’s systems, but at the same time, moderators are told constantly: ‘You do not work for Meta,’ and are forbidden from telling anyone they do.”Teleperformance said moderators were “offered housing in … one of the most upscale and well-known residential and commercial neighbourhoods in Accra”.The spokesperson described the housing as “safe, with strong security” and having air conditioning, recreation facilities, including gyms and pools.Carla Olympio, a partner at Agency Seven Seven, said she believed a personal injury case could succeed in Ghana’s courts and would set a precedent establishing that worker protections extend to psychological harms as well as physical injury.“[There is] currently a gap in our laws because they haven’t necessarily caught up with the new developments that cover technology and virtual work,” she said.Rosa Curling, a co-executive director at Foxglove, said it was seeking for the court to “order immediate changes to the content moderators’ workplace”, including proper safeguards and psychiatric care.A spokesperson for Teleperformance said: “At TP in Ghana, we take our content moderation work seriously. From the very beginning during the interview process, within the employee contract and through employee training and resiliency testing, we are fully transparent with our prospective moderators regarding the content they might see during their work to help keep the internet safe for our communities. We have robust people management systems and workplace practices, including a robust wellbeing programme staffed by fully licensed psychologists to support our content moderators throughout their content moderation journey.”Meta said the companies it worked with were “contractually obliged to pay their employees who review content on Facebook and Instagram above the industry standard in the markets they operate”.The tech company said it took “the support of content reviewers seriously”, including detailing expectations around counselling, training and other support in contracts with the companies it outsourced.It said all content moderators signed client confidentiality agreements because they were dealing with user information which needed to be protected and for their own safety, but moderators may discuss their jobs with doctors and counsellors, and some aspects with family members.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

I’ll never forget youI spent entire nights in 2011 gabbing on Skype. As it shutters, I’m reminded of a bygone era of online intimacyAdrian HortonSun 27 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 03.45 EDTShareIdoubt many people are mourning the demise ofSkype. The sky-blue platform that revolutionized the video call,themedium for long-distance relationships in the early 2010s, had not been relevant for almost a decade when Microsoft announced its impending death. My own relationship with Skype’s clunky tangle of video, voice and chat peaked in 2011 – the same year Microsoft purchased it for a headline-making $8.5bn, only to let it wither in the shadow of professionalized, less-pixelated options. By 2014, it was basically obsolete, as video calls shifted to more integrated apps like FaceTime, and my college schedule did not allow for glitchy, hours-long catchups. Snapchat was far more efficient.Like most people, I barely touched Skype from the mid-2010s on; the news that Microsoft will shutter it on 4 May and fold its data into the free version of Teams prompted me to log back in for the first time in five years. All that remained of my formerly thriving Skype life – once a log of video calls picked up and put down, peppered with chats pleading to “pleaseeeeeeee call me back bitchhhh (:” – were a handful of spam crypto chats and phishing links from former favorites who had long quit the platform, as well.Skype shutdown surfaces sweet memories: ‘I proposed marriage’Read moreStill, I must pour one out for Skype, a place where I would spend whole nights in 2011 gabbing over murky video, a form and era of technology I associate with a spectral, critical, inarticulable valence of intimacy that also feels bygone. I lavished hours and hours and hours on the platform in high school, catching up with my older friends who slipped the bounds of our town for university, or sussing out kids from other states I met on college visits, or desperately trying to keep my older unofficial boyfriend’s attention despite all signs pointing to him moving on.Skype was an island of intimacy – more than text but not quite the real thing – that tangled emotions and refracted IRL life in ways difficult to explain. It was the tether to people outside my small world – people older than me, cooler than me, going to more parties than me. A whole night on Skype video hearing a friend recap his escapades of pledging a fraternity, clinging to the fact that he still wanted to talk to me. A nebulous romantic relationship kept alive by the semblance of intimacy and the promise of access – we could do homework together, my bedroom to his student lounge. I could meet the two-dimensional versions of his friends. A perpetual state of will-they-won’t-they without any prospect of seeing each other, or a fleeting new friendship processing the death of a mutual friend in long, desperate gulps of connection – that was all over Skype.And that was all forgotten, siloed to a particular platform and a particular time, when digital relationships seemed to me a strange, new liminal realm, not an everyday facet of life and before my attention splintered into minute-long intervals. If people are talking about Skype these days, it’s probably in relation to the movie Past Lives, which depicted a relationship over several decades and captured that peculiar intimacy in a chapter of intense, inexpressibly important reconnection over video call. For the film’s release in 2023, Iwroteabout how the writer-director Celine Song’s inclusion of the classicSkype theme music– that interminable and annoyingly peppy sonar into the deep digital abyss – portaled me straight back to 2011, the same year Nora Moon (Greta Lee) began long-distance video-chatting with her childhood sweetheart Hae Sung (Teo Yoo). Song effectively and accurately rendered the heady rush of long-distance intimacy, the formative kind forgotten under the layers of real life that came after – curled up in bed on hours-long calls, rushing to beat the ringtone clock, awkwardly papering over glitches and lags.The predominant feeling of Past Lives is the predominant feeling, for me, of Skype: yearning – for a bigger world, for renewed attention, for a bond to remain in place. For a person you could not actually be with. For some way to describe all the emotions caught up in “Skyping”. For the hope that these long video calls could actually substitute for the real thing. It is admittedly difficult to disentangle this yearning from nostalgia for a simpler time with fewer demands on our attention, less omnipresent connection, less overwhelm. When now-faded relationships still had some road left, when tech interfaces felt clumsy and rough, because they were so new. When youth allowed for an endless sense of possibility, and when the intangible weight of relationships, friend or lover or somewhere in between, rested on this hallowed, janky portal to another laptop. The other person haloed in blue light, there but not.The locus of long-distance connection has long shifted elsewhere, taken root and entwined with normal life. You can now FaceTime someone, text them and check their other digital beams – their Instagram Stories, their Letterboxd logs, their Strava workouts, even their real-time location – from the same screen, in the same minute, with the same impulse. The video quality evolved and proliferated. I got older, and long-distance connection became more a puzzle of screens and streams and time to optimize, less an escape. And Skype straggled on as one of our most ephemeral digital artifacts; there islittle for the digital hoarderin its remnants. Unlike text messages or camcorder video or iPhotos or the never-deleting Facebook timelines, there is no archive, no vastlibrary of video to parse through.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will turning it into a game make everything better?With two small kids and a dog to take care of, I often struggle to look after myself. Self-care apps promise to help – if you can handle the quests, magic potions and rainbow stones. I put four of them to the testChloë HamiltonSun 27 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareThe other night, I didn’t moisturise before bed. The baby had just woken and was crying for a feed. I didn’t want him to wake the toddler he shares a room with, and I couldn’t, in that intensely fraught moment, locate my Elizabeth Arden.We all find it hard, at times, to fit in self-care. But if there’s one thing I’ve noticed since becoming a mum of two small children, it’s that even the most basic level of personal care requires military-level planning. Often, I pour from an empty cup because I haven’t had time – or, more likely, I’ve simply forgotten – to refill it.Fortunately, there’s an app for that. Lots, in fact. The global self-care apps market wasvalued at about $3bn (£2.2bn) in 2024and is projected to reach $14bn by 2033. Many of these apps turn self-care into a game to help users look after themselves. There are gamified apps for meditation, drinking more water and consuming less alcohol. There’s even one called Zombies, Run! that claims to put a “post-apocalyptic spin on a workout” by challenging users to outrun the undead.Gamification expert Kimba Cooper-Martin says of the trend: “Gamification taps into psychological motivators like achievements, competition (even with yourself) and rewards. It makes tasks more engaging and less like chores.”So, I put four gamified apps – Finch, Habitica, Ahead and PokémonSleep– to the test for one week each to see if any of them could help me take better care of myself. All are available for iOS and Android and have free versions or free trials, plus extra features for between £4.99 and £9.99 a month.FinchI thought I’d love Finch, which launched in 2021 and encourages users to look after themselves by, um, making them look after a pet. I’m a child of the 90s, after all, and once kept my Tamagotchi alive for nearly two weeks – although, in fairness, this was mostly because my dad took it to work with him and left his meetings to feed it.View image in fullscreenThe birbs from the Finch app.Photograph: FinchAs you complete self-care goals on Finch (drinking more water, meditating, running) your little pet (they call it a birb) will go on adventures, grow, be happy. And if you don’t hit your goals? Don’t worry: according to the app’s creators, the pets “never die because it can be too anxiety inducing”.I downloaded the app with much anticipation. Sure, I already have a baby, a toddler and a spaniel to look after, but what’s another mouth to feed?“You hatched a birb,” my phone tells me when I open Finch for the first time, before inviting me to choose its pronouns. The app then suggests a name: Squiggles. Unconvinced, I click “shuffle” and a new moniker is generated for my pixelated pet: Peach. Better.And so Peach and I begin our adventures. I’m allowed to choose my own goals and decide to keep it simple. Get out of bed is one. Brush my teeth is another. I do set a few slightly more intentional ones, though: take three deep breaths; have a stretch break; do one thing that makes you happy. Each time I complete a goal, I get to check it off and Peach rewards me with merry little cheeps, the occasional burst of digital ticker tape, and messages letting me know that she now has 123 Rainbow Stones, whatever they are. I’m also thrown daily affirmations each time I log on to the app. “I’m not lost, I’m exploring,” preens one. “I allow myself time to unwind,” gloats another.I play along and even buy Peach a little toadstool hat for 500 Rainbow Stones (seems steep to me); try to hatch her a micropet by promising to take three deep breaths for seven days in a row (unsuccessful); and even plan to send her off on adventures in Finchie Forest powered by a “potion” (bought with more Rainbow Stones).I find the whole thing overstimulating to the point of being unusableWhile I like keeping track of my goals, I find that the concept is lost on me. Maybe the app’s colourful display is too busy or maybe I’m simply too old for this business, but I find the whole thing overstimulating to the point of being unusable.At one point, Finch advises me that Peach is just four more “full-energy” days away from becoming a toddler. Sadly, my actual toddler, himself already full of energy, is not only slowly sapping mine but is also – rightly – keeping me away from my phone, meaning I sometimes go a day or two without checking in on poor Peach.Before long, the app feels like another job, so I enact the biggest act of self-care thus far and delete it.HabiticaPerhaps the best way to ensure you keep on top of self-care is to make it a habit, part ofyour daily routine. That’s the thinking behind Habitica, which features in-game rewards and – eek! – punishments to motivate users.I’m initially impressed. The app invites me to list a range of habits and then select whether they have a positive or negative impact on my life. Putting my phone down for at least an hour, for example, is a positive habit. Spending more than 15 minutes at a time scrolling on Vinted is negative. I enjoy thinking about what habits I already have, exploring if they’re helpful or unhelpful, and then siphoning them off accordingly.Things then get a bit other-worldly. The more positive habits I check off, the more “gold” I accumulate for my avatar, who I can also send off on quests – completing tasks, battling monsters and collecting enchanted feathers. I’m able to get gold, too, by completing a daily scheduled task like brushing my teeth or by ticking off an item on my personalised to-do list, such as collecting my son’s prescription from the pharmacy. I can then use said gold to “buy” rewards, which can either be, say, potions for my avatar (potions again!) or customised prizes that I input: listening to a podcast, watching an episode of my favourite TV show, allowing myself more than 15 minutes on Vinted. If I partake in bad habits, I lose gold or damage my avatar.I wonder if relying on extrinsic motivation erodes the power of intrinsic motivationI understand the theory: that if you do something – a good habit – and something positive happens as a result, you’re more likely to repeat that habit. Similarly, if you do something bad and something negative happens, you’re unlikely to do it again.I’m not entirely convinced, though, by relying on extrinsic motivation: to me it risks eroding the power of intrinsic motivation. I should spend an hour away from my phone because it’s good for my brain, not because if I do, I get some guilt-free scrolling time in return.Like Finch, Habitica encourages me to build a streak by using the app every day. But, although there isn’t a digital dependant relying on me this time, I still feel guilty every time I forget to log on. I even find myself feeling stressed about not recording health habits on the app, even if I’ve carried them out in real life. I also – and perhaps this is my age at play again – find the cluttered design a bit tiresome. So I delete this one, too.AheadBy the time I try Ahead, I’m a bit frustrated with self-care apps. Finch and Habitica – though, I’m sure, helpful for their fans – are too overstimulating for me. So I’m pleasantly surprised when I download Ahead – which bills itself as “Duolingo for your emotional intelligence” – and find the app has been created by scientists from Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard universities. This, combined with a clean and intuitive design, gives it a reassuring air of grown-up credibility.It opens with a quiz about how I’d respond to different events: if a friend moved a coffee date, for example, or if I made a mistake at work. The language is clear and accessible, if sometimes a bit too wacky. (Do you get “hot like a jalapeno” in arguments? Apparently I do!) Then, from my results, it calculates what I’m most in need of help with, covering everything from anxiety to anger. It also asks me – and I particularly like this bit – how much time I’m able to commit to the app per day, ranging from three to five minutes to more than 15. I choose five to 10 minutes, a middle ground, which I resolve to do while winding down before bed. I also commit, somewhat tentatively, to a five-day streak of logging on to Ahead to “work on myself”.Working on myself, it transpires, involves clicking through a series of very short courses that have the vibe of workplace fire safety training, even down to the short recall quizzes I’m asked to complete at the end of each one. In them, I’m taught about how to manage my emotions, spot distorted thinking and establish whether any of my worries are helpful. Each mini-course comes with sources to back up the theory and a timestamp that tells me how long it will take (most are around three to five minutes). They’re easy to do, surprisingly informative, and – hurrah! – there’s not a single potion or quest in sight. Learnings and techniques picked up along the way are safely stashed within the app for me to refer back to as needed. And I do.I don’t manage my five-day streak. However, crucially, I don’t feel guilty for missing a day, knowing the courses are there for me to pick up when I can.Pokémon SleepView image in fullscreenA help or a hindrance?Photograph: Wachiwit/AlamyI was initially sceptical that Pokémon Sleep, a sleep-tracking app based on the Pokémon franchise, would work for me given I often share a bed with my own little Pikachu – my 10-month-old baby – who still wakes frequently at night. I also suffer from bouts of insomnia, made worse, I think, by the postpartum hormones raging through my body. Would the pressure of gamifying my sleep make it harder to drop off?The premise of the app – which, I should say, is intended for entertainment purposes only – is supposedly simple: help the fictional Professor Neroli research Pokémon’s sleep habits using a Snorlax (a large, blue-green creature that sleeps a lot) as, I guess, a kind of sleep bait, encouraging different Pokémon to come over and have a nap next to it. The more you sleep, the greater your Snorlax’s “Drowsy Power” will become and the more Pokémon you will attract and wake up to in the morning. Got it? Good.The app uses your device’s accelerometer to estimate your sleep state by detecting body movement. Professor Neroli suggests sleeping with the app open and running, your phone face down on the mattress and uncovered by pillows and blankets.I’m not a Pokémon fan (unless you count trading cards in the playground when I was 10) but seeing a tiny, snoring Charmander curled up on my screen when I awoke on the first morning elicited an unexpected squeal of delight. I also found it interesting – and useful – to dig into the data the app provides. It divides sleep into three categories – a doze, a snooze and a slumber – and each morning sends you a report on how you slept, noting what percentage of your sleep was spent in each one. It tells you, too, how long it takes you to fall asleep, which was fascinating for someone who, too often, lies awake for hours on end wondering why they can’t sleep. (While using the app, I learned it’s typical for it to take me about 20 minutes to get to the land of nod.) I should, however, point out that phones, smartwatches etc are not 100% reliable when it comes to measuring sleep and often unable to distinguish slumber from simply being still. In other words, if you just lie there hoping to drop off, your tech may assume you already have.Maybe self-care apps aren’t for me, because I’m trying to spend less time on my phoneProfessor Neroli was, in addition, irritating. It was a little galling, for example, when he chastised me – after a night when the baby had been up from midnight to 2am – for my sleep score of 85, telling me I was aiming for 100 and should “try to get as much sleep” as possible. That, and the fact you need to clock up an uninterrupted 90 minutes of shut-eye in order to even log sleep data, suggests this app probably isn’t designed with new parents in mind.The verdictMaybe self-care apps aren’t for me, not least because I’m trying to spend less time on my phone. I’m already addicted to WhatsApp, Instagram and Vinted, and I’m not sure it’s helpful to add another app into the mix. I realised, over the course of the experiment, that not only was I not sold on the level of fantasy involved in many of the apps I’d chosen, I also didn’t like how much they dragged me away from the real world.On reflection, too, I found the pressure of gamification to be in conflict with the whole idea of self-care: it just made me more stressed.This, it transpires, isn’t uncommon. Dr Frankie Harrison, a clinical psychologist, says: “There’s a fine line between using these apps as a helpful tool and turning self-care into another task to complete. For some people, especially those dealing with anxiety or trauma, tracking habits or emotions too rigidly can actually add pressure rather than relieve it.”There’s no doubt these apps have their place. Some people, I’m sure, find them extremely useful, especially if they thrive on structure and accountability as well as fun. But, at least for me, they’re not a magic fix, no matter how many powers, Pokémon or potions are involved.Explore more on these topicsSleepHealth & wellbeingMental healthAppsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I first came across that ticket I was very shocked. I didn’t even look at my computer because it was very disturbing for me.View image in fullscreenThe Octagon building in Accra.Photograph: Foxglove“But gradually I started normalising what happened because I became used to it. I even started to enjoy seeing people beheaded, child abuse, pornography, suicide. I asked myself, is that normal? And I replied, it’s not.”Solomon, who arrived from his home in east Africa in late 2023, said he would “never forget the day” he came across a person being gradually skinned alive. “The system doesn’t allow us to skip it … we have to look at it for 15 seconds, at least.”Another video featured a woman from his home country screaming for help in his native language while several people stabbed her.He says the videos became more and more disturbing. Some days, there would be no videos, then something would start trending and in the same day 70-80% of videos would feature graphic content. He felt himself gradually becoming “out of humanity”.In the evenings, he would return to the shared flat provided by his employer, the outsourcing company Teleperformance, with “no room for privacy and many problems with water and electricity”.When Solomon learned that a childhood friend had been killed, his already fragile mental health unravelled. He broke a window and a mirror in frustration, leading Teleperformance to suspend him until he felt better.He spent the next two weeks home alone. “I started developing depression. I didn’t eat or sleep, I drank day and night and smoked day and night. I was not this kind of person before,” he said.Solomon attempted suicide, and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where, he said, he was diagnosed with major depression disorder with suicidal ideation. He was discharged after eight days, at the end of 2024.Teleperformance offered to transfer him to a lower-paid job, but he feared he would not earn enough to survive in Accra. He asked for compensation for harm and longer term psychological care to be covered but instead Teleperformance sent him back to his home town, which is in the midst of an insurgency.“You’re using me and throwing me. They treated me like a water bottle – you drink water and throw the bottle way,” Solomon said after his dismissal.He said he had held a professional job in his home country, adding: “Before coming here I was so happy and peaceful.”Another moderator, Abel*, shared how he, too, had had his contract terminated, for standing up for his friend Solomon and for the rights of other employees.He said he had told Teleperformance: “You’re not treating him well.”“They just put him in the house. He stayed alone and he was telling me he’s scared being alone all the time, it was giving him severe stress, so he started to going to the company, ‘I want to stay with you guys, I want to be in office, I’m scared.’”Abel, too, had struggled with his mental health because of the content. “I didn’t know the nature of the job, actually. I didn’t realise I’d see people skinned alive and porn videos as my daily job … This is the first time I’d heard of content moderators … I used to be spooked when I saw blood, but now I’ve become numb. Gradually I’ve seen it altering my character … I’m struggling. Not to exaggerate, it’s 100% changed me.”He said his colleagues often sat around drinking coffee and discussing disturbing content, including religious colleagues sharing their feelings of shame.He has come to fear raising such issues with the wellbeing coach, as he has seen his disclosures later being referred to by his team leader. When he said he no longer wished to use wellbeing services, which he believed were “for research on us”, he was challenged.A Teleperformance spokesperson said: “Upon learning of his depression as a result of his friend’s death, we conducted a psychological assessment and determined that the employee was no longer well enough to continue providing moderation services.“Instead, we offered him a different non-moderation role which he declined, insisting that he wanted to continue in this moderation role. Given this was not an option, his position ended and he was provided compensation according to his contractual agreement.“During his employment and afterward, we continued offering the employee psychological support, which he has repeatedly declined. At the suggestion of his brother, so that family could help provide the employee with support, and with the approval of medical counsel, we provided the employee with his flight back to Ethiopia.“We have continued to offer the employee psychological support in Ethiopia, however he has declined the support. Instead, he has tried to extort Teleperformance for money under threat of going to the media.”*Names have been changed to protect identitiesIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It’s no wonder mountain rescuers are being called out so oftenSun 27 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 16.09 EDTShareIt does not involve protest or violence, but it might be the quintessential human image of our times: a small group of people in the midst of spectacular natural scenery, drawn there in the certainty that the apps on their phones could somehow get them from A to B to C – but utterly, hopelessly lost.Two weeks ago, Mountain Rescue England and Wales published figures showinga record number of annual callouts. For the first time, in fact, teams – of overworked volunteers, mostly – had been called out on every day of the year. Between 2019 and 2024, the total number of rescues had increased by 24%, and there was a marked jump among the 18 to 24 age group, among whom callouts almost doubled. Similar trends were evident in data from Scotland: across Britain, there is evidently a mounting problem about the gap between people’s urge to experience wild and open spaces, and their ability to cope when they actually get there.The Guardian’s report included an incisive quotation from Mike Park, the chief executive of Mountain RescueEnglandand Wales, who talked about incidents in the Lake District, Eryri (Snowdonia), Northumberland and other places. “We know from incident reports that more and more people are tempted into risky locations by Instagram posts and the navigation apps being used aren’t always suitable for an outdoor environment,” he said. Whatever people found online either underplayed or completely ignored what he called “the hazards and context” – or, put more bluntly, the real world.Welcome, then, to yet another version of a familiar story: how seemingly infallible technology turns out to be nothing of the kind. Superficially,digital navigationbased on GPS tech seems massively empowering. In most of our everyday environments, that promise usually just about holds true. But it is also quintessentially infantilising, leaving us unable to get around without it, or cope with its shortcomings.Most of us know the horror and panic that comes with sudden battery loss in an unfamiliar place, and that weird sense of being cut adrift from basic skills that human beings have had since they learned to walk upright (if not before). But those hapless souls getting lost up mountains have confronted something even more fear-inducing: that once you are away from roads and built-up environments, many of the most dependable apps suddenly run out of detailed information.When that happens, do we even have the skills any more to find our way back to safety? In 2020, neuroscientists based at McGill University in Montrealpublished researchsuggesting that “people with greater lifetime GPS experience have worse spatial memory during self-guided navigation”. Thirteen of their participants were retested three years after the initial research, when they found that “greater GPS use since initial testing was associated with a steeper decline in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory”. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that deals with navigation: amongLondon taxi drivers, the need to memorise so many geographical details was found to cause it to increase in size. But here were findings that suggested the opposite: reliance on automated directions reducing people’s capacity to navigate for themselves.There is something even more profound and insidious at work here. On our phones, all that really matters is an archetypal blue dot, representing a single individual. As the writer and academicJerry Brottonputs it in his brilliant book Four Points of the Compass – published last year – this represents “the most extreme expression of a long history of egocentric mapping”. Anyone familiar with the history of ancient Rome willrecall Ptolemy, the mathematician and astronomer who believed that the planets of the solar system, along with the sun, revolved around the Earth. Here is our delusional modern equivalent: a version of reality that puts us at the centre of everything. It also offers no clues about what awaits us further along the route: the journey just unfolds by increments.Worse still, what the most-used navigation apps – Google and Apple maps – most clearly show is the location of shops and restaurants, embodying the sense that, as Brotton puts it, “what matters most is where we stand and how we consume, often at the expense of an immersive understanding of and interaction with our physical domain”. The result is that “individuals online can be virtually connected but environmentally detached from the surrounding world, inhabiting a confused realm of spatial illiteracy”. If that can happen even in towns and cities, what hope have we got amid fells, lochs and forests?Lost your sense of direction? Turn off your phone and you’ll soon reconnectRead moreWanting to believe you are omniscient while constantly running the risk of accident and disaster might be the basis of the human condition, but the revolution in human thinking caused by the internet seems to have taken it to a surreal new extreme. It is surely telling that amid the endless profusion of apps designed to tell us where we are, how fast or slow our heart is beating and the latest news headlines, the word that seems toconstantly crop upin articles about the way we now live is “disorientation”. In that sense, people’s inability to find their way through the physical world reflects our declining skills at navigation more generally – and through information in particular. These are the consequences of the 21st century’s insistence that everything must be personalised: it distorts our understanding of the world to the point of near-fiction.And so, at the risk of sounding like someone’s dad, to some practical advice. If anyone is thinking of venturing into the wild but unsure of how to avoid disaster, I’d recommend the Ordnance Survey’s peerless phone app – which requires a subscription – and a paper map as a back-up, either in the form of the full fold-out version, or a relevant section shown in a reliable guidebook. Always carry a compass. Before you set off, do what the blue dot discourages, and cast your eyes across the whole route, mindful of the aforementioned hazards and context, and what apps underplay or omit: bogs, high streams and rivers, steep gradients.More broadly, we clearly need to talk about improving people’s understanding of what the countryside is like up close, and how to get around it – a conversation that might revive interest in the much-mocked subject of geography. Here, perhaps, is the key to reconnecting the world we see on our phones and the one we have to actually deal with. That is the breach that needs to be healed: if it isn’t, even more generations will find themselves lost, in every sense of the word.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionAppsGPSOrdnance SurveyWalkingMapsEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

But a bigger threat to my body may have come from an invisible villainSun 27 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 19.51 EDTShareEveryone experiences a moment that shapes who they are – a moment when childhood innocence is lost, and the burdens and traumas of the world become clearer.For me, that moment occurred in elementary school when my friend discovered a gun in Denning Park in Englewood,New Jersey. For days, I worried about what might be lurking behind the trees and in the shadows. This anxiety lingered through high school; I even wrote in my local newspaper that “I couldn’t remember anything more frightening for a young girl in elementary school”.Looking back at the violence-obsessed, fear-driven 90s, I thought dangerous people and violent weapons were the biggest threat to my body. It turns out that an invisible villain may have been the real danger.Black maternal health means navigating a broken system. But there is hope | Venice HaynesRead moreBack then, my suburban town of hardworking families felt like the heart of the Black American dream. Not perfect, but peaceful. Redlined, but filled with love.We lived in the shadow of factories bordering our beloved park. Companies such as the LeDoux Corporation, a chemical testing company that had worked on everything from the Manhattan Project to the moon landing, were just steps from the swings.While I was consumed by the potential danger of some shadowy, gun-toting figure, the real pain I felt was internal. My reproductive system betrayed me month after month, leaving me doubled over in excruciating pain. While the world validated my fear of violence, my period pain – marked by ER visits, surgeries and more than 30 Aleve each cycle – was dismissed as “in my head”. No one asked questions or explored its cause, let alone its potential environmental roots.Instead, I was handed birth-control pills and told to go about my merry way, even though Black people are far more likely to live in areas filled with environmental toxins that can harm fertility. We’re75% more likelyto live near industrial facilities and breathe air that’s38% more pollutedthan what white communities are exposed to.Discussions about toxins and the environment usually focus on cancer. However, a recentHuman Rights Watchreport found that air pollution is linked to gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and fibroids. On the heels of Earth Day and Infertility Awareness Week, it’s worth remembering that contaminants such as heavy metals and industrial solvents areassociatedwith infertility and pregnancy complications due to endocrine disruption.Uranium exposure can disrupt menstrual cycles and contribute to conditions including endometriosis, which I had, and can impact fertility. These contaminants loweregg qualityand increase the risk of miscarriage.Last year, I began a documentary about how the climate crisis – flooding, heat, wildfires, hurricanes – affects Black people who are pregnant or trying to conceive. It was an urgent story that felt both intimately familiar and strangely distant, since many of their environments were marked by large factories, disastrous floods and devastating hurricanes.Across the country, their stories echoed mine: shame around infertility, questions of illness and correlation, dismissive doctors and public officials, and frustration that their stories would go unheard or, worse, that their lives just didn’t matter.I first heard from Marquita in Tennessee, who put it this way: “When a woman, through no fault of her own, doesn’t have a viable pregnancy, sometimes people make it seem as if it’s her fault. There is a conversation happening about Black maternal health, but I feel like they’re not connecting it to pollution.”Then there was Shamell in Louisiana’s notorious “Cancer Alley”, who talked about being blamed for her infertility: “I learned I wasn’t ovulating because I was insulin resistant. Chemicals like benzene are endocrine disruptors that contribute to diabetes. It’s not necessarily what you’re eating or drinking.”It wasn’t until my mom mentioned that Denning Park had been closed due to concerns about toxic contamination from the factories falling into the brook behind the park (which was flooding more frequently because of the climate crisis) that the link between it all became clear to me.An old family friend posted about growing up in the park in the 60s and 70s: “As kids, we always played in the brook and thought it was fun when the water changed colors and stained our hands … Our neighborhood smelled like rotten eggs every day when we came home from school, which I now know was the smell of sulfur. I can only imagine the toxins we were exposed to.” My fears were validated, and I hoped for answers about my reproductive health issues.In February, a city councilmeetingrevealed that 37 samples from the park had tested negative for radiation, with no history of radiation found, and the park was reopened. While some felt relieved, others called for more expansive chemical testing. A frustrated councilmember criticized residents for raising the contamination issue and essentially claimed the park was a red herring. He claimed that they were playing politics and mad over a development project for a cannabis factory and new apartment complex, and their complaints had led to the city losing a grant: “We need to ensure that discussions are based on knowledge, not wild speculation.” Yeah.Wild speculationabout a park next to a place where apackage of uranium went missingin 2005.It reminded me of Kay Gaudet, a Louisiana pharmacist who raised alarms in the 1980s about chemical exposure leading to increased miscarriages, only to be met with skepticism. One industry official told theWashington Postin 1987: “They say the chemical plants are causing the miscarriages, but they have no proof. I could say they screw too much, and that’s the cause of the miscarriages. But then I would have no way to prove that.”Like the residents of those communities, the burden of proof fell on folks in my old neighborhood, and their worries were cast as “speculation” instead of a legitimate call for further investigation. Meanwhile, rollbacks in Washington under theTrump administrationto theNational Institutes of Healthand Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have only made it harder to conduct environmental studies and reproductive health research.I’m a Black gun owner. I have mixed feelings about gun control | Akin OllaRead moreGrowing up, I never imagined that something invisible – something without a face or a trigger – could be responsible for my pain. Like so many others, I may never find concrete answers. The connection between the environment and my reproductive health isn’t a clean narrative. It’s messy and complicated and doesn’t fit neatly into a single report. But that doesn’t mean it’s just a story that shouldn’t be taken seriously.I moved away from Englewood years ago, but my mom still lives there. I wanted my children to play at Denning Park, enjoy all the laughter and smiles like I did. But now I’m not sure if it is safe, not because of guns or shadowy figures, but a system of intersectional oppressions that have ignored the voices of Black and Brown communities and disregarded women’s stories.When we reflect on “wild speculation” by Aristotle or Galileo, we call it a hypothesis, not some type of paranoia. This scrutiny is how we get closer to the truth, how we investigate and understand harm, especially harms that are more subtle than a gun in a park.Reniqua Allen-Lamphere is a film-maker and writer.

Quietly signed by President Barack Obama, it now reads as a premature act of enclosure: staking titles in a realm we scarcely understand. Though some expressed concerns at the time, it was justified by the idea of inevitable progress. Such naivety evaporated with Donald Trump. Space had been humanity’s last commons, shielded by a 1967 Outer Space treaty. Mr Trump declared it dead in 2020, signing the Artemis Accords and enlisting 43 allies, including the UK, in the legalisation of heaven’s spoils. In March, Mr Trump vowed to plant thestars and stripes on Mars– and beyond. The age of celestial commons was brief, if it ever began.A new report by the Common Wealth thinktank, titledStar Wars, warns that a powerful coalition – composed of private corporations, billionaires such asElon Musk and Jeff Bezos, and “neoliberal” thinktanks – is working to extend earthly ownership structures to space. The report’s author, Durham University’s Carla Ibled, calls it “the transfer of shared resources into the hands of a few”. The 1967 treaty bans state exploitation of space, but is vague on private claims – a loophole now fuelling a tycoon-led scramble for the stars. The aim is obvious: to act first, shape norms and dare others to object.Companies are targetingasteroidmines for “platinum group” metals,lunar icefor fuel andhelium 3for nuclear fusion. These are, admittedly, more likely to be business cases more than functioning businesses. Space law, however, is being fashioned to allow appropriation under the guise of peaceful, commercial activity. Some bizarrely argue that off‑planet mining is social justice – shifting pollution from Earth to “lifeless” space to spare local communities environmental harm. Common Wealth rightly sees this as a modern-dayenclosuremovement. Space isn’t a prize for private conquest. It’s a shared realm needing democratic, ethical stewardship – not corporate extraction in legal disguise.Building a worldwide democratic, collective model is not easy. There is no global body that has clear authority over space resource governance. There is an embryonic one in theUN Office for Outer Space Affairs. Previous attempts to create new frameworks – like the 1979 Moon Agreement – have failed to gain traction among major space powers. There are also longstanding concerns that privatisation is a cover for themilitarisationof the cosmos. Notably, the UK has yet to adopt a space resource licensing system – unlike its fellow Artemis Accords founders the US, Luxembourg, United Arab Emirates and Japan. Reviving cold war lines in the stars, Russia and China defend space as common property against western-style celestial land grabs.There is no viable commercial model for the extraction of space resources and their return to Earth for sale. Nasa’s Moon rock returns helpedCongressjustify space property rights. Dr Ibled warns that humanity’s last commons is slipping into private hands. Some have proposed anAntarctic-style, consent-basedmodelfor space – which would treat it not as endless bounty but as a realm worthy of restraint and respect, where survival uses like water extraction would be permitted. Creating equitable global governance is hard. But that’s no excuse not to try. The stakes, after all, are planetary.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Deepening debt in the developing worldRead moreA quarter century on from the hugely consequential Jubilee 2000 movement – in which churches played a major role – the pope had asked a commission chaired by the economist Joseph Stiglitz to report on the issue next month.Debt reliefis also likely to be discussed at the UN financing for development conference in Seville in late June.But there was little optimism in Washington that any country is prepared to offer the necessary moral and political leadership to force the issue up the agenda. Certainly, it will not be the UK, which played a crucial role in the Jubilee 2000 campaign under Gordon Brown, but has shown little interest in the issue since imposing brutal cuts to aid spending, to boost defence.Meanwhile, ample evidence was shared in Washington to show how the situation is rapidly deteriorating. The IMF’s analysts warned that Trump’s dramatic shake-up of the global trading system, the final shape of which remains impossible to guess, willdepress economic growthand ratchet up the risks of financial crisis.For emerging economies, the outlook is especially bleak. Many had already been left heavily indebted, after grappling with the Covid pandemic. And asthe IMF’s Global Financial Stability Review made clear, one side-effect of the market chaos triggered by Trump’s “liberation day” is likely to be tighter financial conditions.That will make it harder, and more costly, for countries to refinance their debts – a problem the IMF said could be compounded by fresh volatility in the currency markets.The more is spent on debt repayments, the less is available for important areas of government spending that are necessary for development. As Achim Steiner, the head of the UN’s development arm, the UNDP,said on the sidelines of the spring meetings: “The debt servicing is essentially a defunding. We’re defunding, or forcing countries to take money out of their social and welfare and education budgets and health budgets just to service their debt. This is for obvious reasons bad: it’s not sustainable and ultimately contributes further to locking countries in into this stagnation.”He added: “If you are defunding your own education system, you’re locking yourself into a generation that is going to fall behind.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since 2022, 80% have cut social spending as a share of their budget.This comes at a time when the economic impacts of the climate crisis are already being felt, in the soaring costs of extreme weather events for example. There is a consensus, at least outside the White House, that significant investment will be needed to manage the transition away from fossil fuels.Another report launched in Washington last week– from the expert panel on climate and finance, a joint project of the Colombian, French, Kenyan and German governments – warned of a “vicious circle”, between the “debt, climate and nature crises”.“Debt pressures and environmental vulnerabilities are most pronounced in the poorest and most credit-constrained countries … yet these countries account for only a tiny fraction of the consumption and emissions driving nature loss and climate change,” they said.Even the IMF itself suggested last week that debt restructuring may need to be part of the toolkit to respond to the rapidly changing economic and financial situation.“The path forward demands clarity and coordination. Countries should work constructively to promote a stable and predictable trade environment, facilitate debt restructuring, and address shared challenges,” it said in its World Economic Outlook.But campaigners complain that the IMF’s debt restructuring process, the Common Framework, is cumbersome and time-consuming – and can still leave beneficiaries with high servicing costs, because it does not contemplate debt write-offs.Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, when he was not taking anti-woke side swipes at the IMF and the World Bank, said he would like to see the IMF get more involved in restructuring struggling countries’ debt. In amuch-analysed speech, he said the IMF should “more proactively push official bilateral lenders to come to the table early, to work with borrower countries to minimise periods of debt distress”.Some development campaigners seized on his comments as a positive sign that the US would not stand in the way of multilateral efforts to ease the burden for the world’s poor.But others warned that in saying that he wanted to “make the IMF again”, and calling for it to be a “brutal truth teller”, Bessent appeared to be yearning for a return to the bad old days of economic shock theory, when the fund swept into struggling countries and imposed a prescription of harsh spending cuts and privatisation.Meanwhile, as they geared up to amplify Francis’s calls for a jubilee, some in Washington last week privately warned it may take a large-scale default to force the world’s powerful to accept the need to lift developing countries’ debt burdens. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.Explore more on these topicsDebt reliefEconomics viewpointPope FrancisInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)World BankTrump administrationGlobal economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

His governing philosophy is absolute powerSidney BlumenthalThe president’s clashes with the judiciary over immigration have launched a constitutional crisis. We’re headed toward a collisionSun 27 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 17.39 EDTShareDonald Trumpissued his declaration of war against his “enemies within” at the Department of Justice on 14 March. Thus the president launched a constitutional crisis that encompasses not just agroup of migrants snatchedwithout due process and transported against federal court orders to aforeign prison, but a wholesale assault on virtually every major institution of American society.“We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose, and very much expose, their egregious crimes and severe misconduct,” he pledged. “It’s going to be legendary.”Trump’s speechcondensed his mission to its despotic essence. While he distilled his contempt, Trump also marked his disdain for the traditional conservatism of limited government, respect for the law and liberty. He defined his project, built on his executive orders as substitutes for the law, to crown himself with unrestrained powers to intimidate, threaten and even kidnap. His political philosophy is a ruthless quest for absolute power.Want to beat authoritarianism? Look to Latin America | Greg GrandinRead moreTrump hailed his appointees for being “so tough” – the enthusiastically compliant attorney general,Pam Bondi, and the irrepressible flunky FBI director, Kash Patel. He attacked lawyers whose firms he would issue executive orders against to eviscerate their work – “really, really bad people”. He claimed Joe Biden and the former attorney general Merrick Garland “tried to turn America into a corrupt communist and third-world country”. And he described “people that come into our country” as “stone-cold killers. These are killers like – they make our killers look nice by comparison. They make our killers look nice. These are rough, tough people with the tattoos all over their face.” Trump’s accusations are invariably projections of his own malice that he manufactures into politically pliable paranoia.No staff attorneys within the department were invited to the speech, as people at the justice department told me. The senior lawyers from the Public Integrity Section had alreadyresignedwhen Trump attempted to coerce them to participate indropping the prosecutionof New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, for corruption in exchange for his support of Trump’s coming roundup and deportation of migrants. After Trump, a convicted felon, concluded by comparing himself to Al Capone, the mafia boss convicted of tax evasion – “the great Alphonse Capone, legendary Scarface, was attacked only a tiny fraction of what Trump was attacked” – Trump’s theme song from his political rallies, YMCA, blared out of the loudspeakers in the department auditorium.The next day, Trump announced hisexecutive orderciting the Alien Enemies Act of 1789, a wartime measure, to incarcerate members of the Tren de Aragua gang he asserted were coordinating with the Maduro government of Venezuela to commit “brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking”. (On 20 March, the New York Timesreported: “The intelligence community assessment concluded that the gang, Tren de Aragua, was not directed by Venezuela’s government or committing crimes in the United States on its orders, according to the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity.”)The238 menabducted were taken without any due process to a maximum-security prison operated by the Salvadorian strongman Nayib Bukele, who calls himself “the coolest dictator” and whosegovernment is being paidat least $6m in an arrangement with the Trump administration.In a hearing on 24 March before the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, Judge Patricia Millett, criticizing the absence of due process,said: “Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act.” She asked the deputy assistant attorney general, Drew Ensign, arguing the administration’s case: “What’s factually wrong about what I said?”“Well, your Honor, we certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,” he replied.Trump’s assertion of emergency power under the Alien Enemies Act is more than a bit analogous to the ideas of Carl Schmitt, the chief legal scholar and apologist of the Nazi regime, “crown juristof the Third Reich”. The falsity, according to the intelligence community, of Trump’s claim about the men underlines the analogy of Trump’s argument to Schmitt’s. “Authority, not truth, produces law,” Schmitt wrote. “Sovereign is he who decides on invocation of the state of emergency.” And then: “Der Ausnahmefall offenbart das Wesen der staatlichen Autorität am klarsten” – “The State of Emergency reveals most clearly the essence of the authority of the state … The exception is thus far more important that the ordinary rule. The normal state of affairs shows nothing; the emergency shows everything; it confirms not only the rule, rather the rule derives strictly from the emergency.”The ACLU filed alawsuiton 15 March before Chief Judge James Boasberg of the US district court of the District of Columbia to halt the flight to El Salvador. The judge issued an order for the planes to return to the US, but the Trump administration defied it.Trump’s defiance has set in motion a flurry of legal challenges and court cases heard in district courts and circuit courts of appeals, as well as the supreme court. On 7 April, the courtruledthat the detainees had theright to due process, which they were denied. On 11 April, the justices unanimously ordered the administration tofacilitate the returnof one wrongly taken individual,Kilmar Ábrego García, a legal resident of Maryland who was identified by his family and had no criminal record. On 19 April, the courttemporarily blockeda new round of deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.CBS’s 60 Minutes reported: “We could not find criminal records for 75% of the Venezuelans.” Bloomberg Newsreportedthat about 90% had no criminal records.On 14 April, Trump welcomed Bukele to the White House. Trump has turned the Oval Office into his small stage with cabinet secretaries and staff seated on the couches as his chorus. Bukele was dressed in black casual wear, but not admonished, as Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy was admonished, for supposedly showing disrespect to Trump by not appearing in a suit and tie.Trump and Bukele played the sceneas a buddy movie, kidding each other, but not kidding, about repression. “Mr President,” said Bukele, “you have 350 million people to liberate. But to liberate 350 million people, you have to imprison some. That’s the way it works, right?”Trump’s already skirting due process. Now he’s musing about deporting citizens | Moira DoneganRead more“The homegrowns are next, the homegrowns,” said Trump. “You’ve got to build about five more places.”“Yeah, we got the space,” Bukele said.When the question of Ábrego García was raised by a reporter, Bondi said: “That’s not up to us,” and that it was “up to El Salvador”.“Well, I’m supposed – you’re not suggesting that I smuggle a terrorist in the United States, right?” Bukele replied. Trump reassured him: “It’s only CNN.” Bukele called the question “preposterous”.“Well, they’d love to have a criminal released into our country,” said Trump. “These are sick people. Marco, do you have something to say about that?” It was another test of the secretary of state’s sycophancy. Marco Rubio rose to the occasion. “No court in the United States has a right to conduct a foreign policy of the United States,” he said. “It’s that simple. End of story.”Standing behind Rubio, Trump’s most influential aide and the architect of his immigration policy, Stephen Miller, chimed in: “To Marco’s point, the supreme court said exactly what Marco said. That no court has the authority to compel the foreign policy function in the United States. We won a case 9-0. And people like CNN are portraying it as a loss, as usual, because they want foreign terrorists in the country who kidnap women and children.”A reporter attempted to point out that the court had in fact ruled it was illegal to deprive the captives of due process. “Well, it’s illegal to, so I just wanted some clarity on it,” he asked. Trump jumped in: “And that’s why nobody watches you anymore. You have no credibility.”On 17 April, the day the supreme court ruled on Ábrego García, Trumpsaid: “I’m not involved in it,” though he had signed the executive order that authorized his kidnapping. Trump was reverting to the tactic of denial, however patently ludicrous, that he had been schooled in originally by Roy Cohn, the Republican power broker and mafia lawyer who had been his private attorney. The Trump administration continues to claim it has no control over the captives in the Salvadorian prison and they cannot be returned.Trump’s disavowal of responsibility made thevisit to the prisonby the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to tape a video on 26 March problematic on several levels. If Trump has no control, then how was Noem allowed the run of the place? If the prisoners were combatants under the Alien Enemies Act, then their status made her appearance a violation of the Geneva convention’s Article 1 that outlaws “outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment”, and Article 13 that prohibits “acts of violence or intimidation” and “insults and public curiosity” – that is, using prisoners for propaganda purposes.If Schmitt’s argument is not Trump’s argument, the difference has certainly not confused the judges handling the cases. Boasberg ruled that the Trump administration hadacted with “willful disregard”for his order and, while contempt proceedings were paused, threatened toappoint a special prosecutorif the Department of Justice declined to do so.The Maryland federal judge Paula Xinis, who ordered the administration to return Ábrego García, said on 15 April she hadseen no evidence of progress. Sheruled on 22 Aprilthat such stonewalling “reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations … That ends now.”She also stated: “Defendants must supplement their answer to include all individuals involved as requested in this interrogatory.” That discovery process might range into stranger precincts of Maga depths than imagined. The New Yorkerreportedon “a Maga salon” at a tech billionaire’s Washington residence to which a Republican lobbyist, Andrew Beck, brought Trace Meyer, self-described as the “Babe Ruth of bitcoin”, where they discussed with state department staffers the “work-in-progress plan” for abducting migrants to El Salvador. The officials had reached “an impasse in the negotiations. Meyer, through his crypto connections, was able to help reopen the conversation.” Add to the discovery list: Beck, Meyer and the state department officials.In denying the Trump administration’s motion for a halt in the Xinis ruling, Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III, of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit, issued athunderous opinionon 17 April, marking a historic break between principled conservatism and Trump’s regime. Wilkinson is an eminent conservative figure within the judiciary, of an old Virginia family, a clerk to Justice Lewis Powell, and a Ronald Reagan appointee revered in the Federalist Society.The Guardian view on the US immigration crackdown: what began with foreign nationals won’t end there | EditorialRead more“The government,” Wilkinson wrote, “is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”Wilkinson concluded with a siren call about Trump’s threat. “If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home? And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present, and the Executive’s obligation to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed’ would lose its meaning.”Wilkinson has defined the stark conflict headed toward an unstoppable collision. Against Trump’s appropriation of Schmitt’s authoritarian logic, the conservative jurist has thrown down the gauntlet of American constitutional law. Trump’s disdain for that sort of conservatism moves the cases again and again toward the conservative majority of the supreme court, which must decide its allegiance, either like Wilkinson, to the constitution, or instead to Trump’s untrammeled power that would reduce the court itself to a cipher.This article was amended on 27 April 2025; an earlier version stated that JD Vance admonished Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit to meetDonald Trump.

From Governor Kathy Hochul’spush to expand involuntary commitmentin New York to Robert F Kennedy Jr’sproposal for “wellness farms”under his Make America Healthy Again (Maha) initiative, policymakers are reviving the logics of confinement under the guise of care.These proposals may differ in form, but they share a common function: expanding the state’s power to surveil, detain and “treat” marginalized people deemed disruptive or deviant. Far from offering real support, they reflect a deep investment in carceral control – particularly over disabled, unhoused, racialized and LGBTQIA+ communities. Communities that have often seen how the framing of institutionalization as “treatment” obscures both itsviolent history and its ongoing legacy. In doing so, these policies erase community-based solutions, undermine autonomy, and reinforce the very systems of confinement they claim to move beyond.TakeHochul’s proposal, which seeks to lower the threshold for involuntary psychiatric hospitalization in New York. Under her plan, individuals could be detained not because they pose an imminent danger, but because they are deemed unable to meet their basic needs due to a perceived “mental illness”. This vague and subjective standard opens the door to sweeping state control over unhoused people, disabled peopleand others struggling to survive amid systemic neglect. Hochul also proposes expanding the authority to initiate forced treatment to a broader range of professionals – including psychiatric nurse practitioners – and would require practitioners to factor in a person’s history, in effect pathologizing prior distress as grounds for future detention.Robert F Kennedy Jr has mass appeal despite his extreme ideas. This theory explains why | Darren LoucaidesRead moreThis is not a fringe proposal. It builds on a growing wave of reinstitutionalization efforts nationwide. In 2022, New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, directed police and EMTs to forciblyhospitalize people deemed “mentally ill”, even without signs of imminent danger. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom’s Care courtscompel people into court-ordered “treatment”.Now, these efforts are being turbocharged at the federal level. RFK Jr’s Maha initiative proposes labor-based “wellness farms” as a response to homelessness and addiction – an idea thateerily echoes the institutional farmsof the 20th century, where disabled people and people of color were confined, surveilled and exploited under the guise of rehabilitation.Just recently, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)announced a sweeping restructuringthat will dismantle critical agencies and consolidate power under a new “Administration for a Healthy America” (AHA). Aligned with RFK Jr’s Maha initiative and Donald Trump’s “department of government efficiency” directive, the plan merges the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and other agencies into a centralized structure ostensibly focused on combating chronic illness. But through this restructuring –and the mass firing of HHS employees– the federal government is gutting the specialized infrastructure that supports mental health, disability services and low-income communities.The restructuring is already under way: 20,000 jobs havebeen eliminated, regional offices slashed, and the Administration for Community Living (ACL)dissolved its vital programsfor older adults and disabled people scattered across other agencies with little clarity or accountability. This is not administrative streamlining; it is a calculated dismantling of protections and supports, cloaked in the rhetoric of efficiency and reform. SAMHSA – a pillar of the country’s behavioral health system, responsible for coordinating addiction services, crisis response and community mental health care –is being gutted, threatening programs such as the 988 crisis line and opioid treatment access. These moves reflect not just austerity, but a broader governmental strategy ofmanufactured confusion. By dissolving the very institutions tasked with upholding the rights and needs of disabled and low-income people, the federal government is laying the groundwork for a more expansive – and less accountable – system of carceral “care”.This new era of psychiatric control is being marketed as a moral imperative. Supporters insist there is a humanitarian duty to intervene – to “help” people who are suffering. But coercion is not care. Decades of research show that involuntary (forced) psychiatric interventions oftenlead to trauma, mistrust,and poorer health outcomes. Forced hospitalization has been linked toincreased suicide riskand long-term disengagement from mental health care. Most critically, it diverts attention from the actual drivers of distress: poverty, housing instability, criminalization, systemic racism and a broken healthcare system.The claim that we simply need more psychiatric beds is a distraction. What we need is a complete paradigm shift – away from coercion and toward collective care. Proven alternatives already exist:housing-first initiatives,non-police and peer-led crisis response teams,harm reduction programs, andvoluntary, community-based mental health services. These models prioritize dignity, autonomy and support over surveillance, control and confinement.Did RFK Jr really drink fish medicine? He definitely has weird ideas about ‘making America healthy again’ | Arwa MahdawiRead moreAsLiat Ben-Moshe argues, prisons did not simply replace asylums; rather, the two systems coexist and evolve, working in tandem to surveil, contain and control marginalized populations. Today, reinstitutionalization is returning under a more therapeutic facade: “wellness farms”, court diversion programs, expanded involuntary commitment. The language has changed, but the logic remains the same.This moment demands resistance. We must reject the idea that locking people up is a form of care. These proposals must be named for what they are: state-sanctioned strategies of containment, rooted in ableism, racism and the fear of nonconformity.Real public health does not rely on force. It does not require confining people or pathologizing poverty. It means meeting people’s needs – through housing, community care, healthcare and support systems that are voluntary, accessible and liberatory.As budget negotiations inNew Yorkcontinue to drag on – with expansions to involuntary commitment still on the table – and as RFK Jr advances carceral care proposals at the federal level, we face a critical choice: will we continue the long history of institutional violence, or will we build something better – something rooted in justice, autonomy and collective wellbeing?The future of mental health care – and of human dignity itself – depends on our answer.Jordyn Jensen is the executive director of theCenter for Racial and Disability Justiceat Northwestern Pritzker School of LawExplore more on these topicsUS prisonsOpinionUS healthcareMental healthKathy HochulNew YorkRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

There was seemingly no limit to what it would do to sustain his grasp on power, including droppingchemicalweapons andbarrel bombson civilians in territory held by the armed opposition, andstarving,torturing, “disappearing” andexecutingperceived opponents. The victims numbered in thehundredsof thousands.Since December, Assad is gone,toppledby the HTS rebel group that now controls the interim government in Damascus. The leader of the interim authorities, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has promised a far moreinclusiveandrights-respectingrule. The jury is still out on whether he will live up to those vows, but one place where he has fallen short is in satisfying the Syrian people’squest for justice. Both he and international courts could play a role.Assad’sflightto Moscow has not diminished the desire for justice, nor should it. Vladimir Putin is much older than Assad and will not be Russia’s president forever. Just as in 2001 the Serbian governmentsentformer president Slobodan Milošević to The Hague in return for the easing of sanctions, so a future Russian government may be persuaded to surrender Assad and his henchmen who joined him in exile as the price for, say, liftingsanctionsor even maintaining Russia’s militarybasesin Syria.Trump’s tariffs are ruinous, but are western sanctions any better? Just look at Syria | Simon JenkinsRead moreJustice is always better if it can be provided locally, but for the time being, the Syrian judicial system cannot deliver. Under Assad, Syria’s courts mainlyfacilitatedhis extraordinary repression. They currently offer little hope of the fair and transparent trials that are essential for justice. Railroading people to conviction would only compound the Assad regime’s injustice, not remedy it. Most of Syria’s judicial system needs to be rebuilt from scratch.For the foreseeable future, international courts provide the only realistic prospect of justice. One possible route would be for national courts to exerciseuniversalorextraterritorialjurisdiction. That is possible because Assad’s crimes are so heinous that they fall within the category of crimes that are subject to global prosecution.There already have been modest steps in this direction. Most involve Syrian perpetrators who happen to have fled abroad and been discovered. The most noteworthy was brought by German prosecutors inKoblenzagainst a Syrian intelligence officer who had run a torture center. He was convicted andsentencedto life in prison for crimes against humanity. Yet so far the most senior perpetrators have not been detained, even though, since Assad’s fall, they are more vulnerable.One government – France – has gone a step further andchargedAssad himself for a particularly heinous crime, the use of a nerve agent,sarin, to killmore than 1,000people in 2013 in Syria’s Ghouta region near Damascus. Trials in absentia are best avoided because, without the suspect present to defend himself, they do little to advance justice. But charges in absentia, with the aim of generating pressure for arrest, are laudable. More governments should follow in France’s footsteps.But national prosecutions require a major investment by the prosecuting country, even assuming assistance from the body established by the UN general assembly to assemble evidence insupportof such prosecutions, theInternational, Impartial and Independent Mechanism. A more logical forum would be the international criminal court (ICC), where governments could pool resources in support of prosecution.The ICC was absent in Syria during Assad’s reign. An effort by the UN security council to confer jurisdiction in 2014 wasblockedby the Russian and Chinese vetoes. And with little prospect of securing custody of the most culpable officials while Assad retained power, the ICC prosecutor showed no discernible interest in pursuing other possible routes to jurisdiction.Assad’s overthrow has changed that. Karim Khan, the current ICC chief prosecutor, has alreadyvisitedthe interim authorities in Damascus. But despite Assad’s litany of atrocities, no further progress is known to have been made. The fault lies in part with the new interim Syrian authorities, in part with Khan.The easiest way for the ICC to secure jurisdiction would be for the new authorities to join the court and grant itretroactive jurisdiction. Acceptance of the court would be an important signal that they intend to respect Syrians’ rights, but al-Shara has not taken that step or indicated that he will. His reasons are not entirely clear.One factor may be that he fears the ICC would prosecute him or fellow HTS commanders for human rights violations theycommittedin north-western Syria, which they controlled since 2017. This is not a trivial fear, but those abuses paled in comparison to the Assad regime’s atrocities, so it is hard to imagine they would be Khan’s priority.Another reason may be that some of the foreign forces operating in Syria have signaled their displeasure with the prospect of ICC jurisdiction. Turkey, the principal backer of the interim authorities, may not want oversight of theterritoryit has seized in northern Syria. The United States, whose decision to maintain Assad-era sanctions presents the principal impediment to economic and hence political stability in Syria, undoubtedly doesn’t want scrutiny of itsforcesfighting the Islamic State in the northeastern part of the country.Israel, whose officials already face ICCchargesfor starving and depriving Palestinian civilians in Gaza, clearly doesn’t want additional vulnerability for its ongoingoperationsin Syria. Even Russia undoubtedly opposes ICC jurisdiction, given thevulnerabilityof its commanders and even president Vladimir Putin to charges of bombing hospitals and other civilian infrastructure in north-western Syrian. They, too, already face ICCchargesfor their conduct in Ukraine.Given these competing factors, there may be no overcoming the interim authorities’ reluctance to join the ICC, but that is not the end of the story. The ICC prosecutor on his own could establish jurisdiction over an important subset of the Assad regime’s crimes.The key would be to follow the same strategy pursued inMyanmar. It has never joined the court, but adjacent Bangladesh has, which gives the court jurisdiction over any crime committed on the neighbor’s territory.Although the ICC had no direct jurisdiction over the massatrocities– murder, rape and arson – committed in 2017 against the Rohingya of Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, it did have jurisdiction over the crime of forced deportation because that crime was not completed until Rohingya stepped into Bangladesh. That became a backdoor method of addressing the atrocities that drove more than750,000Rohingya to flee. The court hasapprovedthat jurisdictional theory and is now considering the prosecutor’srequestfor an arrest warrant for the Myanmar army leader, Min Aung Hlaing.Khan could do the same thing in Syria. Jordan is an ICC member and the Assad regime’s atrocities drove more than700,000Syrians to flee there. Charging Assad-era officials with this crime of forced deportation would be a way of addressing many of that regime’s atrocities. That partial justice would be far better than no justice at all.This approach to jurisdiction would pose little threat to the interim authorities, whose cooperation Khan would need at least to conduct on-site investigations. Whatever their misdeeds in north-westernSyriabefore seizing Damascus, they would have had little if anything to do with why people on the other side of the country fled to Jordan. Nor do any of the current international actors in Syria seem to be contributing to any exodus to Jordan.Maybe Khan is secretly advancing this plan, but I doubt it. In the case of Myanmar, the ICC prosecutor’s office, beginning under Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, publiclysignaledthat it was pursuing this approach. Khan has given no such indication for Syria.He should. I am a strong backer of the ICC, but when I have defended it publicly, detractors commonly note its lack of action on Syria. For years, I defended the court by arguing that its lack of jurisdiction over Assad’s atrocities was not itsfault. But with the forced-deportation route to jurisdiction now approved by the court for Myanmar, the decision whether to pursue it for Syria lies mainly with Khan. Assuming that the interim authorities continue to eschew court membership, Khan should exercise that option for jurisdiction. The people of Syria deserve it.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

But don’t underestimate the self-destructive power of the president’s own hubrisSun 27 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 04.19 EDTShareTyrants come to a sticky end, or so history suggests. Richard III and Coriolanus made bloody exits. More recently, Saddam Hussein went to the gallows, Slobodan Milosevic went to jail, Bashar al-Assad went into exile. Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi was run to ground in a sewer. Tyranny, from the Greektúrannos(“absolute ruler”), is typically fuelled byhubrisand leads ineluctably tonemesis. Tyrants are for toppling. Their downfall is a saving grace.Tyranny, in its many forms, is back in vogue, and everyone knows who’s to blame. To be fair, to suggest similarities between the aforementioned abominable individuals and Donald Trump would be utterly wrong. In key respects, he’s worse. Measured by willingness and capacity toharm the world’s poorestand most vulnerable, wreak global economic mayhem and threaten nuclear annihilation, Trump is uniquely dangerous – and ever more so by the day.In any notional league of tyranny, Trump tops the table, with Russia’s Vladimir Putin following closely in his rear. If these two narcissists formed a partnership (a scary but not wholly improbable thought), it could be called Monsters R US. Across a disordered globe, wannabe “strongmen” queue to join their club.Yet like every tyrant, old and new, Trump must fall. How maynemesisbe peacefully and swiftly attained? As he marks 100 days back in power next week, such questions gain urgency. Can the 47th president’s premeditated swinging of a wrecking ball at US democracy, laws, values and dreams be halted? How may what remains of the international rules-based system be salvaged? Who or what will dethrone him?Policy failures and personal misconduct do not usually collapse a presidency. The US constitution is inflexible: incompetence is protected; cupidity has a fixed term. Trump is in power until 2029 unless impeached – third time lucky? – for “high crimes and misdemeanors”, or else deemed unfit under section 4 of the25th amendment. With JD Vance, his yes-man Veep, playing Oval Office bouncer and Congress awash with Maga converts, such procedural defenestration appears unlikely.Public backing is certainly slipping. Last week’snationwide demonstrations, worries about inflation and savings, and anger over federal funding cuts, cultural war-making and mass firings reflect deepening alarm about threats to an entire way of life.Polls showTrump losing the middle-of-the-roaders whose votes ended the Biden interregnum. Yet despite a royal resemblance to another “tyrant”, King George III, a second American revolution is a long way off.Many look to the courts for rescue. Judges continue to challenge Trump’s diktats on deportations and other issues. It was a New York jury that convicted Trump of34 felonieslast year, but sadly failed to jail him. His businesses are repeatedly accused of fraud. Now it is suggested the supreme court-tested “major questions doctrine” could bring him to heel. This requires the government to demonstrate a “clear congressional authorisation” when it makes decisions of great “economic and political significance”, explained US law professor Aaron Tang. It’s restraint of sorts.In the land of Watergate, will the media bring the tyrant low? It’s a fond hope. Major news organisations, undercut by social media andtsunamis of official lies, are derided from on high as liberal purveyors of “fake news”. They face costly legal challenges and outright bans, as in Trump’s malicious “Gulf of America”vendetta with Associated Press. Basic concepts of objective reporting are torched as the White House favours rightwing, pro-Trump outlets. The free press, perforce, is not so much cowed as cautious.This fight has moral and ethical aspects, too – and, given this is the US, prayer is a powerful weapon in the hands of those who would slay evil-doers. Of the seven deadly sins – vainglory or pride, greed or covetousness, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, sloth – Trump is comprehensively, mortally guilty. In Isaiah (13,11), the Lord gives fair warning: “I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant and humiliate the insolence of tyrants.” God knows, maybe he’ll listen. Miracles do happen.Of all the tools in the tyrant-toppling toolbox, none are so potentially decisive as those supplied by Trump’s own stupidity. Most people understand how worthless a surrender monkey “peace deal” is that rewards Putin and betrays Ukraine.Does Trump seriously believehis support for mass murder in Gaza,threats to attack Iranand recklessbombing of Yemenwill end the Middle East conflict and win him a Nobel peace prize?By almost every measure, Trump’s chaoticglobal tariff waris hurting American consumers, damaging businesses and reducing US influence. It’s a boon to China and an attack on longtime allies and trading partners such as Britain. Trump’s big tech boosters know this to be so, as do many Republicans. But they dare not speak truth to power.And then there’s his greed – the blatant, shameless money-grubbing that has already brought accusations ofinsider trading, oligarchic kleptocracy, and myriad conflicts of interest unpoliced by the 17 government oversight watchdogsTrump capriciously fired. His relatives and businesses are again pursuingforeign sweetheart deals. Corruption on this scale cannot pass unchallenged indefinitely. Avarice alone may be Trump’s undoing.All this points to one conclusion: as a tyrant, let alone as president, Trump is actually pretty useless – and as his failures, frustrations and fantasies multiply, he will grow ever more dangerously unstable. Trump’s biggest enemy is Trump. Those who would save the US and themselves – at home and abroad – must employ all democratic means to contain, deter, defang and depose him. But right now, the best, brightest hope is that, drowning in hubris, Trump will destroy himself.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Can we ever be certain about anything? And if not, how can we progress with our lives while carrying the anxiety of the uncertain in our every day?For years, Chloe’s insomnia was a mystery. Then she uncovered the trauma beneath it | Leanne SchubertRead moreReflecting on these questions led me to think about Claire*, a 38-year-old client of mine who came in to discuss some difficulties she’d been experiencing in her workplace as a teacher. She had many thoughts regarding the way she had been treated and the professionalism of staff and colleagues, and by the third session she was ready to open up about another stressor, her journey with IVF.Claire had previously been in a toxic relationship for eight years, and never thought of having children with her former partner. But now she was in a loving relationship with a partner she adored and said the next step of having children “just felt right”.Fast forward two years and multiple rounds of IVF, and still no success. Claire was frustrated, devastated by the process and the crippling anxiety related to the uncertainty of each round. Being a maths teacher, she desperately wanted the numbers to line up – 20% chance, 35% chance – all variations with the same message: it would be a long road ahead.During therapy it became clear that Claire’s most difficult hurdle was not just tolerating the uncertainty, it was also letting go of the outcome. When things seemed most uncertain, she was encouraged to practise grasping tight and grounding herself in things she could control. From regulating her breathing in between classroom changes, to walking with her partner on the beach – these minute decisions may not seem like much but, when life is moving faster than you are, a self-imposed pause can give you that sense of agency and accomplishment – “I choose to lean into what is certain in my life, and give it the same energy I give to what is uncertain.”Structuring unstructured timeWe may never be able to eliminate our exposure to uncertainty but like Claire, we might find ways to integrate it in our everyday life.Alex felt demoralised by the suggestion he should ‘be more resilient’. He learned that it is an ongoing process | Bianca DennyRead moreBuilding our tolerance for uncertainty is a skill and everyone responds to uncertainty differently. Some people thrive living unpredictable lives but others find the randomness and uncontrollability of life highly distressing.Regardless of our response, all our uncertainty thresholds have been tested in these times and it’s important to know there are things we can do to manage this anxiety.One technique I introduce in therapy is the idea of “structuring unstructured time”. This involves having a certain activity that is stable, manageable and isn’t going anywhere any time soon. When life feels unpredictable, you can count on this activity to stay constant.An example of this could be a tea break at 11 o’clock every day, regardless of whether you are a chief executive or a stay-at-home parent. This is your structured activity – you know it is going to happen regardless of what’s happening externally out of your control.On the other end of the spectrum, you can increase your tolerance for uncertainty by introducing small, bite-size portions of uncertainty in your life. For example, try an activity where you are uncertain about the outcome. This could be ordering something new on a menu or taking a different route for your morning walk. Consider these as healthy risks, in which you can test out what happens when you loosen the reins and leave yourself open to being surprised.Leaping into the unknownBut what happens when those healthy risks carry a potentially hefty price?This was the experience of my client Anthony*. Anthony was 44 and had a successful career in finance. He came to me with a dilemma that had been following him for several years. Anthony grew up in hospitals, accompanying his single mother while she was treated for a chronic heart condition. Growing up he played with stethoscopes and blew surgical gloves up into little balloons to distract him from his mother’s worsening condition. His mother died when he was 28.Anthony told me that he had so much admiration and respect for the nurses and doctors who treated his mother, and there was always a part of him that wanted to enter healthcare. He silenced that part for the more “practical” career but now it was knocking louder than ever. “I want to study nursing,” he told me. To do this he would have to leave his job, take a huge pay cut and start all over as a junior in a health system plagued by challenges. But for Anthony it was clear that with those anxieties also came relief – that a longtime desire could finally be realised now he had given voice to it.It is clear there are many issues that leave us uncertain, ranging from the global, such as our changing economic landscape or our future relationship with AI, to the personal, like “Have I picked the right school for my child?” or “Is this the type of friendship I want to be a part of?” These uncertainties can accumulate and cause stress. But the remedy does not come from trying to control all facets of life – instead it comes from understanding and welcoming the new, the odd and the unpredictable, which give life its colour regardless of hue.*Claire and Anthony are fictitious amalgams of clientsSara Mussa is a psychologist based in MelbourneIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

Will that be enough to win Canada’s election?Erica IfillHe’s got name recognition and gravitas. But he lacks ideas for how to heal the fissures in Canadian societySun 27 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTShareMonday’sCanadian federal electionis likely to determine the economic future of the country for years to come. Someone should inform the Conservatives and the New Democratic party (NDP). On 6 January this year, Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as prime minister and leader of the Liberal party, which had been in power since 2015. His resignation cameamid plummeting support: the Liberals hadn’t formed a majority government since 2019 and on the day Trudeau resigned, the party netted its lowest approval ratingat 20%. After a truncated leadership race, Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister and leader of the Liberal party. He is now on the brink of retaining his position.Pierre Poilievre, on the other hand, leader of the official opposition Conservative party, has seen his party’s fortunes ignominiouslydrop from 44%support when Trudeau resigned to 37% on 9 April. This is a battle of leadership, and while for two and a half years Poilievre seemed on course for victory at the next election, the re-election of Donald Trump in November reoriented politics. Poilievre has been flatfooted and unable to adjust to the new environment. Now he is struggling toretain his own seat.Prior to Trump’s election, Poilievre shaped the political conversation by attacking Trudeau, and was successful in denigrating one of Trudeau’s signature policies, the carbon tax to combat the climate crisis. With his slogan “axe the tax” he blamed the carbon tax for the rising cost of living. The slogan was catchy and seemed to address the financial squeeze many households were facing. His hammering of Trudeau’s climate policy and his frequent claims that Canada was broken contributed to the former prime minister’s plummeting approval rating.Unfortunately for Poilievre, we are now in the era of Trump, in which national pride – in opposition to the US president’s promise to annex Canada tobecome the 51st state– has galvanised the country. Prioritising Canadian-made products, Canadian stores and Canadian culture, the country finally speaks with one voice that says, “elbows up” – a reference to a defensive hockey move, that has become a national rallying cry.The NDP is also seeing support fall to its lowest level since 1993, when it won only nine seats. The party’s support has dropped fromabout 19%at the time of Trudeau’s resignation to as low as 8.2%. Leader Jagmeet Singh’s undignified performance on the campaign trail may cause the loss of official party status (for which a minimum of 12 seats is required) in the House of Commons. In other words, the NDP is irrelevant.The economy is now the focus of the election. The main question is whose stewardship will bring about a better outcome for the country and its future. When asked about affordability during the leaders’ English language debate,Carney responded: “The biggest risk we have to affordability, the biggest risk we have to this economy is Donald Trump.” In other words, tariffs and Trump are our biggest rivals to prosperity, rather than a paltry carbon tax that Carney had in any casealready cancelled.View image in fullscreenConservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre, campaigns in Vaughan, Ontario, 22 April 2025.Photograph: Arlyn McAdorey/ReutersIn this race, Poilievre is a minnow and Carney, the former Bank ofCanadaand Bank of England governor, is the shark. Carney may be confirmed in Canada’s highest office simply through having the gravitas and requisite employment record to steward the economy, despite lacking political experience.This election also exposes asignificant generational divide. The Conservatives have captured the 49-and-under demographic, while the Liberals are the strongest with those over 49. One major reason for this is asset ownership and appreciation. Older Canadians own houses, and have investments that have matured at a healthy pace, especially in an inflationary economic environment. The value of their capital holdings has appreciated over time, and therefore they can capitalise on increasing house prices. But for those who seek to get on to the property ladder, rising house prices have negated the opportunity for upward economic and social mobility, and expensive rents have hamstrung a lot of young people. Their money can only go so far, as they have experienced a falling real wage due to inflation.According to an OECD report, Canadian “real wages are still 2.4% lower than they were just before the pandemic in Q4 2019”.Inflation has made Canada a very expensive place to live. Housing, food and energy, to name a few expenses, have soared. Trump’s tariffs threaten to cause a recession that could see many Canadians lose their jobs, especially in the working class. Those on lower incomes are more likely to vote Conservative, whereas those with university degrees are more likely to be Liberal supporters. Poilievre has hammered the Liberals on the affordability crisis, accusing the party of failing to fully address it; while the Conservatives haveframed their platformaround the growing cost of living for families,the Liberals’ platformis a framework for nation-building. The latter does not address the immediate affordability crises many Canadians face.A big problem for the Conservatives is that women reject the party. Ekos, a political polling company,calculates the female voteat 51% for the Liberals, compared to 26% for the Conservatives. Poilievre appears to give some women the ick. His aggressive communication style, gruff responses to questions and constant attack mode are turn-offs. It is difficult to find women posing behind him at press conferences amid a wall of men. Women are also more likely than men to vote to preserve social services, which is not Poilievre’s mainstay. He voted against the three largest publicly funded social programmes that have been designed during the last decade, including affordable childcare, dental care and pharmacare.Unfortunately, there are issues that have not been addressed in this election. The English-language leaders’ debate focused on rightwing talking points such as crime, border security, energy and tariffs. Left out were many social issues, allowing candidates to avoid answering questions about funding for public services. If there is a recession, politicians are likely to cut social services to the bone, disproportionately affecting poor and working-class Canadians. The homelessness crisis,opioid overdose epidemicand climate catastrophe are all going unaddressed. We also need more funding for community programmes to elevate the many marginalised people in Canada – but since the debate did not touch on those issues, we have no idea what the parties’ positions are.Nor did we hear anything regarding Indigenous rights beyond establishing partnerships for pipeline expansion. TheTruth and Reconciliation recommendationshave yet to be wholly implemented. We still have work to do with implementing the recommendations of themissing and murdered Indigenous women and girls inquiryand infrastructure upgrades on reserves. Carney and the Liberal platform have produced vague commitments on Indigenous rights, but most racialised Canadians have been ignored in both Carney’s and Poilievre’s visions for Canada.This election is focused more on Canada and less on Canadians. It lacks solutions for those who are struggling. It’s offering trickle-down politics, instead of relief and community-building from the ground up. Without those, no nationalism will heal the fissures in Canadian society.Erica Ifill is a political columnist based in CanadaExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionJustin TrudeauAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

It’s no wonder mountain rescuers are being called out so oftenSun 27 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 16.09 EDTShareIt does not involve protest or violence, but it might be the quintessential human image of our times: a small group of people in the midst of spectacular natural scenery, drawn there in the certainty that the apps on their phones could somehow get them from A to B to C – but utterly, hopelessly lost.Two weeks ago, Mountain Rescue England and Wales published figures showinga record number of annual callouts. For the first time, in fact, teams – of overworked volunteers, mostly – had been called out on every day of the year. Between 2019 and 2024, the total number of rescues had increased by 24%, and there was a marked jump among the 18 to 24 age group, among whom callouts almost doubled. Similar trends were evident in data from Scotland: across Britain, there is evidently a mounting problem about the gap between people’s urge to experience wild and open spaces, and their ability to cope when they actually get there.The Guardian’s report included an incisive quotation from Mike Park, the chief executive of Mountain RescueEnglandand Wales, who talked about incidents in the Lake District, Eryri (Snowdonia), Northumberland and other places. “We know from incident reports that more and more people are tempted into risky locations by Instagram posts and the navigation apps being used aren’t always suitable for an outdoor environment,” he said. Whatever people found online either underplayed or completely ignored what he called “the hazards and context” – or, put more bluntly, the real world.Welcome, then, to yet another version of a familiar story: how seemingly infallible technology turns out to be nothing of the kind. Superficially,digital navigationbased on GPS tech seems massively empowering. In most of our everyday environments, that promise usually just about holds true. But it is also quintessentially infantilising, leaving us unable to get around without it, or cope with its shortcomings.Most of us know the horror and panic that comes with sudden battery loss in an unfamiliar place, and that weird sense of being cut adrift from basic skills that human beings have had since they learned to walk upright (if not before). But those hapless souls getting lost up mountains have confronted something even more fear-inducing: that once you are away from roads and built-up environments, many of the most dependable apps suddenly run out of detailed information.When that happens, do we even have the skills any more to find our way back to safety? In 2020, neuroscientists based at McGill University in Montrealpublished researchsuggesting that “people with greater lifetime GPS experience have worse spatial memory during self-guided navigation”. Thirteen of their participants were retested three years after the initial research, when they found that “greater GPS use since initial testing was associated with a steeper decline in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory”. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that deals with navigation: amongLondon taxi drivers, the need to memorise so many geographical details was found to cause it to increase in size. But here were findings that suggested the opposite: reliance on automated directions reducing people’s capacity to navigate for themselves.There is something even more profound and insidious at work here. On our phones, all that really matters is an archetypal blue dot, representing a single individual. As the writer and academicJerry Brottonputs it in his brilliant book Four Points of the Compass – published last year – this represents “the most extreme expression of a long history of egocentric mapping”. Anyone familiar with the history of ancient Rome willrecall Ptolemy, the mathematician and astronomer who believed that the planets of the solar system, along with the sun, revolved around the Earth. Here is our delusional modern equivalent: a version of reality that puts us at the centre of everything. It also offers no clues about what awaits us further along the route: the journey just unfolds by increments.Worse still, what the most-used navigation apps – Google and Apple maps – most clearly show is the location of shops and restaurants, embodying the sense that, as Brotton puts it, “what matters most is where we stand and how we consume, often at the expense of an immersive understanding of and interaction with our physical domain”. The result is that “individuals online can be virtually connected but environmentally detached from the surrounding world, inhabiting a confused realm of spatial illiteracy”. If that can happen even in towns and cities, what hope have we got amid fells, lochs and forests?Lost your sense of direction?

It is surely telling that amid the endless profusion of apps designed to tell us where we are, how fast or slow our heart is beating and the latest news headlines, the word that seems toconstantly crop upin articles about the way we now live is “disorientation”. In that sense, people’s inability to find their way through the physical world reflects our declining skills at navigation more generally – and through information in particular. These are the consequences of the 21st century’s insistence that everything must be personalised: it distorts our understanding of the world to the point of near-fiction.And so, at the risk of sounding like someone’s dad, to some practical advice. If anyone is thinking of venturing into the wild but unsure of how to avoid disaster, I’d recommend the Ordnance Survey’s peerless phone app – which requires a subscription – and a paper map as a back-up, either in the form of the full fold-out version, or a relevant section shown in a reliable guidebook. Always carry a compass. Before you set off, do what the blue dot discourages, and cast your eyes across the whole route, mindful of the aforementioned hazards and context, and what apps underplay or omit: bogs, high streams and rivers, steep gradients.More broadly, we clearly need to talk about improving people’s understanding of what the countryside is like up close, and how to get around it – a conversation that might revive interest in the much-mocked subject of geography. Here, perhaps, is the key to reconnecting the world we see on our phones and the one we have to actually deal with. That is the breach that needs to be healed: if it isn’t, even more generations will find themselves lost, in every sense of the word.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionAppsGPSOrdnance SurveyWalkingMapsEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s something Reform and the Tories will never understandSun 27 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 06.55 EDTShareDo you know somebody who is good at fixing the local church roof? Who is well liked in your community? Well, if we are to go by the comments of the leader of the Conservative party, Kemi Badenoch, they are quite likely to be standing as a Liberal Democrat candidate in next week’s local elections.Yes, that’s right. According to Badenoch, a Lib Dem is “somebody who is good atfixing their church roof. And … the people in the community like them.”Reader, I will let you in on a secret. I think she meant it as an insult. But I’ll happily wear it as a badge of honour – as will more than 1,000 Lib-Dem candidates standing across England for election on 1 May. And don’t her comments tell you all you need to know about the state of the Tory party in 2025? Completely out of touch, serially online and with a sneering attitude to serving your community.The Conservatives were deservedly kicked out of office last year by the British public. But, sadly, whole swathes of the country are still having to put up with the dire record of failing Tory-run councils and councillors. And in so many parts of England – from Cornwall to Cambridgeshire – it is the Lib Dems who are the main challengers. We are a party that views being achampion for local people– fixing a church roof or a pothole, or helping clean up a local river – as something worth fighting for.I have been travelling across the country these past few weeks – albeit via some unusual modes of transport: swan boats, diggers, teacups and, of course, a horse (of the hobby variety). And so many of the local people I’ve met have told me about how they want to kick the Conservatives out of local government in their area.View image in fullscreenEd Davey at a local election campaign launch at Badgemore golf club on in Henley-on-Thames on 31 March.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesBut I have also been struck by the disappointment at the new Labour government. Before I embarked on arollercoaster rideat the Big Sheep theme park in Devon last week, the owner explained to me how, while they were looking forward to a new government after years of struggling through a cost of living crisis, Labour’s changes have actually made things worse. The hospitality industry in the south-west, and across so many parts of the country, is being hammered. Wherever I go, there has been a sense of despondency – whether about the cut to the winter fuel payment, which has forced pensioners to choose between heating or eating, or the failure to solve the longstanding crisis in social care.Anger at the Conservatives, despondency at Labour. It is in these conditions that the easy soundbites of Nigel Farage and Reform UK can start to sound compelling. But theoccasional memberfor Clacton and his ilk offer no real solutions.Let’s be frank: if you want to fix the NHS, why would you put your trust in a man who has in the past said he wanted to replace healthcare that’s free at the point of use with an insurance-based model(whatever hemay say now)? If you care about high-quality British food, why would you support someonewho is in favourof allowing US chlorinated chicken on to UK supermarket shelves? And if you love your country, why stick with someone who would rathersuck up to Vladimir Putin– the world leader he admires most – than stand up for Britain?I’ve quit the Tory party because it’s become a Trumpesque mess. Others will follow | Jamie GreeneRead moreIn the Hull and East Yorkshire mayoral election, what everyone expected to be a Lib Dem v Labour fight is turning into one between theLib Dems and Reform. That’s why the bookies’ odds now show Reform and the Lib Dems in the top two, with Labour trailing in fourth place as eight to one outsiders. When you compare the records of the two parties, there is no contest. We have a strong record of running Hull council – and many other local authorities across the country – and of being an effective opposition in East Riding. Meanwhile, Farage can’t even run his own party. He and his MPs are fighting like rats in a sack. He is overseeing a bin fire – yet wants you to believe that Reform can be trusted with running your local bin collections.The fundamental difference is that the Lib Dems work hard for our communities. We are winning up and down the country. So, on 1 May, remember, whether it’s a church roof that needs fixing, local crime that needs cutting, or a GP or dentist you need help to see,Liberal Democratswill be fighting for a fair deal for you and your community.Ed Davey is the leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for Kingston and SurbitonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In a fantasy world of riches and beauty, I wouldn’t eitherRachel ConnollyMost of us, with our lumpen faces, fragile bank balances, and bobbled polyester clothing, fall out regularly. That doesn’t have to be a bad thingSun 27 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 06.26 EDTShareSomebody give George Clooney a medal. In an interview with CBS a few days ago, the actor claimed he has never, in 11 years of marriage,argued with his wife, the human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Let’s just accept it to be true that you can be married to a lawyer for more than a decade and never find yourself in an argument. And in this case, I suppose, why should it not be? These are some of the most beautiful people in the world. On top of this, they are extremely rich. They can have houses and holidays wherever they want. They can buy whatever clothes and dinners they choose. What would you have to argue about if you lived such a gilded existence?And actually, I do find myself wondering about that quite often these days, especially when I see the strange spectacle of enormously wealthy and successful celebrities arguing with strangers online. Maybe the fact this does happen is evidence that, for some people, even in a life with no material problems, artificial grievances can always be invented. Still, I can dream that I would not end up like that, and that if I was that rich, I would never argue. In fact, I simply would not have a phone. I would live a life surrounded only by beauty. I would buy new socks and new peach silk underwear every day. I would spend every minute of my days smiling calmly. And if I did run into problems with my partner, I would simply employ someone – let’s call them a relationship tension expert – to work things out on my behalf.Until that day, though, arguments are part of life. Most of us, with our lumpen faces and bodies, our fragile bank balances, our bobbled polyester clothing, and our strained sleep schedules, argue with our partners with some degree of regularity. But I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. As long as nobody is using physical force or other forms of intimidation or manipulation, such as fake tears, or other forms of cruelty such as lying, I think an argument can be a very productive tool in a relationship.As a straight woman living in a society that tends to teach men from a young age that household chores are beneath them, for example, I have always advocated for arguing ferociously about chores and tidiness from the very start of a relationship. Let no infraction pass, no matter how small. An unwiped counter should be met with a great tirade about not feeling understood and loved and having your personhood squashed and so on. Gentle nagging won’t do. The more melodramatic, the better. No sane person would rather have an argument like this than wipe the counter. In my experience, if you have this argument on a grand enough scale, you need only have it once. It’s either that, or wipe the counter and clean the fridge shelves and put someone else’s underwear in the wash basket for ever, gently nagging all the while. I made my choice long ago and never looked back.View image in fullscreen‘In general, if you have had the same argument again and again, you will have it again and again and again.’Photograph: Image Source/AlamyThere are other things I have learned about arguments in relationships over the years. If you tell your partner calmly that something is annoying or upsetting and they continue to do it anyway, they are doing it on purpose. Use that information how you will. Another thing: you can never have a productive argument with someone when you don’t agree on the basic facts of what happened. And I don’t mean how people felt about things – I mean if one person says the car crashed and the other says it didn’t. An argument about that will never end. And you should never agree that you saw a car crash when you didn’t, or vice-versa, for the sake of your own sanity, as well as the other person’s. Agreeing with someone else’s fantasy to placate them is a very dangerous thing to do, because it makes a fantasy feel real. I learned a simple strategy for this a little while ago. Now I just say: “We are living in different realities. We cannot have a productive conversation about this until that changes.”In general, if you have had the same argument again and again, you will have it again and again and again. One of you can change, or one of you can accept that things won’t change. Or you can argue about it for ever. There are no other options. And arguing about something for ever is a bad option.When it comes down to it, then, I am a strong advocate for making your red lines known clearly and then walking away if they are crossed. I can’t have my relationship tension expert or my daily fresh silk underwear, but I can have a relatively peaceful life all the same.Rachel Connolly is a writer and the author of the novel Lazy CityDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Inspired by “gymfluencers” and an Instagram feed filled with workouts and progress journeys, I dug into gym culture, often spending two hours weightlifting in one day, nauseous from chocolate-flavoured shakes and consuming more than 100g of protein daily to bulk my gluteal muscles and build a “revenge booty”.Statistics suggest I am not alone. A recent industryreportshows that gym memberships for gen Zers have risen quickly over the past few years, almost doubling since 2020. Moreover,30% of this generationare regularly working out in fitness facilities,compared with 15-25% of the total adult population.It’s been suggested that – since we’re alsodrinking less– my generation isreplacing the pubwith the gym. “With the right support, this could become the most health-aware generation ever,” says the chief executive of UKActive. Great news, you might think: finally, a generation so healthy it’s going to live – happily and mindfully – for ever. But, as a 26-year-old with a love of beerandbench presses, I’m not sure it’s that simple.While exercise and alcohol abstinence do improve health and prevent disease, I worry that this new gym craze actually reflects an atomised society, not a health-aware one. As I became obsessed with the gym, I certainly noticed that the things pushing me away from the pub and towards exercise were not positive thoughts, but fears – self-esteem issues, financial worries and an anxious desire to be maximising my time.I also suspect that the rush to the gym is partly driven by social media. It’s hard to tell the difference between an obsession with health and an obsession with physical appearance, and we know the latter particularly affects the children who grew up on a diet of online fitness influencers who prioritise their looks: 40% of gen Z report that social media makes themanxious about how they look. Fifteen years ago, only the celebrities on TV had unachievable bodies; now seemingly thousands of “normal” people do too. Given this environment, it is difficult for people not tocompare and compete; a recentreportshows that nearly half of gen Zers list “improving their appearance” as a key reason they work out. It certainly is one of mine.This is sad, because the pub was a huge part of growing up for me – it’s where my friendships formed and solidified. This has changed; now we have full-time jobs, work on projects in our spare time, go to the gym as much as we can and go to the pub less. I thought this was because we’re getting older, but we’re still only 26. It’s not age, it’s a generational shift in how young people live, and it’s partly down to alack of disposable income.The price of a pint has risen from an average of£2.30 in 2008tomore than £5nationally, and much more in London, where I live. When I can go to my budget gym every day for £28 a month, hanging out over drinks with mates just doesn’t add up.Hundreds of pubs a yearare closing, maybe partly because they can’t grab the younger consumer base they used to rely on. What used to be a regular meeting spot for my friends and me has become more of a special occasion; we all decline invites more readily, chalking it up to a need to save money.Unfortunately, I don’t think the gym will ever replace the pub as a new “thirdplace” in which to make friends. The capacity for social engagement is undermined by most gym layouts – the heavy presence of mirrors, one machine per person. People mostly exercise with headphones on, eyes forward, staying in their lane. The gym seems more like a place to be productive, alone and silent as we endlessly pursue self-betterment.In my case, I gradually realised that I could never build a revenge booty big enough to get my ex back, and that exercising in front of the mirror and daydreaming about having a different figure wasn’t empowering, but an obsession with self-improvement. I felt good because I was “working on myself”. Actually, it’s this phrase that is the problem – and the pressure put on people to supply value as we become increasingly competitive, commodified objects who feel we’re only valued because of the quality of our assets, or our asses. Becoming aware of this changed my priorities. I only go to gym classes now; instead of changing my body, I focus on cardio and core strength, and try not to look in the mirror. Thinking less about my body has made me much happier.Yes, the physical benefits of exercise are undeniable. The physical toll of alcohol is undeniable too. But it doesn’t necessarily add up that younger people spending less time in the pub and more in the gym is a better thing overall. For most, it would be nice to save a space that isn’t reliant on this impulse to optimise. A space that exists for its own sake, which combines the benefits of the gym with the social benefits of the pub. Lately I’ve been enjoying playing Frisbee in the park with my friends. Maybe next time we’ll take some cans.Isabel Brooks is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

A patchy sampling of Hiroshige’s imitators is all a bit rushed. But then, to do justice to his after-echoes would take a blockbuster in itself, not an epilogue.Everywhere I looked up to this point, it was evident how precisely French impressionism followed Hiroshige’s cues. Take rain. It becomes a pleasurable urban event inRenoir’s The Umbrellas, but it was Hiroshige who first saw rain as a lighthearted excuse to put up umbrellas – in works such as his printTarui, created in the 1830s. The impressionist theme of snow, enjoyed by Monet, is also delightfully anticipated by Hiroshige’s 1832-34 workSnow-viewing Along the Sumida River.This triptych, in which a single scene is expanded across three separate prints in a favourite Hiroshige tactic, shows the French avant garde took much more than imagery from Hiroshige. Artists and writers in late 19th-century Paris adopted his whole philosophy. For Snow-viewing encapsulates the way Hiroshige looks at the world, with a hedonism he shares with the people he depicts. In this print, a well-dressed family hunch up in their robes on a cold day in Edo (now Tokyo). But they are not on a hard winter journey – they are just enjoying the way snow blankets nature.View image in fullscreenA kaleidoscopic trip … Pleasure Boats at Ryōgoku.Photograph: Matsuba Ryōko/© Alan MedaughPleasure in the passing moment, from a shower of rain or fresh crisp snow to a restaurant meal or trip to the theatre, is Hiroshige’s ideal. His art wittily insists that happiness lies in savouring these little freedoms. This was the ideal the early European modernists took from his art, though what was calm common sense for this devout Buddhist would be for them a revolutionary escape.This is, you might say, an exhibition about nothing. Hiroshige is a connoisseur of brief glances and weightless incidents. A man says goodbye to a female friend who is a sex worker, as the blue dawn shadows under a pinkening sky show that it’s daybreak in Edo’s sex district. In another triptych, two women watch their companion as she goes off to bathe. That’s it, but you could look for ever at their expressions, sinuous poses and colourful swathings of cloth.View image in fullscreenFresh scenes … Cherry Blossoms on a Moonless Night along the Sumida River.Photograph: Alan Medaugh. Photography by Matsuba RyōkoHiroshige portrays scenes so fresh you could restage them not just in fin de siecle France but London or Newcastle today. You thought pop-up restaurants were a 21st-century idea? Nah. In Enjoying the Evening Cool Along the Shijo Riverbed, crowds of people enjoy the temporary restaurants set up on a dried-up riverbed. In the foreground, men and women dining on a platform over the still-flowing part of the river laugh as one of friends does a comic dance. Here we go again: it’s Renoir’sLuncheon of the Boating Party. As for Manet’sLuncheon on the Grass, there it is in scenes of people picnicking on sheets spread out in the open air.But Hiroshige did not live in modern times, nor is “modern” even a helpful term in relation to his art. He was born in 1797 in aJapanthat had been ruled since the 1600s by the Tokugawa shogunate, a military dictatorship led by the samurai class that excluded virtually all foreign contacts. His 1830s triptych of a Samurai procession captures what his world was like, but with a twist: the ritualistic procession is almost exclusively female as a bride is taken to her elite marriage.View image in fullscreenCopied by Van Gogh … The Plum Garden at Kameido.Photograph: Alan Medaugh. Photography by Matsuba RyōkoMaybe Chaucer is more relevant than Baudelaire. An 1851 print by Hiroshige depicts a fun-loving crowd of pilgrims heading for a mountain shrine by the sea, their bright costumes and dancing movements as robustly human as Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims. What makes this print, and almost every other here, so radiant is this artist’s ecstatic sense of colour. Seas like sapphire, skies on fire, acid reds and oranges, kimonos with myriad hues that contrast with the white faces of the women – it’s a kaleidoscopic trip. The matter-of-fact details of Hiroshige’s pleasure gardens, teahouses and picnics are irradiated by his cosmic colours. He sees nirvana in a blast of Prussian blue.It was Van Gogh who was Hiroshige’s most passionate western fan. There are two versions here of The Plum Garden, which Van Gogh copied. In the different variants, Hiroshige casts the sky in varying tints of red-pink, as if the atmosphere is stained with plum juice. Van Gogh’s drawing for his canvas after Hiroshige is shown beside these juicy scenes. You feel his pained concentration as he carefully, spikily delineates the fruit trees, trying to drink the redemption and happiness of Hiroshige’s sweet strong art.Hiroshige: Artist of the Open Road is at theBritish Museum, London, from 1 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtBritish MuseumJapanPaintingAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1932, the festival’s inaugural year, the German film-maker’s mystical mountain drama The Blue Light made the official selection. In 1934, she picked up a gold medal for Triumph of the Will, her chronicle of the Nazi party congress in Nuremberg. In 1938, 10 weeks before Kristallnacht, she won best foreign film with Olympia, a two-part documentary of the summer Olympics in Berlin that wascommissioned and financed by the Nazi government, overseen by the Reich ministry of propaganda and enlightenment, and released on Adolf Hitler’s birthday.After the war, and until the day she died, aged 101, in 2003, Riefenstahl insisted that her films were only ever about award-winning art. Through the postwar decades, and over the course of four denazification proceedings, the film-maker presented herself as an apolitical aesthete. She had no interest in “real-world issues”. She was motivated only by beauty, creative opportunity and the perfection of her craft. Although she never disavowed her personal fascination with Hitler, she vehemently denied complicity with the atrocities of the Nazi regime. Olympia and Triumph of the Will were in no way tendentious, she told Cahiers du Cinéma in 1965. They were “history – pure history”.Last August, the film-maker made a return of sorts to Venice, but this time as the subject of Andres Veiel’s Riefenstahl, a new documentary that reveals just how doctored history could be in her hands. Made with exclusive access to her private estate, the film explores how Riefenstahl’s great talent for staging and image-making extended not only to a cinematic glorification of nazism, but also to a personal exculpation campaign so persuasive that Mick Jagger, Madonna and Quentin Tarantino all gladly endorsed Riefenstahl’s art.Alongside his producer, the journalist Sandra Maischberger, Veiel was galvanised by the possibility that the material Riefenstahl left for posterity might disclose truths she had skilfully obscured in her lifetime. The first challenge was the sheer volume of her estate, which comprised more than 700 boxes, containing film reels, news clippings, letters, diaries, home videos, several drafts of Riefenstahl’s memoirs, hundreds of hours of recorded phone conversations, and hundreds of thousands of photographs.View image in fullscreenLeni Riefenstahl during the filming of Triumph of the Will at the 1934 Nazi Party Congress.Photograph: Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesOver six years, Veiel, Maischberger and a team of researchers combed through the material for anything that might contradict Riefenstahl’s public story. For the first six months, there were no breakthroughs. The experience felt “like a sermon”, Veiel recalls. “It was just interview after interview – always the same questions, always the same answers: ‘I was just an artist, I was not interested in politics.’ It was suffocating.”It appeared Riefenstahl, a consummate editor, had perfected her posthumous presentation. Then, slowly, fissures began to appear among the folders and files. There was a scribbled note in a calendar to “Vote NPD”, a reference to the postwar neo-Nazi party. Recordings of private telephone conversations conveyed shared nostalgia for the “decency and virtue” of the Nazi years. There was a missing section of a 1934 interview Riefenstahl gave to the Daily Express which, when located in the newspaper’s own archives, described the “tremendous impression” made on her byMein Kampf, the first page of which had made her “a confirmed National Socialist”.There were also private letters that proffered previously unseen, and compromising, accounts of Riefenstahl’s stint as a war correspondent in Poland and her witnessing of one of the earliest massacres of Jews, in Końskie in September 1939. While Riefenstahl first claimed she did not see the shooting, and later that she did but had been horrified, the estate letters hint at a more complicated story. Indeed, one letter, referring to an army report of the massacre, suggests that Riefenstahl’s directorial instructions to remove the Jews from a market square where she was filming may even have been a catalyst for the shooting. Her request was relayed roughly by a member of the Nazi military as “get rid of the Jews”, the letter says. “Prompted by this remark … some of the Polish Jews attempted to flee and the shots were fired.”“In the beginning, I was the detective, looking for her guilt,” recalls Veiel of his discoveries. “Later on I realised she does the job herself.”It was important that she is not just a nasty Nazi. She is a human being. That makes her even more dangerousMaking Riefenstahl, Veiel and Maischberger observed in parallel a renaissance of the film-maker’s imagery and its attendant ideology. From Donald Trump’s raised fist to the organised bodies of Moscow military parades, the mediascape was increasingly occupied by the choreography, motifs and perspectives that characterise Triumph of the Will. To those in the film community – and beyond – who defend Riefenstahl as a “pure artist” or foreground the formal appreciation of her imagery, the documentary insists, as Maischberger puts it, that “there is no innocence in the use of these aesthetics”.The film works with minimal commentary, but makes deft use of cuts to expose the inconsistencies in its subject’s storytelling. Her claim, in a 1993 documentary, that Triumph of the Will has “no other political goal or motive” beyond “peace and work” and “no mention of racial theory” is swiftly followed by her low-angle shots of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher thundering that “a people that does not hold dear its racial purity will perish”.The more archival interviews with Riefenstahl the team reviewed, the more the film-maker also revealed her strategies of postwar rehabilitation. An actor before she was a director, she deployed all her “tools as an artist”, Veiel says, to deflect from her ideological affinity with nazism. Over the course of the documentary, we encounter the film-maker as beguiling and flirtatious – all secretive smiles and “oh, do have another cup of coffee”. We see her furious and intimidating, abruptly shutting down interviews with a high-volume tirade. We see her insist on her own victimhood and on how “terribly difficult” it is not to be believed. And in English-language interviews in particular, we see her play guileless ingenue. “What does it mean, ‘disappear’?” she asks one interviewer, when asked about her knowledge of deportations.View image in fullscreenLeni Riefenstahl, pictured in 1993, had a childhood imbued with ideas of ‘toughness, strength and contempt for weakness’.Photograph:  /BetaCinema/Riefenstahl/Landesarchiv/BadenWuerttembergThroughout Riefenstahl, Veiel makes frequent use of slow-motion and zoom to bring the viewer uneasily close to his subject’s gaze, gestures and mouth. Early on in the film, he cuts between photos of her at different ages, her piercing eyes steadfast centre of the frame. The effect is one of powerful beauty (“as pretty as a swastika”, as American columnist Walter Winchell memorably put it), and of even more potent image control. “We show her ability to stage herself,” he says. “Different means and methods, always knowing there is some sort of impact.”Did Veiel, a posthumous interviewer of sorts, feel manipulated by what Riefenstahl had left behind? “There was this deep suspicion. I asked myself how do I go beyond the performance?” In particular, the director, who studied psychology, grappled with documentation of the film-maker’s childhood.In memoir drafts found in the archive, Riefenstahl described a harsh upbringing, punctuated by “terrible beating” and often being told it was a pity she was not born a boy. She recalled a formative episode as a five-year-old, when she was thrown into a lake and left to figure out how to swim. Since these anecdotes did not make it into the published version of her memoirs, Veiel is inclined to consider them uncomfortable truths – determinative traumas, even – that might contextualise Riefenstahl’s relationship to nazism. “It’s this very brutal Prussian education,” Veiel says, a childhood imbued with ideas of “toughness, strength, the contempt for weakness, the question of supremacy”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She celebrated the strong, condemning the so-called dirty, sick or frailThese leitmotifs would carry over to Riefenstahl’s early acting career of the 1920s, in which she starred in several so-called mountain films, directed by Arnold Fanck. In these Alpine epics – The Holy Mountain and The White Hell of Pitz Palu are two of the best known – Riefenstahl was determined to do all her own stunts. Often the only woman on set, she scaled glaciers without safety ropes, ascended sheer rocks barefoot, was immersed in freezing water, and nearly suffocated under a staged avalanche.Veiel sees a through-line from these childhood experiences and early acting roles to Riefenstahl’s work for the Third Reich. “It was some sort of long-prepared affinity,” he says. “It was not by chance that Hitler was asking her to make these films. She had this divided idea of mankind – celebrating the strong, condemning the so-called dirty, sick or frail. We considered her at a certain stage as a prototype of fascism.”In assessing the impact of education, history and policy on Riefenstahl’s outlook, Veiel described a tightrope between understanding and exculpation: “For me it was important that she is not just a nasty Nazi. She is a human being. That makes her even more dangerous, because she comes out of the middle of our society. I wanted to understand her, but not to exonerate her responsibility.”At times, Veiel seems to come close to a psychological study of his subject. “This ideal of purity and beauty was, of course, to repress the violent part of her experience,” he says. He acknowledges, however, that this is conjecture, rather than conclusion, around the film-maker’s formative years, and that the unpublished drafts of Riefenstahl’s memoirs have no more claim to factuality than the different versions of her experience in Końskie, Poland. In this, the documentary is on more unstable ground, contending with the unreliability, as much as the revelations, of its source material. “It is open. I’m not the one who can judge what is fabricated or not,” says Veiel.Did my Jewish great-grandfather make chemical weapons for the Nazis? Author Joe Dunthorne on a dark legacyRead moreTo counter the doubt, Veiel insisted on total fidelity to the archival material. “If you make a film on someone who is manipulating their whole life, it was a total no-go for us to use AI,” he says. He also developed a visual style rooted in the materiality of the estate. Spliced between the archival footage and recordings are several shots of the archive’s physical presence: the file dividers, the labelled cassettes, the glued-in pictures in albums. The means and matter of analogue record-taking lends Riefenstahl a solidity its slippery protagonist cannot.Ultimately, however, Riefenstahl impresses most in attesting to the seductiveness of evasion. Veiel hopes that the film will above all foster a deeper understanding of “the structure and necessity of legends” and the breeding ground of untruths. Even when the gaps and inconsistencies in her storytelling seem flagrant, she still finds her advocates and supporters. “It doesn’t matter that she is obviously lying,” Veiel says. “People want the lie. That’s the crucial point.”Riefenstahl is in UK cinemas from 9 May and will be screenedat the German Film Festival across Australiafrom 30 April to 28 MayExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsNazismSecond world warHolocaustGermanyPolandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No scientist has ever done that. But that ancient dream hovers today over the discipline called synthetic biology, the very name of which seems to promise the creation of artificial life forms. Take one of the most dramatic results in this field: in 2010, scientists at the J Craig Venter Institutes in Maryland and California announced they had made “thefirst self-replicating synthetic bacterial cell”.This wasn’t, however, truly the creation of life either, but rather, a particularly bravura (or scary, depending on your viewpoint) example of genetic engineering. The team had produced a bacterium of a species found in nature, but with DNA that the scientists had assembled in the laboratory using chemical methods, modified to their own design (including a DNA-encoded version of the institute’s website address).To truly make a living thing from scratch is another matter entirely. Can we create life afresh from its basic, nonliving components? Some scientists are attempting it – last year researchers in the US and Europe reported a “roadmap” to, as they put it, “achieve the vision ofbuilding cells from molecular parts”.That it appeared at all on our planet suggests that making life from scratch must be possibleAll life forms on Earth share the same chemical ingredients: DNA for encoding the hereditary messages of the genes, protein for making the enzymes that enable the chemical processes of life, lipids to make cell membranes, and so on. And all living things are composed of individual cells, which are inherently alive in themselves; the Nobel laureate Paul Nurse calls them life’s atoms. (I’m not getting into the argument about whether viruses, which are exceptions to these rules, are truly alive.) So if we were to make versions of all these molecules using chemistry alone (and that can be done) and somehow assembled them into a cell, would we be creating life?It’s a moot point, because we can’t even do that. Cells won’t just assemble themselves from all their molecular components mixed together in a test tube – they are far too complicated. Every cell that ever existed was made by the division of an earlier cell: as Rudolf Virchow, the German physiologist who helped promote cell theory in the 19th century, put it, “every cell comes from a cell”.You’ve doubtless spotted the flaw in this picture, which is that it had to start somewhere. Where did the first cell come from? In other words, how did life originate? We don’t know, but there is no shortage of theories. In 1953, two scientists at the University of Chicago tested one of these – that life arose from a primordial soup of chemicals in the early oceans – by making amino acids (the chemical ingredients of protein) from mixtures of water, hydrogen, methane and ammonia. Echoing the headlines of half a century earlier, Time magazine claimed that experiment had come close to creating a“living molecule”(whatever that was meant to be).However life started, it almost certainly wouldn’t have cohered all at once: increasingly complicated chemical entities must have developed from simpler ones, acquiring ever more attributes of the truly alive. But the mere fact that life appeared at all on a planet that was once little more than rock, water and simple molecular gases in the atmosphere shows us that making life from scratch must be possible.Some parts of cells do assemble themselves. In particular the lipid molecules of our cell membranes will gather together into hollow cell-like sacs in water to shield their fatty parts. Researchers in the Netherlands are trying to construct a kind of miniature assembly line for loading such lipid bubbles with proteins. But there’s no reason why DNA, proteins and the rest would spontaneously arrange themselves into the positions they adopt in living cells. We have no idea how one might get all these parts to organise into something alive.Yet wouldn’t it anyway be rather unimaginative simply to create life in our own image (or that of a bacterium)? Why not make it instead from totally different molecular components – to, so to speak, write our own song of life and not just do a cover version? That would indeed be amazing, but we have even less idea where to start. How to make things that do what DNA and proteins do but aren’t those molecules?What this really comes down to is the slightly embarrassing fact that scientists don’t even agree on what “life” means in the first place. So how would we know if we’ve made it, if it doesn’t resemble life as we know it? Some researchers argue that computer-based “artificial life” – algorithms that can make copies of themselves, or that produce patterns which crawl across the screen, perhaps mutating and evolving as they go – fit the criteria for being genuinely alive. Last year, researchers at Google described howcomputer programs that replicate themselves emerged spontaneouslyfrom non-replicating ones when they had the ability to join and split. Group leader Blaise Agüera y Arcas argued that this “synthetic life is no different to natural life” because all life is just a kind of computation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

For me, “created life” has to be able to, at least metaphorically, crawl out of the test tube. If that prospect appals you, fear not: scientists aren’t even close to doing it.

It invokes a sense of possibility in people.”To understand Turiya, one has to respect her vibratory intentions, and know her legacy goes beyond her songs.Some of Coltrane’s greatest wisdoms came from her books, including the Endless Wisdom series and Divine Revelations, in which she captured the depths of grief following the deaths of her husband, John Coltrane, in 1967, and their son John Coltrane Jr in 1982. Her grief pushed her into isolation and at times brought on hallucinations, a period of time that she later described as a spiritual initiation that included mediating, fasting and – at one point – going silent.“Within a short period of time, I experienced the first rays of illumination and spiritual reawakening on the physical plane, these radiations open new avenues of awareness in the brain cells,” Coltrane wrote. “Even subtler were the inner effects of light and the cognizance of a spiritual revelation taking place within me.”View image in fullscreenThe Monumental Eternal exhibit features a laser light show by artist Nicole Miller that projects Coltrane’s Vedic astrology chart.Photograph: Joshua WhiteIn her book Monument Eternal, she writes of how she asked to become “an instrument of the Lord” through her suffering, said Sita, who voiced the audiobook in its republishing.Alice Coltrane grew up in Detroit, Michigan, and quickly became fluent in what she later refer to as God’s language: music.“From a very early age, Alice was marrying the sort of sonic realm and spiritual realm, and that started for her in church,” Christovale said, adding that by age seven, Coltrane was learning the piano.By the 60s, Coltrane had become the muse of American jazz, building a career of her own and also working alongside her husband’s group, John Coltrane Quartet. By the 70s and 80s, only a select few aligned with her experimental, telepathic music, Christovale said.View image in fullscreenMonument Eternal also showcases tributes and interpretations from 19 artists inspired by Alice Coltrane.Photograph: Joshua WhiteFollowing her spiritual awakening, Coltrane moved toCaliforniaafter “the Lord gave a ‘spiritual order’”, said Sita, citing her mother’s 1976 song Om Supreme.

Christovale, with curatorial assistant Nyah Ginwright, designed a way to artistically resurrect the ashram for the exhibit with Coltrane’s estate.Christovale now feels “nothing on this project is a coincidence”, she said, believing Coltrane’s spirit has guided her throughout the entire process.Alice Coltrane, Monument Eternal is on view at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles through 4 May2025"

She was just 22 at the time. “I didn’t even think it was a book,” she says when we meet. “I was just learning how to write.”Send Nudes, her first collection, about being a young woman in a messed-up world, was published in 2022. She won theBBC national short story awardand the Edge Hill short story prize. The following year, she made the once-in-a-decade GrantaBest of Young British Novelistslist. “Then I was like: ‘Oh, this is actually happening. This feels like a big deal,’” she says.It is one of the first warm spring days and we are sitting outside a cafe in Broadway Market in east London. Sams, now 28, has another new baby (three months old). He is being looked after by her grandmother, along with her toddler, at her flat in nearby Bethnal Green, while her eldest, who is just about to turn six, is at school.She also – somehow – has her first novel, Gunk, out next month. Squinting against the sunshine, she seems remarkably unfazed by it all. And, as a writer of youthful malaise, very cheerful. Although she does admit that it is a “relief” to have the tricky follow-up to a hit debut in the bag. “You write the first book and you’re like: ‘Well, that will probably never happen again,’” she says. “I feel like a real writer now.”Sams writes in the disarming voice of a bored teenager with a gift for one-liners and sudden moments of poetry, and it is not hard to see why her work has caused such a stir. The 10 short stories in Send Nudes show characters on the heady precipice between girlhood and becoming young women. “It was the summer between year nine and 10, when all the boys smelt of Lynx Africa and Subway,” one narrator tells us.There’s only so long you can write before you’re like: ‘Let’s do a sex scene.’ It’s funPool-side rivalries flare on a first blended-family holiday; a young woman bakes sourdough in the days after an abortion; a girl attempts to recreate a Tenerife beach in a London high-rise flat to console her mother during the pandemic – these stories are sad, true and very now. The girls’ world is one of Tinder and Snapchat, but also age-old problems of unwanted pregnancies and abuse. They navigate toxic relationships with their friends, boyfriends, parents and their own bodies in stories that are sticky with booze, sex and blood.Gunk returns to the same territory. The title is the name of the grotty student club in the novel, which is set in Sams’s home city of Brighton, and also refers to the slime on a baby’s head after it’s born. It opens with a baby just “24 hours and 17 minutes” old and loops back to end with what Sams calls her “big fat birth scene”. In between, the novel charts the friendship between Jules, the divorced manager of Gunk, and nim, a shaven-headed 18-year-old who comes to work in the club. In a twist on the standard love triangle, Jules’s ex-husband Leon is the father of nim’s baby, and the novel rests on the ambiguous relationship between the two women.In Sams’s fictional worlds, the edges between female friendship and desire are as smudged as lipstick after a long night partying. Jules and nim are everything to each other, she explains. “They’re a boss and an employee, a kind of mother and daughter interchangeably, they’ve slept with the same man and they are parents of the same child.” Like the unequal best friends in her short storySnakebite, their relationship is charged with attraction. “I wanted it to be sexy,” she says. “I wanted to keep it really messy and to see if there weren’t so many rules around love, maybe we could love each other better.” Sams is interested in the tangled and untidy: “I couldn’t write something neat because it wouldn’t feel true to me.”Her own life became messy when she got pregnant just after graduating from the University of Manchester with a degree in English and creative writing. “I was a woman of a certain class and education; I was expected to dream of something other than wasting my life on a baby,”she wrote in an essayin Granta magazine shortly after Send Nudes was published. She realised she desperately wanted to keep the baby. Her boyfriend Jacob wasn’t initially keen (he’s now a very happy father of three boys).“It didn’t occur to me that I would feel completely alone afterwards,” she says today. She felt alienated from her friends and the older mums she met in west London, where she was living at the time. Writing the stories was a form of escape, but also “a kind of grieving process for girlhood,” she says. “I really felt like I had left young womanhood behind.”View image in fullscreenGunk was written when Sonny was a toddler and she was pregnant with her second baby. She knew she had to write about young motherhood, and that inevitably meant writing about alternative families. In a time of a cost of living crisis and crazy childcare fees, she feels “like everyone’s rethinking how the family looks. Everyone is like: ‘Where’s the village? We need the village.’ It’s just not working.”It is not just domestic set-ups that have changed. “You no longer need a man and woman to have a baby,” she says. In Gunk she wanted to think about all the different ways to be a mother, “how we mother each other, and how we all still need mothering”.Growing up in Brighton, her world “was run by mothers”. Her childhood was one of parties and music festivals, which left the bookish young Saba (her name comes from her Syrian heritage) longing for more rules. Her parents divorced when she was 11; she has a younger sister and a much younger half-brother. Her mother, a breastfeeding consultant, has recently gone back to university to train to be a midwife. Send Nudes is dedicated to her maternal grandmother. Having so few men in her life as a child, she was thrown to find herself the mother of three boys, “but they are all so different from each other that it becomes impossible to know what ‘a boy’ even is,” she says. “The world has changed, gender really does feel looser.”Send Nudes was written as a reaction against the “simplified feminism” of those bubble-gum-pink go-girl affirmations all over Instagram when Sams was at university. She would look at the slogans and ask: “OK, but what about this situation? What about this one?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But then thereports of rising depression, anxiety and eating disorders among generation Z, particularly women, show that it really isn’t. Add in financial insecurity and the existential threat of the climate catastrophe, and it’s no wonder novels by a generation of female writers have come to be dubbed – rather patronisingly – “sad-girl lit”.Feminist critic Jessa Crispin complained that Send Nudes conformed to this vogue for listless young female characters “as helpless against the tides of fate as a jellyfish washed up on the beach”. This passivity could be seen as part of a generational helplessness in the face of world events. In fact, many of the stories are also celebrations of female resilience or agency, such as the title one in which the unnamed narrator finds liberation in sending a nude selfie to a stranger. “Obviously, it’s complex and it’s shit sometimes,” Sams says of the reality she was trying to capture. “But ultimately I wanted the stories to be about power and the slipperiness of control.”Far from being merely victims, many of her girls are drunk on their own youth and beauty. “I think that there is loads of power in being a young woman,” Sams reflects. “But your power is also your powerlessness. It’s constantly eluding you.” Looking gorgeous might feel great, but “it’s just the patriarchy” and can always be weaponised against you.Like writers such as Ottessa Moshfegh (Sams is a big fan), she refuses to be coy about sex and body parts. “I’m really interested in bodies, particularly women’s bodies, periods and all of that,” she says. “To me that feels overdue.” You can’t write about women’s bodies without also writing about shame. “I was a chubby kid, and I felt bad about my body from around the age of six,” she says. “I don’t think it felt, like, rare.”She was determined to write a truthful delivery room scene, breaking waters and all. “I was filling chapters,” she laughs. “I was forcing my reader to witness this massive birth scene, because you give birth and no one cares. You’re like: ‘Listen to this – it’s insane!’” And, rather than being an act of feminist subversion, she simply enjoys writing about sex. “There’s only so long you can write before you’re like: ‘Let’s do a sex scene.’ It’s fun.”She gave a copy of Send Nudes to her grandparents with strict instructionsnotto read it. “Obviously they would never have listened,” she jokes. “But I don’t know if they’re as scary as just, like, the whole world.”Jacob is a horticulturist at Kew Gardens – “He’s a plant guy, it’s cute” – and they have a small but lovely garden in east London. Now her middle son is at nursery, Sams likes to write in the cafe of a local independent cinema, where they don’t hassle you to buy much and she can eavesdrop on conversations about films. Generally, she’s not bothered by the buggy in the hall. Quite the opposite: “For me, having kids and writing complement each other,” she explains. “You experience time differently because toddlers are so slow and so interested in every tiny thing. Writing is the same: it takes ages and there’s so much paying attention to things that are brushed over when you’re just walking around.” Writing is the best way “to be in love with being alive”, she says, and there’s nothing sad about that.Her phone buzzes. Time’s up. It’s her grandmother. She needs to go home and feed her new baby.Gunk by Saba Sams will be published by Bloomsbury on 8 May.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Tracy Letts plays radio shock jock Rick Egan, who casually, carelessly stirs up racial tensions in the post-9/11 US. Fast forward eight years, and Rick is persona non grata in the industry, a deadbeat dad and – on top of all that – has become the target of an evil parasitic force called the Blank (voiced by Taran Killam), in a series that offers thrills and chills right to the end.Believein MagicView image in fullscreenMegan Bhari was a teenager who – despite apparent ill health – poured her energy into founding a charity for sick children that was supported by the likes of One Direction. But, astoundingly, web sleuths alleged that Bhari was faking cancer – even claiming that she had gone to Disney World when she was supposed to be undergoing treatment. Sensitively handling its hugely tricky subject matter, Jamie Bartlett’s 2023 BBC series keeps up its rigorous investigation of the Believe in Magic charity all the way to its final chapter, with big revelations about Bhari and her family.Hot Money: Who Rules Porn?This pod from the FT and Pushkin is the sort of series that lodges itself deep in your brain after listening. First released in 2022, it offers a forensic look at the world of online porn, from the surprising role of Visa and Mastercard to what performers really think of their tech overloads, and the ascent of OnlyFans. It also seeks to answer a simple but seemingly unknowable question: who is PornHub’s secretive owner? Gladly, Patricia Nilsson and Alex Barker find this out – and much more besides.Dancing With ShadowsView image in fullscreenReleased earlier this year, this series hosted by journalist Nicky Anderson for the British podcast outfit Stak delves into the elite New York City Ballet, where allegations of abuse and toxicity have festered over the decades – even leading to a headline-grabbing lawsuit. Its greatest strength is its candid accounts from former members of the company – which continue right to the last episode, when a newly retired dancer unpacks the isolation and mental strain she suffered.Finding Quantum QuestView image in fullscreenFunded in part by Nasa, Quantum Quest was an ambitious, educational sci-fi animation with an enviable voice cast that included Samuel L Jackson, Mark Hamill and Sandra Oh. Why, then, did the film barely see the light of day, showing in one Kentucky cinema for six months in 2011 before all traces of it were scrubbed from existence? This indie pod explores all the theories, before getting some solid answers about how such a starry project ended up on the scrapheap.Explore more on these topicsCultureThere's a podcast for thatPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Darin’s relative lack of contemporary reputation compared with, say,the Temptations, is why Just in Time, written by Warren Leight and Isaac Oliver from a concept by Ted Chapin, situates its narrative of a life lived in the fast lane behind a very porous fourth wall, the easier to explain who Sandra Dee is. It’s why Groff, smartly dressed and toting a retro microphone, greets the audience at Manhattan’s Circle in the Square Theatre not as Darin, the baby-faced playboy crooner, but as Groff, Broadway king fresh offhis Tony win, poised to deliver a night of rousing, enthusiastic theater befitting a consummate showman.John Proctor Is the Villain review – smart and snappy high school comedyRead moreThe Tony win goes unmentioned, though Groff’s intro mirrors hismoving acceptance speech: as a kid growing up in Pennsylvania, all he wanted to do was entertain. Sing and dance and bring joy. Groff explicitly compares himself to Darin (and, in one of the show’s many winking bits, acknowledges that yes, he will spit and sweat a lot while recounting the life story of the man whose first hit was Splish Splash). The melding of personas successfully transmutes Groff’s exceptional charisma and earned goodwill into the tale of a past celebrity most of the audience could not identify via photo. But it also makes suspension of disbelief an impossible hurdle; it is difficult with such an emphasis on the performer’s magnetism, to invest in the details of the subject’s actual life, which are occasionally tossed off like Wikipedia entries.That Darin, born Walden Robert Cassotto in East Harlem, was a talent of trailblazing versatility who took on pop, rock’n’roll, swing, country and folk – a precursor to the modern pop star demands of reinvention – is not so much celebrated as sublimated into a show that leans heavily on knowingly dated pop-rock sounds and Darin’s most consistent form as a nightclub act. The sultry Copacabana-themed set, designed by Derek McLane, channels Darin’s greatest joy in life: connecting with audiences in a nightclub, riffing and rizzing on the specific chemistry with a specific audience, including certain lucky people pulled up by Groff to dance amid tables in the round.Director Alex Timbers and choreographer Shannon Lewis make the most of the Circle in the Square’s opportunities for audience immersion. Groff, as himself and as Darin, and his three nightclub “sirens” (Valeria Yamin, Christine Cornish and Julia Grondin) saunter into aisles allowing some to feel the white-hot charge of the spotlight. A delightfully perky swing band plays on stage throughout and joins in on some bits; various characters from Darin’s short life – Groff tells you early that he died at 37, owing to a weak heart from childhood bouts with rheumatic fever – pop up on and around stages at opposite ends of the space.Those characters are accoutrements to a show predicated on pizzazz, not friction or substance, though each woman gets her time to shine. This includes Darin’s mother, Polly (Michele Pawk), a former vaudeville singer reverent of the classics who pushed her son to pursue a showbiz career; much-older, too-doting sister Nina (Emily Bergl); first flame Connie Francis (Gracie Lawrence), a fellow 50s chart-chaser possessing a truly showstopping belt; and in the second act, the actor Sandra Dee (a mellifluously voiced Erika Henningsen), with whom Darin briefly became a Hollywood it-couple in the early 60s, before the marriage fell apart.Smash review – canceled TV drama gains new life on BroadwayRead moreThat Groff and Henningsen sell the rise and fall of this doomed pairing as well as they do within three songs is a testament to the sheer force of their performances; at one point I thought Groff had to have a double, so fast did he move between stages. But while the second act evinces some thornier parts of a character the first act kept mostly eager, ambitious and prodigiously imitative – Darin was a classically bad husband – it still zooms awkwardly through heavy material. At one point, Dee breezes through Darin’s pivot to politics, witnessing the assassination of RFK, mental breakdown, loss of his fortune, folk rebrand and decampment to Big Sur all in about 30 seconds. Likewise, the death he always knew was coming early passes too swiftly to fully land; much more emotional, if a touch too earnest for my liking, is Groff’s conclusion, as himself, celebrating the cliched yet still somehow underappreciated, unrepeatable magic of live performance.Which is, ultimately, Just in Time’s selling point. The show puts an interesting twist on the cliche of a past-his-prime singer becoming a nightclub nostalgia act – typically a sad, pitiable fate for a pop star instead presented as a victory, a return to form and homecoming worthy of one of the show’s most vivacious numbers. Both Darin and Groff understood the implicit contract of a performer: lend one’s time in exchange for entertainment. The retro style of show will appeal to some Broadway-heads more than others, but on that promise, at least, Groff more than delivers.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayMusicalsUS theaterTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to imagine that barely 20 miles (32km) separate me from the frantic bustle of the famous Djemaa el Fna square and the clamour of the souks.“Salam alaikum,” says Abdelkarim Ait Ali, owner ofOurika Lodge(doubles from £53), as he loads my already groaning table with the generous breakfast offerings that are part of traditional Amazigh (Berber) hospitality. “There are so many [hot air] balloons this morning!” he says, pouring glasses of sage-scented tea.View image in fullscreenI hadn’t even noticed the distant specks in the skies above the city, but now I count more than 20 of them, wafting eastwards on the dawn breeze. The realisation that even the skies are crowded makes it easier to picture the ruckus that reverberates through one of the world’s most vibrant cities each morning.I’d fallen in love with Marrakech during my first assignment there three decades ago, and it’s still one of my favourite cities. For the moment, however, I’m immensely grateful that I’d decided to base myself in Ourika valley, where the only sounds this morning are the sizzling of my Berber omelette and the braying of a mule from the mountain trail behind the house.View image in fullscreenAt weekends, these colourful riverside cafes on the upper Ourika are full of visiting Marrakchis.Photograph: M Bell/Getty ImagesAbdelkarim had guided me on a hike into those mountains the previous day and I’d been astounded that such pristine wilderness could lie so close to a city of a million people. The son of a blacksmith, Abdelkarim now works as a mountain guide, leading tours and expeditions throughout the High Atlas and beyond. He shows me carob trees with their chocolate-flavoured seed pods and cypress seeds harvested for what French colonials calledle poivre des pauvres(the poor man’s pepper). “Mountain people place dried oleander leaves on a fire to create antiseptic smoke,” he tells me.I’m astounded that such pristine wilderness could lie so close to a city of a million peopleFrom the ravine below comes the sound of a wild boar cracking through the vegetation. She emerges from the thicket with five striped piglets hurrying to keep up, but fortunately we are downwind and she remains unaware of our presence.In the distance, patches of snow glint on the peaks of Toubkal national park. It has been four years since north Africa’s highest mountains had a proper snowfall, and the ski-season at nearby Oukaïmeden has been almost nonexistent once again this year.The last wild Atlas lion was shot near those high peaks in 1942, but experts believe that African wolves are now making a comeback in the High Atlas’s remotest valleys. We see the hoof prints of boar everywhere and it’s easy to imagine that the wolves may find rich pickings if they return. Abdelkarim explains that the boar population is almost at infestation level as their meat isharam(forbidden to Muslims). There are worries that the drought is bringing them increasingly into contact with the villagers, as the hungry pigs raid fields and homesteads on a nightly basis.View image in fullscreenArtist André Heller’s Anima Garden.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyIt has been a hard time for farmers, he adds. Spring meltwater rather than rainfall is the primary life force for the Ourika valley’s fruit orchards, olive groves and saffron gardens.Marrakech is renowned for its photogenic gardens: most famouslyJardin Majorelle, founded in 1923 and bought by Yves Saint Laurent and his partner in 1980. In recent years, though, increasing numbers of visitors have been escaping the city to spend time inAnima Garden, established by Austrian artist André Heller on what had been arid wasteland just north of Ourika. I love Anima’s peaceful labyrinth of tropical gardens and mystical sculptures, but am also impressed by the lower-keyJardin du Safrannearby.It is where I learn how saffron, Morocco’s valuable “red gold”, is harvested. Morocco’s deliciously refreshing mint tea is celebrated, but the saffron-scented tea I sip on a sunny terrace in the Jardin du Safran, amid an orchard of persimmons, kumquats and clementines, stands out. Even among the mind-boggling assortment of flavours – thyme tea, sage tea, lavender tea, absinthe, even artemisia (AKA wormwood) tea – that are popular among the Amazigh, this is a highlight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We fuel our exploration of the Friday market in Aghmat village with succulent Ouarzazate dates and sugarcane juice that is tangy with crushed ginger.Ongoing excavations at Aghmat archaeological site prove that this now humble village was the regional capital for more than 700 years, until the city was relocated to Marrakech’s current position in the 11th century. The brick domes that had been part of Aghmat’s majestic hammam were occupied by a community of potters for longer than anyone could recall before archaeologists began restoring the site in 2005.The restoration project remained largely unaffected by the 6.8 magnitude earthquake that struck on 8 September 2023, killing almost 3,000 people and destroying or damaging an estimated 60,000 houses. In the pottery village of Tafza, near the mouth of Ourika gorge and 40 miles from the epicentre, half the homes were destroyed.“It’s strange how fate works,” Khalid ben Youssef tells me when I arrive for apottery class at his workshopin Tafza. “When we were clearing the rubble we discovered a big stone slab that was engraved in Hebrew.

It’s been good drying weather, and the roofs and courtyards throughout the village are permanently stacked with ranks of terracotta pots, bowls and tagines. Although I’m a complete novice, a morning under Khalid’s expert tutelage is enough to get me creating a surprisingly eleganttangiapot, in which meat is traditionally slow-roasted in embers.Few, even among the Marrakchis, seem to be aware of how much Ourika valley has to offerAt weekends, the banks of the upper Ourika bloom with lurid parasols and scattered floor cushions, while chefs at scores of riverside cafes chop hunks of lamb and goat into steaming tangia pots, or prepare smouldering mini-volcanoes of tagine stews with vegetables, beef, chicken or rabbit.The series of seven picturesque falls in Setti Fatma village is by far Ourika valley’s most popular tourist drawcard. On the way up the valley, sightseers often stop to have their photos taken mounted on camels. After taking a selfie at cascade number one, most visitors promptly cross the river to descend back to the town.But Abdelkarim guides me onwards up a narrow track – little more than a goat trail – which leads through a jaw-dropping chasm to the second, third and fourth cascades. Half an hour later we reach the fifth cascade, where a picture-perfect natural plunge pool presents an idyllic picnic spot, a world away from the noisy riverside eateries.“Few, even among the Marrakchis, seem to be aware of how much Ourika valley has to offer,” says Abdelkarim, as we stare past the waterfall to the snow-capped peaks, known as the roof of Africa. “It’s amazing that our valley, so close to the city, could be Marrakech’s best-kept secret.”Explore more on these topicsMarrakech holidaysMorocco holidaysAfrica holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Food styling: Emily EzekielFelicity Cloake's masterclassCurryHow to make aloo gobi – recipeBasic but beautiful, andveryeasy, it’s well worth adding this classic Indian vegetable curry to your regular repertoireFelicity CloakeSun 27 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareDescribed by chef Vivek Singh as “the most common and basic vegetable curry you will find anywhere in India”,aloo gobi(the name means potato cauliflower in Hindi) makes a great vegetable side dish, but it’s also full-flavoured enough to pair with plain rice or flatbreads for a very satisfying (and incidentally vegan) main meal.Prep20 minCook1 hrServes4350g waxy potatoes1 red or yellow onion1 medium cauliflower20g fresh root ginger, or 1 tbsp grated ginger4 garlic cloves400g tin plum tomatoes, or 5 fresh plum or medium tomatoes and 1 tbsp tomato puree2 tsp coriander seeds4 tbsp neutral oil1 tsp cumin seeds½ tsp nigella seeds½-1 tsp mild chilli powder½ tsp turmeric1-4 green finger chillies1 tsp salt1 tbsp methi(dried fenugreek leaves)1 tsp garam masalaJuice of ½lime1 small bunch fresh coriander1 Prep the spuds and onionView image in fullscreenChop the potatoes (common waxy varieties, often sold as salad potatoes in the UK, include charlotte, nicola, anya and jersey royals) into roughly 2½cm dice; there’s no need to peel them, but if they’re a bit dirty, give them a good scrub first.Peel and finely slice the onion (I like the sweetness of red in this dish, but brown will work fine, too).2 Trim the cauliflowerView image in fullscreenCut any leaves off the cauliflower, saving those that are in good shape to add to the dish later (or use them in a soup or stir-fry, if you prefer).Trim off and discard the base of the stalk, divide the top into bite-sized florets and cut the remaining stalk into chunks about the same size as the potatoes.3 Crush the ginger and garlicView image in fullscreenPeel the ginger (a teaspoon is the easiest tool for this) then finely grate or chop it – you should end up with about a tablespoon.Peel and grate or crush the garlic (I usually put both in a mortar with a pinch of salt and mash them to a paste). Roughly chop the tomatoes; if using tinned, save the juice.View image in fullscreen4 Start cookingView image in fullscreenPut a wide pan for which you have a lidon a medium-high heat, toast the coriander seeds until aromatic, then tip out on to a small plate.Pour in half the oil, fry the cumin and nigella seeds for a few seconds and, when they start to pop, add the potatoes and saute until lightly golden (they don’t need to be cooked through just yet).View image in fullscreen5 Fry the cauliflowerView image in fullscreenUsing a slotted spoon, scoop the potatoes into a large bowl, leaving as much oil as possible behind in the pan, then saute the cauliflower, frying just to colour it slightly.Scoop into the potato bowl (if you’re using the leaves, shred them, saute them separately until wilted, then put in a different bowl from the florets and stalk).6 Start on the sauceView image in fullscreenTurn down the heat a little, add the remaining oil and fry the onion until softened but not browned. While the onion is cooking, grind the coriander seeds. Add the garlic and ginger paste to the hot pan, fry, stirring, for a couple of minutes, then stir in the ground coriander, chilli and turmeric, and cook for 30 seconds or so.7 Finish the sauceView image in fullscreenTip in the tomatoes (and tomato puree, if using) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil starts to separate out from the sauce and bead around the edges of the pan, and the sauce thickens slightly. Meanwhile, slit the fresh chillies down their length (finger chillies can be quite hot, so adjust the number according to your liking for heat).8 Cover and cook for half an hourReturn the potatoes and cauliflower to the pan, add the fresh chillies and salt, stir to coat everything with the sauce, then bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat, cover and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, until both the spuds and cauliflower are tender. Stir occasionally, to make sure it doesn’t catch, and add a splash of water if it threatens to do so.View image in fullscreen9 Finishing touchesTake the pan off the heat, stir in the methi and garam masala, plus the sauteed cauliflower leaves, if you have any, and leave the rest, still covered, for 10 minutes. Stir in the lime juice and check the seasoning, adjusting as necessary, then decant into a large bowl. Chop the coriander, scatter over the top and serve with rice or flatbreads.Explore more on these topicsCurryFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodVegetablesPotatoesTomatoesIndian food and drinkVegan food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Seven all-in-one recipes testedThe duchess’s skillet spaghetti outraged purists, but there’s no shortage of single-pot pasta dishes to try. Here are some that make the grade, and others that most certainly don’tTim DowlingSun 27 Apr 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 27 Apr 2025 06.31 EDTShareSadly, we cannot return to a more innocent age before the first episode of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’sNetflixcookery show, with its recipe for one-pan pasta. This was a time when typing the words “skillet spaghetti controversy” into Google produced no significant matches. Now those three words are inextricably linked.To recap: Meghan piled uncooked spaghetti and other raw ingredients into a shallow pan, poured boiling water from a kettle over them and cooked them with a lid on. Some of the attendant controversies were: the dish was unforgivably bland; the recipe may not have been Meghan’s alone; Italians, inevitably, consider skillet spaghetti to be a heresy. Subsequently a lot of people recreated Meghan’s version and, in a backlash against the backlash, pronounced it pretty good.I question the idea that one-pan spaghetti represents some great triumph of convenience. A traditional spaghetti dish may be a two-pan recipe, but one of those pans contains only boiling water, salt and spaghetti. It’s not difficult, and it takes 11 minutes tops.But there are plenty of other one-pan pasta dishes out there, some wholly non-heretical. I tried making seven of them.A technical note: the US is the white-hot centre of the one-pan pasta obsession, so most of these recipes use US cup measurements. You can translate by using 240ml to a cup, but I usually just pick a random tea mug, call it a cup, and eyeball the fractions.Another note: all one-pan pasta recipes inevitably call for what seems a preposterous volume of liquid – it can feel as if you’re making soup. You just need to be confident the pasta will soak it up. Sometimes, I have discovered, this confidence is misplaced.Orecchiette with white beans and spinach(Good Housekeeping)View image in fullscreenOff to a good start … orecchiette with white beans and spinach.Photograph: Tim DowlingSaute four minced cloves of garlic in olive oil in a casserole pot, add four mugfuls of water into which a vegetable stock cube has been dissolved, then throw in half a bag of orecchiette with some chopped thyme. Simmer until done. With the heat still on chuck in a tin of white beans, drained and rinsed, a bag of baby spinach and some grated parmesan, about 45g, some black pepper, and stir for a couple of minutes. I did not have high hopes for this recipe, but it turned out to be not only palatable, but ready in under 15 minutes. Things were off to a surprisingly good start.Skillet spaghetti carbonara(Recipe Girl)View image in fullscreenA little gloopy, but not bad … skillet spaghetti carbonara.Photograph: Tim DowlingThe best way to make carbonara already exercises the minds of culinary purists, so a method for cooking the whole thing in a single skillet seems destined to stir up trouble. As with Meghan’s recipe, you’ll need a skillet big enough to accommodate dried spaghetti. Then put some olive oil in it, fry some bacon or pancetta on medium heat and put aside when crispy.Next add minced garlic to the pan (I know there’s no garlic in a real carbonara). Saute for less than a minute before adding white wine, chicken stock (I know) and water – just under a litre and a half in total – and 340g dried spaghetti. Turn the heat up until boiling and cook until the pasta is tender – a bit longer than normal, possibly up to 18 minutes – stirring often.View image in fullscreenThe lot in a pot … skillet spaghetti carbonara in progress.Photograph: Tim DowlingOnce it’s done take it off the heat and whisk in two whole eggs that have been beaten with 80ml of double cream (yes, I know) and 60g of grated parmesan. Really, it should be pecorino, but it’s no use being doctrinaire at this point. It’s in askillet.To be fair I’ve had worse carbonaras than this one – in fact I’ve had worse carbonaras in restaurants. It’s a bit gloopier than it should be, but using slightly less water would probably remedy that. Is it better than a traditional carbonara? No. Is it easier? No. But this is probably how I would make it if I was camping.Mushroom and Swiss chard pasta(How Sweet Eats)View image in fullscreenJust fine … mushroom and Swiss chard pasta.Photograph: Tim DowlingI chose this recipe because I happened to have a lot of chard on my hands, and it seemed like an easy way to use it up. It’s possible – allegedly – to slap all the ingredients into a pot, pour water on top, cook for 10 minutes and have it ready to eat, but I took the sensible precaution of sauteing the mushroom and garlic in the butter for a few minutes first. The recommended pasta shape here is gemelli. I used a near-lookalike – casarecce – but any short pasta should work.The result is … fine. Like a lot of these recipes, it tastes of less than the sum of its parts – which figures when you’re dumping a load of water over the ingredients early on in the proceedings. There’s a good idea for a two-pan pasta dish here. I wish I’d made that.Greek baked orzo(Pinch of Yum)View image in fullscreenTasty enough … Greek baked orzo.Photograph: Tim DowlingI was well into adulthood before I learned that orzo was a small form of pasta, rather than a large form of rice. Because of the residual embarrassment I don’t buy it often, but it’s a sound choice for one-pan meals, because it cooks quickly and therefore doesn’t give the other ingredients time to go soggy while submerged. This dish is prepared in a large pan that can then go in the oven, so make sure you own such a thing.After softening some chopped onions in a pan on the hob, add in two minced cloves of garlic, some chilli flakes, dried oregano and salt, four handfuls of chopped kale (I used chard instead, because I still had a lot left and I hate kale). When the greens are wilted add three tablespoons of tomato paste, a tin of tomatoes, a tin of chickpeas (drained and rinsed), one cup or half a bag of orzo and about 600ml of vegetable stock. Stir, bring to a simmer and stick it in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes at 200C. Serve topped with cubes of feta, fresh dill if you’ve got any and a squeeze of lemon.The result is quite heavy but tasty enough. I’d recommend halving all the amounts. A big skillet of this is way too much, even for four people.Pasta e fagioli(Simply Recipes)View image in fullscreenThumbs up … pasta e fagioli.Photograph: Tim DowlingA safe bet – a traditional Italian one-pan meal with many variations, but almost certainly containing carrot, onion, celery, garlic, tinned tomatoes and borlotti or cannellini beans. As a meal, pasta e fagioli lies somewhere between a pasta dish and a soup, so it’s amazingly forgiving. Sweat chopped onions, carrot and celery. Add garlic and chilli flakes, cook for another minute or so, add a tin of tomatoes and about 1.4 litres of chicken stock. Bring to a low boil and add 225g of pasta – ditalini is recommended, but the closest I could come up with was mezzi rigatoni, which is rigatoni cut in half.When the pasta is done add a tin of drained, rinsed cannellini beans and a handful of parsley, and warm through. Of all the dishes I made, this is the only one my wife had a good word to say about, but then she wouldn’t even try three of the seven.Pasta e ceci(Bon Appétit)Pasta e fagioli’s chickpea-based cousin, in a one-pot version that uses tinned chickpeas and a squid ring-shaped pasta called calamarata.This can be hard to source, but again, any short pasta will work, even – at a pinch – smashed-up lasagne sheets. Chances are you have everything you need to make it already, and it takes 20 minutes.Heat some oil in a big pot and saute one chopped onion, then three minced cloves of garlic, followed by a tin of rinsed chickpeas, lightly bashing up about a quarter of them with the edge of a wooden spoon (it will release starch to make the sauce thicker). Throw in some chilli flakes, a bit of salt and a sprig or two of rosemary – don’t bother chopping it up.Saute until the rosemary goes bendy before adding in one tin of tomatoes – chopped or whole. Reduce for about five minutes. Pour in a litre of water, bring to a simmer and throw in the pasta – again, about half the bag or box, say 250g. Once it’s cooked, finish with parmesan, chopped parsley and serve. I love this.One-bowl microwave macaroni cheese(The Kitchn)View image in fullscreenThin, gluey, tasteless … microwave macaroni cheese gets started.Photograph: Tim DowlingYou’re supposed to be able to produce a passable single serving of macaroni cheese in a microwave, from equal volumes of dried macaroni and water (half a mugful each, say) and half as much of milk, a fistful of shredded cheddar and a pinch of salt. I realise this already doesn’t sound like a good idea. Spoiler alert: it isn’t.The idea is you microwave the macaroni, salt and water in a bowl for two minutes at a time, stirring in between, until the macaroni is cooked. This could take 10 minutes or more (it took me 14) depending on your microwave. Then you add the milk and cheese, stirring some more while microwaving in 30-second bursts until you’re satisfied it’s never going to get any better than it looks – probably two minutes.The result was thin, gluey and tasteless, and the macaroni had an unfortunate, licorice-like texture. It could be my fault – I may have made a mistake somewhere along the line – but I’m not going to try this again.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.One of the main challenges of writing a weekly restaurant column is finding new ways (and at least 11 times a year) to describe the experience of eating Mediterranean small plates in a room painted inLittle Greene’s Silent White. Other food – and, indeed, paint colours – are available, but in recent years, whenever you cast an eye over some hot, hip new place, you need to brace yourself for polenta, coco beans, galettes and neutral furnishing.The Lavery, just opposite the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, is by no small margin the new emperor of this style of cooking and decor, with a formerRiver Cafe,Petersham NurseriesandToklaschef, Yohei Furuhashi, serving up gnocchi with fresh peas on the upper floors of a dreamily restored, Grade II-listed Georgian townhouse.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This room iswhite– let’s call this shadeJohn Lennon Imagine Video White, or Ascending To Heaven And Sitting At The Right Hand Of The Father White. It’s all very heavenly, anyway. There are gilt-edged, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, original fireplaces and expensive wooden flooring. It’s modern minimalist with a glut of leftover grandeur from fine times past, whenthe Irish painter Sir John Laveryand his wife Lady Hazel lived here. The Lavery is not only beautiful, but useful, too, being close enough to the museums to make it a fine place to pop into after a trip to the V&A, or after enduring the half-term scrum aroundHope, the blue whale skeleton, at the Natural History. Would I take children to the Lavery, though? I’m not too sure. What are your kids like? Will they eat blood orange and puntarelle salad with taggiasche olives? Do they say things like, “Mummy, can I have the Isle of Skye scallop with cime de rapa, tomato and cedro, please!” If the answer to either of those questions is no, it’s possibly not the brightest idea.View image in fullscreen‘Absolutely delicious’: the Lavery’s monkfish with alubia beans, marinda tomato and a ‘pleasingly rough-and-ready’ mojo verde.But the Lavery is very definitely suitable for people who have glanced at the menu and prices at Furuhashi’s former haunt, the River Cafe, and thought: “Ha ha ha! I must get my eyes tested. For a moment there, I thought that read £49 for an antipasto of grilled langoustines and £68 for a sea bass and artichoke main! Oh …” The fact that Furuhashi is now in South Kensington, overseeing this wholesome, rustic, yet semi-decadent modern European cooking for a fraction of those prices is reason enough to skip over to this side of town. Take the monkfish main, a generous portion, with perfectly cooked flesh on white alubia beans with marinda tomatoes and a pleasingly rough-and-ready mojo verde for £36. Absolutely delicious.We started with a plate of fluffy, pungent salt cod with fried polenta (of course) and Iberiko winter tomatoes of sublime quality. Then there was also some excellent, balm-like, soft and runny burrata with fresh peas, pea shoots, fennel and a scattering ofbottarga, which we ate with ciabatta dipped inTwo Fields Greek olive oil. I can’t lie: before we started to eat, I had felt a bit lukewarm about the Lavery, because, despite its culinary pedigree and sumptuous location, I failed to see how it might be outstanding. But that thinking waswayoff. There is a precise, exemplary method to the cooking, plating and sourcing that elevates it into one of London’s loveliest new places to eat.View image in fullscreen‘Elegant’: the Lavery’s grilled Swaledale lamb with jersey royals, courgettes, chilli and mint.The main course choice featured rabbit leg stuffed with Tuscan sausage and Castelluccio lentils, and artichoke ratatouille with chickpea farinata, but we were both swung by Swaledale lamb with jersey royals, courgettes, chilli and mint, and an elegant, multi-leaved “little salad” on the side. Service was polite but formal. An Instagram influencer pest turned up in the middle of our meal, began waving her camera about and was firmly told to sit down twice, which I wholly respect. More of this please: sit down and eat your dinner, lady, we are not your film set.None of this distracted me from the pudding list, though, which may be coyly diminutive, but make no mistake, theOriginal Beanschocolate mousse with Agen prunes is one of the most delicious things being served on Planet Earth right now. This plump, puckered, glossy quenelle of joy with two fat, boozy prunes makes every other chocolate mousse in the UK taste likeInstant Whip. We also managed a slice of loquat and hazelnut tart with chantilly cream, a sort-of-rustic, buttery frangipane tart that very much hit the spot.View image in fullscreenThe Lavery’s Original Bean chocolate mousse with Agen prunes: ‘One of the most delicious things being served on Planet Earth right now.’All in all, then, there’s something rather special happening here, even if, on the surface, it may appear to be rather snoozily boring. Apparently, they’re opening a downstairs cafe soon, for more grab-and-go-type fare, though I just can’t see that myself. I doubt the Lavery has anything as casual as a sarnie or a flapjack in its repertoire.The Lavery4-5 Cromwell Place, London SW7, 020-8057 1801.
