Then, imagine a tourist from New Zealand stopping to take a picture and several videos of said grot – presumably to show his kin back home what louts we are – while diggers deposit big black clods of the stuff into the bed of a truck, and rowers glide blithely by.Imagine it, or see it for yourself. Welcome to “Wet Wipe Island”, London’s newest – and grimmest – landmark.Forget the Grecian torsos and brute machiavellianism of Love Island. At the foot of Hammersmith Bridge, the show of the summer is fast becoming the excavation of this very different type of island, a stretch of the Thames that is saturated with enough discarded wet wipes to form two tennis courts.View image in fullscreen‘It’s slightly embarrassing’ … Adam Perry.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“I’m shocked, to say the least,” says the 31-year-old architectural designer Adam Perry, whose office is just off the bridge. “To be honest, it makes me emotional and frustrated that people are actually flushing their wet wipes instead of disposing of them correctly. It’s slightly embarrassing. Don’t get me wrong, the majority of Londoners are doing their part, but all it takes is a certain percentage to do stuff like that and it affects us all.”Unfortunately, the numbers suggest that it is more than just a small percentage who are flushing these environmental terrors down the toilet. Grace Rawnsley, the director of sustainability for the Port of London Authority (PLA), which has taken on the gruesome task of dredging up the wet wipes, estimates that more than 180 tonnes – roughly equivalent to 15 of the capital’s doubledecker buses – will be pulled from the river in the next month.It’s no wonder, then, that Wet Wipe Island – which has its ownGoogle Maps listing(it’s recorded as a cultural landmark), should you struggle to find your way from the tube station – has garnered an unlikely notoriety in recent days. “My ears pricked up when I heard Hammersmith on the news,” says 62-year-old Russell Page, who is nursing a pint outside the Rutland Arms, a pub with expansive views of the river and now, this first-of-its-kind cleanup operation. “I had no idea what they were doing over there until the other day. It’s not until you see [the detritus] up close that [you realise] it’s so dreadful.”View image in fullscreenWaste of space … Rubbish and debris along the riverbank.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe self-financed PLA – which declined to say how much the cleanup will cost, though admitted it was “in the hundreds of thousands” – is using a “rake-and-shake” method to sift the wipes, which get caught in the bucket of the digger like rotten string cheese, from the river sediment. They will eventually be put into landfill. “The sediment will be what’s containing the aquatic invertebrates,” says Rawnsley. “We’re removing that contaminated layer while retaining as much of the foreshore as we can.”If you think that sounds like an unpleasant job, spare a thought for volunteers from the environmental charity Thames21, who have fished about 140,000 wet wipes by (gloved) hand from the river since 2017. When wipes are flushed into the sewage system, and the sewage system overflows in heavy rain, “[it] throws them out into the Thames”, explains the charity’s Liz Gyekye. Because this part of the river is a slow-moving bend, they gather en masse – and their impact is “devastating for wildlife and potentially humans”, says Gyekye. In short, “they shouldn’t be in the environment.”Whether they’re used for makeup removal or nappy changing, most wipes sold in the UK contain plastic, which invariably ends up in the systems of the invertebrates, fish and birds that call the Thames home. Every year, Thames Water clears 3.8bn wipes from its network at an annual cost of £18m. Although the government has pledged to ban wet wipes containing plastic,progress has stalledsince last year’s general election.View image in fullscreenGrace Rawnsley.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianStill, it’s not all bad. “The story of this river is the story of recovery,” says Rawnsley. Where parts of the Thames were declared “biologically dead” in the 1950s, today, with 125 different species of fish and 92 species of bird, “it’s on its way back to being miraculous – but we still have further to go.”Of course, it’s not just wet wipes that are blighting the UK’s second-longest river. Most Londoners have a pub story about the most menacing thing they’ve spotted in the Thames. (My own was a lifesize crucifix, which I watched being thrown into the water from Vauxhall Bridge.) “I’ve seen lots of horrible things floating,” says a 69-year-old passerby, Doune Storey. “Tampons, Durex, nappies. It’s got to go somewhere – it’s not just going to go into the ether. We’ve all got to be more responsible.”Earlier this year, over the course of a two-day environmental survey, the PLA pulled 29 bikes (15 of which wereLime bikes), a park bench, a wheel clamp and an empty safe from the river.As for Wet Wipe Island, Rawnsley hopes it will soon be wiped from the map once and for all: “Without sounding too virtuous, we’re working towards making the Thames the river that everyone wants it to be.” Who knows, maybe in a few years we’ll be livingla vie parisienneand swimming in it. Maybe.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsThe ThamesLondonEnglandWaterPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lily Allen is convincingly brittle as the bored newlywed who has just returned from honeymoon with her plodding academic husband, George (Ciarán Owens). His loyal aunt, Julia, is exquisitely played by Imogen Stubbs. Julia Chan shines in the part of Hedda’s old school friend, Taya, who has left her controlling husband and is in the throes of a love affair with the alcoholic academic Jasper (Tom Austen, all earnestness here). He is Hedda’s former lover who sparks her destructive jealousy, which leads to the play’s explosive ending.The setting is a cool, Scandi-style living room with long billowing curtains, beautifully designed by Anna Fleischle. But as well-acted and stylish as this production is, why does it not convince in its story?Perhaps because it seems neither of our time nor of Ibsen’s. Dunster’s adaptation sticks to original events on the whole and this fidelity jars against the modern context.The playwright’s Hedda is a female Shakespearean antihero, of sorts, an arch manipulator who seeks freedom from the confinement of her marriage and position in high society. Allen plays the daughter of a music label mogul brought low rather than a woman of aristocratic lineage. But when stripped of the specific confines of her time, she is less coherent as a character. Her refusal to work, for instance, is harder to understand, so Hedda seems like a spoilt princess rather than a woman trapped by, but also resisting, patriarchy. George does not transpose into this world convincingly either: he is not adoring nor pliant and you wonder what he is doing with a wife as conspicuously unloving as Hedda.View image in fullscreenCompellingly creepy … Brendan Coyle and Lily Allen in Hedda.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThere is psychological realism – characters speak as they feel – but the language sounds odd and artificial in this setting: Hedda implores Jasper to make his suicide “beautiful”, as in Ibsen’s script, and speaks of her “disgust” when she is told the bullet that killed him was shot into his bowels. Again, it jars.Dunster, also directing, creates good intensity in some scenes but the pace of events gathers a speed that brings out the melodrama of Ibsen’s plot. Allen shows you her character’s power and rage more than her vulnerability but you do not feel her sense of narrowing choices, maybe due to the rush of events.It grows fevered, not keeping a pace with the psychology of its characters, and by the end, events come thick and fast, from Jasper’s drinking binge to trouble with the police, a visit to another woman’s home and his misplaced book manuscript (here on a laptop). Characters’ emotions swing in one direction and then another.The play’s tragedy rests on Hedda’s fear of scandal, after the powerful figure of Brack (Brendan Coyle, an MP rather than a judge and compellingly creepy) blackmails her. It does not quite chime – maybe scandal does not carry the same threat for a woman like Hedda today or perhaps this plot point is just not given enough space to grow in its threat.There is tension in the earlier acts and some taut moments, but it ends up seeming like a domestic thriller rather than a grand tragedy.AtUstinov Studio, Bath, until 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreLily AllenHenrik IbsenTheatre Royal BathreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2021 it was a lie about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election; in the summer of 2025 it’s lies about crime levels. Reliable sources – including the Biden Department of Justice inJanuary– have noted that violent crime there is at a 30-year low. Five people died as a result of that 2021 attack on Congress, and dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, some gravely, by the mob Trump incited. On his first day in office in 2025 he pardoned 1,500 of the convicted criminals who stormed the capital, some of whom went on to commit more crimes.The hypocrisy is obvious, or it would be if most discourse about contemporary events wasn’t so contemporary that events before last month get left out. Of course hypocrisy and double standards are a key element of the rightwing commitment to inequality, and their violence imposes their version of order, even when it breaks bones and the law. As Wilhoit’s law famously put it: “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: there must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.”The former Doge employee who was attacked is 19-year-old Edward Coristine, AKA Big Balls. As long as we’re talking about violence, this spring the medical journal the Lancetestimatedthat Doge’s dismantling of USAid could result in more than 14m deaths, a third of them children, by 2030. When it comes to sheer numbers, that’s like killing everyone in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, or if you prefer everyone in Denmark, Norway and Estonia, but these deaths from disease, malnutrition and hunger will be largely out of sight for most Americans. Of course there’s been a lot of direct violence by the Trump administration on display in the United States this year too, including mothers dragged away from their children by heavily armed men in masks and immigrants brutalized in gulags in El Salvador.The attempt to take over the capital fits with rightwing and authoritarian agendas in so many ways. Modern conservatives love to hate cities because cities are places where diversity and inclusion thrive, where immigrants, people of many ethnicities, queer and trans people, nonconformists, bohemians, independent women and progressives tend to concentrate. A political map of the US mostly shows an archipelago of blue islands in a sea of red, and those islands are blue because they’re also Democratic strongholds.They are threats to the right electorally and because theyare hotbeds of tolerance and of cultural, religious, racial and sexual diversity, and most have high immigrant populations. By flourishing, they disprove the rightwing theory that if these things are permitted all hell will break loose. But it is more fun for the right to pretend that these cities are dangerous because they are cesspits of crime and depravity.That notion that cities or ethnic neighborhoods or progressive movements are out of control justifies harsh law enforcement and violations of rights in the name of getting them under control. In other words, it justifies authoritarianism, which claims to be protecting some of us while attacking lots of us. Something that’s also been part of rightwing discourse lately is able-bodied adult men claiming to be afraid to walk down the street in American cities. All through the years when my town, San Francisco, was being demonized by rightwing and some mainstream media, conservative tech dudes would claim to be afraid to take a stroll here, which comes across to normal city dwellers as astonishingly fragile and cowardly.Most recently the professional provocateur and pundit Charlie Kirktweeted: “Was just inNYCall weekend with our family. Never felt safe. So many people in the city who don’t belong. Praying for all involved.” Who doesn’t belong in a city? The answer would be: Kirk doesn’t if he’s unable to feel safe amid a diverse population.New York has long been a great city of immigrants, the most linguistically diverse city on Earth with 800 languages, including many endangered ones, spoken there, and a city whose tourism and convention bureau estimates 68 million apparently unafraid visitors will come to New York in 2025. Another rightwing pundit and social-media personality, Benny Johnson, just made lurid allegations about crimes he witnessed and suffered (but apparently failed to report at the time) in Washington DC, including his house being set on fire. Not to be outdone Senator Markwayne Mullindeclaredon Wednesday night on Fox News that he doesn’t wear a seatbelt when driving through DC so he can flee in a hurry if he’s carjacked.Authoritarians are at war with cities because they are at war with our rights and our diversity. It behooves us all to defend them – cities, rights, diversity, including by fending off the lies and propaganda that are themselves weapons in this war. And of course Trump is concocting a drama in DC, with the national guard being turned into an army of extras, because, speaking of violent crime, he would like us to really stop talking about theJeffrey Epsteinfiles and his long and close association with that child trafficker and rapist.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Forget networking, embrace netwalking. Why book a stuffy hotel function room when you can work together outside and also have a drink halfway round?Most treasure hunts do not have prizes, apart from bragging rights, although the German company Komoot is this month upping the ante by staginga hunt in Bristoloffering, it says, £32,500 in prize money.View image in fullscreenPaul Fawkesley, left, and Ian Drysdale, right, have developed treasure hunts in 16 cities including York (pictured).Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianThis is the summer of treasure hunts, and on a sunny August day the Guardian embarked ona hunt in Yorkaccompanied by the two men who devised it, Paul Fawkesley and Ian Drysdale. So, no pressure.“We’ve never tailed someone on a hunt before,” said Drysdale. “It could be great … or it could be moderately awkward.”Participants are guided round the city by a Captain Bess character who has heard you’re looking to join her ship, the Rising Pearl. Maps and instructions are sent to your phone and you search for clues and solve cryptic puzzles, all the time coming across things in the city most people never knew were there.View image in fullscreenA character guides participants around the city, with maps and instructions sent to your phone.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianWithout giving too many secrets away, it’s fair to say there was a terrible start to the hunt, stemming from misunderstanding a question about degrees. Was the answer 360? “No.” 90? “No.” 45? “Nay, that’s not it.” Fed up, Bess finally gives up the answer and we quietly move on.Once you get the hang of the puzzles, it is enormous fun. It’s only when you’re not mindlessly milling along busy streets looking at shops you’re not really interested in that you realise how many people are doing just that.Participants are likely to see parts of the city they have never seen before – including, inYork, an empty lane with arguably the best, most photographable view of York Minster.

Now treasure or scavenger hunts are all over the place. They are a great way of getting under the skin of a city that you might not have seen before.”Or even if you thought you knew a place, France added, recalling one she did with her 13-year-old daughter – “she absolutely loved it” – and colleagues. “The one we did was really, really good fun but actually quite complicated as well. We had to work hard.“I probably shouldn’t say this but I’ve worked on promoting Sheffield in various different guises for 25 years and on the treasure hunt there were things I had never seen before.”Speedboats, ghosts and moneyLondon: the capital has many treasure hunts available, particularly for the booming team-building market. ClueGo even offersa chartered speedboatblasting along the Thames, promising a “treasure hunt with extra thrills and spills”.Glasgow: a ghost hunt, the evocatively namedThe Soul That Got Away, is one of a number of treasure hunts in the city. It says it blends folklore, mystery and exploration. “Can you reclaim your soul – or will you become just another story Glasgow whispers about?”Bristol: the German navigation app company Komoot says it is popular around the world, “but in the UK we’re just getting started. We want to change that, and what better way than by having some fun together?” The fun will be what they bill as the UK’s “most ambitious treasure huntwith £32,500 in real money prizes”.

It ran for 18 seasons in the US, attracting more than 10 million viewers in its prime and spawning more than 30 international versions, including a UK iteration presented in 2012 by Davina McCall.The show was undeniably the making of Harper, who went from being a farmer’s son who dropped out of university because he couldn’t afford it, to an American household name who appeared on The Traitors US and RuPaul’s Drag Race. He is “really proud” of the years he worked on “Loser”, as he refers to it, and has little time for its critics.“That Joelle, she just does not like me, does she?” he says with a grin when he speaks to me via Zoom, having just finished watching Fit for TV: The Reality of the Biggest Loser, the new documentary in which he also appears. He is calling from his chic, monochrome New York apartment, where his “little dog”, Ralph (after Ralph Lauren), is darting around behind him. Days away from his 60th birthday, the reality TV star says he has “learned to not take things personally”.For the uninitiated, each season of The Biggest Loser was filmed over a 30-week period, and brought together a group of people who wanted to lose weight (and who, like all good reality TV contestants, often had deeply harrowing back stories). Contact with their friends and families was cut off, and they were sent to live on a ranch, put into teams and assigned a trainer (such as Harper), who guided them through an intense workout schedule. Outside the gym, the teams faced “challenges” and “temptations” for which they could win prizes or immunity from elimination. Each week, the contestants were weighed, and those who had lost the lowest proportion of their previous body weight risked being sent home. At the end of the season, $250,000 was awarded to the remaining contestant who had lost the most weight.View image in fullscreenHarper in Fit for TV.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe rigid format meant that being as thin as possible – not necessarily as healthy as possible, though contestants were monitored by health professionals – became the primary goal of the show, and huge emphasis was placed on the way contestants looked, with dolled-up finalists walking on stage alongside sad, washed-out holograms of their pre-show selves.“We’re all obsessed with our looks,” Harper says in Fit for TV. “Because aren’t we?” he says when I ask him about it. “I know that probably sounds really shallow, but I have worked in the fitness business for a long, long time. And yes, I want to be as healthy as I possibly can”, as do “all the people that I’ve ever worked with”, but looks are “a huge part of it … I want to look good when I go to the beach.”Harper’s own looks were also important when it came to The Biggest Loser. The roles played by him and Jillian Michaels, the show’s other original trainer, partly involved being eye candy for viewers: thin, ripped examples of what the show deemed to be desirable. Harper has a number of tattoos, which were “a real issue” with the producers, “because they didn’t know what the American audience would or would not respond to”. He was made to wear long sleeves to cover them up – until, Harper says, on one non-shooting day: “I didn’t have a shirt on when I was training and they saw me and they were like, ‘Oh, he looks great. He can show whatever he wants.’”View image in fullscreenJillian Michaels and Bob Harper.Photograph: Richard Hartog/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesProducers also worried about him talking about being gay on the show. Harper came out at 15, but didn’t discuss it publicly until a conversation he had with a gay contestant was shown on The Biggest Loser in 2013. “Everyone was kind of nervous about that,” he says, but his view was: “Why would I not talk about it? I’m not ashamed of who I am. I never have been.”Born in rural Tennessee, Harper says he was “definitely different” from his parents and two older sisters, and as a young adult he moved an hour south to Nashville to look for work. The owner of his local gym took him under her wing, and he began teaching fitness classes, which took him to Los Angeles, where his clients included Julia Roberts and Ellen DeGeneres. Thanks to the film stars and Hollywood agents who attended his classes, his name was put forward when producers began discussing The Biggest Loser, and he went on to become the only trainer to appear in all 17 seasons, between 2004 and 2016, as well as the one-season 2020 reboot, in which he was the show’s presenter.The Biggest Loser “was the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” Harper says. Even on “dark days” when there was no filming, the trainer was busy leading “more sensible, low-pressure workouts” – those days were “when we got all the real work done”, he says. He tired himself out to the point that after one season, he got shingles, and remembers being so hungry on set that he would sometimes eat the snacks that had been provided for the contestants in temptation challenges.“Temptations” were one aspect of the show with which Harper did not agree. They involved bringing the contestants into rooms full of high-calorie food, which they had to decide whether to eat (which could win them advantages in the competition or the chance for a treat, such as visiting family) or refuse, to prevent weight gain. He tried to push back on these challenges to the producers “all the time”, he says, but he and the other trainers “didn’t have a say in it”.View image in fullscreenThe Biggest Loser ran for 18 seasons in the US.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixSuch challenges, as well as filming techniques such as shaking the camera when a contestant fell over to make it look as if their weight had caused the ground to move, were “designed to make you draw conclusions about fat people”, says the author and activist Aubrey Gordon in Fit for TV. When I ask Harper if he thinks the show made fun of fat people, he says he can only speak for himself, but “that’s something I would never do and have never done”.I mentiona study that showed an increase in anti-fat attitudesafter participants had been shown episodes of The Biggest Loser. Harper hasn’t heard of it, but thinks it’s “stupid”. “The trolls that are out there just want to attack in any way, because people are going to have such a strong opinion when it comes to weight loss,” he says. He is keen to share examples of people who have told him they were inspired by The Biggest Loser: “I really do believe that we did help a lot of people.”But even if you buy into the show’s “inspirational” message, the fact remains that most of Loser’s contestantsregained weightafter the competition had ended. When it comes to any kind of diet or fitness regimen, “the success rate overall is very low,” Harper says. “It’s really sad, but it’s such a reality.”He is much happier to talk about the show’s “success stories”, like Olivia Ward, who entered season 11 of The Biggest Loser with her sister, Hannah Curlee. She won, with Curlee coming second, and later named her child Harper in honour of the trainer. “I was really touched by that,” Harper says, adding that he and Ward have remained friends: “She’s flying in for my birthday party next Saturday.” Ward “looks better than ever”, he is quick to tell me. “And her sister Hannah, she looks great too.”By “great”, he presumably means “slim” – and though Harper says he is “a firm believer that healthy bodies come in many shapes and many sizes”, when I ask whether he agrees with Loser’s simplistic categorisation of thin being good and fat being bad, he says: “Well, fat is bad. Let’s not kid anybody.”View image in fullscreenThe show’s trainers: Jennifer Widerstrom, Harper and Dolvett Quince.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesHarper knows as well as anybody that those who look fit may still suffer from unexpected health problems. In 2017, at 51, he had what is known as a“widowmaker” heart attackbecause of an undiagnosed genetic issue, which left him clinically dead on the floor of his gym for nine minutes. Luckily, there was a doctor present who performed CPR, and Harper made it to hospital in time. If it had happened while he was alone in his apartment, he says: “I wouldn’t be here.”Having the heart attack “fucked me up”, Harper says. He struggled mentally with going from being the man working out in his 50s who could keep up with 20 and 30-year-olds, to “a person that couldn’t walk around a city block”.Plenty of people from The Biggest Loser got in touch when they heard what had happened – but not Michaels. “We weren’t besties, but we were partners on a television show for a very long time,” he says, so it “spoke volumes to me” that she didn’t get in touch. But, he adds: “I would not expect Jillian Michaels to do anything other than what she wants to do.”Michaels was always the more headstrong of the show’s original trainers, and she caused controversy in 2013 by giving rule-breaking caffeine pills to her team of contestants. Did Harper ever give his contestants any kind of supplement? “Absolutely not,” he says.In any case, the 2013 season marked the beginning of the end for Loser: on top of the furore over the caffeine pills, the show was further criticised when winner Rachel Frederickson appeared in the finale having lost a record-breaking 59.62% of her original body weight, with many viewers believing her weight loss had gone too far.He and Michaels “were horrified” when Frederickson appeared on stage for her final weigh-in, Harper says. He thinks her background in competitive swimming led to her extreme approach. “You talk to any person who’s an athlete. That’s a different breed of person,” he says. “And evidently this woman was like, I’m going to win this show and I’m going to do whatever it takes.”Yet his “horror” at Frederickson’s extreme weight loss doesn’t seem to have led to much reflection on his involvement in the show that encouraged her behaviour. Granted, he wasn’t Frederickson’s assigned trainer. Nor was he season three contestant Kai Hibbard’s, he points out when I ask him how he feels aboutreports that Hibbardlater developed an eating disorder.There has also been criticism from contestants he did train, including Suzanne Mendonca, who appeared on the second season and in 2016threatened to file a class action lawsuitagainst the show, complaining thatshe later regained 150lbs (68kg) , and that during taping she was “dehydrated, vomiting and limited to eating 800 calories a day.”Though Harper tries “not to have too many regrets in my life,” he does concede that two moments that are brought up in the documentary – shouting at Gwynn and telling Mendonca that it was “good” when she threw up because it would help her lose weight – were things he “shouldn’t have” done. But, he adds: “You also have to remember, everyone that came on Loser, we were all adults.”Well, except for the “kid ambassadors”,junior participants whose weight loss was documented in segments of some of the later seasons. “Oh, I don’t really remember that,” Harper says.Does he think the show would get made now? He doesn’t see why not, although he admits: “It would have to be completely different.” But “we as a society are just as obsessed with weight loss as we have ever been,” he says, pointing to the rise of weight-loss drugs. Harper doesn’t necessarily promote those types of drugs, but says he is “for anything that you need to get you on the path that you want to be on”.When it comes to his own path, he says he is in his “retirement era”, but is still enjoying teaching hot yoga classes in New York. He is single, having broken off his 2019 engagement to his long-term boyfriend Anton Gutierrez, “so if you know anyone …” he jokes. He is content with the life he has built for himself, and seems unlikely to be affected by conversations about the ethics of Loser that Fit for TV will undoubtedly bring back into focus.“I knew what the show represented to me,” he says. “I have nothing but a good experience and really good memories.”Fit for TV is on Netflix, from FridayExplore more on these topicsTelevisionReality TVNetflixHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Erika Goldring/Getty ImagesAs her landmark pop album Emotion turns 10, we run down the funky, feverish and feral of the Canadian star’s greatest hitsByLaura SnapesThu 14 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 17.24 EDTShare20. Anything to Be With You (2023)Carly Rae Jepsen loves to squirrel away killer songs for her now-standard B-side collections. The opener to The Loveliest Time (the companion to 2022’s The Loneliest Time) evinces several CRJ trademarks: a love of odd production in the drily funky guitar and playful percussion, breathy falsetto – and obsessive, intense lyrics about being willing to doanythingfor love.19. This Kiss (2012)You can plot Jepsen songs on a spectrum of “laser-eyed intensity” to “dreamy reverie”. This Kiss, from her first pop album Kiss (after her dreary post-Canadian Idol debut, 2008’s Tug of War), epitomises the former, with EDM-era synths that rattle and gleam like arcade machines and a sledgehammer vocal performance about wanting forbidden pleasures.18. Cry (2016)View image in fullscreenIn Austin, Texas in 2016.Photograph: Rick Kern/WireImageCRJ is a fiend for pure sensation who literally called an album Emotion: often her lyrics skip over any specific object of affection and cut straight to the feeling, as a song later in this list spells out. So when she sings “he never wants to strip down to his feelings” on this pained ballad from Emotion Side B, you know it’s terminal.17. No Drug Like Me (2019)Anyone who’s only ever heard the radioactively perky Call Me Maybe and (wrongly) considers CRJ a one-hit wonder might be stunned to learn that she’s elite at genuinely sultry come-ons. No Drug Like Me lives up to its narcotic premise – a risky cliche to sell – with its slinky, muted boogie and Jepsen’s gasped promises to “blossom for you”.16. All That (2015)Avant garde collaborators love Jepsen, but unlike, say, Caroline Polachek or Charli xcx, she’s never made leftfield cool her brand. Those moments feel more like surprise gems in her enjoyably wayward catalogue: All That, made with Ariel Rechtshaid and Dev Hynes, is a sparkling devotional that forms a perfect period trifecta with Sky Ferreira’sEverything Is Embarrassingand Solange’sLosing You.15. Joshua Tree (2022)The verse to Joshua Tree is all sharp, hungry anticipation of – what else – some kind of sensory high. Jepsen makes it worth the wait when the tension breaks into a chorus of rapturous satisfaction, à la Jessie Ware’s sultrier disco moments: “I need it / I feel it,” Jeppo sings, her unusually fragmentary lyrics evoking the strobe-lit half-memories of an ecstatic night out.14. Boy Problems (2015)The cutely funky Boy Problems solidified CRJ’s gay icon status – you’ll seldom see a crowd yell louder than when she sings, “Boy problems, who’s got ’em?” – and gave the concept a self-aware spin, acknowledging how bored her friends are of hearing about her messy love life. The sing-songy chorus sends up her predicament and is totally addictive.13. Tiny Little Bows (2012)Intended for Jepsen’s scrapped second album Curiosity, Tiny Little Bows got a glow-up from its coffee shop-pop demo to the machine-tooled whirling strings and snapping bass of its incarnation on Kiss. The lyric about chasing Cupid and his dinky arrow makes little sense (how doyouthink it goes with those tiny little bows? Err, fiddly?) yet hits like the best of Scandi-pop nonsense.12. Everything He Needs (2019)View image in fullscreenCRJ performing in LA in 2019.Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty ImagesCRJ had failed to clear this song’s sample of He Needs Me, from Disney’s 1980 Popeye film. So, naturally, she went to Disneyland and got Mickey Mouse to sign a fake contract approving it, then sent it to the publishers: “The big star boss says it’s OK.” They relented, and thank god, otherwise this slice of flirty madness, with its chorus that ascends like a starlet climbing a light-up staircase on a TV special, would never have existed.11. Gimmie Love (2015)“‘Cause I want what I want / Do you think that I want too much?” could be the Jeppo MO. On Gimmie Love, she lunges for, then suddenly withdraws from her crush, scared by the enormity of the feeling. It echoes within the cavernous, bass-wobbling production, offset by her effervescent vocals – and a determined cheerleader chant pivot in the middle eight.10. Julien (2019)No stranger to gothic intensity, Jepsen sings that she’s “forever haunted by our time” on this sleek, sumptuous recollection of a formative romance. It was originally written for a scrapped disco album, its cool bass and enveloping sparkle hinting at a student of the French touch sound.View image in fullscreenCarly Rae Jepsen circa 2012.Photograph: PR Company Handout9. The Sound (2019)The Sound offers a rarity in the Jeppo catalogue: unequivocal exasperation, anger flashing as she rebukes an unpredictable lover. “Love is more than telling me you want it,” she sings over an abrupt beat, craving – once again – the feeling. The tender piano in the verses drives home what she’s missing.8. Want You in My Room (2019)Not to accuse co-producerJack Antonoffof recycling, but this song’s bass/percussion intro very much recalls his work on Lorde’s Hard Feelings/Loveless. Anyway, it sets up a fantastically feral CRJ moment: “I wanna do bad things to you!” she rhapsodises, with teeth-baring pep to rival early Madonna and robotic zip out of the Daft Punk playbook.7. Western Wind (2022)Jepsen’s lead singles have sometimes failed to recreate former glories: see Call Me Maybe redux I Really Like You, a red herring for the depth of Emotion. But for the first taste of The Loneliest Time, she ditched her bangers-first approach for this gorgeous, dusky Rostam collab, a pandemic rumination on memory.View image in fullscreenCharli xcx (left) and and Carly Rae Jepsen in LA, 2018.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty Images6. Charli xcx – Backseat (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017)Charli has form for drawing out unexpected sides of well-known artists, and the first taste of mixtape Pop 2 showed off an unusually, captivatingly desolate CRJ. The pair spun a tale of powerless self-sabotage in relationships, their Auto-Tuned voices fluttering “all alone, all alone, all alone” over AG Cook and Easyfun’s tweaky ghost-in-the-machine ballad.Carly Rae Jepsen: ‘Lockdown was me, my cat, and a lot of questions about my life decisions’Read more5. Shy Boy (2023)Jepsen may be as good a successor to Kylie as we’ve ever had: a beloved, benign pop presence with an endless thirst for cheeky disco. Shy Boy is Minogue-worthy: a commanding, tart invitation to the dancefloor, although CRJ fabulously overplays her hand in a wordy bridge that reveals just how frazzled desire has left her.4. Cut to the Feeling (2017)One billion times better than a song written for an animated kids’ film about a ballerina should be, Cut to the Feeling is raw Jepsen ID: she’s sticking her hand straight in the socket of desire, and conducting it through the rowdy, euphoric chorus, written at peak leaping-around tempo. It’s basically Run Away with Me 2.0, but this is a song about overcoming reason, so just give in to it.3. Call Me Maybe (2012)The first time I heard Call Me Maybe I thought it “wasn’t that catchy”. Like biting into a chilli and declaring it “not very spicy”, only to be left weeping and demanding pints of milk, its delirious strings, pogoing beat and Carly’s nuclear-force yet endearingly innocent crush got the better of me. And rightly so.2. Run Away With Me (2015)Emotion arrived a year after Taylor Swift’s 1989, the latter laden with lyrical Easter eggs that clearly identified her songs’ subjects. Emotion hit certain listeners hard because it felt so free from subtext, hungering instead for BIG FEELINGS shot straight to the heart. The brazen sax and “oh-oh-whoa / OH-OH WHOA!” of RAWM are a direct hit.1. Warm Blood (2015)The moment a crush becomes reality is rare and beautiful. Often, it simply never happens. If it does turn into a relationship, that moment of tingling anticipation can still only happen once. Here, Jepsen and Rostam precisely capture the feverishness of finally being so close to someone’s face, you can feel their breath. Their subtle rapture softens the arpeggiated judder of Robyn’s Call Your Girlfriend into a beat that rushes like adrenaline, the song’s body heat contrasting the parched desperation in Jepsen’s voice. It skips the cathartic peak of many of her hits to circle this precious feeling, willing it to last as long as possible.Explore more on these topicsRankedCarly Rae JepsenPop and rockCharli xcxDev HynesJack AntonofffeaturesShareReuse this content"

And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy’ things up, but you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term, OK?” Trump told Fox News Radio.He was referring to the possibility that Zelenskyy will have toaccept “land swaps”– in practice the handing over of Ukrainian territory to Russia, potentially including some not captured by Moscow.Later on Thursday, Trump suggested that any second, trilateral meeting could happen quickly – and possibly take place in Alaska.“Tomorrow, all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” he said. “I’d like to see it actually happen, maybe in Alaska.”Any such meeting would be a concession by Putin since he refuses to recognise Zelenskyy as the legitimate leader ofUkraine.Trump conceded he was unsure whether an immediate ceasefire could be achieved, but expressed interest in brokering a peace agreement. On Putin, he said: “I believe now, he’s convinced that he’s going to make a deal. I think he’s going to, and we’re going to find out.”Zelenskyy will face a difficult choice if Putin rejects Ukraine’s call for a full 30-day ceasefire and offers only a partial break in the fighting, particularly if Trump thinks a three-way meeting should still go ahead.The Ukrainian president spent much of Thursday in London discussingWednesday’s video call between European leaders and Trumpwith the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. European leaders were largely relieved with the way the conversation went, but know Trump is unpredictable and prone to acting on instinct, rather than sticking to a script.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet at 10 Downing Street.Photograph: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing StreetThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said changes on the battlefield could make peace harder. “To achieve a peace, I think we all recognise that there’ll have to be some conversation about security guarantees,” he said.Trump has rejected offering such guarantees before, but it is possible European security guarantees could be agreed. Rubio said he believed Trump had spoken by phone to Putin four times and “felt it was important to now speak to him in person and look him in the eye and figure out what was possible and what isn’t”.Starmer and Zelenskyy met in Downing Street for breakfast on Thursday and hailed “a visible chance for peace” as long as Putin proved he was serious about ending the war.European leaders emerged from Wednesday’s meeting reassured that Trump was going into his summit focused on extracting Putin’s commitment to a durable ceasefire and was not seeking to negotiate over Ukraine’s head.The plan for Trump and Putin to hold a joint press conference after their talks suggests the White House is optimistic the summit will bring about a breakthrough. Moscow is determined that the summit should not just focus on Ukraine but also agree steps to restart US-Russian economic cooperation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a separate statement, Zelenskyy said there had been discussions about the security guarantees required to make any deal “truly durable if the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killing”.On Wednesday Starmer co-chaired a virtual meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – a European-led effort to send a peacekeeping force to Ukraine to enforce any deal – where he said there was a “viable” chance of a truce.On Thursday the prime minister gave Zelenskyy a bear hug in the street outside the door to No 10 in a symbol of continuing British solidarity with the Ukrainian cause. Similar public displays of solidarity followed thedisastrous February meetingbetween Trump and Zelenskyy, when the two leaders quarrelled in front of the cameras in the White House.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy and Starmer embrace in Downing Street.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockFurther sanctions could be imposed on Russia should the Kremlin fail to engage, and Starmer said the UK was already working on its next package of measures targeting Moscow.Trump has frequently said he will know if he can achieve peace in Ukraine only by meeting Putin personally. He sets great faith in his personal relationship with the Russian leader, but on Wednesday he played down expectations of what he could do to persuade Putin to relent. At the same time he warned there would be“very severe consequences”for Russia if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire, a veiled threat to increase US sanctions on Russian oil exports.As Ukraine battles to hold lines, Trump may find Putin difficult to persuadeRead moreHe has so far held off from imposing such economic pressure on Russia, but by the end of the month the US is due to impose additional tariffs on Indian imports into the US as a punishment for India continuing to buy Russian oil.The UK would like to see the US consider other, more targeted sanctions, either on the so-called shadow fleet of Russian oil tankers or on refineries that use Russian oil. But Moscow briefed that the Alaska summit, far from leading to extra economic pressure on the Russian economy, would instead include discussion and agreements on new US-Russian economic cooperation, a step that would relieve the pressure on Russian state finances.Some European leaders took heart from the detailed grasp of the issues shown on the call by the US vice-president, JD Vance, and by hints that Trump could be willing to contribute US assets to a European-led security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement.The Alaska summit, due to start at 11.30am local time (2030 BST), will include aone-to-one meetingbetween Trump and Putin, with interpreters, then a wider meeting.The Russian delegation will include the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov; the defence minister, Andrei Belousov; the finance minister, Anton Siluanov; the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev; and Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaKeir StarmerForeign policyEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

But the improvements faded outside London, the south-east and big cities.Graph showing regional gapWhile one in three entries from 18-year-olds in London gained A* or A grades, fewer than one in four did so in the north-east of England, where results remain below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019.‘They pushed me’: Birkenhead college students ace A-levelsRead moreLondon’s advantage means that the university application rate for its students remains considerably above all other English regions, even as record numbers of school leavers accepted offers to begin higher education courses this autumn.TheDepartment for Educationsaid that the results “have exposed inequalities which continue to exist in the education system”, which it aims to tackle in a schools white paper later this year.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “Every single young person collecting their results should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams – whether that starts with further study, university, an apprenticeship or the world of work – but too often, opportunities depend on background rather than talent.“The entrenched divide in outcomes seen over the last few years and the lack of progress for children from white working-class backgrounds is particularly concerning.”Carl Cullinane, director of research at the Sutton Trust, which campaigns to improve social mobility through education, said: “If the government is going to break down barriers to opportunity, the growth in regional inequalities must be reversed.“It’s positive that increasing numbers of young people from the most deprived areas are getting into university. This is important, because gaining a university degree remains the surest route to social mobility. However, today’s figures show the gap between the most and least deprived areas remains wide, and worse than before the pandemic in 2019.”Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Schools and colleges face severe funding and staffing shortages, and these students were affected by the disruption of the pandemic earlier in their education. They have overcome the odds and we salute the fantastic efforts of our brilliant education staff.“However, we continue to see big differences in attainment between regions, reflecting socioeconomic factors which represent a massive challenge, not only for the education sector but our society as a whole.“We have to stop merely talking about these issues and actually address them with investment in communities suffering from generational disadvantage. This cannot be solved by schools and colleges alone but must also involve action to boost the opportunities available for young people.”More than 28% of entries in England gained an A or A* grade, while 9.4% gained the top A* grade, higher rates than in 2024 or 2019, the last year before the disruption of the Covid pandemic when 25.2% of entries received top grades.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One in five working-age adults in the UK has at least one BTec, althoughthe popular qualification remains under threat from government policyin England.In England nearly 12,000 young people received results for T-levels, vocational qualifications first introduced in 2020that have struggled to attract students. Although entries have increased substantially, T-levels remain less popular than A-level PE.

TheBBCsaid it had removed “some of the language used” by Kandiah from a version of Thought for the Day posted online, saying it was not appropriate for the faith-based radio segment.In his statement, Kandiah said: “Mr Jenrick, I want your daughters and mine to be able to walk down the road safely and without fear. I worked with you when you were housing minister and the UK welcomed over 200,000 people from Hong Kong.“I was grateful for your support and compassion during that time. I would love to find a way we could work together to de-escalate the fear and anger many are feeling in our country. I believe we need to focus on the real challenges that are making people worried – housing, jobs and the cost of living – rather than ramping up anti-immigrant sentiment.”2:01Refugee charity founder calls Robert Jenrick ‘xenophobic’ – videoIn last weekend’s Mail on Sunday, Jenrick cited a series of recent crimes he said had been committed by asylum seekers, writing: “When I see these stories, I can’t help but think that it could have been one of my three young daughters. I certainly don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood with immigrant men with backward views who broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing.”In his Thought for the Day contribution, Kandiah quoted this passage from Jenrick, adding: “These words echo a fear many have absorbed. Fear of the stranger. The technical name for this is xenophobia.”While the government has not criticised Jenrick’s tone, and say the current row is a matter for the BBC, some MPs and others have said Kandiah’s description was accurate.View image in fullscreenRobert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, criticised ‘immigrant men with backward views who broke into Britain illegally’.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe Labour MP John McDonnell said: “Jenrick has become the byword for political opportunism. There is no prejudice he won’t pander to and no harm to our community he won’t risk to further his political career.”Siân Berry, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion and a former co-leader of the party, condemned Jenrick for his comments and the government for not speaking out against them.“It is 100% xenophobia, drawing on stereotypes to create unnecessary and inaccurate fears,” she said. “If you can’t call that xenophobic or racist without the person in question kicking off at you, then I don’t know what we’ve learned from the last 80 years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: “Not only are his comments xenophobic and without substance, but this is the sort of language that fuels racist tension in an otherwise cohesive society and causes the sorts of attacks on migrants and those who work with them as we are now seeing, and which fans the flames which led tolast summer’s riots.“It is irresponsible for a senior member of the opposition to make such statements. Whereas there are a few high profile cases of asylum seekers who have been arrested for sexual offences, this is not at all representative of those who claim asylum, the vast majority of whom go on to prove that they have fled persecution.”Jenrick’s office has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumBBCRobert JenrickSiân BerryConservativesRadio 4Radio industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They take a mifepristone tablet, then wait for 24-48 hours and then take the misoprostol.“It is deeply disappointing that the successful application of mifepristone in one area of clinical medicine is hindering more extensive research into other indications that could benefit public health,” the opinion piece written by eight co-authors and published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women’sHealthsays. All are experts in reproductive health or reproductive cancer working in London, Edinburgh, Stockholm and Erbil in Iraq.“The time is long overdue to give mifepristone the opportunity it deserves to be investigated as a non-surgical option for primary prevention [of breast cancer],” they add.Breast cancer is themost common female cancer in most countriesin the world and kills an estimated 670,000 women globally every year, according to the World Health Organization.Although small-scale, the three previous studies offered evidence mifepristone can limit the effect ofthe hormone progesterone, which drives the cell growth found in breast cancer. They were published in 2008, 2022 and 2024.Mifepristone is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator.If proven to work, it could help women who are at high risk of breast cancer, such as those who carry a variant of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Currently they are offered surgical options for their treatment, such as a mastectomy, or drugs that are of “low efficacy”, the authors say.UK cancer charities endorsed the plea for drug companies to look seriously into the role mifepristone could play in breast cancer care and for governments to enable that to happen by easing regulations that restrict its use to abortion.Dr Simon Vincent, the chief scientific officer at BreastCancerNow, said: “More risk-reducing treatment options for women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, that also protects their quality of life, are desperately needed. And we need to explore all avenues, including existing drugs, to achieve this.“So early research into mifepristone is an important step forward and we need further studies to understand if these drugs are safe and effective.”Dr Marianne Baker, Cancer Research UK’s science engagement manager, said the 57,900 new diagnoses a year of breast cancer in Britain showed that “it’s vital we invest in research exploring new ways to prevent the disease”.She added: “Cancer develops when cells grow uncontrollably. Early studies showed that mifepristone slowed down cell growth in breast tissue, so it might be useful in delaying or preventing cancer.“But we need more research to understand whether it’s effective, how it works and who would benefit most from it.”Prof Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, the piece’s lead author, and who heads the department of women’s and children’s health at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: “Stigma around mifepristone used for abortion is describing part of why mifepristone is not more extensively researched for prevention of breast cancer.“Taken together, our data support the use of mifepristone for prevention of poor prognosis breast cancer. All studies were randomised controlled trials using a low dose of mifepristone for two or three months.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthAbortionHealthWomenBreast cancerCancerMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

He was placed under sanctions along with fellow far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir by the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in June for “repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities”.Standing at the site of the planned settlement in Ma’ale Adumim on Thursday, Smotrich, a settler himself, said the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, and US president, Donald Trump, had agreed to the revival of the E1 development, though there was no immediate confirmation from either.While approval for the plan would be a significant step, it remained unclear on Thursday how much buy-in Smotrich has from Netanyahu and the Trump administration.Netanyahu has not commented on Smotrich’s remarks, while the US state department appeared to dodge the issue of E1 when questioned.“Those in the world trying to recognise a Palestinian state will get an answer from us on the ground,” Smotrich said on Thursday, as he announced the plan’s impending approval. “Not through documents, not through decisions or declarations, but through facts. Facts of homes, neighbourhoods, roads and Jewish families building their lives.”The anticipated decision was immediately condemned by the EU. “The EU rejects any territorial change that is not part of a political agreement between involved parties. So annexation of territory is illegal under international law,” the European Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper said.Germany’s foreign ministry said it “strongly” objected to the plan, and called on the Israeli government to “stop settlement construction” in the Palestinian territory.The Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said the move by Smotrich, an ultranationalist in the ruling rightwing coalition who has long advocated for Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, showed that Israel “seeks to appropriate land owned by Palestinians in order to prevent a two-state solution”.While a UN spokesperson called on Israel to reverse a decision that would end prospects of a two-state solution, the US state department was more evasive.Asked about Smotrich’s statement that Netanyahu and Trump had agreed to the development, a spokesperson for the US state department said the US remained focused on ending the war in Gaza and ensuring Hamas will never govern that territory again. “A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace in the region,” the spokesperson said, while referring to the Israeli government for further information.The fraught question of E1 – and whether the land will ever be built on – has become one of Israel’s most interminable sagas, embraced by settler politicians but seen by more mainstream politicians as a red line over Washington’s previous history of firm opposition.Israel confirms plans to create 22 new settlements in occupied West BankRead moreWhile Smotrich, whose increasingly unpopular far-right party would be unlikely to win any seats if elections were held today, has spent the past 24 hours grandstanding on the issue, any decision to meaningfully advance with actual building on E1 would probably have to be made by Netanyahu given the diplomatic ramifications.Reflecting the strong international opposition, the UK’s Foreign Office said in July – when the issue of E1 re-emerged – that construction would be “a flagrant breach of international law” threatening the viability of a future Palestinian state.Smotrich’s remarks follow declarations in recent days by a growing number of countries of theirintention to recognise a Palestinian statein the coming months, which Israel has condemned.The Israeli NGO Peace Now, whichmonitors settlement building, said: “The Netanyahu government is exploiting every minute to deepen the annexation of the West Bank and prevent the possibility of a two-state solution. It is clear to everyone today that the only solution to the conflict, and the only way to defeat Hamas, is through the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The government of Israel is condemning us to continued bloodshed, instead of working to end it.”First mooted in the 1990s by the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, the E1 plan has barely advanced in the past 20 years amid recognition by successive Israeli governments of the depth of international opposition, including in Washington.Even with the tacit approval of the Trump administration, movement towards building would have severe diplomatic ramifications for an already diplomatically isolated Israel, leading to speculation that even with planning permission, the plan might not advance.Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

It felt like needed escapism as we crawled out of the very worst of the pandemic, with The White Lotus, Triangle of Sadness, The Menu and Glass Onion all hitting a sweet spot, but it’sgrown rather tiring, as Sirens, The Better Sister and Your Friends and Neighbors have felt less eat the rich and more what if we just admired their kitchens instead.‘We thought with The Crown: “Is anyone going to watch this?”’ director Benjamin Caron on risk, realism – and royaltyRead moreIt’s become especially uninteresting as the gap between the uber-wealthy and the rest of us has widened, food prices up and empathy down. That particular anger pulses through Night Always Comes, a well-intentioned yet often inert Netflix drama based on the 2021 novel by Willy Vlautin. It’s told over one awful day, following a desperate, raggedly fatigued woman living on the breadline who must resort to extreme measures to save her family home. It’s reminiscent of the Dardennes’ similarly fraught, ticking clock parableTwo Days, One Nightor 2021’s underseenFull Time, which turned the day-to-day stresses of an overloaded single mother into a seat-edge thriller.It’s notable that these stories tend to emerge within European cinema (the recent German dramaLate Shiftfits alongside, following an overworked nurse at breaking point), where social-realist stories have found a place less occupied in the US. Perhaps that’s why Night Always Comes, while set in and around Portland, Oregon, is made by a British film-maker and led by a British actor, both from a country of artists more comfortable raging against the machine.Director Benjamin Caron, who found small-screen success with episodes of The Crown and Andor, already tackled the wealth divide in his first film, the sleek and twisty con artist thrillerSharper. His primary objective there had been to entertain us (which he achieved, quite spectacularly) but his grimmer follow-up is tasked with a more serious message, an almost two-hour descent into the hellish reality of Lynette, a woman driven to the edge by the direness of her circumstances. He’s reunited with his Crown star Vanessa Kirby, a recent Marvel inductee, who had previously shown an impressive fearlessness when pushed close to the edge in the otherwise rather affected Pieces of a Woman. Her determination is persuasive here but the mechanics of the plot less so, forcing her into an episodic series of increasingly less involving and believable situations as she tries to secure $25,000 for the house that’s about to be taken away from her family.Lynette’s after-dark quest sees her try to get money owed by an old friend (Julia Fox), revisit a shadowy figure from her past (Michael Kelly), get mixed up in a drug deal with a slimy coke hound (Eli Roth), beg for help from an ex-convict co-worker (Stephan James) and return to sex work with a client (Randall Park). The chain of events is kicked off by her mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) suddenly spending the original $25,000 on a new car, an act so impossibly cruel that the film can’t quite find a way to explain it.Lynette is quick-tempered, confrontational and maddeningly impulsive and it’s refreshingly unpatronising that the script, from the Mothers’ Instinct writer Sarah Conradt, doesn’t spend time trying to soften her hard edges. But her desperation shifts too quickly into reckless foolishness and when the pace slows down to allow some more texture to her character, Conradt’s only way of doing this is upping the trauma from her backstory. Caron mostly avoids accusations of poverty porn – his direction is propulsive and then restrained in the right moments – but Lynette is written as only being the product of the very worst things that have happened to her and by the end the overwhelming bleakness of her story starts to feel numbing.Night Always Comes tries to be both seat-edge action thriller and searing social issue drama and while Caron is able to squeeze suspense out of the early, frenetic moments, there’s not enough emotional weight to the more human final act. It might be glumly of the moment and it’s never a bad thing for a tech giant like Netflix to fund films about those grappling with the hopelessness of an impossible system but noble intentions aren’t enough to save this one.Night Always Comes is out on Netflix on 15 AugustExplore more on these topicsDrama filmsVanessa KirbyThrillersJennifer Jason LeighJulia FoxreviewsShareReuse this content"

Caron and Kirby met nearly a decade ago when he directed episodes of The Crown, in which she played the young Princess Margaret from behind a cloud of cigarette smoke.Now Kirby stars as a former sex worker called Lynette, toiling in multiple jobs and living with her disabled brother (Zach Gottsagen) and their wrecked, wayward mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They have cobbled together the funds to buy their dilapidated house at a snip, only for Lynette’s mother to recklessly blow her half on a new car. Cue one manic night in which Lynette must make back the dough, by fair means or foul, or else be turfed out on to the streets.Caron cites the Safdie brothers’Uncut GemsandGood Timeas an influence on his picture’s breakneck momentum. But, along with films such asLate Shift,On Fallingand the forthcomingUrchin, Night Always Comes surely belongs to a wave of neo-realism that reflects our ongoing cost of living crisis. “The idea that you can work three jobs and still not be able to afford your own home is a universal modern tragedy,” says the affable 49-year-old director. “Lynette’s story represents millions of people who are just one or two pay-cheques away from collapse. Of course, the film is in the thriller genre but I also wanted to get across the idea that nurses or caregivers or whoever are being priced out of the very cities that they help to keep running.”Night Always Comes  is available on Netflix.The situation first struck him during a visit to Los Angeles. “I remember being genuinely shocked by seeing the homeless crisis there. People are like: ‘Oh, they must be drug addicts.’ It’s very easy to throw labels like that around. But they can’tallbe addicts. People are not just falling into homelessness: they’re being pushed.”Wealthy characters in Night Always Comes, such as the client who recoils in disgust when Lynette tells him of her straitened circumstances, are naturally insulated from economic turbulence. This is a film where it’s poor versus poor all the way, and kindness is in short supply. “It’s a cliche,” says Caron, “but desperate people do desperate things. And the film is full of desperate people. Everyone has their reasons for doing what they do.”But I’m a romantic. I like to think the world sort of had a stroke during CovidKirby is in every scene, her vitality and desperation propelling the movie in much the same way as, say, Gena Rowlands in Gloria or Mikey Madison in Anora. As Lynette, she lies and schemes, steals a car, loots a safe, and isn’t above taking the nearest blunt instrument to anyone who crosses her. “Being back with Vanessa was like reuniting with a dance partner,” says Caron, with a smile. “It’s been a while but you still know the moves.”Actors bring baggage, however. The casting of Kirby – privately educated and so often labelled “posh”that she has even moaned about it in interviews– as a traumatised, penniless sex worker, appears to plunge the film into the territory of Frankie and Johnny, which starred Michelle Pfeiffer as a dowdy, unremarkable waitress. “You’re absolutely right,” Caron says, “but, as an actor, you want to avoid being pigeonholed.

The lack of reverence that Caron brought to George Lucas’s universe might have been one of the keys to the show’s excellence. “You can get too drawn into trying to please the fans,” he says. “That’s a dangerous trap.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Don’t say that. Look, I remember in the 1980s and 90s, you’d hear about a film in America and it would take six months until it reached the UK. There was this feverish anticipation: fomo, really. And it’s true that doesn’t exist in the same way. But I’m a romantic. I like to think the world sort of had a stroke during Covid, and everyone retreated into their rooms and drew the curtains. Slowly, they’ve been coming back, blinking into the daylight. Look at Barbie and Oppenheimer. Those are moments when the audience feels that connection of sitting in a cinema and having a shared experience. For those two hours, you can be sucked into this portal and taken on a journey.

WithThe Crown, I was working with the budget of a mid-sized movie, with actors who would normally be in films. And people have bigger screens now; it’s not like in the 1980s. No director would say they wouldn’t love viewers to sit in the cinema and watch what they’ve made. But you also want lots of people to see your work.

In aletter to the Guardian, the signatories describe her as a “longtime symbol of cultural propaganda for a regime that is responsible for serious war crimes”.The Royal Ballet and Opera must reconsider its invitation to Anna Netrebko | LetterRead moreThey suggest the RBO has put itself on the wrong side of history by inviting Netrebko to perform in title roles at a time when Russia hasescalated its attacks“on peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilians” and is trying systematically to erase Ukrainian culture.View image in fullscreenAnna Netrebko performing La Gioconda in Salzburg in 2024.Photograph: Imago/Alamy“The RoyalOperanow faces a defining choice: between status and responsibility, between profit and values, between silence and conscience. We urge you to remain, as you consistently have, on the ethical side of art – and of history,” the letter adds.Signatories include the Ukrainian novelistsAndriy KurkovandSerhiy Zhadan, the Oscar-winning film-makerMstyslav Chernovand the chef and authorOlia Hercules. The former New Zealand prime ministerHelen Clarkhas also backed the letter along with a group of MPs, and the French intellectualBernard-Henri Lévy.The Royal Opera House and Netrebko declined to comment. Earlier this month the RBOpulled its production of Tosca at the Israeli Opera in Tel Avivafter almost 200 Royal Opera and Ballet members signed an open letter criticising the organisation’s stance on Gaza.The RBO’s chief executive, Alex Beard, explaining his decision, denied accusations of double standards, after the opera houseconfiscated a Palestinian flag in Julyfrom a performer. In 2022 it showed the Ukrainian flag as a symbol of solidarity after Moscow’s full-scale invasion.Beard said last week: “Our support forUkrainewas aligned with the global consensus at the time. As the world’s geopolitics have become more complex, our stance has changed to ensure that our actions reflect our purpose and values.”TheLabour MP Alex Sobel, chair of the parliamentary all-party group on Ukraine, said he was “deeply troubled” by the RBO’s invitation to Netrebko and its apparent reduction in support for Kyiv.“You can’t explain it as ‘complex geopolitics’. It’s not complex. It’s simple. Don’t invite Russian supporters of the regime to perform. Ukraine is fighting for all our freedoms. This is adding insult to injury,” Sobel said.The Conservative MP John Whittingdale and the Labour MP Emily Thornberry have met Beard privately to discuss Netrebko’s participation in the 2025-26 season, and have also written to him about it.“Anna Netrebko may be a fine soprano but she has previously shown support for Russian separatists in Ukraine and has said nothing to condemn Russian brutality since a single statement over three years ago,” Whittingdale said.The MP added: “I am sorry that the Royal Opera House has reversed its position by inviting her to perform, and hope at the very least that she will make clear her condemnation of Putin and his regime before taking the stage inLondon.”Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, who organised the letter, said the ROB should replace her with a singer “not associated with a criminal regime”.Netrebko is one of the world’s best-known sopranos who draws full houses for her performances at leading opera houses globally. She made her name at the Mariinsky theatre in St Petersburg, whose director,Valery Gergiev, is an ardent supporter of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.In 2014 Netrebko made a donation to Donetsk’s opera house after Russia seized the city as part of its covert armed takeover of parts of eastern Ukraine. She met a pro-Kremlin former Ukrainian politician andwas photographed holding the separatist flag of “Novorossiya”, later saying she did not understand what the flag meant.The Guardian letter asked: “Can the Opera credibly claim neutrality and integrity while offering its stage to someone who, in 2014, publicly waved the flag of ‘Novorossiya’, the Kremlin’s separatist project in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, parts of which remain under Russian military occupation?”A longtime Austrian citizen and resident, Netrebko issued a statement in March 2022 condemning the war in Ukraine. “My thoughts are with the victims of this war and their families,” sheposted on Facebook, saying she was not a member of a political party nor “allied with any leader of Russia”.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin, left, and Anna Netrebko, right, at the 2013 opening of the Mariinsky theatre in St Petersburg.Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images“I acknowledge and regret that past actions or statements of mine could have been misinterpreted,” she added, saying she had met Putin “only a handful of times” at awards ceremonies and the Olympics. “I love my homeland of Russia and only seek peace and unity through my art,” she wrote.Her general manager, Miguel Esteban, said Netrebko had “never shown support for Russian separatists” and had condemned the war in three social media statements and two interviews. She had not returned to Russia since the full-scale invasion, he added.Netrebko has carefully avoided directly criticising the Russian president, who in 2008 gave her the honorary title of “people’s artist”. In March 2022 the Metropolitan Opera in New York cited her failure to condemn Putin for its decision to drop her from a run of Turandot, with her role given to a Ukrainian artist.Other invitations dried up.She has subsequently made a comeback, appearing at the Vienna State Opera and singing to a full house at La Scala in Milan. She is scheduled to perform forfour nights at the Royal Opera Housein Covent Garden from 11 September, with another appearance in December, starring in Turandot.This article was amended on 14 August 2025 to add a comment from Anna Netrebko’s manager, Miguel Esteban, that was received after publication.Explore more on these topicsOperaRussiaUkraineVladimir PutinLondonEuropeClassical musicnewsShareReuse this content"

I was furious – and ashamedEveryone taking the ‘skinny shot’ was losing weight, but my scales didn’t change. My inner dialogue became toxicAndrea JavorThu 14 Aug 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 14.33 EDTShareI’m 46 years old and I have been on a diet since I was 11.For as long as I can remember, eating has given me comfort. As a kid, I lied to my friends’ parents so I could eat a second dinner at their house. I’ve never wanted just one cookie – I’d eat 12 and only stop when I felt physically ill, and sometimes not even then. In nearly every photo of me as a teenager I’m wincing, sucking in my stomach, trying to pose.I never really enjoyed the taste of these foods, nor was I happy with myself after eating them. They came with a side of guilt:you don’t deserve this. This relentlessfood noisetrapped me in a cycle of wanting to eat, then shaming myself for doing it. I spent inordinate energy hating my too tall, too big body. I always felt simultaneously like not enough and too much.Now, GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro are being hyped as an easy fix to obesity. Their manufacturers have experienced significant revenue growth credited to the drugs’ popularity; for instance, Eli Lillyrecently announced 38% yearly growth, credited in part to sales of Zepbound and Mounjaro. Media headlinestoutthechangesin weight and appetite for those who take them.But what if the “miracle” doesn’t work for you?Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Being diagnosed with diabetes at age 27 threw me deeper into a shame spiral. At the time, my doctor clinically defined me asobese. That, along with the prognosis of a deficient pancreas, felt like punishment for decades of failing to control my overeating.Given my family history of diabetes – my grandpa had it – the doctor diagnosed me as type 2 and recommended dramatic lifestyle adjustments, including carb counting and daily exercise. She also did an A1C test, which measures average blood sugar levels for three months. A non-diabetic’s result would be under 5.7%. Mine was 7.7%.This diagnosis felt like being sentenced to lifelong obsession. Food already controlled me, and now it had even more power.Over the next five years, I worked with a nutritionist and psychotherapist. I trained for a 200-mile relay race with friends. I did Weight Watchers, went to Overeaters Anonymous, worked the 12-step program, and used apps likeNoomandMy Fitness Pal. I lost 50lb. Still, I remained overweight according to the BMI chart, and my A1C didn’t budge, which confounded my primary care doctor.I’m not diabetic – should I be using a glucose monitor?Read moreShe referred me to an endocrinologist who specialized in metabolic health. Six months later, when my appointment finally arrived, my A1C had shot up to 9.1%. That should not have happened while I shed pounds. She declared I was misdiagnosed: type 2 diabetics’ bodies make insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar, but don’t use it effectively. But I was actually type 1, an autoimmune condition where the body stops producing insulin.I would be dependent on insulin injections from that point forward.Living with diabetes was taxing. I had to order a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), pen needles, insulin vials and other items – but via a specialty supplier rather than a standard pharmacy, for insurance purposes. I had to procure pre-authorization forms for medication and attend required half-day training sessions every time I wanted to try a different insulin pump or when my insurance changed.In 2018, after five years of effort, my A1C settled in at 5.9% – a happy result for me and my doctor. But to get to a weight my doctor would approve, I still had to lose 30lb. She started me on a new drug called Ozempic. Like most people at that point, I’d never heard of it. She said it was only technically approved for type 2 patients – but some who were overweight with type 1, like me, were taking it to help with weight loss.Over the next four years, my doctor and I gradually increased my Ozempic dosage and eventually were pleased with the results: when I woke in the morning my fasting blood sugar reading was finally within the recommended range of 80-120 on my CGM. I was able to reduce my regular insulin usage.But my weight didn’t change. I continued my healthier eating habits and exercised regularly with cycling, yoga and running. Still, the scale didn’t move.In 2022, when Ozempic was becoming a household name, I suddenly had two problems. First, my doctor confirmed I was already on the highest available dose, so taking more wouldn’t help me lose weight. Second, because the drugs were now approved for general weight loss, I might have trouble filling my prescription. Aglobal shortage followed, and I went four months without, eventually switching to Mounjaro because it was available.The meds are highly effective for a majority of patients but there is still a percentage who don’t lose … body weightVeronica JohnsonMy already-thin friends started taking GLP-1s, and I couldn’t avoid chatter about the “skinny shot”. “I’m not even hungry! I don’t even think about food!” they’d say. But I didn’t experience this quieting of the voices in my head telling me I was hungry all the time, and I wondered why.I was furious. As my friends celebrated their new bodies, I wondered, again, what was wrong with mine. My diabetes was under control, but I was also existing at the margins of a miracle.An estimated 15% of all GLP-1 users are so-called “non-responders” to the weight loss effect, according to Atlanta-based physician Dr Cristina Del Toro Badessa. Lucas Veritas, a GLP-1 user from Montreal and author of The GLP-1 Effect newsletter, highlighted clinical trials showing that approximately 13% of people takingsemaglutide(the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and about 9% of those takingtirzepatide(found in Mounjaro and Zepbound) did not lose more than 5% of their body weight.“The meds are highly effective for a majority of patients but there is still a percentage who don’t lose a clinically significant percentage of body weight. Everyone’s physiology is a little different,” said Veronica Johnson MD, an obesity medicine specialist in Chicago. Recent research hasidentified a genethat may help predict who will successfully lose weight with GLP-1 medications.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said his patients sometimes had unrealistic expectations about how quickly and dramatically they will drop extra pounds. He explained that for someone who is overweight, shedding even a small amount of weight can improve heart and kidney function, adding: “The bar has been set too high for weight loss.”“What’s dangerous,” Badessa said, “is the dominant societal narrative that these are ‘magic shots’ for weight loss.” Veritas agreed: “Expectations are sky-high. People see all the before/after photos and expect an easy ride.”“It feels similar to any other time the diet industry has thrown marketing momentum behind one particular ‘fix’,” Virginia Sole-Smith, author ofFat Talk, told me about the current hype. “There’s excitement that we’ve found a ‘silver bullet’, then it silences any other narratives and experiences about it.”What is metabolic syndrome – and do we really need to worry about it?Read moreI had definitely been looking for an elixir to rid me of body mass. Then I discovered that diabetes itself might be the reason I wasn’t losing weight. Andrew Koutnik, a metabolic research scientist, said that GLP-1s typically lead to significant weight loss for people with obesity (15-25% of their body weight). However, people with diabetes generally lost less weight, proportionally: for type 2, an average of 8-11%; for type 1, about 8-12%.“While we don’t know why this is occurring, prior data suggests the drug’s metabolic effects may be tied to how well the body manages glucose,” Koutnik said. GLP-1s are designed to coax the body into making and using insulin more efficiently, he explained. But for someone with type 1 diabetes, meaning their pancreas cannot make insulin, that’s like installing a turbocharger on a car with no engine – there’s nothing to boost.That said, he clarified, these drugs aren’t entirely useless for people with type 1. GLP-1s slow digestion and suppress appetite, which can lead to fewer snacks and less carb-heavy meals. That might nudge blood sugar in the right direction, but it’s more of a side-effect. “The actual impact on blood sugar control is minimal: less than a 1% drop in A1C,” Koutnik explained.The psychological fallout of being a non-responder can be devastating. It was more fodder for my destructive inner dialogue:Why won’t my body just comply?Alyson Curtis, a therapist based in New York, works with patients who feel isolated as they see others losing weight and don’t have the same result. I told her how unfair it felt and she agreed the loss of agency can be a lot to process. “I hear the ‘thin fantasy’ constantly from patients – it’s a dream to fit into societal norms,” Curtis added, “but what they’re really saying is they want to be accepted, cherished, adored.” She helps patients reframe success to focus on healthy outcomes beyond weight loss – like how theHealth at Every Size (HAES) movementcenters on overall wellbeing.It feels similar to any other time the diet industry has thrown marketing momentum behind one particular ‘fix’Virginia Sole-SmithStill, these drugs are here to stay. Johnson pointed to recent innovations likeCagriSema, a compound drug bringing together an amylin agonist and a GLP-1. In trials, CagriSema helped reduce blood sugar spikes after meals and can also contribute to weight loss. “The hormone called amylin is normally released by the same cells that make insulin – which type 1 diabetics lack,” Koutnik said. He added that amylin helps slow digestion and also lowers levels of glucagon, which could help better manage blood sugar.Society seems to have rewritten ideas about health, worth and willpower through the lens of these astonishing drugs. I figured I could, too. I’ve tried to quiet the inner voice that’s shaming me into thinking I’m a failure for not losing more weight.Forging self-acceptance from deep frustration, I am realizing there is nothing inherently “wrong” with my body – I am simply among those for whom the current medications produce a partial benefit. Learning that I’m not alone has helped curb my body shame.I am grateful that GLP-1s have helped me with blood sugar control, minimizing my risk of complications from diabetes. “When we focus on the miracle weight loss narrative, we ignore their real value in helping people with diabetes, adding to the discourse of body shaming, which is never health-promoting,” said Sole-Smith.I’ve been trying to shift my focus from weight loss to improving my relationship with food. For me, that’s learning to eat with more intention and maybe even a little joy. Hopefully, I can come to appreciate my right to the occasional indulgence without self-recrimination. And on my next birthday, I want to celebrate with the most delicious symbol of self-acceptance: a guilt-free piece of cake.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyDiabetesDiets and dietingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Tuvalu Foreign Ministry/ReutersWith sea levels rising, much of the nation’s population is confronting the prospect that their home may soon cease to exist. Where are they going to go?ByAtul DevThu 14 Aug 2025 00.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 05.21 EDTShareIn November 2022, Simon Kofe, then foreign minister of the island nation ofTuvalu, announced a sensational plan for his country’s survival. Climate breakdown poses an existential threat to small island-nations in the Pacific, but Tuvalu’s geography makes it especially vulnerable. The highest point of elevation in the country is 4.5 metres. If the water rises, there is no hill to run to. In the past four decades, local sea level has risen twice as fast as the global average.By 2050, the government expects half of the capital, Funafuti, to be flooded by tidal waters. By the end of the century, more than 90% of the land could be submerged. “As our land disappears, we have no choice but to become the world’s first digital nation,” Kofe declared in avideo address to delegatesat the UN climate conference Cop27. In the background was an islet of Funafuti, Te Afualiku.“Islands like this one won’t survive,” Kofe said. Then came the twist: “So, we will recreate them virtually.”Organ music swelled, the camera zoomed out, and the image of Kofe standing on the island flickered like a glitch in a video game. The leaves of the trees behind Kofe were bathed in sunlight, but as the view widened, the sky was revealed as a black void: Kofe was delivering his address from a digital rendition of the islet. As he continued his speech, the camera went higher, as if on a drone, and Kofe became smaller and smaller. Frigate birds circled above him, signifying bad weather. “Without a global conscience and a global commitment to our shared wellbeing,” Kofe continued, “we may soon find the rest of the world joining us online, as their lands disappear.”As an advertisement to draw attention to Tuvalu’s grim predicament, it was designed to shock. The words Kofe spoke had been polished by an Australian creative agency affiliated with Accenture. They generated a tremendous market response: travel vloggers began to descend on the “sinking nation”, followed by country-counting tourists who wanted to get a glimpse before it disappears.The idea of a virtual future for Tuvalu generated frenzied commentary. By creating a digital clone of the islands, a headline inthe Guardian pondered, could we not “preserve the island nation before it’s lost to the collapsing climate?” TheSydney Morning Herald reported, “Tuvalu turns to metaverse to guarantee its existence.” The video won an award at the Cannes Lions international festival of creativity, beating ads for Mastercard and Budweiser. Adweek reported on the “award-winning metaverse project that’s saving a nation”.This was a time when the US media was producingtwo articlesa day about the metaverse: it was going to “shape our future”, it was the “future of connection”, it was “reality beyond fantasy”. It also became something that might save poor Tuvalu from extinction. Yet this outlandish idea sidestepped the most basic question posed by Tuvalu’s possible submersion: where are the people going to go? Last year, I flew from New York to Fiji, which provides the only aerial connection to Tuvalu, to find out how Tuvaluans felt about the future that the government had imagined for them.Spread 420 miles across the western Pacific, halfway between Australia and Hawaii, Tuvalu is made up of nine islands, six of which are atolls. Funafuti is an atoll, consisting of 33 individual islets. Their combined surface area is smaller than Central Park, and the lagoon they surround is spread over 103 sq miles. From the window of a low-flying, 68-seat aircraft that flies three times a week to Tuvalu from Fiji, I could only see a part of the atoll, not the whole ring. There were no tall structures visible, no sprawl of cement and no bridges connecting the islets, some of which are completely covered in a huddle of treetops.The population of Tuvalu is just over 11,000 and more than half of the people live on a single islet of Funafuti, called Fongafale. It is a sliver of land eight miles long, with a small airstrip near the centre. After my plane landed, it came to a stop in front of a small airport building. Going through immigration, customs and the exit took about five minutes. Filamona Lodge, one of the four lodging options in the country, where I had booked a room, was less than 100 metres away. It was a two-storey house, in which more than a dozen rooms had been carved out with thin walls. The upper floor was made of planks of wood. The owner-family lived in the back. The open-air restaurant was almost full when I arrived, because the airport has no lounge, and the departing passengers come here to sit, wait and sweat after checking in their luggage.Metia Lotoala, a 30-year-old father of three, with buzzed hair, a goatee and a look of perpetual amusement on his face, showed me to my room. Lotoala grew up in Tuvalu and his family owns the lodge. My room was slightly bigger than the others but the best part, Lotoala told me, was that it was adjacent to a balcony, which overlooked the airstrip. In the evening, I realised what he meant.The widest open area on the islet, the airstrip is an essential part of daily life. After 5pm, when the temperature climbed down, it transformed into a town square. Soccer goalposts and volleyball nets were brought out and placed on the runway. Young men dashed about in trainers and shorts; old men watched them sitting cross-legged on their mopeds. Families laid out picnics on mats made by weaving the leaves of the pandanus tree, which, along with pukas and coconuts, line the edge of the airstrip.View image in fullscreenThe serpentine coastline of Funafuti atoll, February 2004.Photograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty ImagesAt 6.45pm, under an indigo sky, church bells rang out along the main street and all movement on the islet came to a halt. Those walking back home stopped by the side of the streets, mopeds and cars turned off their engines. Like many island-nations in the Pacific, Tuvalu is devoutly Christian. Every evening, 15 minutes are reserved for prayer time. By the side of a road that runs along the airstrip, I chatted with a police officer who had asked me to stop and wait. She told me that there are 132 police personnel in the country, and the last notable crime took place in 2015, when a drunk motorcycle rider ran over someone who was sleeping the night at the airstrip. Sleeping at the airstrip used to be common practice and continues to be permitted; since the accident, cars and mopeds have been banned.Night descended quickly and by 7pm it was dark. Back at the lodge, the plastic chairs of the restaurant were occupied by a couple from Peru, two college students from Hong Kong and an Indian sexologist. A story I heard there, later confirmed by Lotoala, was about a tourist who arrived a few weeks earlier, spent about an hour walking about, then bought a return ticket, and flew back on the same flight he had come on. The tourists I met had been flying around the Pacific and were all heading to their next destination in a couple of days. No one felt they hadn’t spent enough time, no one said they’d be coming back. After a dinner of chicken soup, I asked what had brought them here, to one of the least visited countries in the world. MR Krishna, the Indian sexologist, told me he had come “to see Tuvalu before it disappears”.Acouple of days later, I went to see Simon Kofe. He was almost defensive when I asked him about the Cop27 address. “Everything I said in my speech was backed by science,” he told me, sitting in the porch of his lagoon-facing house, where the video was filmed on a green screen. “If our statehood is permanent and we lose our physical territory, a digital nation is going to be the representation of the sovereign state of Tuvalu.” Kofe reminded me that he had “never used the word ‘metaverse’” in his address. He was surprised to see that “that’s what everyone ran with”.Media outlets, especially those covering technology, have portrayed Tuvalu as a country leaping into a digital future, but in terms of internet accessibility, landing in Tuvalu felt like time-travelling to the mid-2000s. No international telecommunications service has coverage here. The only way to connect to the internet was to buy a sim card from the office of Tuvalu telecom, which opens for a few hours every weekday. A woman handed me a sim card after noting down, by hand, the details of my passport in a long register. The sim card offered 2G speed and sketchy network. It cost more than $10 for two gigabytes of data, and I was unable to load a YouTube clip of Kofe’s famous address. I was told that a few houses had set up Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite internet connection, but it is far out of the financial reach of most locals. In a bid to counter China’s overtures in the region, Japan, Australia and Taiwan, led by the United States, are working out a plan to connect several Pacific states with an undersea internet cable, but completion is years away.“First we will have to bring the internet,” Kofe told me. “It is not something that will happen overnight.”View image in fullscreenAn urban scene at Funafuti atoll.Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Corbis/Getty ImagesIn 2023, the government of Tuvalu amended its constitution to note that “the state of Tuvalu … shall remain in perpetuity in the future”, irrespective “of climate change or other causes resulting in loss to the physical territory”. Since then, Tuvalu has managed to get more than a dozen bilateral partners, including New Zealand and Australia, to formally acknowledge its permanent statehood. The idea has unanimous appeal, and acceptance, across the region, where several other countries’ boundaries are similarly threatened by the climate crisis.In international law, a state is traditionally defined as an entity with four attributes: a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to form relationships with other states. Submersion means Tuvalu will fail to meet the first two criteria. And with this, come other tricky questions. The sale of fishing licences contributes almost half of Tuvalu’s national income – would an underwater but online Tuvalu retain these territorial rights over maritime territory? The government has taken steps, by amending its constitution and securing bilateral agreements, to secure its future sovereignty over the waters – but this may have far-reaching implications for international law, and the commonly understood meaning of statehood itself.“Statehood is a fiction, a legal fiction that we came up with,” says Sumudu Atapattu, the director of the Global Legal Studies Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison law school. In this century, as the climate crisis will scramble the commonly understood meanings of nationhood and sovereignty, the world is going to have to come up with, in Atapattu’s words, “a new fiction”. Digital statehood is an attempt at this redefinition, but at this stage the details are unknown.Recent bilateral agreements with New Zealand and Australia provide residential visas to a few hundred Tuvaluans each year to move to those countries, but a far greater number of locals aspire to emigrate than the 355 who receive these visas every year. In June, when applications opened for the first time for 280 Australian visas to be allocated to Tuvaluans, more than 8,000 people applied. But at the current rate, it will take more than 30 years for everyone to leave Tuvalu, by which time Funafuti, according to government estimates, might be underwater.Grace Malie grew up in Fongafale. For high school she moved to Vaitupu, the largest atoll of Tuvalu, where just over 1,000 people live. Students from all the other islands attend Motufoua secondary school while living with local families in Vaitupu. Malie told me she learned the local dances,faatelein Tuvaluan, from all the eight inhabited islands of Tuvalu, each of which has distinct linguistic dialects and customs. Later, she went to study at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji, moved back to Fongafale, and worked briefly as an assistant to Kofe.In 2023, at the age of 24, Malie visited Cop28 in Dubai as a youth delegate. “I find it kind of hard to accept when I ask people where they are from, and they say, ‘New York’, and I say, ‘The big city!’” she told me. “But when I say, ‘I’m from Tuvalu’, they’re like, ‘Where?’, and I say, ‘In the Pacific’, and they’re like, ‘Where?’, then I say, ‘You know Australia? Hawaii? Yeah. Somewhere in between there.’”Malie said that the people she was talking to probably couldn’t even imagine what Tuvalu looks like.Malie appreciated how Kofe’s speeches were changing that. But she was also disturbed by the image of the virtual islet where Kofe was standing in the 2022 video. “The visuals are for people who are not living here to be able to see, and for us, it is like …” Without finishing that sentence, Malie popped her eyes and retreated into her chair behind outstretched hands. Was it scary to watch? I asked. “Yes,” Malie said. “It brought the reality closer to home.”View image in fullscreenFunafuti’s dumpsite, November 2019.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesI met Malie shortly after she had returned from Cop28 with her friend Tamala Pita, who was sitting with us at the restaurant of Filamona Lodge. As youth delegates, Malie and Pita told me, it was exhausting to talk about erosion, submersion, migration and weave it together with their personal experiences. “It was emotional,” Malie said. “You are talking about losing your home to these strangers, and you think about what you are saying, and you start crying, it is just emotionally draining.” Both Malie and Pita broke down several times during the nine days in Dubai; they consoled each other and were consoled by youth delegates from other developing nations. Both were stunned by the excessive, needless use of indoor lighting and air-conditioning. Pita said: “There were lights on the floor of the metro station! I was like, do you really need that?”Whenever Malie is away, she is always thinking of returning. I asked her what she misses when she is travelling. “Ohh,” she said, letting her shoulders droop. Then, with a burst of energy: “Everything! Being able to sleep with your door open, the wind coming into the house, there is no homelessness here, there is no stress.” Many houses in Tuvalu have openings on all sides, with sloping roofs made of thatch or corrugated iron. Generally, the house is one big hall, where the family sleeps on mattresses on the floor. The bedding is rolled up and put in a corner in the morning, and the hall becomes the living room.What is it like to consider, I asked Malie, that Tuvalu might become uninhabitable in her lifetime. “We need to convey that possibility, but we also want to try to make sure that doesn’t actually happen to us,” she said. It is a difficult balance. Tuvalu is walking a fine line: to get the attention of the world, it must publicise its own disappearance, while doing everything it can to survive. The government of Tuvalu is reclaiming land on the lagoon side, with funds from the UN. That gives Malie hope. So does her religious faith. “We always have journalists coming up and talking about these scientific facts, but then we have to remain true to our fight and our cause and our people, and we have remained resilient and remained hopeful,” she told me. “We’ve said this so many times, but the motto of Tuvalu is ‘Tuvalu mo te Atua’, which means, Tuvalu with God.”Until recently, Tuvalu was best known for its fortuitous top-level domain – .tv. In 1995, a government office in Fongafale received a fax, informing them that Tuvalu’s country code on the world wide web had been assigned. The government officials gathered around the fax, one recalled in 2019, and wondered: “What the hell is this internet thing?” Before long, video platforms wanted URLs ending in .tv, and Tuvalu cashed in. Every streaming company running a website address that ends in .tv, from Amazon to Apple to Hulu to Twitch, pays a licensing fee. Last year, it contributed more than $10m to the country’s $80m revenue. Besides the licences for tuna fishing in its territorial waters, which amount to about $35m, .tv is Tuvalu’s second-largest source of income.Before it became independent in 1978, Tuvalu had been under British rule for almost a century. When independence was looming, it was important to Tuvaluans to not be merged with the Gilbert islands, which became Kiribati. Tito Isala, a septuagenarian with curly white hair, who was part of the committee that negotiated the terms of independence in the 1970s and lived with his wife a few houses down the road from my lodge, told me that Kiribati, which has a surface area of 300 sq miles, would have “swallowed little Tuvalu”. They decided to become an independent country comprising nine atolls, eight of which were inhabited, and adopted the name Tuvalu, which in Tuvaluan means eight standing together.Today, Fongafale, on its less than one sq mile of land, houses more than 6,000 people, and offers them few services. There was no ATM in the country until a few months ago. There are no barbershops; people cut their own hair or wait till their next visit to Fiji. A small garden run by a Taiwanese aid agency is the only source of fresh produce. A bag of vegetables can be bought once or twice a week, at $13 each. Locals catch fish in the lagoon, which is the only source of fresh meat in the country besides pork; neither is available in plenty. The population is sustained by imported food.View image in fullscreenAn aerial shot of Funafuti.Photograph: Tala Simeti/The GuardianA supermarket, a warehouse really, near the north end of the airstrip, accounts for more than 70% of the country’s imports. It sells butter manufactured in California, Japanese washing machines, and sofas of unspecified origins; this is also where everyone buys vegetables, grain and meat. Sacks of rice are piled in one corner. Imported, processed food has disturbed the diet. A quarter of Tuvalu’s population has diabetes.Tuvalu, according to the UN, is among the world’s least-developed countries. On the northern end of Fongafale, just before the point where Kofe made his famous address, there is a huge garbage dump – among the tallest structures on the island – which sometimes combusts spontaneously. On the southern end is a rusted warship, and the stony beach is covered in broken glass and plastic bottles, torn clothes and washed-up Blundstone boots. People who live here feel deeply connected to the place, but even they concede that to see how beautiful Tuvalu is, one must get out of Fongafale, and go to the outer islands. “Too many people live here, that’s the problem,” Lotoala, the motel owner, said to me.One evening in the balcony next to my room, I asked Lotoala what he thought about the threat posed by the climate crisis to Tuvalu. “Do you mean that the islands might drown?” he asked me. When I said yes, he responded: “I don’t think it will happen.” With a boyish, confessional smile, he added: “People don’t like you when you say that. But I don’t think it will happen.”He knew that when the tides run high, around March every year, water seeps through the ground in Fongafale. “But it only happens at that one place,” he said. “It has been happening there since I was a kid.” Lotoala believes that it will be “hundreds” of years before the islands are fully submerged, but he knows that it will become increasingly difficult to continue to live here. “This is what I tell my children: you have to think about moving, about being flexible, you have to have that mindset, you should not get stuck here.”The idea of submersion is not convincing to all the locals. They have seen the erosion of Fongafale before their eyes and are acutely aware of the changing climate, but at the same time, they have also seen atolls grow and gain ground. Tito Isala dismissed all talk of a digital future with a wave of his hand: “It is defeatist, hopeless.” Nor was he excited about the idea of Tuvaluans settling on foreign shores. “We do not want to relocate,” he said. “Where are we going to go? New Zealand?” Isala said. “How do they treat the Māori?” He gave me another hypothetical. “America? Who wants to deal with their Trumps and Bidens?”Isala opened an iron chest in his living room and pulled out a large, laminated, navigational map of Funafuti. He unrolled it on the top of the trunk. “The islets make the shape of a human face in profile; we are here, at the back of the head,” he said, pointing to Fongafale. “Here we have lost land.” Then he pointed to the chin on the map, at an islet of Funafuti called Motuloa. “Motuloa has grown its landmass,” Isala said.The local understanding of the adaptability of the atolls is backed up by some scientific data. When Malie had told me submersion “is a possibility”, she wasn’t simply dismissing the projections of sea level rise by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “The signs are very clear, especially from the IPCC reports,” Malie said. “But then you have other science, which is uncertain, which says it [submersion] might happen, it mightnothappen.”This “other science” is mainly based on the work of Paul Kench, a coastal geomorphologist who has studied shoreline changes in the Maldives, Fiji, the Marshall Islands, the Great Barrier Reef, Kiribati and Tuvalu. Kench studied coastal changes and physical geography of islands at the University of Auckland, then did his PhD at the University of New South Wales, where his dissertation was on atolls in the Indian Ocean. When we spoke on Zoom, Kench was in Singapore, where he is a professor in the department of geography at the National University. Kench has amassed a significant body of work to show that rising sea level does not necessarily mean the submersion of low-lying atolls. The projections of Tuvalu’s disappearance assume that atoll islands are static structures. Kench’s work shows that they are instead dynamic entities that are constantly transforming themselves, even gaining landmass.View image in fullscreenLooking into the centre of the Funafuti lagoon.Photograph: Kalolaine Fainu/The GuardianUsing data from aerial images going back to the second world war, Kench showed that in the past four decades, while sea level rose in Tuvalu twice as fast the global average, total land area slightly increased, by 2.9%. The greatest gains were made by the islands of Vaitupu and Nanumaga. Fongafale itself had gained 4.6 hectares in the past four decades, even as the locals were watching both tips of the islet being eroded before their eyes. In 2018, Kench published another paper with two other researchers, which is the most comprehensive analysis of Tuvalu’s coastal changes. The paper showed that 73 of the 101 islets analysed had accreted surface area amounting to 80.7  hectares. The remaining 28 had eroded, losing 7.24 hectares in total. These changes happen through a combination of factors. The reef is continuing to produce sediment, Kench told me, and the waves are continuing to deposit crusts of reef that break away from the vast rim.Kench’s work has been used by conservative thinktanks and climate change deniers – or what Kench refers to as “that idiotic part of society” – to raise doubts about sea level rise. “You can’t control it,” Kench said, with the weariness of a man who has for years been dealing with such misinformation. “You can’t control what those maniacs do.” Kench does not dispute that sea levels are rising and that this is a result of human-made climate breakdown. But he maintains that when it comes to atoll islands, “a lot of the gloom and doom scenarios are based on emotive, or intuitive, reasoning.”When I asked Kofe about Kench’s work, he said that the government finds it “inconclusive”. Kench can appreciate the tricky spot Tuvalu finds itself in, but he feels his work could have been used differently. “We got a lot of criticism,” he said, “because it didn’t really show what they wanted it to.” The government of Tuvalu accused him, Kench told me, “of undermining Tuvalu’s international negotiations”. He was surprised by the vehemence of the reaction. “They could have said, ‘We are going be living here in our country, but our lands are changing around us in ways that we are only starting to understand, and we are going to need a lot of help.’” But that does not make for, Kench admitted, “a sexy headline”.Kench emphasised to me that he was not an expert on habitability. “Land is only one part of that metric,” he told me. “I stick to my lane.” But he is astonished by how little attention has been given to the physical islands amid the rising sea. “Over the last 30 years, agencies have been very happy to spend hundreds of millions [of dollars] in measuring sea level rise,” Kench said. “But they’ve spent zero on actually measuring the thing that they keep saying is going to disappear because of sea level rise.”Iwent to see Fualifeke, a tiny islet at the top of the forehead on Isala’s map, which has gone through a strange mutation over the past few decades. While its shore had been severely eroded on the lagoon side, it had gained almost the same amount of ground on the sea side.Getting to the outer islets is not easy. There are no boats waiting in the lagoon to ferry you about. A day before the trip, I had to find someone with a boat and then hope for good weather. Lotoala set it up. But on the day we were supposed to leave, he told me that though we had the boat, the man who had promised to take us couldn’t be found. We decided to go for a few hours anyway. It was a burning hot afternoon, though the temperature was only 30C. It was not the sticky heat of New Delhi, where I lived for a decade in summer temperatures of over 40C, but equally sapping.Sun shone in a blue sky; clouds streaked the horizon. We poured water on the aluminium surface of the boat for a few minutes before sitting down. There was no padding on the seats, and the bare surface would have scalded the skin. When we were done dousing, Lotoala sat on the bow, his cousin at the stern. I was joined in the middle by the students from Hong Kong and Krishna, the Indian sexologist. The lagoon water was comparatively placid, but our small boat was soon seesawing as it moved across patches of emerald and cobalt water. When frigate birds flew by the boat, my co-passengers hooted with excitement.When we reached the islet after about half an hour, there was one house, a few hundred coconut trees and a dazzling bank made up of what looked like white gravel, but turned out to be tiny, pearly bits of coral reef. We swam in some shallow patches of water but only for a few minutes. The heat was exhausting. I saw the Hong Kong students clamber out of the warm water, squinting. The bleached reef was impossible to stand on without footwear. We all walked into the trees to find sand and shade.Everyone took long breaths and drank from a tank that collected rainwater. Lotoala climbed a sloping trunk with a big knife and tossed down green coconuts. Each of us had many coconuts. We poured cool, sweet water into our mouths, then cut them open to scrape out the flesh inside. We sat down, facing the sea, and Lotoala happily pointed out where the shape of the island had changed. He said that the area covered by chip stones in front of us was not there until a few years ago. “It just happens,” he said, enjoying the incomprehension on my face. The previous day, we had talked about the projections of Tuvalu’s submersion: “I don’t know if it will,” he said. “You can never be sure about nature.”View image in fullscreenA satellite view of Funafuti.Photograph: Universal Images Group North America LLC/AlamyOn our way back, no one spoke a word, the heat had drained us. I could easily recognise Fongafale from miles away, with a dark trail of smoke rising from the garbage dump, into the blue sky. When we came back to the lodge, Lotoala told me that when he was growing up, the heat wasn’t this bad. He was wagging his finger at the airstrip, which was baking under the sun without a patch of shade. “We used to play there in the afternoons.” The heat is worse on Fongafale than perhaps any other islet of Funafuti, he said, primarily because of the airstrip: no other atoll has so great an area of asphalt exposed to the sun. Everyone complains passionately about the rising temperature.When I took a walk one afternoon, the heat pinned me down within minutes and seemed to rise out of the ground. The sun was directly above, shadows were small, and Fongafale had the look of a ghost town. People had receded indoors. Hapless tourists stood by the side of the road waving at the occasional passing moped, requesting a lift to their accommodation. When I crossed the white-hot airstrip, where Lotoala used to kick a football at this hour, I wondered if the rubber soles of my sandals were sticking to the ground. In the restaurant at the lodge, Lotoala found me gulping down water and sweating profusely. He laughed heartily when I explained, and said: “Boss, you do not take a walk at 2pm!” The heat, Lotoala believes, might make it impossible to live in Funafuti long before water takes over the land. His mother, sitting nearby, nodded in agreement.Ihad arrived in Tuvalu at the time of a national election, hoping to find the usual ferment around the time of voting. But the election means a lull in Fongafale. The ferry to the outer islands wasn’t running, the government building was empty, and there were no rallies or speeches. Tuvalu has no political parties. The cabinet is made up of two representatives from each of the eight inhabited islands, who vote for a prime minister among them. All candidates had returned to the islands, and the sofas in the lobby of the government building, which has decent internet, were occupied by kids spending their afternoons playing games on their smartphones.While voting was ongoing at different community halls in Fongafale, a group of young men were downing cans of Filipino beer in a yard by a small house. I joined them. They were a boisterous bunch, who had attended high school or university in New Zealand and Australia. When I told them I was from India, they wanted to know how to pronounce the names of some Indian cricketers who had recently toured Auckland and Sydney. It delighted them that I could name the cricket grounds in those cities; one of them, who had studied in Brisbane, broke out in a little dance when I said: “the Gabba!” With glazed eyes, they told me about the tall buildings, the glittering streets, the nightlife. Everything about those cities gladdened them and they spoke of their time there with longing and excitement. They wanted to go back, but they weren’t sure how.Unlike Lotoala, who runs his own lodge, or Grace, who works with the government, these men, like many others in Tuvalu, hear the siren song of the great cities of Oceania, which present them with opportunities for a life that is not accessible to them in Fongafale. This yearning exhibits itself in the thousands of people who apply each year for the Pacific Access Category visa which has granted 75 Tuvaluans residential rights in New Zealand each year since 2019.How to move a country: Fiji’s radical plan to escape rising sea levelsRead moreIn 2023, Tuvalu signed theFalepili Union treatywith Australia, which stipulated “a special human mobility pathway for citizens of Tuvalu” to migrate to Australia and millions of dollars in aid; in exchange, Tuvalu must consult on defence and security matters before engaging with other nations. When signed, in November 2023, the treaty was seen as an overture by the United States to counter China’s investments in the Pacific states,like Vanuatu. But the part of the treaty that most concerned locals was that Australia will award 280 Tuvaluans residential visas every year through a ballot system, and the beneficiaries will receive the same health, education, housing, and employment rights enjoyed by Australian citizens. Additionally, Tuvaluans will retain the ability to return to their home country. It has been publicised as a “climate visa” by the international press, but the reasons for the widespread appeal of immigration are also economic.When I called Lotoala in August, he told me that he wasn’t among the Tuvaluans who had applied for the Australian visa, but he wasn’t surprised that every third person in Tuvalu wants to “have this opportunity”. “I have a business,” he told me. “I can work here and feed my family and live a comfortable life. But maybe 1% of people here, 100 families, can afford such a life. What we earn is not what normal people earn. Most people have no way to make money. Most work you can find pays A$5 per hour.” Lotoala mentioned that over the past months, tourists from the US and Europe have expressed to him their shock at the prices of daily essentials in the shops. “Even we feel the pressure every now and then,” he added. “Life here can get very tough.”Lotoala said that more and more people are feeling “stuck” in Tuvalu. Moving to Australia, or New Zealand for that matter, seems like a way out. “If I didn’t have a business, I’d take my family to Australia, find a job and level up from there,” he said. “It is like a new opportunity, to build a new life.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readTuvaluPacific islandsAsia PacificClimate aidClimate crisisFloodingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They must perform utterly archaic feats of memory in their exams and then embark on an academic experience that has almost nothing to do with real life. Their reward may be a higher income, but perhaps not higher than their innate ability would have gained them anyway.England’s present university system is in a terrible mess, chronically in need of a royal commission. Between 1997 and 2010, university student numbersincreased by 68%. Then, under the coalition government, universities were offered £9,000 a yearfor each of an unlimited number of students. It was an open invitation to lower standards and increase overcrowding.Some cities found themselves with two if not three universities, with multiple campuses, student residences and overheads to match. The waste was ludicrous. Their vice-chancellors received crazy sums. The average for the Russell group isnow £400,000.The government supposedly recouped the cost of all this by treating fees and maintenance grants as borrowed. This allowed university extravagance to appear not as public spending but as debt, on the thesis that the students would repay it with interest one day. Until recentlyno more than a quarterof graduates were expected to fully repay their loans – small wonder, as they averaged£50,000 a head.The accumulated student debt is enormous. It has reached more than £250bn and is said to beheading for £500bnby the late 2040s. Quite why higher education should be so privileged as not to count as current spending has never been clear. As with HS2, the Treasury likes to treat certain sorts of posh spending as “investment” rather than hard cash.The reliance on fees from overseas students – now coveringnearly a quarterof university income – caused the present crisis. As thisincome has fallen,in part through recent immigration and visa changes, 40% of England’s universities are set to be infinancial deficit. Jobs and courses are being cut back.Meanwhile, every bit of news out of the university sector seems grim. Employers are disregarding not just classes of degree, but degrees at all. It is 10 years since the large accountancy firm EY started disregardingA-levels and degree classesin recruitment, while PwC said it would rely on aptitude and behaviour tests. I know of no job that ever depends on a class of degree. The Office for National Statistics records thatmore than a quarterof graduates in England are now in medium- or low-skilled jobs. Another survey shows the graduate“premium” is plummeting. This is not just a British issue. Across the US and the EU, graduate unemployment is almoston a parwith non-graduate.Students seem miserable. The two-thirds who leave home to go to college report soaring mental illness, with 90% suffering from loneliness. The Boston Consulting Group last year found ex-students thefastest groupof young people going straight into long-term sickness.Tuition fees are rising again and nobody is happy – it’s time to actually fix our broken university sector | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThe solution is glaring: cut back. The thesis that university courses requirea minimum of three years, each with barely six months of teaching, is absurd. For most courses, two years should be enough, as the former universities minister, Jo Johnson,has proposed. The number of institutions claiming fully-fledged university status should be slashed. The practice of almost every city hosting two universities – or 40 in London – should end in a mass of mergers. There should be a return to vocational colleges, with an emphasis on contact with local employment.This was proposed by James Dyson in setting up just such a college in Wiltshire, the Dyson Institute, in 2017. Another, the New Model Institute for Technology and Engineering in Herefordshire, was started by the Tory MP Jesse Norman. It is simply absurd that a large number of graduates should be doing work supposedly not requiring a degree, and yet the welfare state is chronically short of trained medical and care staff. This is a serious failure of education planning.Higher education should be free at the point of use; not, as now, free only to those whose parents can pay their fees upfront. But those completing a university course should repay the privilege with a modestly higher rate of tax throughout their working life. Loans should cover only maintenance.Of course university is not just a preparation for work, even if for 18-year-olds that is the primary issue at hand. A university is more than a start in life. It is also an experience of liberal education that goes far beyond the young who are its current beneficiaries.A true university should promote breadth of thought and freedom of speech to old as well as young. It should not turn in on itself as its resources shrink. It should make its courses and work accessible to people beyond its walls and across the community.Universitiesare costing us dear. We should not feel they are wasted on the young.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUniversitiesOpinionHigher educationStudent financeStudentsA-levelscommentShareReuse this content"

The nationalism was the problemMartin KettleMany of her admirers gloss over her desire to break up the UK as Scotland’s first minister. But in her open and touching memoir, it plays a starring roleThu 14 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 10.26 EDTShareNicola Sturgeon was – and still is – important, talented, personable and, to many, inspirational. She was also extremely lucky and often wrong, sometimes seriously so. There are examples of all these qualities in hernewly published memoir, Frankly. Sturgeosceptics should concede at once that it contains much that is fascinating, especially about her relations with her charismatic mentor turned vengeful enemy Alex Salmond. Starry-eyed Sturgies should equally admit she made several deep and lasting errors that have left behind a divided nationalist party and movement.The book is more open and touching about private issues than most political memoirs, although Sturgeon deploys these qualities selectively. Many of the intimate reflections are about being a woman in politics. Other memoirs by female politicians – including those of Margaret Thatcher, Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel – leave such subjects alone.Sturgeon does not. She writes about her relationships, her miscarriage, her sexuality and her menopause. Yet to me, the single most affecting sentence in the book comes near the end, when she describesher resignationin 2023. “In short,” she writes, in words that should be pondered by male and female rulers alike, “I was exhausted.”After Sturgeon’s years of power, who would not have been? From the moment she joined the Scottish National party as a teenager, Sturgeon built a career at the most demanding and, for nationalists, the headiest time in modern Scottish history. She was a parliamentarian, a minister, deputy leader and then leader of her party, and finally Scotland’s first minister from 2014 to 2023. Roy Jenkins wrote long ago that eight years at the top is as much as anyone should be permitted in the full-on world that is modern politics, and Sturgeon’s career proves him right.You can quibble, as some people have, about whether being Scotland’s first minister is really as important and demanding as being a US president or a UK prime minister. Clearly it is not. However, after what the self-confessed workaholic Sturgeon had already crammed in, she was surely right to get out two years ago and prepare for the rest of her life. She is still only 55, and she is entitled to use this book as a pivot from the old to the new, whatever that may be.Just don’t idealise her, that’s all. The most important thing about Sturgeon’s political career is not whether she was relatable, good on television or better than the men. Pretty obviously, she was all three. It is whether she was right to be a nationalist. In my book, she was wrong. From her teenage years, Sturgeon’s overriding political goal has been to break up the United Kingdom. It still is.Many of her admirers, especially in England, ignore this fact. But it cannot be ignored, in part because everything else that she did in politics was always ultimately subordinate to it, and in part because, even now, her cause may yet win in the years ahead if British parties and governments allow it to happen.Sturgeon’s great political talent was her ability to ride the waves of change. Talent was part of that. But good luck also played a huge role. The first major example of this came in 2004, when she over-ambitiously threw her hat into the ring to become SNP leader in a contest most observers thought she would lose. Who knows where the story would have ended if she had fought on? Over a private dinner in Linlithgow, however, Salmond told Sturgeon that he was planning to enter the contest, and proposed a pact in which she wouldrun as deputyand eventually succeed him. Labour was already haemorrhaging votes as a result of the Iraq war. In 2007 the duo took the SNP to power at Holyrood.Sturgeon quickly became the most popular politician in Scotland. In 2011, the SNP won an unprecedented overall majority. Her second big stroke of luck, nevertheless, was the defeat of the 2014 independence referendum. Salmondresigned in the aftermath, leaving Sturgeon as his unchallengeable successor. SNP membership soared. What could have been a hospital pass was instead a coronation.A few months later, it got even better. At the 2015 general election, the SNP captured all but three of Scotland’s Westminster seats. Then came Brexit, opposed by the majority of voters in Scotland. This presented the nationalists with a perfect platform to claim that the union was denying Scotland its will. While the Tories became obsessed with Brexit, and Labour turned in on itself, Sturgeon was able to pitch Scotland as a nation that marched to a different and more progressive drum, and to follow the pro-European path.But the SNP did not have things all its own way. True, the party remained dominant. Electorally speaking, Sturgeon could have titled her book Undefeated. True also, Sturgeon managed to keep the prospect of a second referendum simmering without boiling over. But in other respects the Scottish political and economic landscape was getting far tougher for the SNP.There were rows about Lockerbie, on which Sturgeon’s book is informative, and about Hebridean ferry contracts and overruns andScotland’s drug problems– topics on which she has next to nothing to say. Sturgeon’s unequivocal pledge in 2016 to eliminate the educational attainment gap between children from rich and poor neighbourhoods in the next decade is skated over too. Her account of the court case against Salmond is nothing if not bitter. Her gender recognition reforms were dogmatic and divisive. Her legacy in many respects is division, and perhaps fiscal unsustainability. The reminder in Wednesday’s Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report that Scotland’s public spending deficit has widened even further than in the UK as a whole is a timely counterpoint to Sturgeon’s version of history.But the greatest gift that the gods ever presented to Sturgeon and the SNP came in 2019: Boris Johnson’s accession to the UK prime ministership. Sturgeon did not have to make an argument against Johnson. She could merely let people observe the contrast between his sloppiness and her precision, and let them judge for themselves. It would have been the same with Liz Truss, if she had lasted.Sturgeon used every lever to imply that Scotland was handling the pandemic better than the wider UK. To many in Scotland and in England, the contrast marked Sturgeon’s apotheosis. In England, some yearned to have Sturgeon in charge south of the border too, and had done so during the Cameron and May years as well.Yet this was to fundamentally misread Sturgeon. It was a misreading that she was smart enough to encourage. Hers is an interesting account. But it is not the full story. She was not seeking to be the negation of Johnson or Truss. Her aim was to be the negation of the union. It is on this that she should be judged, by nationalists and anti-nationalists alike. By that yardstick her career has – frankly – been a failure.

Motorists rightly complain of the damage caused to their vehicles. Cyclists risk serious injury every time they mount their bikes.Increased road use from a rising population is one reason for the problem. Cuts to repair budgets are another. Fixing the problem will be expensive, with one estimateputting the costof mending potholes in England and Wales at a hefty £17bn.Complaints about the state of the roads have made governments reluctant to arouse the ire of motoring lobby groups by raising fuel excise duty – the tax paid at the pump on fuel. The last chancellor to do so was Alistair Darling 15 years ago. The cumulativecost to the exchequerof the freezes and cuts to fuel duty since 2010 is put at £130bn – a colossal sum given the struggle governments have had to balance the books during that time.In reality, the days are numbered for fuel duty. Of the 34mvehicles on the UK’s roads,1.6m are fully electric, but that figure will rise steadily over time. Once petrol and diesel vehicles are phased out completely, the£24.4bn currently raisedfrom fuel duty will dwindle to zero. That represents a sizeable and permanent hit to the public finances.Rachel Reeves has more immediate things to worry about. The weakness of the economy means the chancellor is at grave risk of breaking her self-imposed rule that day-to-day government spending should be matched by tax receipts. Reeves fears that breaking the rule would incur the wrath of the financial markets, while cutting spending would incur the wrath of Labour MPs. So she is scrabbling around for tax increases that don’t break Labour’s manifesto commitment not to raise the rates of income tax, VAT or employee national insurance contributions.This is not going to be easy.One estimate last weeksaid Reeves will need to find more than £50bn to stick to her fiscal rule with a reasonable margin for error. Even though other forecasts suggest the figure may be lower than that, there will still be difficult choices to make.Faced with these pressures, Reeves should do two things. First, she should end the freeze on fuel duty, which has been kept in place no matter whether the cost of petrol and diesel is high or low. It is not just that Reeves could well do with the several billion pounds that a rise in fuel duty would harvest. Fuel duty is now a third lower, in real terms, than it was when Darling was at the Treasury, effectively cutting the cost of motoring and so creating incentives to drive more. Increased congestion and the potholed roads are consequences of that.The stated rationale for the protracted freeze since 2010 is that it helps hard-pressed motorists, but the main beneficiaries have not been white-van man but the better off, who drive more, own more vehicles and buy gas-guzzling SUVs. The richest fifth of householdshave benefited twice as muchfrom the fuel duty freeze as the poorest fifth. Raising fuel duty in the budget should be a no-brainer for Reeves.But the chancellor also needs to come up with a plan for what to do once the era of all-electric vehicles finally arrives, and here there is an obvious solution: road pricing. Conceptually, there should be little problem with this idea. People expect to pay more for a train journey in rush hours. Hotels charge more for rooms on a Friday or Saturday when demand is higher. The same principle should apply to roads.There are reasons why ministers are reluctant to grasp this nettle. Fuel duty, while a regressive tax, is easy to understand. There are no issues with privacy and surveillance, as there would be with road pricing. Governments are sensitive to charges that they are planning to wage war on motorists. Given that only 5% of vehicles are electric currently, the transition may take longer than originally envisaged. No question, doing nothing has its attractions.But the costs of inaction will grow over time. A report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI)said the lossof tax revenue from cars would be £10bn by 2030, £20bn by 2035 and £30bn by 2040. This would inevitably lead to chunky tax increases. Reducing the cost of motoring by continually freezing fuel duty would lead to more and longer traffic jams. Those still driving petrol and diesel vehicles would face a triple whammy: spending longer in traffic; paying higher taxes elsewhere to compensate for the lost fuel-duty revenue from those who transferred to electric vehicles; and paying three to four times more for tax and fuel than those who drive EVs.Why is Labour so afraid to admit that we must tax the rich? | Andy BeckettRead moreThe TBI report outlined the four ways road pricing might work. Drivers could face a flat-rate charge for each mile they drive; costs could vary according to geographic area or specific roads, with costs increased in areas where congestion was higher; road users could be charged for each minute they spend driving; and finally an “Uberised” model, where charges vary dynamically on the road used and the time of travel. Technically, it would be possible to make any of the approaches – or a combination of them – work.It speaks volumes that the report was published four years ago this month, since when inertia has reigned supreme. That needs to change because the do-nothing option is really no option at all.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFuel dutyOpinionTaxLabourTax and spendingPetrol pricesMotoringRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t worry, he didn’t deport it, he cooked one for breakfast. Then he sat down with Katie Miller to tell her all about his baking skills in the very first episode of her brand-new podcast. Which, by the way, I have heroically listened to all 44 excruciating minutes of so that you don’t have to.Miller, for the uninitiated, is a Maga bigwig and married to Stephen Miller,Donald Trump’s far-right chief of staff and a man so odious his own uncle once wrote an article calling him a “hypocrite”.A Trump loyalist, Miller has form when it comes to surrounding herself with odious men: she held top communications jobs during Trump’s first term and, earlier this year, became a spokesperson for Elon Musk’s pet project, the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).In May, she absconded to amysterious roleat Musk’s private ventures. I imagine that she was attracted to Musk’s views on free speech (summed up as: I can say whatever I fancy but you can’t) because it’s been reported that when Miller was in university she once stole and threw away student newspapers because she didn’t like thepolitician they endorsed.Now, she’s launched theKatie Miller Podcast, the first episode of which came out on Monday. Why jump from the highest echelons of government into podcasting? According to Miller,it’s because“as a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full-time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself”.In a promo video, in which she sits cross-legged on an armchair (with shoes on!) in front of a bookshelf with three books on it, including The Great Gatsby and To Kill a Mockingbird, she explains that “there isn’t a place for conservative women to gather online” and she wanted to create a space to have “real honest conversations” about what matters to women.Apparently what matters to women is the minutiae of vice-president Vance’s life: the first 44-minute episode, which I suggest she renameBrief Interviews with Hideous Men, was devoted to fawning over a man who hassaidprofessional women “choose a path to misery” when they prioritize careers over children.Miller’s podcast is yet another reminder that Republicans are doing a far better job of spreading their talking points on new media than the DemocratsMiller, who is not a natural host, awkwardly serves softball questions (“is a hotdog a sandwich?”) while Vance drones on about what a great daddy and vice-president he is and how much he loves ice-cream and joking around with Marco Rubio. The closest they get to a controversial topic is Vance talking about all the memes he’s inspired and saying that one of his favourites features the pope, Usha Vance and a couch. (There have been online jokes that Vance wasintimate with a couchand that hekilled the pope.) There is also light mockery of Late Show host Stephen Colbert, whose show recently gotcancelled.Other than the memes, the most memorable moment of the episode is when Miller seems to imply that her husband subsists entirely on a diet of mayonnaise, like some sort of anaemic vampire. Stephen Miller also apparently runs around his house with his shoes on, as does JD. Usha, sensibly, takes her shoes off at the front door. All of this is exactly the sort of content I’m sure the busy mums are desperate for.Miller has said she thinks there is a gap in the market for podcasts aimed at conservative women, but the market says otherwise. While young women in the UStend to be progressive, there is a thriving “womanosphere” of anti-feminist media aimed at conservatives. Some of these outlets don’t explicitly cater to young conservative mums in the way that the Katie Miller Podcast says it does, but they’re still aiming for the same general demographic.Gen Z commentatorBrett Cooper, for example, who has 1.6 million YouTube subscribers, looks atpop culturewith a rightwing slant and her show attracts conservative female listeners. In between hot takes on Justin Bieber, Cooper argues that feminism’s goal is to “make men angry and dominate them”, a worldview that recently got her a gig at Fox News. Then there’s Candace Owens, a conservative conspiracy theorist who recently turned on Maga over the JeffreyEpstein filesfiasco. Owens has 4.57 millionsubscribers on YouTubeand her streams get millions of views. Bari Weiss also has a successful podcast and is currently in talks to sell her “anti-woke” media startup The Free Press for more than $200m to CBS News. The Financial Timesrecently reported: “Weiss has won over [CBS owner David Ellison] partly by taking a pro-Israel stance … as well as her ability to build a younger, digitally savvy audience.”Then, of course, you’ve got all thetrending “tradwife” contenton TikTok, where creators such asEstee WilliamsandGwen the Milkmaidglorify traditional gender roles. Beyond tradwives, there’s an ecosystem of lifestyle content aimed at young women that camouflages rightwing messages. Think: makeup tutorials with a running commentary about how feminism will make you miserable. Canadian media outlet Global News recently obtaineda report prepared byCanada’s Integrated Threat Assessment Centre that warns female “extremist influencers” are using popular online platforms to radicalize and recruit women.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sure, the Katie Miller Podcast isn’t an “official” White House podcast, but the humanizing interview with Vance, along with Miller’s deep Maga ties, suggest it is very much Trump-approved. In an interview with theWashington Postpublished on Tuesday, Miller also insinuated that her podcast is a voter recruitment drive for 2028. “In order to cultivate the future of Maga, we have to talk to women,” she said.As the Republicans stretch their tentacles further into the world of podcasting and TikTok, Democrats are stilldesperatelyjumping oncringememes to appeal to a younger audience while flailing around writing long policy documents about how they can spend millions of dollars manufacturing a “Joe Rogan of the left”. The Katie Miller Podcast may not end up being a hit, but it’s just one small part of a very effective Republican messaging strategy.Of course, the really important issue here – the question I’m sure you’re pondering right now – is whether the veep thinks a hotdog is a sandwich? The answer is: definitely not.

Unfortunately, what a lot of viewers have been asking is why it was inflicted on the public in the first place. Is War of the Worlds “one of the worst movies ever made?”,asked the BBC. “Shockingly bad War of the Worlds is one of the worst movies of the decade,”said the New York Post.“Amazon’s War of the Worlds update should never have been released,”declared the Telegraph.The 2005 adaptation, starring Tom Cruise, was a smash hit. Now people are flocking to the remake to see just how bad a film can be – it’s in the top 10 films watched in the UK and US on Amazon Prime. It seems that we have come to love “bad” films almost as much as those deemed good. The website Rotten Tomatoes practically celebrates films that garner a 0% approval rating: Roberto Benigni’sPinocchio, reborn in2002 asan Italian fantasy comedy-drama, is one such offender; Look Who’s Talking Now in 1993, starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, replaced talking babies with talking dogs and was slated; while Travolta hit rock bottom in2018 with Gotti, a movie about the New York mobster that was so gloriously awful it was nominated for six Razzies, the parody prize bestowed on Hollywood’s biggest cinematic failures, including worst actor and worst picture.But Hollywood has no exclusive hold on the movie clunker machine.Bollywoodhas vast audiences both within India and outside. In 2023, it generated revenues of $1.3bn, securing its own chunk of the global movie market – and its own flops. In both cases, the biggest pitfalls seem to come with attempting to remake much-loved classics.Bollywood tried its own movie version ofthe US favourite TV sitcom The Archie Show, and really shouldn’t have.The Archies, as the Indian version was called, featured wooden acting and misguided casting, not helped by controversy over the recruitment ofnepo babiesof already huge Bollywood actors such as Suhana Khan (daughter of Shah Rukh Khan) and Agastya Nanda. Some thought it engaging; most preferred not to think about it.View image in fullscreenThe cast of The Archies, the Bollywood remake of US TV sitcom The Archie Show.Photograph: Manpreet Singh/Netflix/Courtesy of NetflixJab Harry Met Sejal was a remake of the popular When Harry met Sally. Its director, Imtiaz Ali, is usually lauded for his captivating storytelling – but not this time. “A weak, meandering, near dishonest and awfully misrepresentative film,”was one critic’s verdict. In his review, he wrote a lot about the interval and his journey to the toilet.But whether it is made in Hollywood or Bollywood, a bad film, no matter how boring, unrealistic or slow-paced, can still have value. The Archies led to discourse on nepo babies in Bollywood film, and for all its narratorial difficulties Jab Harry Met Sejal allowed Arijit Singh to perform his magic with hit song Hawayein.Animal, released in 2023, caused an outpouring of condemnation as Ranbir Kapoor’s character consistently and crassly played on the belief that male dominance and female submission in a relationship is normal and necessary. It was bad, really bad – but the national conversation that ensued also educated audiences to became more aware and more critical of other films that also lauded misogyny. When I returned to the movie Ghilli, a Kollywood classic (Kollywood being the informal name for Tamil cinema) that I loved as a kid, I couldn’t help but question why the story continues romantically, without question, after the heroine is slapped by the supposed love of her life.Even notoriously bad movies have the capacity to sharpen our sense of critique. The outrage you feel at a film like Animal heightens your sensitivities, and perhaps your recognition of wrongdoing in real life.Jeans, controversy, used bathwater: Sydney Sweeney’s selling it all.

Had I not watched it, I would not have had the story to tell; or the opportunity to discuss this and rather better horror films with friends.Bad films lead to dialogue, which almost inevitably opens a space for better ideas and new discourse. And failing that, at least a passionate rant about all the other better horror films, allowing people to enjoy a shared rage instead of turning against each other.Is there anything to learn from Ice Cube’s War of the Worlds? Perhaps it’s that some films made during Covid are better left there. Or that “bad” comes in many forms, that “bad” is in the eye of the beholder. Or perhaps it’s just that bad art has merit in ways the creator may not have intended.

Let me show you the horror of a single dayOleksandr MykhedThe rumble, the explosions and the deaths: they are so frequent that they seem normal. It’s a fight to protect our homes, our cities and the psycheThu 14 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 15.16 EDTShareDay 1,254 of the invasion; 31 July 2025, Kyiv, 4.30am. The air-raid alarm started again just a moment ago. I wake up from the roar and rumble of rockets. It’s a sound that makes you want to flee in primeval terror.Time slows down. I roll over on the bed, embrace my girlfriend Dasha, make another half-turn and we drop down softly to the floor. I am not thinking or reflecting, I’m guided by instinct – move away from the windows, position our silhouettes as low as possible. I cover Dasha with my body. All she has time to ask for is: “The doggie? Where’s the dog?” From under the bed, we can hear the rustling of our old chihuahua’s paws.FiveIskander-K cruise missilesare falling from the sky. One after another. Like gigantic knives, striking between the ribs of the city. A deadly force that cannot be stopped. The sounds of explosions are coming from different parts of the city, enveloping us in total helplessness. There is no hiding from this.Two hours before the shelling, I laid out my clothes and placed my emergency bag in the hallway. Just in case. It was not a rational decision based, for example, on warnings from analytical groups. But you can feel the shelling coming. It will happen today or tomorrow. Thousands of little Russians, who “have no influence over anything”, and will repeat at the tribunals the convenient narrative that this is “Putin’s war”, have already manufactured newShahed dronesand missiles.According to Russia’s new tactics, every night it first sends hundreds of the drones to one or several Ukrainian cities, thus exhausting the air defences, destroying civilian infrastructure and terrorising civilians. And then Russian missiles fly right after them and finish off the city that is already bleeding out.On that day at the end of July, the all-clear siren after the Shahed attack sounded at 3.18am, after four and a half hours of explosions. After the all-clear, Kyiv residents who had been hiding in shelters and the metro stations returned home to sleep off the exhausting night. Having waited for an hour and anticipating maximum losses, the Russians launched a missile attack on the slumbering city.In the fourth year of the invasion, I don’t know how to write about the shelling of my home town. Photos of destroyed buildings on social media no longer have the power to shock. The subject matter and angles of the photos have become ordinary.But if our empathy has indeed worn to the nub, why does it still hurt so much? It hurts because it feels as though the number of Russian shellings devalues the grief and loss associated with each attack. Russia’s actions reinforce the idea that this is now the new normality inUkraine.I don’t know how to write about these attacks, but I know for sure that things have got worse.Statistics show that last year, during July 2024, Russia launched just over 400 drones over Ukraine. A year later, in July of this year, it launched more than6,400 drones and missiles.Looking at theinfographicthat visualises this comparison and trying to comprehend the absurd figure of an increase of almost 1,380%, I am lost for words.Now there are so many Russian drones that they are dismantling the smallest components of infrastructure. It feels like if this were a game of Battleship they would have already destroyed the two-deck ships. And, of course, they are deliberately destroying residential high-rise buildings with civilians inside.We know exactly when the situation got worse: after Donald Trump came to power. For the Trump 2.0 world, an unsubstantiated promise of peace is already equivalent to peace. But the war did not stop for a moment. It got worse. The Ukrainian data journalism websiteTexty.org.ua analysedRussian missile and Shahed strikes on 12 frontline and neighbouring regions after Trump’s inauguration. Two months before, the Odesa region was struck twice; two months after, there were more than two dozen strikes.TheUN reportsthat in June 2025, Ukraine recorded the highest number of civilian casualties for three years – 232 people were killed and another 1,343 wounded. Civilians were killed or wounded in Kyiv and at least 16 other regions. In the first half of 2025, the total number of civilians killed and injured was 6,754: 54% more than in the same period of the last year.And the same thing is happening on the ground, where the infantry is digging in. Where the frontline is. According to the DeepState monitoring group, which analyses changes on the frontline, Russia has takenalmost 1,300 sq kmof Ukrainian territory in the first five months of this year. In June alone, it secured a hold over556 sq kmof Ukrainian territory. How much is that? Imagine that in six months the Russians captured an area larger than Greater London. Or in June alone they took over the territory equivalent to five Parises.The Trump administration has broughtRussia back to the table, initiating talks with a terrorist country. But in Russia’s eyes, the west in general and Trump in particular constantly demonstrate weakness. The Kremlin understands only strength, and if its political opponents are unable to implement any of their threats, Russia will expand its political, economic and informational foothold. And its strategic communications – missiles and Shaheds – will speak for themselves.On that single day in July, Russia launched 309 Shahed drones and eight cruise missiles. Of these, 288 Shahed drones and three Iskander-K missiles were shot down.I don’t know how to describe this barrage of explosions: 21 Shahed strikes in 12 locations, debris from the downed missiles in 19 locations.The Helsinki accord was a masterpiece of European diplomacy. Fifty years on, we need its spirit more than ever | Kai Hebel and Richard DavyRead moreI don’t know how to describe the tachycardia that begins with the first explosion and has the heart drowning in this frantic rhythm for hours. There were 159 wounded, including 16 children.I don’t know how to find the words to describe what we seem to have seen hundreds of times, but every time it hurts like never before.Thirty-one killed: five children, the youngest just two.My friend posts a black-and-white photo of 42-year-old IT specialist Vitaly, who was killed alongside his 18-year-old daughter Vlada and dog Spike. Iryna, a mother, and her two daughters, ninth-grader Anastasia and sixth-grader Alina, were killed. Preschool teacher Natalia died along with her two sons, aged 17 and 22, and her brother. Six-year-old Matviy, who had been doing karate for a year and a half, was also killed.Our lives have long since turned into an endless news feed of these losses. Our memory is trying to record the names and facts, but our consciousness is a black lump of pain. This is just a part of what Russia is striving for, that “No one should be left alive in Ukraine.”The 31 July shelling was preceded by a week of torrential rain – loud thunderstorms and bright lightning, the likes of which I had never seen before, and with every flash in the skies I felt my body twist in preparation for the strike. And then I realised that this is the state of war in which our bodies and consciousness function. They are trying to adapt, to survive and to prepare for the next strike. To survive it all, but at what shattered cost?Oleksandr Mykhed is the author of The Language of War and a member of PEN Ukraine.

But if facts alone were sufficient to dispel rumours, conspiracy theories and lies then the far right in Britain would be out of business. Instead, it is flourishing, and moving into the political mainstream.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has welcomednew police guidelinesencouraging forces to release the ethnicity and migration status of those charged in high-profile cases. She hadalready indicatedthat she believed the guidance needed to change and urged the Law Commission to accelerate its review around what information can be released ahead of trials. The idea is that the shift will help to prevent a repeat of the riots thatswept parts of Englanda year ago after lies spread that the murderer ofthree schoolgirls in Southportwas a Muslim asylum seeker. Police rebutted the claims relatively quickly, albeit not as fast as some hoped. The truth did not stop the unrest.No one doubts that there is a problem; the question is whether this is the right solution. As Southport and other cases show, the police already had the power to release information to dispel lies.Policewill increasingly be badgered for the information if they do not share it, and Diana Johnson, the policing minister, has said that the government will want the details released in “most cases”: the hope is that the guidance turns an exceptional decision into a routine one.The need for transparency, especially important in an era when faith in authority is battered for reasons good and bad, must be weighed against investigative needs and the demands of a fair trial. The bare-bones information initially revealed of a suspect’s identity is supplemented over the criminal process. The police, never the most transparent institution, have often tilted too far towards caution on sharing information after the Leveson inquiry into the press. But – even putting aside the question of whether the police are ideally placed to handle sensitive matters of ethnicitygiven their own record– one would have to be remarkably naive to see those now demanding more information on the origins of suspects as champions of the truth. They are not seeking enlightenment: they want confirmation of their prejudices and assistance in spreading them.Singling outone particular aspectof a suspect’s identity does not merely give credence to but cements the belief that race or migration status are central to criminality – when, as the grandfather of one Southport victim, Bebe King,observed: “Mental health issues, and the propensity to commit crime, happens in any ethnicity, nationality or race.” Poor educational attainment is correlated with criminal convictions. But no one is demanding the release of suspects’ school records.TheLeveson reportalso pointed to the evidence of “discriminatory, sensational or unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers”. Rightwing media, and far-right agitators, will emblazon offences ascribed to asylum seekers or members of the South Asian diaspora across websites and social media platforms, while ignoring the ethnicity of the perpetrator when white Britons are responsible.The government either wants to close down a line of political attack, or more generously, douse the fires set by those promoting division and hatred. But disclosing ethnicity is more likely to fuel them by legitimising and further embedding the far right’s poisonous worldview.Explore more on these topicsPoliceOpinionRaceYvette CooperSouthport attackLeveson inquiryFar rightThe far righteditorialsShareReuse this content"

The problem is that he is failing to do itThu 14 Aug 2025 13.49 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShareThe aim of Thursday’sDowning Street meetingbetween Sir Keir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy could not have been clearer. It was to send a strong visual political message to President Trump on the eve of his Alaska talks with Vladimir Putin. Neither the prime minister nor Ukraine’s president spoke publicly. The Ukraine leader was greeted with a hug and a handshake. The two men then talked in private by a vase of sunflowers, Ukraine’s national flower.So much is at stake in Ukraine and so great is the urgency that European leaders have moved fast and determinedly this week – not something one can often say. The aim is to remind Mr Trump thatEurope stands with Ukraineagainst Russia. The solidarity has been well choreographed – and tightly scripted. No leader has said anything that might provoke Mr Trump. Whether the US president willtake any notice, let alone serious notice, is something else. That will only become clear in and after Alaska.Whatever the outcome, this is a pivotal moment not just for Europe but for Sir Keir’s foreign policy approach – and his domestic policies too. In the year and more since he became prime minister, Sir Keir has been faced with huge global challenges inUkraine, the Middle East, and in relations with the United States. These have occupied an enormous amount of his focus. They have been issues which play to his strengths. But, judging by the opinion polls, it has not impressed the public.The Alaska summit will shed some light on whether this effort has been worth it in terms of Ukraine’s independence and the threat fromRussia. But it will also be pivotal because the government is currently being so heavily stress-tested at home on major issues ranging from the economy to migration and the welfare state. Foreign and domestic policy may once have been conveniently – if not wholly – separable problems. In the interconnected, technologically driven world of today, the two things are umbilically connected.In hisnational security strategy, published in June, Sir Keir acknowledged this. He called ours “an era of radical uncertainty”. It must, he said, be navigated with “agility, speed and a clear-eyed sense of the national interest”. This meant, he continued, that foreign policy must answer to “the concerns of working people”. Wars drive up their bills. Cyber-attacks undermine their public services. Criminals smuggle illegal migrants across borders. Higher living standards must therefore become a national security goal. The need, he concluded, is “to bring foreign and domestic policy together”.This may sound sensible. The problem is that it has not been done, let alone with political agility. Policies do not become unified just because someone, even the prime minister, decrees that they should be. A government has to choose how best to unify them. This is where Sir Keir is currently failing.When he says the overriding European security need is to invest in collective defence, he is right. But the current consequence for the working people whose interests Sir Keir places at the centre of his strategy is that their bills are higher and their welfare and spending programmes are reined in to help pay for it. This either-or approach is proving disastrous. It has prepared a path for Reform UK’s closed-door, Britain-first promises. This has to change. Sir Keir needs to start changing either-or into its alternative – and prioritise both defence and higher living standards.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionUkraineLabourVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpAlaskaVladimir PutineditorialsShareReuse this content"

It seems undeniable that the on-street grooming model that has so dominated our news often involves men of Pakistani heritage. However, research by the Home Office-fundedVulnerability Knowledge and Practice Programmereveals that only 3.7% of the 115,489 child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) offences recorded by the police in England and Wales in 2023 (the most recent year for which figures are available) involved “group-based contact offences”, of which majority-Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs would have been just a part.These figures also reveal that while Asian or British Asian individuals accounted for approximately 5% of all CSAE offenders, they make up roughly 9% of the British population over the age of 16 years, ie Asians are underrepresented in statistics relating to CSAE perpetrators.Similarly, Asian or British Asian children represented 4% of CSAE victims. It could be argued then that political figures on the right and the left should be exploring why the Asian community is responsible for a disproportionately low amount of CSAE and examining what UK society might learn from this.Dr Bernard GallagherVisiting fellow, Connect Centre for International Research on Interpersonal Violence and Harm, University of Central LancashireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This is something we must change. It should matter to all of us, not least because the distance that lies between law-abiding lives and the justice system is thinner than we like to think. The blame for the crisis can be fairly laid at the doors of multiple governments who have traduced the prison system in the quest for votes, playing to the very worst of our human instincts.What we need is vision and courage. We need leadership that works for change and looks beyond day-by-day headcount management, and investment in what really works. And what really works is already evidenced in the work of so many small, independent charities across the justice system. None of it is rocket science. Time and again it proves to be person-centred, relational work delivered by a trained and supported workforce. If we increased investment in that now, we would see the savings three, five and 10 years down the line.The challenge is breaking the learned patterns of crisis management across the system, which roll from brink of breakdown to brink of breakdown and perpetuate a short-term vision framed forever in the assumption of inexorable increases in numbers.Penny ParkerFounder and CEO, StandOutMartin Kettle is right about the prison crisis, but, as it were, not correct enough. Since the media’s representation of “public demand” stands only for tougher sentencing and treatment, the prison system has not only all but disintegrated as money has tightened, but the most devastating consequence has been the rise of readmission rates. Almost all attempts to sustain re-education and reform of prisoners have been replaced by dysfunctional repression of what this induces: enduring alienation.Richard EllisDerbyMartin Kettle is right in explaining a major reason why the UK’s prisons have problems in accommodating convicted people. But it ignores the issue of our having the largest numbers in prison of any country in western Europe.About 30 years ago I was a school governor alongside an experienced justice of the peace who was also an ex-teacher. We discussed the introduction of restorative justice to help reduce the numbers in prison and reduce reoffending. I said that it seemed that a significant number of people in prison were, possibly, creative but they had used that creativity in the wrong way. She agreed. I think the same still applies but our current leader is taking the pragmatic approach to so many things that such questions as this will not be asked. It’s long past time that they were; other aspects of public services and education should be addressed to reduce offending and make more of people’s positive potential.David CockayneLymm, CheshireExplore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceKeir StarmerCrimelettersShareReuse this content"

The implication is that the link was benign. It was not.The Martyrs actively supported theChartist movementfor universal (male) suffrage, payment for MPs and annual parliamentary elections. These radical demands were too much for the vicar of St Andrew’s, who, with the local squirearchy, kicked up such a fuss that the Martyrs departed for Canada after a few years of persecution.David JobbinsKelvedon Hatch, EssexI enjoyed your look back in Ongar.

How to handle this (yes, non-feast) day, liturgically? Some, indeed, say no communion. Other traditions say that on this day of all days – the day of the cross – there should be a full service of holy communion. And others follow the pattern of receiving communion from the “pre-sanctified” – that is, bread and wine consecrated the previous day, at the “Last Supper” eucharist, and “reserved” and simply shared the next day, as a sign that Christ’s offering at the supper and on the cross was one and the same – his whole self.Rev Canon Michael AinsworthManchesterSorry to be pedantic, but from an ecumenical point of view Canon John Longuet-Higgins is not correct, for not only do Catholics receive holy communion on Good Friday, but so also do high church Anglo-Catholics of his own church as a pinnacle point of the Easter Triduum. Of all days in the Christian year it would seem the most appropriate moment to receive the blessed sacrament of Christ’s body and blood poured forth as the key moment in Christian salvation history.Nigel Eifion Rogers HartleyWorkington, CumbriaAny bank holiday is a feast day. Any bank holiday that changes date is a movable feast. If elements of the clergy see otherwise in the diminishing religious element of the population, just remind them they are seriously overrepresented in the hierarchy. How they mark the bank holiday is entirely up to them.Alan GoughManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Defensive issues are not exclusive to Andoni Iraola before the Premier League opener, however. Arne Slot voiced concern over the champions’ pre-season vulnerability before and after theCommunity Shield against Crystal Palace, when the absence of Ryan Gravenberch for family reasons was keenly felt. “Three times we lost the ball very simple in our midfield and three times they could counterattack us,” reflected the Liverpool head coach. Gravenberch will be missing again on Friday due to suspension but Slot expects the team with the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season to react as soon as the serious business begins. “Mixed teams, new players coming in, Virgil [van Dijk] being sick, Alisson not being there,” he listed as reasons for Liverpool’s recent difficulties on Thursday. “But all of this is not an excuse when we start the league. We will 100% be ready on Friday.”Andy HunterLiverpool vBournemouth, Friday 8pm (all times BST)2Ramsey sale a blow for the romanticsThe absence of Alexander Isak will invariably dominate the discourse at Villa Park on Saturday lunchtime butNewcastle’s move for Jacob Ramseymeans there is another intriguing subplot. Villa selling Ramsey, who joined their academy aged six, frees them to strengthen after a slow summer – and pocket £40m of profit. But it also serves as a reminder of the demoralising financial landscape in the era of profitability and sustainability regulations. PSR rules have also dictated deals for Newcastle, namely Elliot Anderson – a star in waiting for England – and Yankuba Minteh joining Nottingham Forest and Brighton respectively last year. Unai Emery is a big admirer of Ramsey, who would have been in line to start for Villa this weekend, but ultimately money talks. The 24-year-old lived his dream: playing for his boyhood club. There is always romanticism on the eve of a new season but Ramsey’s imminent sale is a reminder that football is a business.Ben FisherAston Villa v Newcastle, Saturday 12.30pmView image in fullscreenPSR rules mean homegrown talents like Jacob Ramsey are more likely to be sold on.Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty Images3De Cuyper can sparkle on Brighton’s leftAs usual, Brighton did their transfer business early this summer and it seems that Maxim De Cuyper has settled on the south coast already. The Belgium left-back, who joined from Club Brugge for £17.3m on a five-year deal, has been outstanding in pre-season as Fabian Hürzeler’s side have gone unbeaten. De Cuyper capped last week’s 2-1 win over Wolfsburg with a goal, and has immediately struck up an understanding with Kaoru Mitoma down the left flank. Hürzeler is hoping Brighton could have another gem on their hands as they prepare to welcomeFulhamin their opening match on Saturday. “I’m very impressed, because he integrated as a person quite quickly, and that’s something I don’t see that often in the football business,” the Brighton head coach said.Ed AaronsBrighton v Fulham, Saturday 3pm4Wilson can spoil party at rejuvenated old rivalsSunderland have sold their entire complement of 38,000 season tickets this summer and their 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light will be full when West Ham arrive on Saturday. After eight years away from thePremier League– including a stint in League One – they are back in the big time and have prepared themselves with 11 summer signings, five aged 21 or under, acquired for a collective sum in excess of £132m. If turning all those new faces into a functioning team will stretch Régis Le Bris’ undoubted coaching talents to the maximum, locals have reason to fear one particular visitor who recently arrived at West Ham on a free transfer. The former Newcastle and England striker Callum Wilson is now part of Graham Potter’s squad and would like little better than scoring the winning goal while eclipsing Enzo Le Fée, Granit Xhaka and the rest of Le Bris’s top-tier new boys.Louise TaylorSunderland v West Ham, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenSunderland fans will watch their team in the top flight for the first time since 2016-17.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images5Yet another new era dawns at SpursTottenham have had more eras than Taylor Swift but without quite the same success, so the start of yet another should barely register. However the sense persists that in Thomas Frank they have found the right manager at the right time, able to inspire individuals and the collective while being equally adept at finding tactical edges and solutions ­– he appears already to have inculcated set-piece prowess into his new charges. But just as they played wellagainst Paris Saint-Germainthen contrived to lose in a manner that could only be described as classic Spurs, so Burnley at home is precisely the kind of fixture they traditionally avoid winning. Nor will it be enough just to take the points: at the start of his tenure, Ange Postecoglou was extremely successful in their accumulation, but it was obvious the run couldn’t last, and it didn’t. Frank can buy himself time with good results, but over time, he must deliver a side that plays dominant football.Daniel HarrisTottenham vBurnley, Saturday 3pm6Newcomer Trafford gets City chanceHow different willManchester Citylook at Molineux? Pep Guardiola’s side finished last season strong, barring defeat in the FA Cup final, but City sought signings after conceding they were not aggressive in the market last summer. They have added six new faces and it will be interesting if James Trafford is preferred to Ederson in goal. Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki and Rayan Aït-Nouri could also all feasibly start, the last of those against his former club. Cherki may be the most exciting of City’s new signings but Guardiola’s goalkeeping decision feels most significant. Trafford has been given the No 1 shirt but what if Ederson, such an instrumental player across six Premier League title triumphs, stays put? This week City stopped short of denying interest in Gianluigi Donnarumma as a potential replacement for the Brazilian, who is into the final 12 months of his contract. Trafford is expected to start at Wolves and a solid debut could provide Guardiola with his answer.BFskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They did not have suitable cover for the striker, who remains suspended after his red card against Newcastle in May, but depth in attack is no longer an issue. Liam Delap and João Pedro joined in the summer and are competing to lead the line when Crystal Palace visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Both forwards did well during Chelsea’s victorious Club World Cup campaign and impressed in last weekend’s friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Milan. João Pedro scored in both warm-ups, Delap came off the bench to score against Milan and no one noticed the absence of Jackson, who was left out of the squad after indicating adesire to leavebefore the window shuts.Jacob SteinbergChelsea vCrystal Palace, Sunday 2pm8Can overachieving Bees and Forest sustain progress?This fixture at the City Ground features two sides whose seasons feel hard to predict. Nottingham Forest were superb last term, expressing Nuno Espírito Santo’s tactical ideas to the nth degree and adding some much needed variety to the league. Repeating the success, though, is a harder task: opposing players now have experience of facing them, and analysts have had time to identify their weaknesses. Forest still look well-placed to grow:retaining Morgan Gibbs-Whiteis a coup and his midfield partnership with the excellent, still-improving Elliot Anderson is good enough to compete with any in the league. Brentford, meanwhile, have lost three stalwart players with perhaps another yet to depart, as well as the manager who was at the heart of everything. Chances are the club were prepared for Thomas Frank’s departure, their processes embedded so as not to be reliant on any individual. Yet replacing him is about more than that: Keith Andrews cannot just preside over a technocracy but must embody it with soul.DHNottingham Forest v Brentford, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenKeith Andrews faces a tough task in keeping Brentford stable after Thomas Frank’s departure.Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/PA9New-look United and Arsenal stir memories of ‘89These teams met on the opening day of 1989-90. Manchester United were useless and undernew ownership, so had spent heavily (which sounds familiar to modern fans) while Arsenal were champions (less so). Just as Alex Ferguson told his board drastic measures were necessary, so too has Ruben Amorim, with three new attackers arriving at no little cost. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were bought as almost-sure things, Premier League-proven and hitting their peak, but more interesting is thepurchase of Benjamin Sesko, a 22-year-old physical freak who looks as if he plays on fast forward. Arsenal were also interested, but their need to win immediately meant theyplumped for Viktor Gyökeres, his ceiling lower and natural gifts fewer, but who is already the best version of himself. Which side got the better deal will not be evident after Sunday – in August 1989, United won 4-1, then finished 13th – but it will be fascinating to see how each acquisition integrates and fares.DHManchester United v Arsenal, Sunday 4.30pm10Can Harrison and Calvert-Lewin steal Grealish spotlight?It really will be a case of friends reunited when Leeds host Everton on Monday night. While Daniel Farke hopes to be able to include Dominic Calvert-Lewin in his matchday squad, the former Goodison Park centre-forward will not be the only familiar face to be greeted by the visiting manager, David Moyes. Leeds are returning to the Premier League after a two-year absence and their winger Jack Harrison has spent those two seasons on loan at Everton. This has not gone down well with many Elland Road regulars and Harrison has been audibly booed throughout pre-season. Can the 28-year-old win the West Yorkshire public over? Given that the last time Leeds were promoted, five years ago, Covid restrictions meant games were played at empty stadiums, there should be a party atmosphere but Moyes’s marquee summer signing, theManchester City loanee Jack Grealish, will doubtless be determined to ruin it. All eyes will inevitably be on Grealish but this could also be a big night for Calvert-Lewin and Harrison.LTLeeds vEverton, Monday 8pmExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolBournemouthBrighton & Hove AlbionFulhamSunderlandWest Ham UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have regressed sincewinning the Uefa Conference Leaguetwo years ago, too many misguided moves preventing them from kicking on, and rebuilding has not been simple. Funds are tight after a series of costly errors in the transfer market and Graham Potter is yet to demonstrate he is capable of silencing the familiar sound of grumbling at the London Stadium.Some fans fear a relegation battle beckons. West Ham underwhelmed last season, attempts to move on from David Moyes’s pragmatism by replacing the Scot with Julen Lopetegui proving predictably short-lived. They finished 14th, their improvement marginal after Potter replaced Lopetegui in January, a subsequent run of five wins in 19 games telling its own story.The optimistic reading, though, is that this is the real start of the Potter era. The message was to judge him after a pre-season. Potter, who is expected to favour a 3-4-2-1 system, has worked on improving the team’s mentality. He wants more leadership. It is not a surprise that Potter has brought in a sports psychologist. The mood has also been lifted by Lucas Paquetá, the influential Brazilian midfielder,being found innocentof breaking betting regulations.Paquetá has impressed during pre-season. Jarrod Bowen, the captain, continues to deliver in attack and has shown signs of a productive partnership with Niclas Füllkrug. There have been some encouraging additions, El Hadji Malick Diouf in particular catching the eye at left wing-back in pre-season. Potter and Kyle Macaulay, the head of recruitment, won a little battle when they convinced the board to buy the Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Callum Wilson, signed on a cheap short-term deal, offers experienced cover up front – if he can stay fit.More signings are required, though. Several veterans have departed, the sale ofMohammed Kudus to Tottenhamleaves a creative deficit and Potter’s hopes of making West Ham more proactive at home and better in possession will depend on whether the club can deliver a No 6 and a No 8. A lot remains up in the air. The picture will be clearer when the window shuts.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerPotter’s reputation is yet to recover after his brutal, ill-fated stint at Chelsea. Feted as the brightest young English coach around when he was at Brighton, it took only seven traumatic months at Stamford Bridge to throw his promising career off course. Now the challenge is to prove the doubters wrong. West Ham were unsure about hiring Potter but may benefit from his calm, dignity and ability to improve players on the training ground. Patience could be key. Potter is not about instant success. He has tended to build slowly, so West Ham will need to trust him if they start slowly.View image in fullscreenGraham Potter will be hoping with West Ham he can restore his reputation as one of the best young English coaches.Photograph: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Getty ImagesOff-field pictureConcerns over profitability and sustainability rules meant West Ham had to sell to buy at the start of the window. Supporters, though, do not want to hear the club pleading poverty. Many still begrudge the move to the unloved London Stadium which, despite having a capacity of 62,500, has hardly led to a change in West Ham’s fortunes. David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, is heavily criticised. The 76-year-old is not popular but remains highly influential. Less is made of the part played by the Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who bought his stake in 2021. The Gold family put a proportion of their stake up for sale almost two years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tim Steidten, the then technical director, is understood to have felt the Senegal international was not good enough for the Premier League. It is just as well, then, that the overhyped Steidten left last February. West Ham looked at Diouf again – they needed a left-back after releasing Aaron Cresswell and putting Emerson Palmieri up for sale – and took the plunge. They paid £22m for the 20-year-old, who was excellent inSenegal’s win over England in June, and are excited about his crossing ability.Stepping upThere were high hopes for George Earthy after a productive season on loan at Bristol City. However the attacking midfielder sustained an ankle ligament injury at the start of pre-season and is still on the mend. Earthy will hope to press his claim once he returns but in the meantime all eyes are on Freddie Potts, who has done well in pre-season. The 21-year-old, the son of the former West Ham defender Steve Potts, is a deep-lying midfielder and has looked comfortable on the ball in recent friendlies. Ollie Scarles, a 19-year-old left-back, will also hope for more minutes after being given opportunities last season.A big season for …The departure of Kudus means there will be pressure on Crysencio Summerville to step up and nail down a starting spot when he returns from a hamstring injury. The 23-year-old joined from Leeds last summer but the winger is yet to produce his best form for West Ham. He was a bit-part player under Lopetegui, who was reluctant to use the Dutchman’s speed and trickery, and has been out since tearing a hamstring during Potter’s first game. Surgery eventually followed and has left Summerville, who is expected to return next month, desperate to show what he can do. “When I’m back, it’s going to be showtime,” he said last month.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26West Ham UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their head coach believes Wirtz can have a similar impact by following the example of Salah, who continues to set the standards at Liverpool and has scored nine goals in seven opening-day fixtures, aPremier Leaguerecord.Slot was asked whether Wirtz was a signing to takeLiverpoolto the next level. “That is something I can only answer in the upcoming years,” he said. “­Everything we expect is very positive, but between expecting and realising something is different.“Why are Messi and Ronaldo and Mo so highly regarded? Because they are always fit. Every single game they are fit and that is something that ­Florian first has to show in a league like ours. If he is able to stay fit then our fans will see great moments.”Liverpool paid a club record £100m to sign the attacking midfielder from Bayer Leverkusen and he could cost a British record £116m with add-ons.

It is, as ever, a thrilling prospect. The opening round of fixtures will play out across this long weekend with the familiar sense of unspent energy, shapes, tides, narratives that will reveal themselves only in the slog through winter into spring.There are very good reasons why this thing has become the world’s dominant pop cultural stage. It works. No matter how sated you might have become by the end of the last one, there is always renewal and fresh hunger. Albeit with an even stronger sense this time of shifting planes, hard lines dissolving, a Premier League that is, for the first time in some time, a little menaced by omens, portents and notes of horn-parping rapture.Two significant things have happened this summer. First, Premier League clubs have spent like the world is on fire. The running total on basic transfer fees is more than £2bn with two weeks to go, already the second-largest ever, with a shot at beating 2023’s all-time high, post-Covid.This has been classic muscle-flexing Big Window Energy. Nine clubs, according to Transfermarkt, have ticked up more than £60m on ins minus outs.Manchester Unitedand Arsenal are more than £200m. Liverpool, the champions, have spent £253m gross in regearing the starting XI,part of a wider trend of genuine churn, book-balancing and head-count shift.View image in fullscreenArne Slot has a very different challenge this season, having expertly taken Liverpool to the Premier League title last season.Photograph: Matt Impey/ShutterstockIf this feels a little wild in places it is perhaps a reflection of that second element, the feeling of rumblings off stage, other powers rising, a war in heaven about to break. There are good reasons why Sky has chosen to gorge itself on English football this season, recentring on its key asset.This has been the founding commercial relationship for both parties, and a relatively simple dynamic. Put on the show. Sell the show to people whose business is screwing metal dishes to a wall, who can then sell it on to an audience watching a screen from its sofa. Defined territories. Easy to defend from outside interference. That model has been screwed into place for 35 years now, its coherence a key source of the league’s global power.It is already being disrupted. This summer Fifa gouged its fingers into domestic football, juicing up its invitees to the Club World Cup with vast amounts of Saudi-backed money,skewing the domestic balance of income, focus, internal tension. Behold the bald Swiss power broker on his great white throne, saying “I will make all things new”. These structures, these watertight shapes, are not football’s final form.There are signs of the times everywhere, indicators of control being ceded in plain sight. Theexpanded Champions Leagueis already having a similar stratifying influence. Regulations feel more mutable and vulnerable to challenge, unless you’reCrystal Palace and forgot to play the game.La Liga is playing matches overseas. The Premier League is launching a Netflix-style app. A baby has been born in Germany speaking only in Thierry Henry memes. That golden ladder is reaching down. Flick forward five years. How much longer can the centre hold?View image in fullscreenHow Tijjani Reijnders and Manchester City’s other new players will gel is one of the questions of the new season as Pep Guardiola tries to rebuild his team.Photograph: Miguel Rodriguez/EPAIn the meantime we have more boom times, a fever of commerce. Buy, spend, shore up your place in the new heaven and earth. It makes the current season feel both oddly reassuring and safe in its August-to-May routines, but also hard to read.In recent years there have been three distinct Premier League tiers: thelanternes rouges, the back-markers; the well-run middle; and the overclass. But even within this who can say who is good right now, who is healthy, who has found the right chemistry?Partly this is related to the excitable nature of much of the team building this summer. What kind of signings are the current wave of US-facing, entertainment product owners most likely to go all in for? The answer seems to be whizzy attackers with resale value.Florian Wirtz for £116m, Hugo Ekitiké £79m,Benjamin Sesko £73.7m,Viktor Gyökeres £63.5m. These are all exciting and unpredictable additions. Nobody knows how they will fall, who will fire, which of these variables will resolve itself.It still seems safe to say the league title will be divvied up between four contenders. Arne Slot has a harder job this season in some ways. Ticking over, rejigging, fixing the joins is one thing, and it was expertly done. What is required now is now an act of major, high-intensity rebuild on the hoof. It is an entirely different kind of test.Nobody knows whether Manchester City are back, half-back or non-back. Pep Guardiola talks only in prophecies and gospels and sooths these days. Some key expertise has left the club. Rodri andTijjani Reijnderslook a very good midfield. There is also quite a lot of filler around.View image in fullscreenManchester United have spent more than £200m on the attacking talents of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha (from left), but they still look brittle.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty ImagesArsenal will be fascinating to watch. Here are a team who already have the best defence. Add a new central midfield and a goalscorer with the nickname the Cannibal, and there really is nowhere to hide. This will not be a personnel issue or a stadium issue or a vibe issue. It will be an issue of will and nerve and the bravery to play on the edge, to take risks as well as squeeze.Are Chelsea good now? Will they be exhausted or energised? They have a thrillingly strong midfield and a fresh cutting edge. They really should be title contenders.In the tier below, Newcastle fans have finally found something objectionable about their owners, specifically theinability to run a successful player recruitmentand retention arm. But the team are still very strong.Aston Villa can get on with winning the Europa League. Manchester United will as ever exist in their own group of one, simultaneously epic, moreish, big-time, brittle, rickety and utterly brown paper and string. Sesko could be an excellent signing, and has the right elite vibes. On one hand there has to be an improvement. On the other the midfield is still two bad games from thawing out the cryogenic chamber and having another go with Casemiro.View image in fullscreenCan Leeds manager Daniel Farke end the run of promoted clubs dropping straight back down?Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesIn the middle range, AKA Brightfordmouth, the challenge is to resist the effects of being cannibalised and rebuild once more. Crystal Palace look strong and motivated. Everton could have their best season for a while. Fulham have failed to add much but should be fine because of Marco Silva + London stadium bonus + just enough good players. Nottingham Forest have the Europa League to cope with. A poor start could be a problem. Spurs could be anything, or simply Spurs. West Ham’s problem will be patience, allowing Graham Potter’s influence to swell slowly like a tuberous root vegetable.Burnley and Scott Parker will be a fascinating contrast, a far more defensively robust prospect than the Vincent Kompany job pitch project last time around, with its doomed brand-building style. Leeds have energy and a sense of collectivism at Elland Road, although somehow it is still hard to avoid the idea of Daniel Farke ruefully explaining things on Match of the Day. Sunderland will Sunderland. Wolves are going to have to do something surprising.The end result is a notably rigid hierarchy of clubs, a league table that could well simply end up in the exact order listed here. But which still seems to be operating in a state of high-end jeopardy just off stage, bonds and structures being tested, a sense of some looming rapture yet to reveal itself.Take your sickle and reap. Don’t get left behind. Reach up towards those new sources of light and heat.Chelseaare world champions. A dog with the head of Jamie Carragher has been found wandering the Mendip Hills talking about defensive body position. And now the thing that never ends is all set to start once again.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSky SportsTransfer windowLiverpoolManchester CityChelseaArsenalcommentShareReuse this content"

Forestmade Dan Ndoyetheir record buy last month by signing the Switzerland winger from Bologna for £35m to replace Anthony Elanga, who joined Newcastle in a £55m deal, but are ready to eclipse that fee.Forest are also pursuing deals for Douglas Luiz, who is keen to return to the Premier League from Juventus, the Rennes striker Arnaud Kalimuendo and McAtee, with the England Under-21s midfielder poised for a medical in the coming days. Forest are among the clubs to have tracked Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes but the Championship club want about £40m for the Portuguese midfielder.Chelsea are poised to profit from Hutchinson moving on, after they inserted a clause in the £20m deal that took him to Ipswich last year entitling them to 25% of any profit from a future sale. Hutchinson, who returned to his boyhood club, Chelsea, from Arsenal in 2022, was one of Ipswich’s best performers last season but scored only three top-flight goals.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestIpswich TownTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

I was just trying to play controlled but also aggressive and, for the most part, I think I did well.”Meanwhile, former world No 6 Matteo Berrettini has withdrawn from the US Open, tournament organisers said yesterday. The Italian, ranked 59th, has not competed since a first-round loss at Wimbledon after he had recovered from an abdominal injury.Berrettini skipped the Swiss Open in Gstaad and the Masters 1000 events in Toronto and Cincinnati in the buildup to the grand slam at Flushing Meadows, where he reached the semi-finals in 2019.

That was the day Manchester United outplayed and outviolenced Arsenal in the first leg of their Milk Cup semi-final at Highbury. United won 4-2; they were 4-0 up after 80 minutes before taking their foot off Arsenal’s throat, and shinbone, and head. “Perhaps we’ve been concentrating too much on passing and technique,” lamented Don Howe, Arsenal’s head coach and assistanttothe manager, Terry Neill. “Against United we went out to strike the ball about instead of putting some meat into the game.” In 1980s English football, there was no place for veganism. Things have changed since the days when ABH was a bookable offence, and only then after the first 10 minutes, but English football still has a pretty noxious meat footprint.Wayne Rooney hits back at Tom Brady: ‘I don’t think he really understood football’Read moreIn 2025, English society, never mind football, is addicted to beef. You know it’s a weekday when a relatively minor difference of opinion between two adults is reported using the kind of language once reserved for a bloodbath involving the Five Families. Today’s beef involves two football legends: Wayne Rooney (association) and Tom Brady (American). In case you missed it – if you did, get out while you still can – Rooney’s work ethic during his time as Birmingham City managerwas questioned by Brady, a part-owner of the club. This emerged in a documentary at the end of July, seven months after Rooney was sacked by Birmingham – but this ultra-processed beef ain’t got no sell-by date, baby. “I’m a little worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” said Brady. “I mean, I don’t know, I don’t have great instincts on that.” Rooney waited a couple of weeks to reply publicly, coincidentally via the medium of a new podcast that he’d be plugging desperately, if only there was a story he could sell. Remember the name: The Wayne Rooney Show.Actually, we shouldn’t throw shade at Our Wazza. We’re all selling something these days, whether it’s a podcast, a Substack or our last dapple of dignity. And we’re all buying what everyone else is selling, a world of dopamine nutters in desperate need of just one more hit. “I think it was a very unfair comment,” said Rooney, before explaining that Brady’s only visit was the day before a game, when everyone’s workload is generally lighter. “I don’t think he really understood football that well at the time.” Rooney went on to call Brady an abject, NKOTB-loving motherf- no, of course he didn’t. He called him “one of, if not the greatest athlete of all time”. His tone was reasonable throughout, even if he undermined his point slightly by saying the NFL season only lasted three months.Rooney concluded by putting the whole thing in an appropriate context. “Bit disappointed but nothing too serious, so move on.” That quote wasn’t used by the BBC, broadcasters of TheWayne RooneyShow, but they did have sufficient grasp of nuance to put together a graphic for their news story that screamed THE BRADY BEEF. Football Daily isn’t claiming to be any better. We’re eating beef right now, FHS, and we’ve got enough in the fridge to take us through to at least May 2026. But deep down – to nick a line from our progenitor The Fiver – we know it’s time to STOP BEEF. And maybe, if this jejune culture gets much worse, to STOP FOOTBALL.QUOTE OF THE DAY“In medical terms, the operation succeeded but the patient died, so not that good in the end. But we worked on a gameplan that was a little bit different and very close to succeeding” – Thomas Frank, having failed to cure Tottenham of historic ills, reflects on losing Biggest Cup on penalties to PSG. In doing so, Frank echoed the words of Danish compatriot Ebbe Skovdahl, who said the same after his Aberdeen team lost, er, 7-0 to Celtic in 2002.View image in fullscreenAllow him to be Frank: the new Spurs manager is serving up the soundbites already.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSWith reference toyesterday’s Football Daily(full email edition), in which your contributor was bemoaning the lack of alternative monikers for a goalkeeper, may I be so bold as to proffer a few enhancements to their vocab?

More than50,000have crossed since Labour came into power.“I was so happy to survive the journey across the Channel and to reach land in the UK. Then theHome Officelocked me up. I’m still in a state of shock,” said one man from Eritrea, speaking to the Guardian by phone from a detention centre.“We did not understand what was happening to us when the Home Office moved us from Manston [the former military base in Kent] where we were processed, straight to this place which is like a jail.“When we asked why they were bringing some who arrived on the same boat as me here but letting others go free, they did not answer us. They just said it was because we crossed the Channel illegally.”The man said that neither he nor anyone he knew in northern France knew anything about the “one in, one out” deal and was not sure it would prevent people from continuing to try to cross the Channel.“I am very frightened here. There are people who have committed crimes in the UK locked up with us. We have done nothing wrong apart from trying to find a safe place.”He claimed to have been trafficked and tortured when he passed through Libya on his journey from Eritrea. “I believe if I am sent back to France and the smugglers find me they will kill me,” he said.View image in fullscreenScreengrab from a Home Office video of Border Force officers processing people under the asylum deal.Photograph: Home Office/PAA second man from Afghanistan also spoke to the Guardian from detention. He said: “The Home Office have just locked us in these rooms and said we cannot go from here. We are frightened of the dangerous criminals locked up with us. We are so afraid of what Home Office will do to us.“The Taliban tried to kill me so I escaped from Afghanistan. I thought I was free when I reached [the] UK but instead I am in this prison. We knew nothing about the ‘one in, one out’ deal when we left France. I don’t know if it will stop people crossing the Channel.”The Home Office says the first group of detainees are expected to be returned to France within three weeks, with the UK referring potential returnees to the French authorities within three days of their detention and the French expected to respond within 14 days.A leaflet given to detainees by the Home Office says those returned to France may be offered a financial incentive by the French authorities to return to their home countries. It asks detainees to notify the Home Office if they are seriously ill or a victim of rape, torture or violence, although officials are supposed to screen for these vulnerabilities before detaining people.Karris Hamilton, an advocacy manager at Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group, which is supporting those earmarked for forced return to France, said: “We are extremely concerned about the wellbeing of the men being detained for the ‘one in, one out’ scheme.“Those we have spoken with so far are in acute distress and many have been victims of torture, exploited by traffickers on their journeys or victims of modern slavery in Libya.“People are finding it difficult to eat and sleep due to being in a prison environment, not knowing how long they will be there and fearing that they may be taken back to France. We are very worried that we will see a rise in self-harm, suicide attempts and hunger strikes due to this.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Wolverhampton council previously said the higher charge was in response to an increase in obesity levels in the Midlands city, where a third of people are obese, compared with the national average of just over a quarter.Councillors had approved the charges in May after consultation with local funeral parlours, but backed down on Thursday. Wolverhampton city council said: “No formal decision was ever taken on plans to charge more for larger burial plots. This is a common practice taken by councils around the country, where higher charges cover the costs of providing a larger plot.“However, while under consideration, we have decided not to proceed with the plans.”The council previously said it had contacted 25 funeral directors before introducing the measure, with only one of them posing an objection. Local authorities in Telford, Birmingham, Walsall, Coventry and Staffordshire have implemented charges for wider coffins.One of the first councils to introduce higher fees for larger graves was Houghton Regis town council, Bedfordshire, in 2009. A survey by the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors of its members across the UK found a quarter of local authorities charged extra for wider burial plots.There was also concern in Wolverhampton for couples who wanted to be buried together, but where one was already buried in a standard plot while the other needed to be buried in a larger grave.Prior to Wolverhampton council backing down over the contentious proposals, funeral director Ross Hickton told the BBC the charge was a “fat tax” and that it was “not really acceptable or fair”, adding: “You know people have paid into the system their entire life, paid their council tax to Wolverhampton council, and for them to be told [the grave is] 20% more because of the size of their loved one, it’s not really acceptable or fair.”Matthew Crawley, the chief executive at the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management, said the charge seemed reasonable. “You have a finite amount of space to work with; therefore if you need to eat into a grave next door, say, then that needs to be accounted for,” he said.“You also have to account for the idea that digging the grave itself will also need extra equipment to keep it safe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She told the BBC: “Someone like me who’s a bit bigger, is going to be charged [more] because I’m fat.”Explore more on these topicsWolverhamptonDeath and dyingObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

The US pays about three times more for drugs compared with other developed countries, according to theRand Corporationthinktank.On 31 July, Trump sent letters to 17 of the world’s biggest drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, demanding cuts to drug prices for Americans within 60 days.“Make no mistake: a collaborative effort towards achieving global pricing parity would be the most effective path for companies, the government and American patients,” Trump wrote. “But if you refuse to step up we will deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices.“Americans are demanding lower drug prices, and they need them today.”In May, Trump told reporters that a friend in London had told him he had bought the “fat shot drug” for $88, compared with $1,300 in New York.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said her message to young people was: “If you see a problem you think you can fix, you can do something about it.”She joins nine other girls from across the world on the magazine’s first list to spotlight girls’ achievements. It builds on Time’s existing women of the year list, with the express intention of recognising young female role models globally.Rebecca’s design – a solar-powered backpack with an electric blanket inside – won an engineering award in a UK-wide competition that received 70,000 entrants and Rebecca has since developed it as a prototype.The engineering firm Thales, which sponsored the competition, subsequently manufactured 30 of the blankets and distributed them to six homeless charities in Glasgow earlier this year, with plans to make 120 more.Rebecca, a student at Kelvinside academy, said: “The idea came from seeing how hard it is for people living on the streets of Glasgow, especially during winter, and wanting to create something that could make a real difference. At first, it was just a drawing – I never imagined it would actually be made.”“Knowing that something I came up with is helping others makes me feel really proud. By seeing themselves as builders, girls can challenge norms, pursue any passion and shape the world. It’s easy to fall into thinking that building just means construction. It’s so much more than that.”The list is launched in partnership with Lego Group, as an extension of their She Built That campaign, which challenges stereotypes and encourages girls to see themselves as builders.Other entrants on the list include Rutendo Shadaya, a 17-year-old Zimbabwean-New Zealander fantasy novelist, the Olympic skateboarder Coco Yoshizawa, 15, from Japan and an organ donation advocate, Naomi S DeBerry, 12, from the US. Nine of the 10 girls are reimagined as Lego figures on the cover of the new edition.View image in fullscreenTime’s ‘girls of the year’ have received the Lego treatment.Photograph: Time/Coed StudiosLaunching the list, the Time senior editor Dayana Sarkisova said: “These girls are part of a generation that’s reshaping what leadership looks like today. Their generation understands that change doesn’t require waiting for adulthood – it starts with seeing problems and refusing to accept them as permanent.”Rebecca said: “I think there’s a really important message for any young person to look at what you’re interested in and follow your dreams If you see a problem you think you can fix or contribute to, you can do something about it. And whatever you do, you should always follow your own path to what you want to achieve.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandTime magazineMagazinesHomelessnessWomennewsShareReuse this content"

The ambitious countries – who want curbs on production – described it as “unacceptable”, a “lowest common denominator” and a toothless waste management instrument, because it did not include production caps nor address the chemicals used in plastic products.Countries from the “like minded” group, chiefly oil-producing countries and including Saudi Arabia, who want the treaty to focus on recycling and voluntary measures, said it crossed too many of their red lines and did not do enough to pare down the scope of the treaty.View image in fullscreenActivists staged a protest on the last day of negotiations of the treaty at the UN offices in Geneva.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesGraham Forbes, Greenpeace’s head of delegation, said: “The entire day has been behind closed doors. All of civil society is on edge, waiting to see what the next move is going to be from the chair and from the secretariat. We are nervous, we are anticipating, and we’re concerned that we’re going to be sold out in an effort to get a treaty at any cost.“Civil society, frontline communities, Indigenous peoples, everyone is united in wanting to see something meaningful here. And we’re praying that these governments are going to do the right thing and put our collective health before short term profits for the petrochemical sector.”A rush for a weak treaty in Geneva, Forbes said, “would be a disaster”.Some NGOs said they had “lost faith” in a process with the need for consensus between a majority of countries that want production caps versus a small but powerful minority of oil- and plastic-producing nations that continue to reject production limits.Christina Dixon, a campaign lead at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said the need for consensus was being “weaponised”.“A lot of civil society have lost faith in the process, because we’ve consistently seen a majority of countries aligning around a vision for the type of treaty that we’d be happy with. Yet, because of the way that this is being weaponised, we’re constantly bowing to a small but vocal minority who are holding it hostage,” she said.This system was allowing a majority of countries to be “drowned out”, Dixon said. She urged: “What we need to see tonight is that the views of that majority reflected fairly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But if the key components are there and we can build it in time, then we will be signing. By now, we’ve given up bans, we’ve given up production limits. We’ve given up so much, so much.“As ambitious countries, we want an outcome, and we see that if we don’t get an outcome, we’re risking a lot. But at the same time, we won’t take just anything.”Before this week’s talks,an expert reviewpublished in the Lancet described plastics as “a grave, growing and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health”. It estimated health-related damages globally added up to £1.1tn annually, with infants and children particularly vulnerable.However, some delegates were still hopeful. Sivendra Michael, the Fiji government’s permanent secretary for the ministry of environment and climate change, said: “There is still time. There are still processes that the chair can explore. There are many other innovative processes that have worked in other multilateral settings that can be explored.“It’s important for us to take a step back and reflect that we are negotiating at the edge of a planetary emergency.”The talks continue.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsSeascape: the state of our oceansPollutionUnited NationsOilSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They are used in many consumer products, from frying pans to waterproof coats, but one of their most common uses is in firefighting foams.26:02How 'forever chemicals' have seeped into almost everything – videoThe largest Pfas total recorded was at London Luton airport, with total Pfas in one groundwater sample, taken at a location described as “fire training lagoon two”, of 36,084 nanograms per litre.There is no regulatory limit for Pfas in ground or surface water in the UK, but in the EU aproposed thresholdis being considered of 4.4ng/l. While Luton tested for twice the number of Pfas than that included in the EU threshold, the airport’s highest total Pfas level was 8,000 times higher than the draft limit.Among the specific Pfas detected at these 17 airports were PFOS and PFOA – two banned and toxic chemicals which, respectively, are suspected and known carcinogens.One sample taken from “borehole four” at London Luton contained 2,555ng/l of Pfas, with 24ng/l of PFOS and 39ng/l of PFOA. This total Pfas level is more than 500 times higher than the EU’s proposed threshold.A London Luton airport spokesperson said: “Like many airports and other industries in the UK and around the world, we are investing in and working closely with relevant agencies to assess and monitor Pfas.”They added that the data obtained by this investigation was from preliminary screening and should not be considered statistically representative, as a long-term monitoring programme was still under way.Waste from agricultural plant poisoned US town’s water with Pfas, lawsuits allegeRead moreOf the airports sampled, Ends Report’s analysis has revealed that four of the 17 are located within protected drinking water safeguard zones. These are designated areas set up around public water supplies where additional pollution control measures are needed.One sample taken at Farnborough airport, Hampshire, located in a drinking water safeguard zone, contained 180ng/l of PFOS. The Drinking Water Inspectorate has set a guideline safe level of 100ng/l for the total levels of 48 named Pfas. If test results in drinking water come close to this threshold, then the inspectorate states that precautions should be taken.The presence of elevated Pfas in the sample does not necessarily mean that drinking water is being contaminated by the airport’s Pfas pollution. Experts say that for this to happen, pathways would need to exist to enable Pfas to enter drinking water sources.Dr Patrick Byrne, a reader in hydrology and environmental pollution at Liverpool John Moores University, said: “The risk, if any, to downstream receptors like drinking water sources and ecosystems is unclear. To understand the risk, we need to establish if there is a transport pathway between the source and the receptor. If there is no transport pathway, there is a very low risk.”However, for Dr Shubhi Sharma, from the charity Chem Trust, the high levels of Pfas detected at airports are “extremely worrying as some of these Pfas have been established as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization”.Dr Rob Collins, director of policy and science at the Rivers Trust, described the Pfas concentrations at UK airports as “alarmingly high”.While uncertainty remains over the potential risk these may pose, Pfas contamination of drinking water from airports has previously been confirmed close to home.In Jersey, residents have been recommendedbloodletting to reduce high concentrations of Pfasin their blood after private drinking water supplies were polluted by the use of Pfas in firefighting foams at the island’s airport.In France,one region had to take whole drinking water supplies out of usedue to Pfas contamination from an airport.A spokesperson for the trade association AirportsUK said: “This year UK airports are spending around £5m in investigating the sources and nature of Pfas issues on their sites – it is this industry work that this data comes from.“This work is being done with a view to identifying specific source locations so that appropriate actions can be assessed. Airports are working closely with the Environment Agency and local communities to ensure that they do not make their way into watercourses and food chains.”A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are reshaping the UK Reach [chemicals regulation] work programme to deliver stronger protections and are currently considering the best approach to chemicals regulation in the UK, including the development of a restriction dossier on Pfas in firefighting foams”.Explore more on these topicsPfasAir transportEnglandPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

In addition, the organisation advised people not to discard cigarettes, matches or glass bottles, as they can ignite dry vegetation.View image in fullscreenThe wildfire was still burning on Langdale Moor in North Yorkshire on Thursday.Photograph: North Yorkshire fire and rescue serviceThe NFCC chair, Phil Garrigan, said firefighters were “already being pushed to their limits” with recent major incidents “showing just how demanding and dangerous these events can be”.“Each wildfire can take days – sometimes weeks – to bring under control, tying up crews and specialist equipment and placing huge strain on other vital fire and rescue work. There’s a real human toll on our firefighters too who are undertaking the most arduous work in the toughest conditions.“We are already seeing more wildfires at this point in the year than in 2022 – which itself was a record year – and that is deeply concerning. This is against a backdrop of sustained cuts in funding and reducing firefighter numbers – with 11,000 fewer firefighters in England now than there were 10 years ago, alongside a 20% increase in demand over the same period. Climate change is fuelling more frequent and intense extreme weather events, and wildfires are no longer a seasonal threat; they are a persistent and growing risk to life, property, and the environment.”He called for “long-term, sustained investment so that fire and rescue services have the people, resources, and equipment they need to protect our communities, no matter how many fronts they are fighting on”.View image in fullscreenFirefighters worked through the night tackling a gorse blaze on Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh at the weekend.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAResearchers say the sea surrounding the Yorkshire coast is likely to break temperature records in 2025.Temperatures are 2C higher than in the 1980s, putting at risk some species that are a key part of the food chain.Prof Rodney Forster, of the University of Hull, told the BBC the North Sea “appears to be a bit of a hot spot, warming faster than anywhere else and we don’t know yet why that is”.Explore more on these topicsWildfiresNorth YorkshireFirefightersClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Wind powergenerated more electricity than gasin 2024, contributing 30% of the UK’s power needs against just over 26% from gas plants as low carbon generationhit a record high.By the end of the decade, the government hopes gas plants will be used as a last resort option in the UK’s electricity market and generate just 5% of the UK’s power under its plans to create a virtually carbon-free power system.Last month, Centricastruck a dealto take a 15% stake in the planned Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast, which is expected to begin operating in the mid- to late 2030s.Explore more on these topicsCentricaFossil fuelsEnergyGasKentnewsShareReuse this content"

She died two days later.During the inquest it emerged that the worker, who went under the stolen identity Ebo Acheampong, hadnever worked at any hospital before the day he was put in charge of observing Ruthand did not receive an induction before his shift.The jury at Beaconsfield raised concerns about training of agency staff at Huntercombe and said contributing factors to Ruth’s death included her not being prevented from accessing the material she used to harm herself.She did not receive therapy that may have helped while she was being detained under the Mental Health Act, family visits were limited though they may have helped her wellbeing and she was able to access harmful material on her phone, the jury heard.Speaking after the jury returned its findings, Ruth’s parents, Kate and Mark Szymankiewicz, who are respectively a GP and a consultant surgeon from Wiltshire,said: “There is an empty space at our table, a silent bedroom in our home, a gaping hole in our family that will never be filled.“Ruth was an incredible, bright, friendly, loving and adventurous girl with a whole life of joy ahead of her. She, like many other teenagers, developed an eating disorder.“When, at our most vulnerable as a family, we reached out for help, we ultimately found ourselves trapped in a system that was meant to care for her, to help her, to keep her safe, but instead locked her away and harmed her. As a child who thrived on her connection with nature, she was essentially caged.“Over the last two weeks, we have heard about the numerous systemic failures at Huntercombe hospital,” the family said. “It would be easy to be distracted by the failings of one individual. However shocking that conduct might have been, it is paramount that the other wider and more important issues are acknowledged and addressed.”Ruth was ‘an incredible, bright, friendly, loving and adventurous girl with a whole life of joy ahead of her’, her parents said.Photograph: Family handout/PAHealth experts told the Guardian that many of the issues around the use of agency staff and the shortage of psychiatric intensive care units for children and young people was still a huge problem.Andrew Molodynski, the British Medical Association’s mental health lead, said there was a “gap in accountability” over the training and vetting of agency staff. He said it was often mental health inpatient units, with the most high-risk individuals, that relied on agency staff the most, especially when they had patients like Ruth needing one-to-one supervision.He said this was a “toxic catch-22 … You end up with very few people who know the ward and know the patients”.Minesh Patel, an associate director of policy and campaigns at the mental health charityMind, said Ruth’s case was “a clearcut example of the many systemic issues in our mental health hospitals”.He said: “An overreliance on agency staff can compromise patient safety, quality of care, and in the worst cases lead to serious harm or loss of life.”During the inquest, Dr Gillian Combe, the clinical director for the provider group that commissioned Ruth’s placement, said the understaffing seen at Huntercombe still existed.She expressed frustration at rules in England that make it hard for new NHS units to be built, meaning provider groups have to rely on sending patients to private units.Combe said this situation arose afterAndrew Lansley’s changes to the NHS– described by some as “creeping privatisation” – when he was the health secretary from 2010 to 2012. She said there were no psychiatric intensive care units for children and young people in the whole of south-west England.Jodie Anderson, a senior caseworker at the charity Inquest,said: “The jury’s findings are a stark indictment of a mental health system that sent a vulnerable child far from home to a private unit with dangerously inadequate care.”Dr Amit Chatterjee, the chief medical officer atActive Care Group, which owned and ran Huntercombe, told the inquest that the company had worked hard to improve recruitment and its induction process.Huntercombe has closed but Chatterjee said the company had increased therapeutic care at its current site for young people, Ivetsey Bank hospital in Staffordshire.The inquest heard that after learning that Ruth had died, the worker known as Acheampong fled from the UK to Ghana. Thames Valley police said they knew his real identity but did not have enough evidence to try to get him back.The use of agency staff in mental health settings has been cited as a big problem in numerous reviews and inquest conclusions. In the case ofLily Lucas, a 28-year-old woman who died in 2022 from excessive fluid intake brought on by schizophrenia, an NHS review found that some agency nurses on her privately run ward did not know how to use 999.A Care Quality Commissionreporton the Mental Health Act said patients had described agency staff as “not friendly” and “less caring” towards patients, and detrimental to morale among permanent staff.In the UK, the youth suicide prevention charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

There’s really only so much abuse one person can take. However, I’m still here. Because I have too many books in me that I still want to write.”Nominated writers boycotting the prize over Boyne’s inclusion included the Guardian journalistJason Okundaye, whose Revolutionary Acts was nominated for the first book prize longlist and Andrew McMillan, the author of Pity, which was longlisted for the overall Polari prize for a non-debut book.Alice Oseman, the author of Heartstopper, along with the writers Nikesh Shukla, Julia Armfield, Naoise Dolan, Seán Hewitt and Kirsty Logan are among the hundreds to have signed the statement against Boyne’s inclusion on the list.It said Boyne had “unequivocally associated himself with trans exclusionary sentiments” and that his inclusion on the list was “inappropriate and hurtful to the wider community of LGBTQ+ readers and writers”.“In any year, the decision to include Mr Boyne on the longlist would be, in our view, inappropriate and hurtful to the wider community of LGBTQ+ readers and writers,” the statement read. “That the decision has been made this year – in the context of rising anti-trans hatred and systematic exclusion of trans people from public life in the UK and across the world – is inexcusable.”But Boyne has received support from prominent gender-critical writers, including JK Rowling. Last week, Rowling responded to the authors’ statement against him bywriting on X: “Oh, fuck off. I hope everyone buys twice as many John Boyne books, a) because he’s brilliant, and b) to piss off the Gender Taliban.”In response to Boyne’s statement, the writer and former Guardian columnistJulie Bindel posted: “I am proud to know you, John. Thank you for your support for women, including lesbians, and gay men. And shame on the bullies. You deserve to stand proud.”In his statement, Boyne set out his views on trans rights. He said: “All human beings should have the same rights, but if the rights of trans women come into conflict with the rights of what you call ‘cis’ women, then the latter must take precedence.”He said he accepted that the organisers of the petition against him may have “meant well”. But he said they had “forgotten a crucial fact”. “That the novelist you’re protesting, and the novel you tried to exclude, is part of a sequence about sexual abuse from a gay man who endured that very trauma at school, was denied justice because my abuser died in the months leading up to the trial, and is still coping with not getting my day in court.”Boyne said: “It seems absurd and wrong to me that so many debut writers are losing their opportunity for this, either through misguided ideas about who I am or, as I’m aware has happened in some cases, because you too were bullied or intimated into withdrawing.”He added: “I would encourage all the debut writers on the Polari longlist to return to the list, to look forward to the shortlist announcement and, in time, the fun and excitement of the ceremony. One of you gets to win the prize, and that’s as it should be. The organisers stood firm and didn’t expel me from the longlist, which I appreciated. And I am not withdrawing from the longlist. However, should the debut writers all return, I would respectfully ask the judges not to consider Earth for the shortlist. I don’t think I can say any fairer than that.”Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsTransgenderFictionAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

She said that after allegations were made against Gregg Wallace and John Torode its broadcast would send the wrong message about the treatment of women and inappropriate behaviour by prominent figures.Wallace was dropped by the BBC after an independent reportsubstantiated 45 allegations made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact. He has apologised “for any distress caused” but said the report cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”.Torode was also dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over theuse of racist language, which he believes never happened.A spokesperson for Banijay said: “One other contributor decided that given recent events they would like not to be included. We have of course accepted their wishes and edited them out of the show.”The series, which began airing last week, was filmed before Wallace and Torode were sacked.

It has now been edited further to remove another contestant, who has asked not to be identified, according to the BBC.The BBC is facing fresh criticism on social media about its decision to broadcast the series amid speculation about whether it would continue if more contestants asked to be removed.In a statement last month, the BBC said: “This has not been an easy decision in the circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it. In showing the series, which was filmed last year, it in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters. We have been very clear on the standards of behaviour that we expect of those who work at the BBC or on shows made for the BBC.“However, we believe that broadcasting this series is the right thing to do for these cooks who have given so much to the process.

Afterwards, Amir and his friend Hasan, who were both wearing Palestinian keffiyehs, went searching for food and stumbled across Jimmy’s Falafel on George Street.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAmir said while they were asking a restaurant employee if a table was vacant, a security guard approached the pair and said their scarves could not be worn inside the venue and had to be removed if they wanted to dine in.Palestine Action Group’s March for Humanity across Sydney Harbour Bridge – in picturesRead moreThe security guard said the directive came from the restaurant manager, Amir said. “We were quite shocked that this is happening to us, right in the centre of Sydney,” he said.Amir, who said he saw other people also being turned away due to wearing keffiyehs, said the pair calmly left the venue.Keffiyehs, traditional scarves worn across the Middle East, are often worn by peopleexpressing support for Palestine.A Merivale spokesperson said in a written statement that Jimmy’s Falafel was patronised by many who participated in the Harbour Bridge protest march on 3 August, including “many, many people wearing keffiyehs and hijabs”.0:34Protesters chant in support of Palestine during march across Sydney Harbour Bridge – videoThe statement said that a management decision was made at about 3.55pm “that people carrying large flags and placards should not carry or display them within the Jimmy’s Falafel venue”, after instances of members of the public “yelling obscenities and violent rhetoric” at Merivale venues on George Street, including comments such as “death to the IDF”, “death to all Zionist pigs” and “f***ing Zionist pigs and scum”.“Jimmy’s staff understood that decision as providing that persons wearing political garb and/or carrying flags and placards should be kindly asked to remove those items (place them in their bags) before entering,” the spokesperson said.“This meant that for the period 3.55pm to 4.15pm, people wearing political items of clothing were politely asked to remove those items and place them in their bags before entering.”Merivale CCTV footage, viewed by Guardian Australia, shows that during that 20-minute window, some patrons wearing keffiyehs left the venue or were turned away, while others removed them before entering or ordering takeaway.The footage shows other diners wearing keffiyehs inside the venue during that period, as well as at other points during the day.On the footage, which did not include audio, just before the start of the 20-minute period, protesters appear to yell into the venue.“To be clear, at no time was anyone refused entry or discriminated against due to their political or religious affiliations. As you can imagine, it was a day of thousands of people attending the city. It was a challenging time for venue staff, and we of course have an obligation to their safety and comfort. Merivale is politically neutral and has no interest whatsoever in disabusing any patron of their religious or political views,” the spokesperson said.“No Merivale venues including Jimmy’s Falafel have policies on customers wearing keffiyehs or other scarves.”Sharfah Mohamed, a lawyer at the Racial Justice Centre, said: “Our position is that Merivale’s conduct breaches the federal Racial Discrimination Act.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I felt humiliated,” he said.Hasan, who is Lebanese, said the keffiyeh resonates with Palestinians and is a symbol of “hope and freedom”.“We just wanted to become one with the Palestinian people and show solidarity with them,” he said.Amir said he now fears wearing a keffiyeh in public or expressing his opinion about the conflict in the Middle East. “I feel quite shocked, traumatised and humiliated,” he said.Qamar Albashir said he was wearing a Moroccan scarf when his group of six people approached Jimmy’s Falafel . He said the security guard told the group, which included three people wearing keffiyehs, they could not enter the venue wearing the scarves and would have to remove them to go inside.State Library of NSW apologises after guard asked high school student wearing keffiyeh to leaveRead more“We were kind of dumbfounded. When [they] said we couldn’t go in we ask why not, and the security guard said it was a private establishment. We were lost for words.”“It felt really horrible. We felt further anguished because our kids were there with us.”A fourth man, who requested anonymity, said he was also denied entry to Jimmy’s Falafel on the afternoon of the march while wearing a Jordanian keffiyeh.“We were told by the security guard that we wouldn’t be allowed in because we were wearing scarves,” he said. “We were in shock at first.”The man said he was accompanied by his wife, who was wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh, and his friend, who was not wearing a scarf. He said the group observed two other groups, where some members were wearing Palestinian keffiyehs, who were denied entry on the same basis.The man said his friend ordered takeaway food from the venue from the street for the group.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesSydneyIsrael-Gaza warProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the agreement, Vectus will reportedly be given a role in Haiti’s tax-collection system.Haiti’s capital has been largely cut off from the rest of the country since February 2024, when armed groups launcheda joint offensive against the government, toppling the prime minister and commandeering virtually the whole city. According to the UN, more than 1,500 people were killed between April and July, mostly in Port-au-Prince. The majority were killed during security force operations and a third indrone strikes, which the government has started using to target armed groups.A source familiar with Vectus’s Haiti operations told Reuters its deployment would include snipers, intelligence and communications specialists, helicopters and boats.The use of private military contractors to fight Haitian crime groups has caused alarm among human rights advocates and observers, even if the security situation has become so dire that many Haitians have been calling for some form of foreign intervention.‘The ground shook’: drone attacks help Haitian government wrest control of capital from criminal gangsRead more“People are desperate for solutions, for help, for anything … People are willing to accept things they wouldn’t have been willing to accept not that long ago because of the desperation,” said Jake Johnston, the author of Aid State: Elite Panic, Disaster Capitalism, and the Battle to Control Haiti. “I can understand the level of trauma and desperation. But is this really a solution?” Johnston asked, predicting Vectus’s operation was unlikely to go well.Johnson called the deployment another example of Haitian problems being “outsourced” to foreigners instead of strengthening Haitian institutions such as the police. “What kind of a message does [this use of private contractors] send to … domestic forces that are underresourced and feeling like they are not supported?”Romain Le Cour, the head of the Haiti Observatory at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, called the move “a severe institutional setback” to Haitian police and the UN-backed security force sent there last year. Le Cour believed deploying foreign contractors would “deepen the strategic isolation” of Haiti’s police andthe Kenya-led policing missionas they tried to regain control.Prince’s group – which uses the slogan “we don’t just advise, we act” – has been working in Haiti since March. According to Reuters,it has been deploying dronesin coordination with a taskforce led by the prime minister. “[But] after six months of deployment, gangs continue to hold strategic dominance,” Le Cour pointed out.Explore more on these topicsHaitiUnited NationsXe (Blackwater)AmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.“We look forward to the opportunity to respond to attorney General Bondi’s letter, and continue to underscore the inaccuracies of the federal government’s position.”Bruce Harrell, the Seattle mayor, said the letter’s portrayal of his city and its laws was untruthful.“Immigration enforcement is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government. The city neither interferes with nor carries out those federal duties,” he said. “We have received and are reviewing the latest letter from Attorney General Bondi and strongly disagree with its assertions. Our laws and policies protect the safety, privacy and constitutional rights of all Seattle residents while remaining compliant with applicable law.“We remain committed to our local values, including being a welcoming city for all. We will continue to defend our residents and our rights – and we will not hesitate to do so in court.”The office of Eric Adams, the New York City mayor, a Trump ally and embattled re-election candidate, offered a less strident immediate response.“The job of a mayor is to protect the safety of every single person in their city – and that’s exactly what Mayor Adams has worked to do every day for nearly four years,” said Kayla Altus, Adams’ press secretary. “Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows.“That’s why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the city council, but he has also urged the council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to keep violent criminals off our streets.”The letters follow the publication of a revised “sanctuary jurisdiction” list on 5 August. The Department of Homeland Securitywithdrewa previous list after an outcry from rural sheriff’s offices and conservative jurisdictions that argued the list was created without input from sheriffs and “violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationPam BondiLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Today, theBaby Shark Dance videois the most viewed on YouTube, with more than 16bn views, roughly double those of the runner-up, Despacito by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee, and third-placed Wheels on the Bus by the children’s YouTube channel Cocomelon.Baby Shark Dance by Pinkfong (2016)In 2019, the children’s songwriter Jonathan Wright – known as Johnny Only – filed a lawsuit in Seoul, claiming Pinkfong copied his earlier version of the original song, which is thought to have been around for more than five decades.On Thursday, the court ruled that Wright’s version “had not reached a level of substantial alteration” from the original for it to be considered a separate work, which means it is not protected as a separate piece of work under copyright law.Wright uploadedhis version, which also includes the “doo doo doo doo doo doo” line, to his YouTube channel in 2011. The video features him and children doing a simple hand motion, resembling a shark’s mouth, to a bouncy beat.Baby Shark Song (Non-dismemberment version) by Johnny Only (2011)In 2015 and 2016, Pinkfong uploaded its versions with cartoon sharks singing in Korean, and later released it in English with children doing choreographed dances, including the shark’s mouth hand gesture.The South Korean company argued that its version was an arrangement of the same song, which it argued was in the public domain.The song is thought to have originated in the US in the 1970s and been popularised atsummer camps, with darker lyrics that ended withthe shark killing the singer. Some theories suggest it was created in 1975, around the time Steven Spielberg’s film Jaws became a global box office hit.Other versions of Baby Shark predate Wright’s video, including the FrenchBébé Requinand the GermanKleiner Hai (Little Shark), which became a viral hit in Europe in 2007.Kleiner Hai by Alemuel (2008)But none of them had the success of Pinkfong’s adaptation, which sparked viral social media moments such as the #BabySharkChallenge and reached No 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.Wright said he initially thought that “[Pinkfong] could go right ahead and use it” because the song was in the public domain.But he decided to pursue a copyright suit when he learned that Pinkfong itself had threatened legal action against a South Korean political party, the opposition People Power, who had used Baby Shark in a political campaign.“The wheels in my head start turning … Doesn’t that mean that my version also has copyright protection?” Wright told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2019.Scared of Baby Shark? A short guide to the year’s most annoying songRead moreWright said Pinkfong’s version seemed “strikingly similar” to his, highlighting that the two songs had “same key, same tempo change, same melody and rhythm”. He demanded 30m won ($22,000/£16,000) in compensation.The supreme court focused on whether Wright’s version could be considered a “secondary work” of the original children’s song, and whether Pinkfong had made its version based on his work.It concluded that Wright did not make “edits or changes to a level” that could grant him a copyright as a secondary work. Even with the assumption that his version was a secondary work of the song, the court said that there were “no substantial similarities” between Pinkfong’s song and Wright’s version.“All appeals were dismissed and the lower court’s rulings were upheld,” according to court documents seen by AFP.The Pinkfong Company said in a statement on Thursday that the supreme court’s decision confirmed Baby Shark was “based on a traditional singalong chant that has entered the public domain”.The company said it had given “a fresh twist to the chant by adding an upbeat rhythm and catchy melody, turning it into the pop culture icon it is today”.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaIntellectual propertyAsia PacificYouTubenewsShareReuse this content"

Yet she has rarely been treated with reverence. As she prepares for her first big retrospective, she discusses the secrets of her 40-year careerMorwenna FerrierThu 14 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 00.06 EDTShareWhen Anne Geddes began shooting her famous photographs, she soon learned she would need a backup baby – or 20. “Connecting with a child who considers you a stranger is high stress,” she says. “I remember trying to shoot one baby sitting in a tank of water, surrounded by waterlilies. It took five babies to make it work. One of them was even called Lily, but she was not having a bar of it. She looked at me as if to say: ‘You think I’m getting in that water?’”She describes the practicalities of one of her best-known shots, 1991’sCabbage Kids. It shows twin brothers Rhys and Grant with cabbage-leaf hats on their heads, each sitting in an upturned cabbage, turning to one another with mild alarm. Geddes’ assistant had tied a balloon to a piece of string, lowering it between them and whipping it up the moment they turned. Geddes got the shot.View image in fullscreenCabbage Kids, AKA Rhys and Grant.Photograph: Anne Geddes“That whole world has changed; that income has gone,” says the 68-year-old Australian from her home in Manhattan, New York. Technology has changed everything. She calls Cabbage Kids “authentic”: “The props were all real. It was all in my garage. It’s funny; with Photoshop and AI, it makes me sad to think that if you came to my work now, you might question whether it was real.“I think original stories will always prevail. That’s why having people and humans behind the photographs is important. AI can’t replicate that.”If you grew up in the 1990s, there is every chance that, like me, you tacked a Geddes poster to your wall. Babies upright in a flowerpot or a bucket, or gazing sleepily from a peony, a calla lily or a bed of roses. Some were dressed as bumblebees, others with little fairy wings, snoozing on a bed of crisp autumn leaves. The images are whimsical, otherworldly and sometimes plain weird. But they have that rare quality of appealing to children without being childish and have begun popping up again, often ironically, on social media.View image in fullscreenMiracle: A Celebration of New Life by Céline Dion and Anne Geddes.Photograph: Scott Gries/Getty ImagesThey were disseminated initially not just on Hallmark greetings cards, but also on the cover of Vogue Homme, in a Dior advert and even in a 2004 book with Céline Dion (the best image shows the singer holding aloft a baby asleep inside an amniotic sac).The height of that period, for Geddes, was appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show: “She came out carrying two babies dressed as bumblebees and we shot up the New York Times bestseller list!” But for many millennials, the peak of her fame was the episode of Friends in which Elle Macpherson’s character, Janine, moved in with Joey and attempted to “girlify” his apartment using Geddes’ photographTayla as a Waterlily.Geddes is striking, with silver hair, high cheekbones and bright skin, like Meryl Streep if Streep wore her cap backwards. She sits in front of a generic backdrop, warm, if a little reserved, speaking slowly and carefully about bumblebee suits and lily pads.It’s almost 30 years since she created Down in the Garden, a series of photographs of babies in and around flora and fauna, some of which will appear in her first ever retrospective, at the New Art Museum in Tübingen, Germany, this month.Among the 150 images are identical triplets sleeping in the hands of Jack, a school groundsman, whose hands also appeared in her 1993 photograph of Maneesha, a baby born prematurely at 28 weeks. For years, people have written to tell Geddes they keep this hopeful image on their fridge.View image in fullscreenTuli and Nyla.Photograph: Anne GeddesAnother photograph is ofTuli and Nyla. Geddes had two days in the studio, lots of babies and a giant Polaroid camera. “I had no props, but you need a vague plan when you work with babies, as you have to work quickly,” she says. When Nyla began fussing, Tuli rocked her and whispered into her hair. She grabbed the moment.Geddes refers to these prop-less, slightly quieter pictures as her “classic work” and the babies in flowerbeds as “what they know” – “they” being people like me, who grew up with them. “After Down in the Garden came out, it was all pots, pots, pots,” she says. “It was like I had a flowerpot tattooed on my forehead. People always want the flowerpots! But I’m like: I do other things. And what I’m looking forward to is that people will see the other work. This exhibition is really the first time anyone has asked me to do this.”Despite selling more than 10m calendars and almost twice as many copies of her seven coffee‑table books (for context, EL James shifted fewer copies of Fifty Shades of Grey in its first decade), Geddes hasn’t always been treated with reverence in an industry dominated by single-name stars such as Bailey and Rankin. Is it snobbery? “It’s just a bit of a guy industry,” she says. “[Men] would say: ‘I used to shoot babies, but then I moved on to landscapes.’ I was always puzzled. To me, babies are magical.”View image in fullscreenSusanna, Jaclyn and Charlee asleep in the hands of Jack.Photograph: Anne GeddesThe response to the baby pictures has sometimes been frustrating, she says. “People said I was a one-shot wonder. I’m just as interested in shooting pregnant women or new mothers. It’s just people don’t want to talk about that as much.” With some earnestness, she says she now prefers photographing anything pertaining to the “promise of new life, the miracle of pregnancy and birth”; she hopes the exhibition will draw attention to that. “I’ve found that once the Europeans say: ‘This is amazing,’ then the Americans are like: ‘We want this, too.’ It has to be that way round.”Geddes was born in 1956 and grew up on a 10,500-hectare (26,000-acre) ranch in Queensland alongside four sisters. They were country kids who attended a two-room primary school.Photographywasn’t a big part of her life: “I only have three images of myself under two and none of me as a newborn.”View image in fullscreen‘Babies are magical’ … Anne Geddes in New York.Photograph: Justin Jun Lee/The GuardianAs a teenager, she subscribed to Life magazine and became fascinated by the idea of telling a story through an image. Still, she lingered on the periphery of photography, going to work in television, where she met her husband, Kel. It was in those corridors that she came across the “magic” of the darkroom.Shortly after they met, the couple moved to Hong Kong, where Kel was running a new TV station. “Then we got married and I thought: I’ve got a roof over my head, now’s the time to pick up a camera.” She began putting up adverts in supermarkets, offering to photograph families and children, traipsing around their gardens and homes with a Pentax K1000 she borrowed from her husband.When she was back in Australia and pregnant with her second daughter, now 40, Geddes began taking her classic baby pictures. She realised that, in a studio, she could control everything. She started taking photos for new parents, spending months creating elaborate sets in her garage and trying out different props.View image in fullscreenChristiaan and Annaliese.Photograph: Anne GeddesA lot of the shots came about by accident. One day, a six-month-old called Chelsea was brought in for a portrait and Geddes spotted an empty flowerpot in the back of the studio: “We just popped her in there.” To keep her comfortable, she lined the pot with fabric. After a few months, she sent a collection of these images to a small greetings card company. That was that.At the beginning, she would put a call out for babies and take “whoever came through the door”. But she learned to be discerning. “Under four weeks is good. If they’re full of milk and warm, they’ll sleep.” She also liked working with six- and seven‑month-olds, “because they’re not mobile, but suddenly they’re sitting and have this whole new perspective. Also, their heads are too big for their bodies, which is funny.”“The more you charge [for a portrait], the more they want you to make magic with a two-year-old who is having a bad day,” she says. As she became well known, “people began sending in photos of their babies, or rang from the labour ward in tears saying: ‘I’ve just had the most wonderful baby.’ I was just like: ‘OK, yup, sure, let’s go.’”View image in fullscreenEmma holding Thompson.Photograph: Anne GeddesThe images that appeared in calendars, posters, books and magazines were always used “with the permission of the parents”, she says, and the parents were always on set. “To me, a naked newborn baby is perfect,” she says. “They are us, essentially good people, at the start of their lives, and that’s what I love about them. That’s what I was trying to capture. You look at these tyrants that are running rampant [in politics] and think: they were once newborns. What happened? Why didn’t your mothers just tell you to sit down and behave?”Her main inspiration is May Gibbs’ 1918 book Tales of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, about little brothers who went on intrepid adventures in the Australian bush: “Photographers have to have their own visual signature. This became mine.” Her success is unusual, given how kitsch her images are. “This subject of mine is not deemed to be art and that’s been evident throughout my career,” she says. But that was also the point. “It was meant to be a children’s story, not serious.”You look at these tyrants that are running rampant in politics and think: they were once newborns. What happened?Does she think it would be harder to make her images now, in the digital era, because of privacy concerns? She says she doesn’t think the web has affected her work in that way: “I know a lot of people talk about having their babies online, or not having them online, but this sort of work is not exposing the babies personally.”Geddes still refers to her images by the name of each baby, partly because she is still in touch with some of them. She recently put out a call, hoping to reunite with the babies, now in their 30s, many of whom are parents themselves.After we speak, I go to bed and begin scrolling through pictures of my own baby, asleep in the room next door. We love looking at our own babies, but why do we like looking at other people’s, too? We don’t always, says Geddes. She once came close to winning a big portrait award in New Zealand. “I remember the head of Kodak in New Zealand coming up to me and saying: ‘Thank God you didn’t win. How could we have a baby on the boardroom wall?’”Anne Geddes’ retrospective exhibition, Until Now, runs from 16 August until 21 September at Art 28, Neues Kunstmuseum Tübingen, GermanyExplore more on these topicsPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But if anyone can change this mindset it’s the US singer-songwriter Cass McCombs, whose 74-minute new double LP begins at the highest songwriting level and barely wavers. McCombs’ career stretches back to the early 00s, and this unassuming 47-year-old has steadily walked the valley floor of US indie ever since, often overlooked compared to his hyped peers, but perhaps with a longer career for it. This is his 11th album, not counting compilations, collaborations and a terrific posthumous album by New Hollywood icon Karen Black,which he oversaw.View image in fullscreenCass McCombs: Interior Live OakThe centre of his palette has always been folk-rock but the edges have held other imaginatively mixed colours: the vocal to his 2007 songThat’s That, a tale of youthful romance leading to a job as a toilet cleaner in a Baltimore nightclub, could have been crooned over pedal steel by a mid-century country star; his 2009 duet with Black,Dreams-Come-True-Girl, sounds like it’s been beamed from a homecoming dance in 1955. Amid his poetic, sometimes gnomic lyrics would come real-world details: in 2012 he told whistleblowerChelsea Manning’s story in song, whileNew Earth– from his previous and, until now, best albumHeartmind– addressed Elon Musk, heralding a bright post-apocalyptic world where “orchids mock him, spread so wide / With a lurid flavour his foul name could not hide”.That particularity and plurality is all over Interior Live Oak, full of dreamscapes anchored in real-world settings (New York’s George Washington Bridge, San Francisco’s Transamerica Pyramid), and backings that are both classically American but also have their own weird back-country accent.The album opens withPriestess, an ode to a late friend that harks back to McCombs’s California youth, again with specific detail amid strange painterly settings: “In our seminary of contradictions / Ella Fitzgerald, thizz and whippits / you were our priestess.” It’s core McCombs mode, grooving along in a slow lupine lope, rather like his best-known songBum Bum Bum. It gives us the first tear-jerking moment, too, as McCombs yearns to hear his friend sing John Prine’s Angel from Montgomery one more time.There are more tears to be shed on piano-driven balladI Never Dream About Trains, in which our narrator affects not to care about a lost love, his protests underscoring the devastation: “I never dream about you curled up in that old army jacket / On the sand in Pescadero / I never lie in my songs / And I never dream about trains.” You can imagine Tony Bennett or Frank Sinatra singing it, or another waltzing number, Strawberry Moon. The very best of the ballads is Missionary Bell, a song whose melody is so simple and expressive you can scarcely believe it hasn’t always existed. The bells of the title sound across a landscape of “wild fennel in the wetlands, nightfall hurling down”, as McCombs again considers death and the people it leaves behind.The album’s long runtime means that these all feel wonderfully unhurried, and it gives McCombs space for other expansive, ruminative songs. Asphodel putters along at the pace of the Modern Lovers’ Roadrunner, considering yet another dead friend as McCombs travels through a mystical bardo; Who Removed the Cellar Door? has the twang and wide-angled lens of spaghetti westerns; Lola Montez Danced the Spider Dance is a slow ritualistic stomp with the nihilism and dry heat of a Lorca play.Cass McCombs: Tip of the Sphere review – an enigma wrapped in a wayfarerRead moreDiamonds in the Mine is a grownup existential lullaby you might sing to a troubled partner;Peacehas an acoustic guitar riff of extraordinary dexterity and prettiness; Juvenile, a funny song that throws two fingers up at soulless ad men, is powered by a Devo-style organ line you’ll be humming all week. If anything, as the title track’s nervy Dylanesque fuzz-rock brings everything to an end, 74 minutes doesn’t feel remotely long enough with McCombs on this sort of form.This week Ben listened toLlondon Actress– Moscow“I’m a dragonfly, you’re a cockroach!” The 11th single this year from the young UK rapper-producer delivers on its boasts: a prowling cloud rap track with a repeated vocal melody pulsating through the fug.

Writer-director Zach Cregger is no stranger to this line of thinking; his 2022 horror movieBarbarianis very much a spooky-creature-in-the-basement movie for the #MeToo era. Now Cregger has returned with a movie that may well stymie anyone who has been trained by the last decade to search for an easy-to-track allegory within their viscerally depicted fears. His new movieWeaponshas received mostly rave reviews and positive audience response. But at least a few critics and fans are pivoting from complaining about obvious metaphors to ask … is that all there is? Is Weapons actually about anything? (To further delve into this question, of course, we’ll need to go full spoiler mode, so if you want to see the movie and haven’t yet, turn back now.)Weapons review – Zach Cregger’s slick Barbarian follow-up is a bumpy rideRead moreThe movie certainly alludes to plenty of hot-button issues. It springs from a chilling premise: one night in a small town, 17 children from the same third-grade class wake up at 2.17am, leave their houses, and disappear into the night. Parents are understandably distraught, and in looking for someone to blame seem to land on the students’ teacher Justine (Julia Garner), who is as puzzled and disturbed about this as anyone else. When Archer (Josh Brolin) angrily demands to know what was “going on” in his missing son’s classroom, convinced that Justine must have played some role in this tragedy, there are unmistakable echoes of social panics in an era where parents feel empowered to dictate what their children learn about at school. The fact that the movie’s school shutters, then must reopen before the disappearance is solved or its pain is at all healed recalls Covid-era school closures. And when Archer has a dream where he sees a giant AR-15 materialize in the sky above the town, it seems like an obvious reference to school shootings that have devastated so many classrooms over the past quarter-century.Or is it? Cregger actually says no. I co-host a horror podcast, and in ourinterviewwith the film-maker, he unequivocally said he was not thinking of school shootings when he wrote the movie. For him, that’s not at all what it’s about. (Though he did stress that he welcomes people’s interpretations, and in fact wanted to make something with that kind of flexibility.) He wouldn’t say precisely how he personally interprets the story, but he has mentioned repeatedly that it was something he started writing out of – hey! – grief, even if the movie itself may be more ambiguous as to its thematic aims.This leaves Weapons open to the charge that it’s not about much of anything – that it’s all great hook and solid technique in service of a thrill ride where some stray inspiration from Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia is more superficial homage than thematic link. The real question, though, is how bad of an offense this is supposed to be. Plenty of great horror movies are principally concerned with the visceral experience of watching them in the dark, rather than the talking points or takeaways they might hand over to the viewer in broad daylight. Subtext shouldn’t have to be plainly visible at first glance.Indeed, some of the skepticism over Weapons seems to stem from the fact that it turns out to be … a horror movie. The children in the movie are enchanted by a witch. The movie doesn’t say whether she’s always been a witch, or has turned to witchcraft in the face of a debilitating illness. But that’s why she takes control of these children, and various other adults at her convenience: to sap their life force, attempt to heal herself, and, in the meantime, use her control to make her victims do her bidding. So yeah, pretty witchy stuff, and her comeuppance has the gory satisfaction of a Brothers Grimm story fed through a powerful amplifier.View image in fullscreenThe cast of Weapons.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesThat wild, almost fanciful ending may strike some as reductive, especially when its first half plays more like a dark mystery like David Fincher’s Zodiac, or at least Seven. But is the spectacle of brainwashed children being turned against their older captor and ravenously destroying her so devoid of opportunities for interpretation? It’s not even that Weapons is demanding a lot of work from the audience – and that might be exactly what rankles some about it. Most of what happens in the movie is unambiguously explained; it’s the meaning that’s left up to the audience, and maybe some sense an incongruity between those two approaches. That’s a fair-enough critique, as is a thoughtful consideration that concludes none of the movie’s interpretations hold up to much scrutiny. But it’s hard to fault Cregger for making a horror movie that is more concerned with its own scary, twisty immediacy than its optics as a social critique.At the same time, maybe the discourse over the meaning of Weapons suggests that the eye-rolling about “metaphorror” has been overblown, too. Countless horror classics could very much be described as driven by metaphor. Some are murkier or more interpretative than others, but having a central idea and conveying it clearly isn’t a marker of hackdom. It’s just something that some hacky movies have done, often directly imitating very good ones. Think of Get Out, which may have been thornier than it was given credit for, but still has a trackable central conceit that’s not exactly obtuse; then think of heavy-handed Get Out knockoffs like Antebellum and Blink Twice with too much visible effort and too little inspiration.Jordan Peele himself followed a path not unlike Cregger’s when following up Get Out; his movies Us and Nope are immediately engaging visceral experiences with more allusions and evocations than clear signaling of a central metaphor. They may be more successful in that realm than Weapons, but then, that’s true of most movies when compared with Peele’s output. It’s the prescriptiveness – give us a meaning, or kill all metaphors – that goes against the nature of horror in general. The combination of the concrete and slippery is what makes horror such a compelling field; there may not be a genre better suited to blurring the lines between reality and a heightened dream state. There’s no single correct way to have a nightmare.Explore more on these topicsHorror filmsThrillerscommentShareReuse this content"

The script will be by Stacey Gregg, who has credits on TV series Mary and George, Little Birds and The Letter for the King.Production companies behind the project include See-Saw Films, whose past output includes The King’s Speech, Shame, The Power of the Dog and Slow Horses, alongside Nine Daughters (God’s Creatures, Lady Macbeth) and ie:entertainment, which acted as executive producer on Nothing Compares.O’Connor died in 2023, aged 56, after a string of hit records including the huge-selling Nothing Compares 2 U in 1990, and a tumultuous life marked with outspoken protest and controversy. In 1992 she ripped up a picture of the pope on US TV; in 1999 she wasordained as a priestby an independent Catholic group, and in 2018 she converted to Islam.According to Variety, the film will follow O’Connor’s early years in the music industry, “tell[ing] the story of how one young woman from Dublin took on the world, examining how her global fame may have been built on her talent, but her name became synonymous with her efforts to draw attention to the crimes committed by the Catholic church and the Irish state”.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsSinéad O'ConnorFilm industryIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

But what it does have, inevitably, are endless gonzo fight sequences in which Hutch is unfairly matched against half a dozen or so humongous goons, and winds up reducing these bullies to cat litter. There was a big scene in the first film set on a bus, and it seems to have become the Nobody franchise’s USP.The idea now is that Hutch is still working as an assassin but neglecting his family, so he insists on taking them all on a summer break to a cheesy vacation resort with a goofy water slide and silly cabins – a place to which his dad, the lovably cantankerous grandpa played byChristopher Lloyd, who comes along too – once took him when he was a kid. Inevitably Hutch gets involved with local bad guys, including a corrupt sheriff (Colin Hanks) and sadistically mean crime boss Lendina, played by Sharon Stone.And so the six-against-one punch-ups continue, to diminishing effect, with a massive war-zone-style finale in a funfair. The film does contrive to produce a dog for Hutch at the film’s beginning and end, in an obvious attempt to pump up his family-guy relatability. Odenkirk sells it conscientiously enough, although his fans may still prefer to remember his harassed lawyer in TV’s Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, or his psychotherapist in Arrested Development.Nobody 2 is out on 14 August in Australia, and on 15 August in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsBob OdenkirkChristopher LloydSharon StonereviewsShareReuse this content"

Born in 1904, just a few months after Luigi Dallapiccola, Petrassi’s early works were firmly neoclassical, but after 1945 he began to incorporate elements from his younger contemporaries in the European avant garde. He was also a distinguished teacher; among the many who studied with him were Ennio Morricone, Peter Maxwell Davies and Cornelius Cardew.View image in fullscreenPetrassi: Concertos for Orchestra Nos 7 & 8Petrassi’s eight concertos for orchestra are at the core of his orchestral output, and Naxos has now released recordings of all of them. The pairing of the last two, composed in 1964 and 1972, are typical of his later music, trenchantly argued, with fierce contrasts between strings and wind. It’s music of great resource and dramatic potency, even when the musical ideas themselves are not especially memorable. The performances from the Orchestra Sinfonica di Roma under Francesco La Vecchia feel utterly secure, and as a bonus they add the Sonata da Camera, for harpsichord and 10 instruments, which Petrassi composed in 1948.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

A week later, the town is surrounded by Malian slave raiders and Àjàyí is kidnapped along with his mother, sister, best friend and neighbours. He is taken to Lagos and sold to Portuguese slavers preparing to ship their human cargo to the Americas. But they are intercepted by the British navy, which releases Àjàyí in Sierra Leone, where he is recruited by missionaries. From there, he is put on a path that leads to him to study at Oxford and become a celebrated preacher, linguist and abolitionist who meets Queen Victoria.A remarkable tale of barbarism and resilience,Yorùbá Boy Runningis the final work by the Nigerian novelist and film-makerBiyi Bándélé, who died in 2022 aged 54. Weaving in Africa’s colonial history and imagined – and improbably comic – conversations between warring Yorùbá factions, it is based on the real-life story of Samuel Àjàyí Crowther, who was kidnapped in 1821 and sold into slavery. Crowther secured his freedom and went on to become the first Black Anglican bishop in west Africa.Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, who starred in Bándélé’s directorial debut Half of a Yellow Sun, is the narrator, expertly navigating the book’s huge cast of characters and dramatic tonal shifts. For Bándélé, Yorùbá Boy Running was personal, as it had a connection to his own family history. From the opening dedication, we discover that his great-grandfather was a slave who was liberated and who returned home to start his life again.Available via Penguin Audio, 7hr 15minFurther listeningThe Genius Myth: The Dangerous Allure of Rebels, Monsters and Rule-BreakersHelen Lewis,Penguin Audio,9hr, 6minAn examination of an overused word, Lewis’s study spans Renaissance artists, popular music behemoths and the big beasts of science as it asks why some are labelled geniuses and others are not.

That included two of Ravel’s best known scores: the suite Le Tombeau de Couperin and the ballet Mother Goose. At the heart of this latest instalment are Ravel’s three orchestral song cycles: the mezzo soprano Fleur Barron sings Shéhérazade, the 1904 settings of poems by Tristan Klingsor, and the 1913 Trois Poèmes de Stéphane Mallarmé, while between them the baritone Alexandre Duhamel is the soloist in the charming product of Ravel’s old age, which was originally intended as a film score, Don Quichotte à Dulcinée, from 1933.View image in fullscreenRavel: Complete Orchestral Works II.Photograph: L’AuditoriFor all the oriental beauty of Shéhérazade, delivered with suitably seductive warmth by Barron, it is the Mallarmé miniatures that shine most brightly here, with Morlot carefully teasing out the instrumental strands of the accompanying ensemble, beautifully played by the Barcelona soloists, to create a shimmering web around Barron’s lucid shaping of the vocal lines. Duhamel is equally meticulous in his presentation of the Quichotte numbers, though he, and perhaps Morlot, too, sometimes seems a little restrained when a bit more earthiness would be appropriate.The three sets of songs are framed by purely orchestral pieces, opening with the fanfare that Ravel composed for the collective ballet for children L’Éventail de Jeanne, to which Roussel, Poulenc and Milhaud were also among the contributors, and ending with Ravel’s own orchestrations of his Valses Nobles et Sentimentales, given a slightly louche but thoroughly appropriate edge by Morlot.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

This was after he failed to get her attention at her Eras tour show at Arrowhead Stadium, home to his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. Somehow,it worked: he managed to get the girl.Swift has now shed some light on how she felt about this approach.“It was such a wild, romantic gesture to just be like, ‘I want to date you’,” she said, looking at Kelce. But he “never did any proper logistical planning” to meet her at Arrowhead, she joked. He didn’t even contact her management. “[He thought] because he knows the elevator lady, that he could talk to her about just getting down to my dressing room. That’s how it works in 1973!”Taylor Swift reveals details of The Life of a Showgirl ahead of October release: ‘Infectiously joyful and wild’Read moreAs someone who is “genuinely terrified to open my DMs”, she said Kelce’s blunt announcement intrigued her.“This felt more like I was in an 80s John Hughes movie and he was just standing outside of my window with a boombox being like, ‘I want to date you! Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship bracelet’ … I was like, if this guy isn’t crazy – which is a big if – this is sort of what I’ve been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.”She described Travis as “a vibe booster in everyone’s life that he’s in. He’s like a human exclamation point.”How they handle attention about their relationshipJason Kelce asked how his brother and Swift deal with the intense public speculation about their relationship, including the numerous theories going around online. (“I’m way too invested,” Jason said.)“I don’t see a lot of things,” Swift said. “I’ve been in the music industry for 20 years. It’s pretty hard to hurt my feelings at this point.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningTravis Kelce said he’d learned from his girlfriend “how to be a pro about it”.“There’s still some wacko theories from the beginning that I was like, ‘Oh no, how is she handling this,’” he said. “The last thing I wanted to do was screw this up.”Finding humour in it helped, Swift added: “It’s at a point where … my name can be in the actual headline and it can still be none of my business.”The similarities between being a pro footballer and a pop starPart of Swift’s preparation for her three-hour shows on the Eras tour was repeatedly running full speed on a treadmill while singing the entire show. She said Eras required “a lot of physical therapy” and “a lot of being in a state of perpetual discomfort”, including aching feet and plenty of blisters.She saw similarities in Travis’ career: “I’m not getting hit by huge 300-pounders, but the heels …”“When I saw the recovery station in the hotel room after [the Eras show], with the toe-spacers … I’m telling you, dude, the similarities were crazy,” Kelce said. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. She does more than I do.’ … We related on how much torture we put our bodies through.”View image in fullscreenKelce (far right) joined Swift on stage during the Eras tour at London’s Wembley Stadium.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementTaylor sent her mother to buy back her master recordingsSwift signed with her first label, Big Machine, at 15, giving them the rights to her master recordings. In 2019, label head Scott Borchetta sold her first six albums to music executive and Swift foe Scooter Braun, who then sold them to the private equity firm Shamrock Capital for a reported $300m.‘Feels bigger than herself’: the importance of Taylor Swift’s latest victoryRead moreTo regain control over her catalogue after the sale to Braun – and to devalue his investment – Swift embarked on a project to rerecord the albums, rebranding each one as “(Taylor’s Version)” and adding new tracks.And in May,the singer bought back the master recordingsto all six albums, giving her control over her entire catalogue for the first time.On the podcast, Swift revealed she had been saving to buy back her catalogue since she was a teenager – and “it really ripped my heart out of my chest” each time it was sold.When the Eras tour ended, she sent her mother and brother to negotiate on her behalf with Shamrock Capital, not lawyers, because she wanted to convey the emotion involved.“‘[These are] my handwritten diary entries from my whole life; these are the songs I wrote about every phase of my life’ … Rather than send lawyers or management in a big crew, I sent my mom and my brother,” Swift said, crying. “They told them what this meant for me, they told them the whole story of all the times we’ve tried to buy it, all the times it’s fallen through.”She cried again as she recalled her mother telling her Shamrock had agreed to sell: “I just, like, very dramatically hit the floor … I started bawling my eyes out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I had no power in my legs to support myself.”She said an unexpected bonus of the “Taylor’s Version” rerecords was raising awareness among musicians about what they might be signing away. “I have so many new artists come up to me now and say, ‘Hey, I didn’t even know this was a thing.’”Taylor Swift really loves coming up with the Easter eggsPerhaps the biggest thing that separates Swifties from the rest of the population is their appetite for Swift’s Easter eggs – hints she drops about her future music or deep-cut callbacks to past songs. (Sorry, Swifties, everyone else is either bewildered or mildly exasperated by this.) For The Life of a Showgirl, for example, she left the stage at her final performance on the Eras tour by walking down an orange tunnel – the colour theme for her 12th album – and has peppered in references to both orange and the number 12 on her social media.“People are like, ‘The Easter eggs thing is getting a little Zodiac killer at this point.’ I’m like, as long as they like it, ya know?” Swift said. But: “I’m never gonna plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life. It’s always gonna be towards music.”She said her favourite was the 2022commencement speech she gave at NYU, while receiving an honorary doctorate. Swift says she planted “so many lyrical Easter eggs in that speech” that hinted to Midnights, released later that year.“I love numerology, I love math stuff, I love dates, that stuff I just find really fun,” she said.She might be on your baking blogSwift revealed that “my hobbies could be categorised as hobbies you could have had in the 1700s.” She likes sewing, painting, cooking and has “a different baking obsession every six months”.“I’m the luckiest man in the world,” Travis said.The couple are currently both “very deep in a sourdough obsession that has taken over my life,” Swift said, adding: “I’m really talking about bread 60% of the time. It’s become a huge, huge factor … I’m on sourdough blogs! There’s a whole community of us!”“There are a lot of people hoping that you’re on their blog,” Travis joked, to which Swift replied, “Oh, I’m on your blog. Girl, I’m on your blog.”Travis Kelce really likes ottersThe internet agreed Kelce was officially a good guy when a dig through his old tweets turned upthis charming nugget from 2011:“I just gave a squirle [sic] a peice [sic] of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy.”In between sourdough blogs, Travis shows her videos of wild otters, Swift said.“I want a wild otter so bad,” Travis said. “I just want to find these little creatures and be their friend.”Swift said: “He wants one specifically whose life he saved and who knows he saved its life … He doesn’t want to go up to an otter and take it from its mother. He wants to see an otter who is like, ‘My paw’s caught in a shell. And he’s like, ‘I got you.’ And then the otter’s like, ‘Thank you forever’, with its little paws.”“And then I bring him anchovies every couple months,” Travis said.Oh, and Swift has a new album comingThe Life of a Showgirl is out 3 October, with Swift revealing it is inspired by everything that happened behind the scenes while she was on the Eras tour.Travis shared his review: “It’s so much fun … I know there are only 12 bangers. It is a lot more upbeat and a lot more fun pop excitement. I think it’s a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on Tortured Poets, for sure.”“Life is more upbeat,” Swift said, laughing.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftTravis KelcefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Katabasis knows the slow grind of postgrad precarity: the endless grant grubbing and essay marking; the thesis chapters drafted, redrafted and quietly ignored by a supervisor who can’t be bothered to read – let alone reply to – an email. Living semester to semester, pay shrinking, workload metastasising, cannon fodder in a departmental forever war. Katabasis knows how it feels to spend your best thinking years doing grunt work to further someone else’s ideas, clinging to the bottom rung of a ladder you will never be allowed to climb: less an ivory tower than a pyramid scheme.Academia is a hellscape; Katabasis just makes it literal. The American author’s sixth novel is an infernal twist on the campus farce: David Lodge with demons. Kuang’s previous book, 2023’sYellowface, satirised the publishing industrial complex with an irresistible mix of gallows humour and gossip. A tale of toxic allies, commodified identity and hollow moralising, it was lapped up – with predictable irony – by the very people it skewered, like a real-life version of the stunt novel in Percival Everett’s Erasure. The year before Yellowface, in the cult hitBabel, she invented an elaborate, counter-historical version of Oxford University – and then blew it up. A literaryRhodes Must Fall.All of which is to say, Kuang isn’t subtle. She doesn’t allude; she indicts. Some structures are so intractable, she argues – so insidiously self-replicating – they can only be disrupted with blunt force. But she also knows that a joke can deliver the same hard clarity as rage; sometimes more. She doesn’t pull her punches, or her punchlines.In Katabasis, hell is not a roiling pit of fire, it’s worse: “Hell is a campus.” Cambridge postgrads Alice Law and Peter Murdoch are here on a quest. They’re searching for their thesis supervisor, the recently deceased Professor Jacob Grimes. The victim of a grisly lab accident, Grimes has exploded, and not just in rage. His body is in bits, and his soul is in the queue for judgment. Without him, Alice and Peter’s academic futures are equally damned. Their plan is simple: sneak into the underworld and haul him back. It worked so well for Orpheus.This is a novel that believes in ideas – just not the cages we build for themThis is the 1980s: post-structuralism is eating meaning and theory is eating itself. Our dauntless duo are scholars in “analytic magick”, an archaic and volatile branch of the humanities where philosophy is actually useful (that’s Kuang’s joke, not mine; don’t sic the Nietzscheans on me). It’s a similar discipline to the one Kuang invented in Babel, with the intellectual friction of a paradox harnessed and mechanised (“Magick taunts physics and makes her cry”). There’s special chalk involved this time, some algebra and pentagrams. Once again, it’s best not to think too hard about it. Just surrender to the conceit.The real dark magic in this book is self-delusion. As Alice and Peter wander the “eight courts of hell” (Dante was mostly right), they come to realise how deeply they’ve internalised the extractive logic of the academy. They’ve been taught to mistake rivalry for strength, exploitation for meritocracy, privilege for prestige, and endurance for resilience. To thank the system that feeds on them. The lie was so simple: you can be the exception, if you’re willing to be exceptional. And it was Grimes – rapacious, scornful and addicted to his own myth – who made them believe it. The quest to save him begins to curdle, but old allegiances run deep (“Professor Grimes hadn’t tormented just anyone. He’d tormentedthem… whatever they became when he was done with them would be so dazzling”). It’s not easy to shake a validation fetish.Scathing about the institution, faithful to the ideal: Kuang is a campus novelist to the core. Katabasis is a celebration of “the acrobatics of thought”. A tale of poets and storytellers, thinkers and theorists, art-makers and cultural sorcerers. It jostles with in-jokes, from the Nash equilibrium to Escher’s impossible staircase; Lacan to Lembas bread. This is a novel that believes in ideas – just not the cages we build for them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There was something queasy in that final, flaming gesture – a flirtation with martyrdom that never quite questioned its own romance. Death as purity. Destruction as justice. Katabasis is messier, and more generous. It turns away from the allure of heroic sacrifice toward something far harder: survival. It doesn’t ask what we’re willing to die for, but what keeps us here – the oldest and most obstinate of our philosophical questions, and the most beautiful.Katabasis is far from perfect. There’s a pair of blood-drunk villains who feel like a gory distraction, and a nonsense MacGuffin. Bone creatures clatter through plot holes. Grand mythologies collide and compete. Chunks of the novel read like aRowan Atkinson sketch. And the 1980s faculty politics look deceptively – or perhaps wearily – like our own (a fascinating companion read would be Helen Garner’s 1995 landmark provocationThe First Stone). But none of that really matters – especially if you have a score to settle.The heretical glee of this novel is irrepressible. I escaped from my PhD 14 years ago, and it really did feel like an escape; it still does. This book reminded me why. It also reminded me how it felt to ascend from a hell of my own making and not look back. I read Katabasis in a single sitting and then slept the deep, unburdened sleep of someone who’d never even heard of Foucault.Katabasis by RF Kuang is published by HarperVoyager (£22).

When they hear a bang on the door, the DJs of the illegal Blaze FM, youngsters and veterans alike, assume the authorities have spotted their antenna and come to shut them down.That is only rarely the case. As the early years of this century slip by, many other flashpoints from the outside world find their way into the Hackney council flat from where they broadcast.The attack on the World Trade Center brings anti-Muslim reprisals; violence associated with the drill scene leads to the banning of songs; the proliferation of knives results in the death of a friend; and redevelopment brings the threat of gentrification.Ways of Knowing review – foggy forecast from weather pioneers, mystics and scientistsRead moreThe past, too, makes its mark: new information about the death ofPC Keith Blakelockin the Broadwater Farm riots of 1985 gets the police interested in Hughbert Smith (Andrew Brown), the radio station founder who, under the government’s hostile environment, faces deportation.It is a grim tally, made harder to swallow by the station’s evident role in community cohesion. The dialogue can sometimes be clunky as the play races through the years, and the novelty of YouTube turns into the novelty of podcasting, but the seriousness of the theme and the sheer exuberance of the live music keeps energy levels high.Co-written by James Meteyard and grime MCJammz, it is briskly directed by Maggie Norris forThe Big House, which supports care-affected young people. Taking turns on the mic, a reticent Jason (Alexander Lobo Moreno) reinvents himself as Big J, a formidable MC, impressing fellow rappers Alpha (Aliaano El-Ali) and Pritstik (Marcus Reiss), plus the sweet-voiced Aisha (Anais Lone), an aspiring lawyer.

With its streamlined dramatic structure and built-in ballets, Gluck’s great reformation opera proves fertile ground for the company’s agile blend of acrobatics and contemporary dance.The action opens with the dying Eurydice tumbling through space. So extreme is Orpheus’s grief, it seems, that he has wound up in an asylum, strapped to one of a series of hospital beds that, along with a tiny glass house, make up Lifschitz’s minimalist set. The acrobats swirl over and under him – every man an Orpheus, every woman a Eurydice – recalling the emotional volatility of their relationship and Orpheus’s feverish hopes and fears for their future.Throughout this stark yet reasoned production we are never entirely sure what is real and what exists merely in the protagonist’s head. Are the sombre chorus members disembodied hospital orderlies or fellow inmates? The final scene suggests the latter, but the director keeps us guessing.View image in fullscreenStriking images … Orpheus and Eurydice.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianLifschitz is a master of the striking image: a human tower that collapses to audible gasps; a staircase of bodies that one of the Orpheus figures must ascend. Only the occasional wobble reminds us of the extreme athletic demands. Suspended loops enable acrobats to float and fly while hinting at hangmen’s nooses or restraints. White institutional walls are deftly lit by Alex Berlage in vivid crimsons, greens and minty blues. Libby McDonnell’s black, white and red costumes are simplicity itself; Boris Bagattini’s sparing video projections include occasional closeups on a troubled face and surtitles that cleverly dissolve in trails of mist.Beginner’s Gluck: how the 18th-century composer and a castrato changed opera foreverRead moreGluck’s three-hander opera is condensed here by combining the roles of Eurydice and Amor, as if Orpheus has lost the power to differentiate between the two.Iestyn Daviesis outstanding as the bereaved husband, his tireless countertenor rich and even, with memorably light and lyrical top notes. Physically he holds little back, at one point balancing on the shoulders of a cluster of acrobats. The climax, an affecting account of Che Farò Senza Eurydice, finds him abandoned on a bare stage, arms wrapped around his body as if in a straitjacket.Samantha Clarke’s soprano rings out bright and frisky as Amor before turning lush and sorrowful as Eurydice. Laurence Cummings leads the Scottish Chamber Orchestra through a bracing, finely judged account of the score, the ScottishOperaChorus matches his intensity, singing with power and discipline. Their unnerving final appearance as the bloodied Orpheus is strung up by the heels in his own private Bedlam is one of the production’s most haunting images.At Edinburgh Playhouse until 16 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicEdinburgh festival 2025reviewsShareReuse this content"

I mean, you could imagine Lou Doyle and Trevor White wanted their show to be about achieving the impossible and alighted on the phrase “pigs might fly” to encapsulate their vision. That would explain a scenario in which two animals leave their pigsty, disguise themselves as human beings, get past the check-in desks and gain employment as part of the cabin crew on a budget airline. These pigs really do fly.But that would be to seek a rationale for a show that does everything it can to defy logic. The pair may equally be the “flamin’ hot crash fetishists” described in the fringe programme. They certainly have a perverse interest in high-altitude accidents and emergency landings, even if they also have snouts and tails.Ways of Knowing review – foggy forecast from weather pioneers, mystics and scientistsRead moreNo, it is more fruitful to take Pigs Fly Easy Ryan as you find it: messy, exuberant and daft, complete with cabaret aesthetics, shoogly acrobatics and feverish monologues, not to mention cross-dressing and undressing. Directed by Kendra A Miller for Nonstop, Pigs Fly Easy Ryan is staged with such devil-may-care gusto it gives you neither time nor inclination to figure out the method in their madness.There is a bit of a theme bubbling up between the in-flight announcements: something about the irresponsibility of flying during a climate emergency and the obscenity of waste generated in the name of affordable luxury. The show is thetheatrical equivalent of a plastic waste dump, a place where the world’s excesses wash up, noisily and disordered, powering a manic, apocalyptic physical comedy.Hard to say whether they are angered or turned on by the evils of trash culture but, as they take joyful dives down the blow-up evacuation slide in this 2025 Untapped award winner, it is easy to enjoy the bumps and jolts of their turbulent flight.At theUnderbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalCabaretComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

At a festival that teems with ingratiating theatrics, it’s quite the gearshift to watch Elms deliver this hour of improv with no mic, props, a set or anything else prepared. We have to lean in, which is useful for a show that relies on the audience’s suggestions to crank things up.Some may find David Elms Describes a Room underpowered. But it’s right up the street of those of us who love improvwhen it’s not beholden to the gag, and given space to breathe. This solo offering, from an act better known assidekick to Nick (Mr Swallow) Mohammed, is built around an improv exercise in which a performer invites the audience to dream up and describe the room he’s occupying. There’s a stag’s head on the wall, someone proposes. There’s a window overlooking a mountain. With nudges from Elms, and just a little fun backchat, a picture takes shape of every nook and corner of this room – some kind of hunting lodge tonight, with “between five and 18” Russian men in a sauna just beyond the door.John Tothill: This Must Be Heaven review – joyful look at earthly pleasures brings us closer to standup paradiseRead moreIt feels like, and indeed literally is, scene-setting, in anticipation of a scene to come. One soon wonders, such is the detail Elms goes into and his unhurried style, whether any such scene will eventuate – or whether the describing is an end in itself. Were that so, this would remain an unshowy delight of a fringe venture, with Elms the softly spoken foreman of a construction site of the mind, located somewhere between the audience’s ideas and his own.We do finally see him occupy the space we’ve built, interacting wordlessly with each mimed item, suggesting, with an almost vanishing subtlety, narrative connections between this feature and that. As the audience laughs to see each proposal recalled, it’s an object(less) lesson in the transcendent power of collective imagining, and in how little is needed to bring a story and performance to life. It’s also a lovely, skilful and understated hour of extempore comedy.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)TheatreFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 2016 historical drama series tells of the rise of the powerful Florentine banking dynasty, and with it, the story of the Renaissance. Until recently, I could simply have gone to Netflix and found it there, alongside a wide array of award-winning and obscure titles. But when I Google the show in 2025, the Netflix link only takes me to a blank page. I don’t see it on HBO Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, or any of the smaller streaming platforms. On Amazon Prime I am required to buy each of the three seasons or 24 episodes separately, whereupon they would be stored in a library subject toovernight deletion. Raised in the land of The Pirate Bay, the Swedish torrent index, I feel, for the first time in a decade, a nostalgia for the high seas of digital piracy. And I am not alone.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For my teenage self in the 00s, torrenting was the norm. Need the new Coldplay album on your iPod? ThePirate Bay. The 1968 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet? The Pirate Bay. Whatever you needed was accessible with just a couple of clicks. But as smartphones proliferated, so did Spotify, the music streaming platform that is also headquartered in Sweden. The same Scandinavian country had become a hub of illegal torrenting and simultaneously conjured forth its solution.“Spotify would never have seen the light of day without The Pirate Bay,” Per Sundin, the then managing director of Universal Music Sweden,reflected in 2011. But music torrenting died out as we all either listened with ads or paid for the subscription. And when Netflix launched in Sweden in late 2012, open talk of torrenting moving images also stopped. Most of the big shows and a great collection of award-winning films could all be found for just 79 SEK (£6) a month. Meanwhile, the three founders of The Pirate Bay werearrested and eventually jailed. Pirating faded into the history books as far as I was concerned.In Sweden, 25% of people reported pirating in 2024 – a trend driven by 15-24-year-oldsA decade and a half on fromthe Pirate Bay trial, the winds have begun to shift. On an unusually warm summer’s day, I sit with fellow film critics by the old city harbour, once a haven for merchants and, rumour has it, smugglers. Coldbigstrongsin hand (that’s what they call pints up here), they start venting about the “enshittification” of streaming – enshittification being the process by which platforms degrade their services and ultimately die in the pursuit of profit. Netflix now costs upwards of 199 SEK (£15), and you need more and more subscriptions to watch the same shows you used to find in one place. Most platforms now offer plans that, despite the fee, force advertisements on subscribers. Regional restrictions often compel users to use VPNs to access the full selection of available content. The average European household now spends close to €700 (£600) a year on three or more VOD subscriptions. People pay more and get less.A fellow film critic confides anonymously: “I never stopped pirating, and my partner also does it if he doesn’t find the precise edition he is looking for on DVD.” While some people never abandoned piracy, others admit they have recently returned – this time turning to unofficial streaming platforms. One commonly used app is legal but can, through community add-ons, channel illicit streams. “Downloading is too difficult. I don’t know where to start,” says one film viewer. “The shady streams might bombard me with ads, but at least I don’t have to worry about getting hacked or caught.”View image in fullscreenLife on the open seas … Swedish-based filesharing website The Pirate Bay.Photograph: FocusDigital/AlamyAccording to London‑based piracy monitoring and content‑protection firm MUSO, unlicensed streaming is the predominant source of TV and film piracy,accounting for 96% in 2023. Piracy reached a low in 2020,with 130bn website visits. But by 2024 that number hadrisen to 216bn.In Sweden,25% of people surveyed reported pirating in 2024, a trend mostly driven by those aged 15 to 24. Piracy is back, just sailing under a different flag.Streaming was supposed to stop piracy. Now it is easier than everRead more“Piracy is not a pricing issue,” Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve, the company behind the world’s largest PC gaming platform, Steam,observed in 2011. “It’s a service issue.” Today, the crisis in streaming makes this clearer than ever. With titles scattered, prices on the rise, andbitrates throttled depending on your browser, it is little wonder some viewers are raising the jolly roger again. Studios carve out fiefdoms, build walls and levy tolls for those who wish to visit. The result is artificial scarcity in a digital world that promised abundance.Whether piracy today is rebellion or resignation is almost irrelevant; the sails are hoisted either way. As the streaming landscape fractures into feudal territories, more viewers are turning to the high seas. The Medici understood the value linked to access. A client could travel from Rome to London and still draw on their credit, thanks to a network built on trust and interoperability. If today’s studios want to survive the storm, they may need to rediscover that truth.Explore more on these topicsPiracyTV streamingTelevisionPirate BayMusic streamingInternetFilesharingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For connoisseurs, Bourne’s story definitively ended in 2007’sThe Bourne Ultimatum, which masterfully wrapped up the story that began five years earlier with The Bourne Identity. For the less discerning viewer, it ended with 2016’s scraggy and inconsequential Jason Bourne. For the three people who watched the USA Network’s 2019 series Treadstone, it ended there. So which is it?Gun for hire: what does Denis Villeneuve joining as director tell us about the new James Bond?Read moreTrick question, because Jason Bourne is never actually going to end, ever. This week, NBCUniversal haswon a bidding warto acquire all non-publishing rights to Robert Ludlum’s Bourne and Treadstone properties in perpetuity. The deal, described as “very large”, means that Bourne is now firmly as much a part of Universal as Jaws, Jurassic World and the Minions. It also means we are never getting rid of him. As the Universal Pictures president, Peter Cramer, said: “We’re energized to continue expanding the Bourne universe into the future with exciting new stories for global audiences.”This is potentially very interesting news, because if any franchise needs a shot in the arm, it’s Bourne. While its first three movies are rightly regarded as peerless, things really went off the rails after that. There was 2012’sThe Bourne Legacy, made without Matt Damon during that weird time where every franchise on Earth seemed to hire Jeremy Renner as its new face. There was 2016’s Jason Bourne, where Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon attempted to depict Bourne as a slightly narky nightclub bouncer. And then there was Treadstone, which didn’t feature Bourne at all and was canned after a single season.It might have been a wobbly couple of decades for the franchise, but it’s important to remember just how revelatory Bourne was at the beginning. As soon as The Bourne Identity landed in 2002, with its grounded, propulsive, parkour-based action, it instantly made every other film in its genre look creaky and ancient.View image in fullscreenMatt Damon in The Bourne Identity.Photograph: APIt was released in the same year as Die Another Day and, while Bond outgrossed Bourne two to one, the pure athleticism of the latter made the former – with its phalanx of invisible cars, diamond-faced baddies and shoddy CGI – look ready for the glue factory. Pierce Brosnan was ditched, Daniel Craig was hired and, tellingly, Casino Royale ended up being stuffed to the gills with an absolute Bourneload of parkour.Already there is talk of bringingMatt Damonback into the fold, with Deadline revealing that a script by Joe Barton has been written but not greenlit. And this would be the most sensible avenue, since people automatically equate Bourne with Damon and, thanks to his leading role in Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey next year, his stock has rarely been higher. However, he is also in his mid-50s, which puts him squarely in “Liam Neeson in Taken” territory, which isn’t necessarily the best long-term strategy for the franchise.Then again, the character isn’t exactly wanting for source material. Although Robert Ludlum wrote three Bourne books before his death in 2001, many, many more have been knocked out by various other writers since then. Maybe there’ll be an adaptation of 2009’s The Bourne Deception, or 2016’s The Bourne Enigma, or this year’s The Bourne Vendetta, or next year’s The Bourne Revenge. There is now such a glut of Bourne books that perhaps the character needs to be reset with a younger actor to get them all made.One thing to avoid, perhaps, is deepening the mythology too much. Treadstone proved that any appetite the character has for the Bourne franchise begins and ends with the character ofJason Bourne. We’re already drowning in watered-down IP, so the thought of sitting through a spin-off property about the madcap adventures of Julia Stiles sounds absolutely exhausting.Most pressing of all, though, is making sure that there is a place for Jason Bourne in the current landscape. Since the peerless original Bourne trilogy ended, James Bond has lived and died and been bought by Jeff Bezos. The MCU burst into life, dominated the market and then slowly asphyxiated on its own bloat. The go-to action blockbuster reference for a long time was Mission: Impossible’s maximalist stuntwork, but even that came unstuck in the end.We find ourselves in exactly the place we were at the start of the century. The action world has stagnated, and there is a window for something to come along and revolutionise the game. Jason Bourne already did this once. If he can come out of retirement and do it again, the investment will be more than worth it.Explore more on these topicsJason BourneThe Bourne LegacyThe Bourne SupremacyThe Bourne UltimatumAction and adventure filmsThrillersMatt DamonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Twitches and rustles from the huge array of percussion. A bigger picture emerges, anchored by the deep throb of low brass. Bitonal parps cut through like car horns in gridlock.A century after its premiere,Edgard Varèse’s Intégrales remains a beguiling listen – particularly in a performance as coolly loose-limbed as theBBC Symphony Orchestraserved up under Finnish conductorEva Ollikainen. Standing where the strings would normally be to marshal the piece’s sparse wind, brass and percussion, Ollikainen made angular, hyper-efficient gestures.That not-for-show approach persisted throughout – with sonically spectacular results – as each item on the programme demanded an incrementally larger orchestra. The UK premiere ofAnna Thorvaldsdottir’s Before We Fall (Cello Concerto) began with a splash of cymbal and a tutti chord that disintegrated rapidly into tapping and sliding out of which soloistJohannes Mosersoared, all generous vibrato and lyrical warmth. As with so many of Thorvaldsdottir’s scores, the concerto has an elemental, immersive quality, its symphonic textures seeming at times to breath as if a living organism. Elsewhere, the orchestra was in danger of swallowing Moser’s detailed passagework whole. Occasionally, the entire ensemble clicked briefly into tonal harmony – a remarkable, luminous effect.After the interval: Stravinsky’sThe Rite of Springwas performed with breathtaking clarity. The coordination was absolutely taut across the now-vast orchestra, the piece’s sudden cut-offs of phrases and ideas brutal, Ollikainen maintaining a knife-edge balance between effortful, friction-heavy string playing and woodwind solos that might hail from another planet. The piece’s tension between the mellow and the murderous, the natural and the machinic, felt genuinely high stakes: this sacrificial dance had serrated edges, every detail terrifying in its lucidity, its momentum intoxicating.The Rite’s power was only increased by a cool-as-ice performance of Ravel’s Boléro (earworm to end all earworms) at the end of the first half. Ollikainen’s air of detachment came into its own here, holding back the tremendous power of Ravel’s 13-minute crescendo until the very last minute so that the looping melody’s final crash to earth came as a full-on orchestral catastrophe.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

In 1991, seeing an opportunity to create a festival of literature at the historic house and estate, she began organising the first Ways With Words. Initially sponsored by the Observer, with the former editor David Astor as president, the festival launched in the summer of 1992 as an eight-day event of talks, readings and workshops, with speakers including Anthony Burgess, Andrew Motion,Fiona MacCarthyand Peter Ackroyd, and accommodation offered in the buildings and grounds of Dartington Hall.Ways With Words grew rapidly, spawning other festivals that we ran together, in Southwold on the Suffolk coast for 27 years from 1994, in Bath (1994-97), York (1997-2000), Bury St Edmunds (1995-2000) and Keswick in Cumbria from 2001.The festivals were marked by their collegiate spirit and the hospitality offered to participating authors. After Astor’s death, Roy Hattersley became president of the Dartington festival – which ran for 30 years – and Melvyn Bragg was president of the Words by the Water festival in Keswick.Born in Wigan, Kay was the daughter of Marion (nee Cunliffe), a bookbinder, and Harry Pedder, a bespoke tailor running the family business, and grew up in the town with a close family of aunts, uncles and cousins. She attended Wigan girls’ high school and studied at the Keele University institute of education, where she gained a certificate of education in English and drama.After college she moved with her first husband, Gavin Dunbar, to Suffolk, where both taught at Summerhill, the progressive school founded by AS Neill. They then moved around Hertfordshire and Essex, with Kay teaching in primaries and in the English department of Harlow College.Later, in Bishop’s Stortford, Kay had her first child, Chloë, while studying part-time for an MA in language and literature in education at University College London underHarold Rosenand the feminist historianDale Spender.In 1986, Kay and her family (now also including her son, Hamish) moved to Dartington. Both she and I had been enticed there separately by a small Guardian advertisement seeking teachers to help found Park school, a progressive primary on the Dartington Hall estate, after the closure of Dartington Hall school.There we met, working closely together for three years, and later married in 1994, after her first marriage ended. As Ways With Words took off, Kay gave up her teaching job to concentrate on the festival;Park schoolcontinues today and will celebrate its 40th birthday next year.In 2009 Kay was awarded the Benson medal by the Royal Society of Literature and in 2021 made MBE for services to literature.She was diagnosed in 2019 with the terminal neurological condition progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which, together with Covid, led to the demise of Ways With Words in 2023. The Cumbrian festival still continues independently.Kay is survived by me, Chloë and Hamish, and her brother, John.Explore more on these topicsFestivalsOther livesTeachingSchoolsobituariesShareReuse this content"

In 2025, there’sa lot riding on your choice of drinking vessel. The heady combination of worrying about the planet and, on a more day-to-day level, staying hydrated has made reusable water bottles a must-have.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Once the preserve of hikers and gym-goers, water bottles have become a small but significant act of environmental virtue signalling. Not all bottles are created equal, though. Some are insulated, some leak, some weigh as much as a toddler, and some even infuse your water with hydrogen (more on that later). The choice is dizzying.It’s time to lock in, reader. I’ve dedicated months to finding the best water bottles. I’ve bored my friends and family with tales of weight v capacity. I’ve thrown water bottles around my garden. Join me in the quest to stay hydrated and vaguely hopeful about the planet – and find your perfect water bottle along the way.At a glanceBest water bottle overall:Owala FreeSipFrom £31.99 at OwalaBest budget water bottle:Ion8 stainless-steel water bottle£12.99 at DecathlonBest stainless-steel water bottle:Frank Green ceramic reusable water bottleFrom £34.99 at Frank GreenBest water bottle for kids:Yeti Rambler Jr kids’ water bottle£22.50 at BBQ WorldBest sustainable water bottle:Ocean Bottle Go water bottleFrom £38 at Ocean BottleWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing products professionally for more than four years. I’ve assessed so many things, from tablets and trampolines to slow cookers and SPF. My family has become used to rating anything they come across out of five (not so welcome when it’s my cooking that’s being rated, if I’m honest).I’ve tested kids’ water bottles and cups before, and I’m also on a quest to better hydrate myself after several medical professionals told me I’m so dehydrated that I’m virtually desiccated (they didn’t use that actual term).In that quest, I’ve experienced school bags filled with water, mouldy water bottles that are impossible to clean and straws that melt in the dishwasher. Here, I’ve included only water bottles that went through my rigorous testing and came out on top. Life is too short to suffer a rubbish water bottle.How I testedView image in fullscreenThe bottles were hung from a washing line in a bag to test their leakproof claims.Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianI spent two months testing water bottles, trying out 42. I recruited my family as co-testers, and let my three children put the kids’ water bottles through what feels like the ultimate test: a day at a British primary school.During testing, I weighed the water bottles when empty and full. I dropped them from waist height on to a hard floor to see how they withstood the impact. I also put each water bottle on its side in a bag and hung them from my washing line for 30 minutes to see if they leaked. If the water bottles were insulated, I checked how quickly the liquid warmed over a few hours.As well as performance, I did a deep dive into sustainability. I wanted to see which water-bottle brands were all mouth in the eco-friendly stakes – what initiatives did they have beyond creating a reusable water bottle? And how durable and recyclable were the bottles? After testing the water bottles, I donated them to charity for resale.Here are the nine water bottles that performed best in my tests.The best water bottles in 2025View image in fullscreenSip, sup, swig … get into a good hydration routine with a water bottle you can trust.Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianBest water bottle overall:Owala FreeSipView image in fullscreenFrom £31.99 at Owala£32 at Urban OutfittersI challenge you to get through a TikTok doomscroll without coming across an Owala FreeSip water bottle. It’s been the “it” water bottle for a while, and it actually deserves the gen Z hype.The bottle comes in three sizes: 24oz, 32oz and 40oz. In my opinion, the 24oz (just over 700ml) is a perfect size: it fits in cup holders yet doesn’t need refilling every hour. The stainless-steel design is triple insulated and has a one-handed flip-lid opening. What sets the FreeSip apart is the spout – you can sip your drink through a straw or gulp it from the free pour.Why we love itThis is the water bottle I went back to during and after testing. A FreeSip is sitting next to me as I type this.Owala sells this bottle in a fun range of colours, so you can find one that fits your style. It’s also practical: the FreeSip doesn’t weigh much considering it offers decent insulation (it keeps drinks icy for hours, even in a heatwave).The FreeSip is also easy to clean – its lid screws off and the bottle is wide enough to really get in there and blitz it. The rigid straw is easy to scrub using a bottle brush, and so is the spout. There’s a removable silicone seal, which I haven’t found harbours any mould; I give this a soak and find it’s an easy job.Most importantly, I can chuck my FreeSip in any bag and be confident it won’t leak – I’m even happy to throw it in a bag with my laptop, which I’d be wary about with most other water bottles. It also survived the drop test, and I’m confident it’s built to last.During testing, many of my friends remarked on my FreeSip and then went out and bought their own, becoming converts themselves. OK, it’s more pricey than other bottles on this list (especially when you take into account shipping costs), but you’ll never get water-bottle envy again.It’s a shame that …the shipping costs and taxes on these water bottles are so high.Dishwasher safe:lid, yes; bottle body, hand-washBPA free:yesSizes available:24oz (710ml), 32oz (910ml), 40oz (1.2l)Weight empty(710ml):390gWeight filled(710ml):1.07kgBest budgetwater bottle:Ion8 stainless-steel water bottleView image in fullscreen£12.99 at Decathlon£13 at ArgosThe Ion8 water bottle offers much of the same functionality as others on this list, but at a fraction of the price. It’s stainless steel and has a flip-lid spout, with a carry hook in the lid. It’s not thermally insulated, though, which may account for why it’s more affordable.Ion8 produces this water bottle in an array of colours, so you’re sure to find something you like. At 400ml capacity, it can be slipped easily into most bags.Why we love itThis bottle passed most of my testing criteria with flying colours. Perhaps most importantly, it didn’t leak in a bag when laid flat for an extended period. It’s lightweight too – it offers less capacity than many bottles on this list, but it’s great for the commute and chucking in your bag on the run.My kids also liked it for taking to school and sports clubs. I appreciated that it fitted in my car’s cup holder – so many water bottles I tested didn’t.It remained unfazed by the drop test, too, so it’s durable. As it’s a tip-and-pour bottle rather than a straw water bottle (there’s an optional straw included, but I went without), it’s easier to clean. I personally found the carry handle uncomfortable to use, though: the loop is small and got stuck on my fingers.It’s a shame that …Ion8 says this is a one-handed opening flip lid, but I found it clunky. I needed two hands to open the bottle, and I usually like to think of myself as fairly dexterous.Dishwasher safe:yes, on a cool cycleBPA free:yesSizes available:400ml, 600ml, 1lWeight empty (600ml):259g (including straw)Weight filled (600ml):676gBest stainless-steel water bottle:Frank Green ceramic reusable water bottleView image in fullscreenFrom £34.99 at Frank Green£39.99 at AmazonI’d heard about how indestructible Frank Green water bottles are, so I was keen to see how they fared in my own tests. They’re customisable right down to the colour of the lid, bottle and style of straw. There was a menu of 17 bottle colours at the time of writing, from pretty pastels to utilitarian navy and khaki.The bottle I tested had a flip-straw lid, but there are five lid options to choose from. You can open the flip-straw lid with one hand, with the spout flicking open for you to sip from. It also comes with a flexible carry handle that’s big enough to be useful, plus impressive triple-walled insulation.Why we love itIt’s perhaps superficial, but I found the colours on offer appealing. My mint-green water bottle is easy to spot in my Mary Poppins-style tote bag without looking garish. And, during its time in residence at the bottom of said bag, I was pleased to find it didn’t leak a drop. The bottle also performed well in my drop test, looking as good as new despite plummeting on to a hard floor from a height.The mechanism on the flip-straw lid is smooth, even after several washes. Frank Green lines its water bottles with a ceramic coating, which it claims prevents that weird metal-tainted water taste you sometimes get. It’s hard to test this against rivals, but I never noticed a metallic taste. The straw inside is made from metal, which felt more durable – I’m all for less plastic in general.It’s a shame that …even the smallest (595ml) bottle becomes heavy when filled, perhaps because of the heavy-duty insulation.Dishwasher safe:lid, yes; bottle body, noBPA free:yesSizes:595ml, 1l and 2lWeight empty (595ml):340gWeight filled (595ml):870gBest water bottle for kids:Yeti Rambler Jr kids’ water bottleView image in fullscreen£22.50 at BBQ World£24.99 at Ann’s CottageYeti specialises in heavy-duty apparel, and no one needs a heavy-duty water bottle more than kids – specificallymykids. Everything about this insulated water bottle is robust, from the (slightly stiff) screw-on lid to the large, tactile carry handle. And adding to the utility feel, the bottle’s opening is wide – great for jamming in loads of ice, if you want.The double-walled insulation kept my kids’ drinks icy for about three hours, even on hot days. The Rambler Jr comes in nine bright colours, which will make it easy to spot in the classroom.Why we love itOne of the most important tests for kids’ water bottles, if you ask me, is the leak test. Too many times I’ve seen my kids’ reading books end up in a pool of water in their bags. Thankfully, the Yeti Rambler Jr passed this test.It’s easy to open one-handed, even for younger hands with less developed fine-motor skills. A rigid straw flicks up when you exert pressure on the tab. And this spout survived my kids knocking it around on the playing field at school, and didn’t seem to suffer any bite marks either.I liked that this bottle comes with two straws; it’s always nice to have a spare. And, as a time-poor parent, I was happy to find that the whole thing washes well in the dishwasher.It’s a shame that …there isn’t a wider selection of designs.Dishwasher safe:yesBPA free:yesSizes:355mlWeight empty:500gWeight filled:855gskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s a certified B Corp, and makes impressive pledges with every bottle you buy.As well as its eco credentials, I loved using the Ocean Bottle Go. It’s lightweight, has a flip-lid cap and a silicone straw inside. These bottles come in a range of shades and have a coating on the outside to stop them slipping through your fingers.Why we love itThe Ocean Bottle Go is brilliant for use on the go. It’s lightweight and small enough to slip into most bags, while the anti-slip coating means it doesn’t become slippery even when wet.It’s insulated as well, and kept the ice in my drink icy for almost 90 minutes – and pleasingly cold for a lot longer. This bottle passed my leak test with flying colours, too.As well as this, Ocean Bottle says revenue from each bottle soldfunds the collection of 11.4kg of plastic– the equivalent of 1,000 plastic bottles – that would otherwise be bound for the ocean.Using near-field communication and an app on your phone, you can track how many times you’ve refilled your bottle. From here, you can monitor your hydration, and if you’re using an iPhone, it will also transfer this info to your Health app – although you can switch this off. Each time you log a refill in the app, Ocean Bottle funds the collection of an additional five ocean-bound plastic bottles. You can see your “impact progress” in the app.I found this feature a faff, as you have to wave your bottle near your phone every time you refill, but I loved seeing my hydration and impact clocking up.It’s a shame that …for the price, the capacity isn’t larger (Ocean Bottle does offerlarger sizes of its Original bottle, though).Dishwasher safe:yesBPA free:yesSizes:500mlWeight empty:287gWeight filled:752gThe best of the restEcho Flask hydrogen water bottleView image in fullscreen£283.99 at Healf£299 at Echo WaterBest for:hydration obsessivesI first learned about hydrogen water bottles this year, and I was a sceptic. I mean, look at the price tag – are people really paying that for a water bottle? Then I got the Echo Flask in for review, and was converted.You plug your water bottle into the wall (I know, but stick with me here …) and charge it up. You then use the touchscreen on the water bottle to start a 10-minute cycle of releasing hydrogen into the water inside.There is a school of thought that introducing more hydrogen into your water reduces oxidative stress, improves your athletic performance and shortens recovery time. Some studies have been done to prove this theory, includingone on rats. Thejury remains outon exactly how amazing hydrogen water is for humans.It’s impossible to test these claims as I am just one person without access to a lab, but here’s my anecdotal experience: I drank from this water bottle every morning and noticed I didn’t get dehydration headaches, and never suffered a hangover.As you may expect for the price, the bottle pairs with a smartphone via Bluetooth and gives you lots of data to keep you motivated, if that’s your thing. This includes how many “flasks” you’ve consumed v the goals you’ve set, the length of your goal-meeting streak, and how much water and hydrogen you’ve consumed. It will also send you reminders on your phone for you to drink, should you forget.It didn’t make the final cut because …the price made me balk. And the lid leaked during testing.Dishwasher safe:No, but it mostly cleans itself.There’s a self-clean cycle you can select onscreen – for a deep clean, add a drop of white wine vinegar to the clean cycle.BPA free:yesSizes:12oz (350ml)Weight empty:487gWeight filled:793gChilly’s Series 2 water bottleView image in fullscreenFrom £15 at Chilly’s£30 at John LewisBest for:drinking on the goThe beauty of this bottle is its simplicity. There’s no Bluetooth connectivity or dual spouts here. So, if your water-bottle preference is free pour rather than straw, Chilly’s Series 2 is a great option.It’s well made and durable. The spout is curved to prevent spillages when on the move or in a rush, and I found it comfortable to drink from. It’s easy to clean, too.The metal bottle is double-wall insulated, and it kept my drink cold for hours. I liked the rubber base, which gave it a soft landing and protected it from bumps. A simple carry strap can be used, which I found useful (often on water bottles, I’ve found the straps superfluous to my needs).It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pricey for a simple water bottle.Dishwasher safe:noBPA free:yesSizes:350ml, 500ml, 1lWeight empty (500ml):302gWeight filled (500ml):805gAir Up Click water bottleView image in fullscreen£19.99 at Boots£25 at Sainsbury’sBest for:those who hate waterMark my words, this water bottle (which has enjoyed premium status in tweens’ lives for a good few years) is for kids more than adults. The idea is that you attach a scented ring-shaped plastic pod around the straw, and your mind is tricked into thinking the water is flavoured as you sip.I’m not convinced by this functionality. It works for a sip or two, but then my brain quickly realises it’s being tricked. However, my kids loved the concept and all the many child-friendlyflavours the pods come in. All the scents are made from natural flavours extracted from fruits, spices and herbs. It’s worth bearing in mind that the pods need replacing when they lose their scent, and they cost from£4.99 for a pack of three.I liked that the lid stays attached on the Click – previous versions didn’t offer this. Now kids can’t lose the lids in the school playground. Honestly, anything that gets my kids to drink water at this point is a win.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t pass the leak test.Dishwasher safe:yesBPA free:yesSizes:600mlWeight empty:170gWeight filled:770gStanley Quencher H2.0 tumblerView image in fullscreenFrom £35 at Stanley£45 at John LewisBest for:working from homeWhen staying hydrated crosses over into a personality trait, many people – particularly gen Z – seem to reach for a Stanley Quencher. Make no mistake, the Quencher is a style statement. It comes in an array of shades and limited editions with cutesy names such as “hydrangea” and “dried pine”.The 1.8l bottle I tested is enormous – my heart sank when I had to take it out of the house, despite the massive handle on it. It honestly took me back to the days when I used to carry a toddler on my hip, such is the size and weight. However, at home I was deeply into the Quencher. I found it brilliant during the working day as I didn’t have to refill it as often.There are three positions for the lid – covered, straw or sip.I tended to opt for the straw, but it’s not leakproof, so if you’re on the go, you’ll have to make do without it. Stanley says it keeps drinks cold for 12 hours – but I noticed my drink slightly warming after about four hours in my tests.It didn’t make the cut because …it’s impractically big, and therefore lacks the versatility of other bottles on this list (but it does fit car cup holders).Dishwasher safe:yesBPA free:yesSizes:590ml, 890ml, 1.18lWeight empty (1.18l):658gWeight filled (1.18l):1.8kgWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Take your time to find a water bottle you love, and you shouldn’t be tempted to replace it.’Photograph: CasarsaGuru/Getty ImagesWhat to look for in a water bottleThe key features are capacity and lid or spout style; make sure these fit your preferences and lifestyle. If you’ll be taking your water bottle out with you a lot, you’ll need to balance capacity against how heavy it is. You’ll also want something that’s reliably leak-free – look at the lid design and check the seals.Insulation is worth considering. Having used an insulated water bottle, I could never go back. Why suffer tepid water if you don’t have to?Most insulated water bottles are made from metal, which means they’re typically recyclable, durable and, importantly, BPA free. BPA (bisphenol A) is a synthetic chemical used in some rigid plastic food containers, andrepeated exposure may cause health problems. Always look for BPA-free water bottles – all the ones on this list are.Take your time to find a water bottle you love, and you shouldn’t be tempted to replace it; this will not only serve you well, but the environment too. Ideally, you should opt for sustainable water bottles that are made from recycled materials and designed for long-term use.How often do you need to clean your water bottle?Regular cleaning helps prevent bacteria and mould from building up in your water bottle. To keep your bottle hygienic, you should clean it properly at least once a day.That means taking it apart and giving it a good wash in warm, soapy water – a quick rinse under the tap won’t cut it. Soak your bottle for 10 minutes, then rinse with more hot water. It’s best to let it air dry rather than drying it by hand. Stick to environmentally friendly washing-up liquid if you’re keen to reduce your environmental impact. If your bottle is dishwasher safe, you can pop it in there instead.Are reusable water bottles environmentally friendly?Reusable water bottles are undeniably better for the environment when compared with their single-use plastic counterparts. In the UK alone, an estimated 35.8m plastic bottles are used every day, and just 55% are recycled.Producing a reusable bottle requires more energy upfront, but that impact is offset over time. The key is repeated use:an MIT studyestimates that a reusable bottle needs to be used between 10 and 20 times to break even with the carbon footprint of a single-use bottle.The more durable the bottle, the better. A water bottle that has a fully stainless-steel body is best, despite the carbon footprint involved in producing it. Stainless steel lasts longer, has a lower impact over its lifetime, and is easier to recycle at the end of its life than plastic alternatives.Zoë Phillimore is ajournalist with 20 years of experience.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My new home, however, comes complete with a drinks trolley, yet I’m scared to touch it. Why? Mainly because I just don’t think I’m capable of producing something I’ll actually like. Besides chucking some cold gin in a coupe and dropping in a poorly cut toenail of lemon, my mixologist skills begin and end at lumping a few liquids in a jug and calling it a “lazy girl cocktail” – although “cocktail” feels a rather grandiose term for creating what is, essentially, a domestic version of a Wetherspoon’s pitcher.The drinks I want to make – aclover club, aporn star martini, abellini, say – are out of my reach because I’m incapable of making a convincing fruit puree. I lose most of it to the walls of the blender, knacker my wrist grinding it with a pestle, add too much sugar or bankrupt myself by overbuying expensive fruit.So I asked Mez Austin, bar manager atMorchellain central London, for advice on how to make a foolproof puree from summer fruits. From just a single 150g punnet of berries, Mez says you can make enough for a small summer party of eight to 10 people. Simply introduce your chosen fruit and sugar to heat.How much sugar? Ah, that depends. “That will be determined by the fruit involved,” Mez says. “Pear puree, for example, will require a fair bit more sugar than strawberry or raspberry puree. It also depends on how ripe the fruit is – if you’ve bought it from a supermarket, I’d say maybe two tablespoons. Sugar also prolongs the preservation time of a puree.”Leave the fruit and sugar on a low temperature, with a lid on, for five minutes, take off the heat, then blend once it’s cooled a little. “Blending is the tricky part,” Mez explains (“No kidding!” I think). “Over-blending can kill the effervescence of a puree, so blend just until smooth, then stop immediately.”And there you have it: your very own DIY puree. You can now shake/mix/pipette it into myriad cocktails, but the easiest way to drink it is in a bellini. Mez has his own summer rendition, usingpét-natinstead of prosecco for a chic twist. “Pét-nats often offer a broader range of flavour: a really dry, sharp one works brilliantly with a summer fruit puree such as redcurrant or raspberry, while a slightly funky and sour pét-nat works well with pear puree in an autumn bellini.” Now there’s something to look forward to.Four tips for summer cocktailsBoiron Raspberry Fruit Puree£10.52 (1 litre) Henley Bridge, 0%.

I’m having a glass of inexpensive, decent wine in a waterside bar: and even on this picture-perfect night it’s quiet, with every customer around me speaking Dutch.This can’t be Amsterdam, can it? A city that’s overpriced, heaves with tourists, and is awash with busy canals and traffic. It feels a million miles away. In fact, the city centre is just 20 minutes up the road, because this is Nieuwendam, whose houses date from as long ago as the 16th century, built atop the dyke that kept the sea at bay from the pasture land that grew the crops to feed the city. I’m drinking inCafe ’t Sluisje, which for the last decade has been run by local residents. This is the most scenic quarter of Noord, the Amsterdam on the other side of the water from Centraal station.Noord is my home for the summer: my daughter and her Dutch partner live in Nieuwendam and I’m here to help with their baby, my first grandson. My childcare days are spent in leafy Noorderpark, or pushing the buggy through the shady woodland of Vliegenbos to the canal.A century ago this was Amsterdam’s industrial heartland, and the streets are lined with the uniform, steep-roofed houses built for the workers. Today, almost in response to the excesses on display down the road, the area is flexing its hippy, alternative, laid-back side: my walks take me past floating homes, the occupants of one of which keep goats and chickens in a repurposed fire engine. In summer, lives spill out onto the pavements: most houses have tables, chairs, even sofas outside their front doors, and a sunny evening quickly becomes a convivial street party. Down by the water, sculptures by local artists peek through the long grass, and you can jump into the canal for a swim.View image in fullscreenPllek, on the north bank of the IJ river.Photograph: Frans Lemmens/AlamyFor visitors, nowhere sums up the vibe of Noord better thanCafe de Ceuvel, a former shipyard, now a collection of shabby-chic vintage houseboats permanently moored around a meandering boardwalk; they’re now artists’ workshops and a yoga studio. The cafe is a glorious, colourful hotchpotch of recycled furniture, with some tables right at the water’s edge – it’s the perfect place to while away an afternoon drinking organic beers and wine. And if you need somewhere to stay, the Ceuvel has rooms in moored boats – itsHotel Asile Flottanthas doubles from about €150 a night.Today, almost in response to the excesses down the road, the area is flexing its hippy, alternative sideNoord’s best-known area is another shipyard calledNDSM, an open space larger than 10 football pitches that is home to myriad art galleries, museums and outdoor sculptures and installations. A free ferry transports you there in 15 minutes from Centraal Station – on the way, you get a good view of the futuristic, swan-likeEye Filmmuseum. This, along with theNxt Museum of technology, are among the most-visited attractions in Noord.

Movies are screened on its beach, which has stunning views over to the city.View image in fullscreenThe Nieuwendam district, Noord.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyMy advice, though, would be to venture a little further afield, to a street such as Johan van Hasseltweg, which stretches across the peninsula in the opposite direction from NDSM. This is the locals’ Noord, with its corrugated iron warehouses. Tourism is beginning to make its mark here, but only just: wedged between the long-established family businesses and garages are places such asOedipusbrewery, where you can try the citrusy, bestselling Bride, or the Pais Tropical, and which serves a melt-in-the-mouth smash burger. Nearby isChateau Amsterdam, an urban winery and restaurant (open Wednesday to Saturday) where grapes from across Europe are used to make sauvignons and chardonnays, pinots and fizz. And at the very end of the street, where you’re again at the water’s edge, is another beach restaurant –De VerbroederIJ, with its own food garden and pigsty.If you want to push the boat out, you won’t need a boat at all: it’s a few minutes’ walk toHangar, my favourite Noord restaurant. The food – mostly burgers and salad – and the wine are great. But it’s the ambience that makes it spectacular, with tables right by the water, and meals punctuated by giant barges cruising slowly by. Best of all, unlike many of the eateries in the “centrum”, it’s never packed.And beyond the area’s cool restaurants and vibe is the countryside – surprisingly close since 2018, when the metro’s line 52 expanded, making Noord station just a four-minute journey from Centraal. Take your bike (you can do this at off-peak times) and within a few minutes of arriving, you’ll be pedalling through lush fields and picturesque villages. Pack a picnic, because there isn’t much in the way of bars and cafes out here. But as an antidote to the overcrowded city, it’s unbeatable.Explore more on these topicsAmsterdam holidaysNetherlands holidaysEurope holidaysCity breaksShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Workers at the state-runAhmed Baba Instituteused rice sacks to smuggle the remaining documentsout of the city a number of ways, including by donkey cart and motorcycle.Mali’s military junta began returning manuscripts on Monday, citing the threat posed to them by humidity in Bamako. Officials said the first tranche involved a shipment of more than 200 crates weighing about 5.5 tonnes.“We now have a responsibility to protect, digitise, study and promote these treasures so that they continue to enlighten Mali,Africaand the world,” the country’s higher education minister, Bouréma Kansaye, said at a return ceremony.Local political and religious figures who have been clamouring for the return of the manuscripts hailed the move. The documents “reflect our civilisation and spiritual and intellectual heritage” said Timbuktu’s deputy mayor, Diahara Touré.View image in fullscreenA museum guard at the Ahmed Baba Institute displays a manuscript damaged by militants in 2013 before the removal operation.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersThere appeared to be limited enthusiasm, however, among everyday Malians, who despite being proud of their cultural heritage, seem preoccupied with immediate concerns such as economic hardship and insecurity.The Malian army and allied Russian mercenaries hold Timbuktu, but the surrounding countryside remains in the control of jihadists who carry out regular hit-and-run raids to unsettle the government. Militants detonated a car bomb near the airport’s military base in June, and at least 30 soldiers and about a dozen attackers were killed in the explosion and ensuing gun battle.Before the attack, authorities had attempted to show that they were in control by hosting diplomats in Timbuktu. The junta also plans to host a cultural biennale to showcase the city’s cultural heritage in December.Ulf Laessing, the Bamako-based head of the Sahel programme at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a German thinktank, said the government’s gestures were intended as a show of stability, projecting Mali’s ability to improve security.The militants have mostly attacked the military, but there are concerns that the symbolism of Timbuktu could eventually make it a tempting target.The manuscripts are unlikely to be targeted, but travel logistics remain fragile. UN and commercial flights operate weekly, but fuel shortages can strand passengers.Explore more on these topicsMaliAfricaHeritageAl-QaidanewsShareReuse this content"

It was removed, but within two days, people were forced to drink from that same water again,” he said.Sudan’s cholera outbreak was first confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Healtha year ago, and there have since been more than99,700 suspected casesand more than 2,470 related deaths.Thedisease is spreading as people flee fighting, and being worsened by heavy rains, which contaminate water and overwhelm sewage systems, public health leaders said.The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the public health agency of the African Union, has repeatedly raised concerns about the spread of cholera on the continent, whichas of May accounted for 60% of cholera casesand 93.5% of related deaths globally. Vulnerable and conflict-affected states such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan, as well as Sudan, are among the worst affected.MSF said its teams in Tawila, working with the local health ministry, had treated more than 2,300 cholera patients last month. The hospital’s 130-bed treatment centre had to accommodate 400 patients in the first week of August.About 380,000 people have arrived in the small town since Aprilas they flee fighting around the city of El Fasher andZamzam camp, according to UN records.While the World Health Organization says that during an emergency people needat least 7.5 litres of watera day for drinking, cooking and hygiene, people in Tawila must survive with an average of only three.‘They slaughtered us like animals’: the inside story of how one of the biggest atrocities of the Sudan war unfolded in ZamzamRead moreMSF said water shortages across Darfur made it “impossible to follow essential hygiene measures, such as washing dishes and food”.Cholera treatment centres in other towns and regions were also being “overwhelmed”, it said.“The health centres are full,” said Samia Dahab, a resident of Otash displacement camp in Nyala, South Darfur state. “Some areas have water, others have kiosks that are far [away] or empty. Some water is salty, and we drink it unboiled, unsure if it’s safe.”Tuna Turkmen, MSF’s head of mission in Sudan, said the situation was “beyond urgent” and “spreading well beyond displacement camps now, into multiple localities across Darfur states and beyond”.In neighbouring Chad, 16 deaths and 288 cases werereported in the second week of August.Turkmen called for an international response “to provide healthcare, improve water and sanitation services, and begin cholera vaccination campaigns in affected areas at a pace that matches the urgency this catastrophic situation requires”, warning: “Survivors of war must not be left to die from a preventable disease.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentCholeraGlobal healthSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The slogan “black is beautiful” rang out from civil rights marches in the US and UK during the 1960s and echoed through liberation struggles across the global south. It became a rallying cry against racist beauty standards that had long cast Black skin, facial features and hair as undesirable.These movements urged pride in what had been denigrated for centuries, and their message was not limited to people of African or Caribbean heritage. Calls to embrace natural beauty resonated across Asia and much of the global south, directly challenging the colonial belief that lighter skin conferred greater worth.Yet decades later, that belief seems to endure. Across the world, women of colour continue to use skin-lightening creams, many laced with toxic ingredients, in the hope of meeting beauty ideals shaped by colourism.Now, we are learning that the results are becoming even more devastating. For the first time, medical journals have reported rising cases of cancers among women of colour using skin-lightening products. The industry, now worth US$10.7bn (£8bn), isexpected to grow to US$18.1bnby 2033. Some reportseven describe these products being used onbabies and young children.To understand why skin‑lightening creams remain so prevalent, and what can be done to end their appeal, I spoke toProf Ncoza Dlova, head of dermatology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. That’s after the headlines.Five big storiesUkraine| Donald Trumptold European leaderson Wednesday he would be seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine at his summit with Vladimir Putin on Friday and gave reassurances that he would not make any territorial concessions without Kyiv’s full involvement.UK news| David Lammy hasreferred himself to the environment watchdogafter going fishing with JD Vance without the required licence during the US vice-president’s trip to the UK.Immigration| At least20 people have diedafter a boat capsized off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, a United Nations agency and local media reported on Wednesday.UK politics| Keir Starmer is to formallyrevive Northern Powerhouse Railthis autumn with an announcement expected before the Labour conference.Palestine| The United Nations special rapporteur for the occupied territories has warned that moves to recognise a Palestinian stateshould not distract member statesfrom stopping mass death and starvation in Gaza.In depth: ‘It’s psychosocial, political, historical – being lighter is seen as superior’View image in fullscreenSkin lightening, seen by some as producing a more desirable tone, removes melanin, decreasing natural protection from the sun.Photograph: Simon Maina/AFP/Getty ImagesRecently, a patient walked into Ncoza Dlova’s clinical office in need of support. She had dark-coloured pigmentations, known as ochronosis, and stretch marks on her face and neck. The marks were as a result of a skin-lightening cream she had used for three years. When Dlova asked why she used the cream, she told her that she wanted to look like a friend she felt was more beautiful.Patients like this are now a daily occurrence for Dlova. “I said ‘I feel sorry about your situation, but unfortunately, I have to be realistic with you: there’s nothing I can do to reverse your skin and make it look like it was before’,” Dlova remembers.“There was a clear contrast between the face and the hand, with the hand being much darker and the face being much lighter. And then she broke down there and cried. I told her, I know this is painful, but now what I can offer you is using sunscreens to protect your skin from getting worse, or even getting skin cancers.”The Guardian’s global health correspondent, Kat Lay,reported last monthon a string of cases of women dying from cancer after using these products for several decades. Dlova and colleagues are now working on a paper that cites more than 55 cancer cases, from countries including Mali and Senegal.“People don’t know the complications and side-effects. The patients I see who have side-effects regret it, and say they wish they’d known,” Dlova says.When did this become an issue?The use of these creams isn’t a new phenomenon. Reports of African women using skin-lightening creams and suffering harmful effects began emerging as early as the 1970s. At the time, these products often contained mercury as the bleaching agent, but their use wasbanned in South Africain 1975 due to the risk of brain and skin damage.Manufacturers switched to using hydroquinone instead. But in 1975, a professor at Pretoria University, George Findlay, wrote about the harms of hydroquinone in the British Journal of Dermatology. He explained that while the chemical initially lightens the skin, it later makes it rough with dark lumps that can turn into abscesses and ulcers. These effects seem to be accelerated by exposure to the sun, making them particularly dangerous for individuals who use them in African countries.Dlova tells me this paper was groundbreaking and led to bans in other countries such as Rwanda and Ghana. But their use continues today due to weak regulation, while other companies are now using steroids in skin-lightening cream.What are the side-effects?The melanin found in darker skin typically is known to offer some protection against sun damage (though people of colour should still wear sunscreen). Skin-lightening products work by removing the melanin and therefore this layer of protection, and can make some people look lighter, but they come with a whole set of complications. The combination of hydroquinone and steroids can be particularly dangerous.“The immediate complication is the thinning of the skin, where you find that a person can’t use any products. Whatever they use on the skin, it stings and it burns because the upper layer has been thinned. And then there’s also fungal infections, which are common, because some of the steroids also are immunosuppressants,” Dlova says.“You can also get steroid-induced acne or rosacea. And some patients, if they’re using steroids, get excessive hair where they are using their products. There’s stretch marks, because of the damage in collagens, and irreversible pigmentation, such as ochronosis.”The other side-effect increasingly raising alarm?Skin cancer.The huge problem is that many women are simply unaware. A study Dlova recently carried out, of 700 women, found that 30% were using skin bleaching creams. And of those who were using the products, 90% of them didn’t know about the side-effects.Is this justaffecting African women?View image in fullscreenA brand of skin-lightening product available in India.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersThe overwhelming majority of Dlova’s patients are women, though she does see some men. The reasons why are complex. “It’s psychosocial, political, historical, but colonisation is at the root of it. Being lighter is seen as superior,” she says.Researchhas found that lighter-skinned women often face shorter prison sentences, are seen as more intelligent in job interviews, and have greater career and dating prospects than their darker-skinned peers.“There’s so much pressure for darker-skinned women to change their skin colour,” Dlova adds. Just how much women are affected is still hard to say due to a lack of data. Across African countries,estimatesin studies of its usagerange from 25% to 80% of women.But Dlova was keen to point out that the use of skin-lightening products affects countries across the globe. “This is not exclusively an African issue. It’s a global phenomenon. It’s as common in South Africa as it is inIndia,” Dlova says, “We know about the caste system in India and we know about colonisation there and in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand. In all those countries, skin bleaching is pervasive. Even in South America.“It’s important to highlight that, because sometimes people say, ‘Why are Africans changing their skin colour?’ No, it’s everyone who’s Black or darker-skinned trying to be white because of colonisation.”How can we stop it?When a number of African countries banned hydroquinone, there was a slight reduction in the marketing of these products. But that’s changed in the past decade because of social media, Dlova says.Now, a growing number of beauty influencers on Instagram, TikTok and Facebook promote these products with a simple message of personal transformation, while their toxic ingredients are rarely acknowledged. Dlova believes regulation alone is not enough to push back on this worrying trend. She has called for public health campaigns to explain the immediate and long-term risks of using these products, as well as addressing colourism and colonial legacies.Dlova is part of a global working group set up by the International League of Dermatological Societies to address skin lightening. She explains that the group includes dermatologists from across the world, including Japan, Korea, the Philippines, India, South America, Africa, Europe and the US. It also brings together anthropologists, historians, psychologists, community workers and patients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It must go on so that people become used to it and they know.”Of this campaign, she said: “It’s something very close to my heart when I see these patients, some of whom are depressed or suicidal because they realise the damage from the products is permanent.

Under the agreement, Vectus will reportedly be given a role in Haiti’s tax-collection system.Haiti’s capital has been largely cut off from the rest of the country since February 2024, when armed groups launcheda joint offensive against the government, toppling the prime minister and commandeering virtually the whole city. According to the UN, more than 1,500 people were killed between April and July, mostly in Port-au-Prince. The majority were killed during security force operations and a third indrone strikes, which the government has started using to target armed groups.A source familiar with Vectus’s Haiti operations told Reuters its deployment would include snipers, intelligence and communications specialists, helicopters and boats.The use of private military contractors to fight Haitian crime groups has caused alarm among human rights advocates and observers, even if the security situation has become so dire that many Haitians have been calling for some form of foreign intervention.‘The ground shook’: drone attacks help Haitian government wrest control of capital from criminal gangsRead more“People are desperate for solutions, for help, for anything … People are willing to accept things they wouldn’t have been willing to accept not that long ago because of the desperation,” said Jake Johnston, the author of Aid State: Elite Panic, Disaster Capitalism, and the Battle to Control Haiti. “I can understand the level of trauma and desperation. But is this really a solution?” Johnston asked, predicting Vectus’s operation was unlikely to go well.Johnson called the deployment another example of Haitian problems being “outsourced” to foreigners instead of strengthening Haitian institutions such as the police. “What kind of a message does [this use of private contractors] send to … domestic forces that are underresourced and feeling like they are not supported?”Romain Le Cour, the head of the Haiti Observatory at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, called the move “a severe institutional setback” to Haitian police and the UN-backed security force sent there last year. Le Cour believed deploying foreign contractors would “deepen the strategic isolation” of Haiti’s police andthe Kenya-led policing missionas they tried to regain control.Prince’s group – which uses the slogan “we don’t just advise, we act” – has been working in Haiti since March. According to Reuters,it has been deploying dronesin coordination with a taskforce led by the prime minister. “[But] after six months of deployment, gangs continue to hold strategic dominance,” Le Cour pointed out.Explore more on these topicsHaitiUnited NationsXe (Blackwater)AmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Based on its wax numbering system, the FBI said the document was probably stolen between 1985 and 1993.Mexico requested the help of the FBI’s art crime team last year for this particular page.Investigators eventually narrowed the search to the United States and located the document, though the agency did not say who had it. The New York City police department, US Department of Justice and Mexico’s government were all involved in the investigation.Don’t call us traitors: descendants of Cortés’s allies defend role in toppling Aztec empireRead moreBecause the document has changed hands various times over the years, no one will be charged for the theft, the FBI said.It is the second Cortés document the FBI has returned to the Mexican government. In 2023, the agency returned a 16th-century letter from Cortés.“Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico’s history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better,” she said.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsMexicoAmericasUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras,” McLaughlin said.McLaughlin added that when there is a health issue, “ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.”The lawsuit comes amid claims and counterclaims about the number of people being swept up in the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts, and the legality of those efforts under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.There have been more than 1,000 deportation flights to 62 countries since Donald Trump was sworn into office in January, according to the immigrant advocacy group Witness at the Border.But that number of flights is becoming more difficult to track,the group warns, after air charter companies began requesting that their tail numbers be removed from public flight-tracking websites.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t have the resources to care for my children the way they need.”The other, Julia, said: “This whole situation has been incredibly stressful.” She had arrived in the US in 2019 after fleeing Honduras and applied for asylum, but was forced to wait in Mexico under Trump’s first-term “remain in Mexico” policy. She returned to the US in 2021.The lawsuit states that she was told to check in with Ice, bringing both of her daughters to her regular Ice check-ins in February 2021. But in April she went to an appointment and was soon told she would be deported along with her children.“I was lied to,” she said. “I never imagined they would send me and my children to Honduras. Returning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that’s been very hard. My daughters have also suffered a lot. We were deprived of the opportunity to be and make decisions as a family.”Her attorney claims that an Ice officer told her to write on a piece of paper that her daughter would be going with her to Honduras. When she objected, an Ice officer allegedly told her that if she refused, her daughter would be sent to a foster home.The Department of Homeland Security said in its statement to NBC News that it “takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected”.In a statement, Erin Hebert of Ware Immigration said Ice officials had “betrayed their most basic duty: to safeguard the wellbeing of US citizens.

The latest transfers took place after US authorities vowed that prosecutorswould not seek the death penaltyin any of the cases.Mexico expels 26 cartel figures wanted by US officials in deal with White HouseRead moreBut despite the claims from Sheinbaum and others in her government, analysts say these transfers are less about Mexico’s national security and more about appeasing Donald Trump, who has made going after drug cartels a hallmark policy of his administration – even going so far as to designate several Mexican criminal groups asforeign terrorist organizations.“I think [Sheinbaum] believes she can depressurize by sending a bunch of narcs that are already in custody … as an offering to placate Washington’s thirst for Mexican criminals,” said Tony Payan, aMexicoexpert at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. “They’re simply being put on a plane and offered on a silver platter.”Sheinbaum said that the expulsion of 26 criminals from organized crime groups including the Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa cartels was unrelated to efforts to reach a new security agreement with the United States.Among those handed over to US authorities were Abigael González Valencia, a leader of Los Cuinis,”, a criminal group closely allied with the Jalisco cartel, as well as Roberto Salazar, wanted in connection with the slaying of a Los Angeles county sheriff’s deputy in 2008.“In all of these cases, the extradition or the transfer of these members of organized crime, the decision is for the safety of our country,” she said during a news conference on Wednesday. “Nor do they have anything to do with the security agreement; they are sovereign decisions taken for the security of our country.”The Mexican security minister, Omar García Harfuch, echoed her comments, saying the move had been taken to stop convicted criminals from continuing to run their organizations from behind bars.“This action was taken to prevent the continued ordering of kidnappings, extortion, homicides and other crimes from prison,” he said.Sheinbaum hastaken numerous other actions to crack downon drug trafficking in an effort to appease the Trump administration, including deploying thousands of troops to the state of Sinaloa, a cartel stronghold, arresting dozens of top-level narcos and seizinglarge quantities of fentanyl.But Sheinbaum still faces increasing pressure from theTrump administrationin terms of economic tariffs which would hobble the Mexican economy. Perhaps not coincidentally, the timing of tariff discussions have been closely followed by the transfer of wanted criminals from Mexico to the US.The transfers in February came as officials in Mexico were attempting to put off the Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs on Mexican imports. This latest round of 26 criminal transfers comes just a few weeks after Trump spoke with Sheinbaum and agreed to delay the threatened 30% tariffs for another 90 days.“At the end of the day, Mexico hasn’t faced the levels of tariffs that were supposed to take effect because of fentanyl trafficking on February 1,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, a security analyst at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. “These types of transfers which for the Mexican government are not necessarily costly are a way of making progress in DC.”Mexico’s Sheinbaum wins plaudits for cool head in dealings with TrumpRead moreSheinbaum “is trying to show Washington that she’s pliable, she’s cooperative, she is responsive, and she’s willing to talk and she’s willing to concede”, Payan added.Still, according to Ilan Katz, head of the criminal law commission at the Mexican Bar Association, the claim by security minister Harfuch that these criminals continue to present a threat in Mexico even behind bars is not without merit.“Narcos in Mexico have had a lot of operational capacity even while in confinement,” he said. “One of the solutions is to effectively remove any drug trafficker from the country who might have communication with their criminal groups from prison.”The two mass transfers are also significant in that they are not technically extraditions, but rather the Mexican government simply acting unilaterally without the due process normally required by the justice system to complete an extradition.“Drug traffickers in Mexico have been able to evade extraditions to the United States through a series of injunctions and suspensions,” said Katz. “It’s the lesser of two evils to send this guy right now and comply with the extradition order rather than to continue keeping him here because of those suspensions.”But this too is problematic, says Farfán-Méndez, if Mexico is simply exporting its criminals without due process to be dealt with elsewhere.“It creates questions about whether this represents justice in Mexico,” she said. “What does it say about our criminal justice system?”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumDonald TrumpTrump administrationDrugsUS foreign policyUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Strains of the bacteriaKlebsiella pneumoniaeandRalstonia pickettii– some of which were resistant to multiple antibiotics – were detected in the patients.Investigators said the source was fentanyl, which it traced to the pharmaceutical company HLB Pharma and its laboratory, Laboratorio Ramallo.Tests carried out by Argentina’s drug regulator, Anmat, confirmed bacterial contamination in the deceased and in ampoules from two fentanyl batches prepared by the company – one of which had been “widely circulated”,according to the federal judge Ernesto Kreplak, who is leading the investigation.In an interview withLa Nación, the owner of HLB Pharma, Ariel García Furfaro, denied that the deaths could be directly attributed to his product, said his company pulled it from the market itself, and claimed that if the ampoules were contaminated, someone had “planted” the contaminant.The patients had been hospitalised for unrelated conditions and were given the drug for pain relief or anaesthetic, before becoming infected with the multidrug-resistant bacteria.Authorities say the contamination may have affected more than 300,000 ampoules distributed across Buenos Aires province, Santa Fe, Córdoba, Formosa and Buenos Aires city; an estimated 45,000 had been administered before the remainder were withdrawn and seized.“Argentina has never experienced such a serious case. It is unprecedented,” said Adriana Francese, lawyer for four of the victims’ families.The human toll has been severe. “The fentanyl caused their death within days,” Alejandro Ayala, brother of Leonel, who died at 32,told AFP last week.The mother of 18-year-old Renato Nicolini, who was hospitalised following a car accident and later died from the fentanyl complications, told Efe: “He began to improve little by little, and on the third day, they discovered he had pneumonia. His fever couldn’t be controlled, and seven days later, he died.”The ampoules from the affected batch have been recalled, andKreplakhas said: “Contaminated ampoules are not circulating today.” Yet the death toll continues to climb as investigators analyse more cases of patients who died in recent months after receiving the medication.No charges have yet been filed, but the court has named 24 people involved in the manufacture and sale of the opioid as suspects. They have been banned from leaving the country and had their assets frozen. Francese said the investigation was looking at how the contaminated batches were manufactured and what quality controls were in place. “This is going to be very important to determine responsibility,” she said.Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid approved for pain relief and anaesthetic, is between50 and 100 timesmore powerful than morphine.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Today, theBaby Shark Dance videois the most viewed on YouTube, with more than 16bn views, roughly double those of the runner-up, Despacito by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee, and third-placed Wheels on the Bus by the children’s YouTube channel Cocomelon.Baby Shark Dance by Pinkfong (2016)In 2019, the children’s songwriter Jonathan Wright – known as Johnny Only – filed a lawsuit in Seoul, claiming Pinkfong copied his earlier version of the original song, which is thought to have been around for more than five decades.On Thursday, the court ruled that Wright’s version “had not reached a level of substantial alteration” from the original for it to be considered a separate work, which means it is not protected as a separate piece of work under copyright law.Wright uploadedhis version, which also includes the “doo doo doo doo doo doo” line, to his YouTube channel in 2011. The video features him and children doing a simple hand motion, resembling a shark’s mouth, to a bouncy beat.Baby Shark Song (Non-dismemberment version) by Johnny Only (2011)In 2015 and 2016, Pinkfong uploaded its versions with cartoon sharks singing in Korean, and later released it in English with children doing choreographed dances, including the shark’s mouth hand gesture.The South Korean company argued that its version was an arrangement of the same song, which it argued was in the public domain.The song is thought to have originated in the US in the 1970s and been popularised atsummer camps, with darker lyrics that ended withthe shark killing the singer. Some theories suggest it was created in 1975, around the time Steven Spielberg’s film Jaws became a global box office hit.Other versions of Baby Shark predate Wright’s video, including the FrenchBébé Requinand the GermanKleiner Hai (Little Shark), which became a viral hit in Europe in 2007.Kleiner Hai by Alemuel (2008)But none of them had the success of Pinkfong’s adaptation, which sparked viral social media moments such as the #BabySharkChallenge and reached No 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.Wright said he initially thought that “[Pinkfong] could go right ahead and use it” because the song was in the public domain.But he decided to pursue a copyright suit when he learned that Pinkfong itself had threatened legal action against a South Korean political party, the opposition People Power, who had used Baby Shark in a political campaign.“The wheels in my head start turning … Doesn’t that mean that my version also has copyright protection?” Wright told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2019.Scared of Baby Shark? A short guide to the year’s most annoying songRead moreWright said Pinkfong’s version seemed “strikingly similar” to his, highlighting that the two songs had “same key, same tempo change, same melody and rhythm”. He demanded 30m won ($22,000/£16,000) in compensation.The supreme court focused on whether Wright’s version could be considered a “secondary work” of the original children’s song, and whether Pinkfong had made its version based on his work.It concluded that Wright did not make “edits or changes to a level” that could grant him a copyright as a secondary work. Even with the assumption that his version was a secondary work of the song, the court said that there were “no substantial similarities” between Pinkfong’s song and Wright’s version.“All appeals were dismissed and the lower court’s rulings were upheld,” according to court documents seen by AFP.The Pinkfong Company said in a statement on Thursday that the supreme court’s decision confirmed Baby Shark was “based on a traditional singalong chant that has entered the public domain”.The company said it had given “a fresh twist to the chant by adding an upbeat rhythm and catchy melody, turning it into the pop culture icon it is today”.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaIntellectual propertyAsia PacificYouTubenewsShareReuse this content"

Afterwards, Amir and his friend Hasan, who were both wearing Palestinian keffiyehs, went searching for food and stumbled across Jimmy’s Falafel on George Street.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAmir said while they were asking a restaurant employee if a table was vacant, a security guard approached the pair and said their scarves could not be worn inside the venue and had to be removed if they wanted to dine in.Palestine Action Group’s March for Humanity across Sydney Harbour Bridge – in picturesRead moreThe security guard said the directive came from the restaurant manager, Amir said. “We were quite shocked that this is happening to us, right in the centre of Sydney,” he said.Amir, who said he saw other people also being turned away due to wearing keffiyehs, said the pair calmly left the venue.Keffiyehs, traditional scarves worn across the Middle East, are often worn by peopleexpressing support for Palestine.A Merivale spokesperson said in a written statement that Jimmy’s Falafel was patronised by many who participated in the Harbour Bridge protest march on 3 August, including “many, many people wearing keffiyehs and hijabs”.0:34Protesters chant in support of Palestine during march across Sydney Harbour Bridge – videoThe statement said that a management decision was made at about 3.55pm “that people carrying large flags and placards should not carry or display them within the Jimmy’s Falafel venue”, after instances of members of the public “yelling obscenities and violent rhetoric” at Merivale venues on George Street, including comments such as “death to the IDF”, “death to all Zionist pigs” and “f***ing Zionist pigs and scum”.“Jimmy’s staff understood that decision as providing that persons wearing political garb and/or carrying flags and placards should be kindly asked to remove those items (place them in their bags) before entering,” the spokesperson said.“This meant that for the period 3.55pm to 4.15pm, people wearing political items of clothing were politely asked to remove those items and place them in their bags before entering.”Merivale CCTV footage, viewed by Guardian Australia, shows that during that 20-minute window, some patrons wearing keffiyehs left the venue or were turned away, while others removed them before entering or ordering takeaway.The footage shows other diners wearing keffiyehs inside the venue during that period, as well as at other points during the day.On the footage, which did not include audio, just before the start of the 20-minute period, protesters appear to yell into the venue.“To be clear, at no time was anyone refused entry or discriminated against due to their political or religious affiliations. As you can imagine, it was a day of thousands of people attending the city. It was a challenging time for venue staff, and we of course have an obligation to their safety and comfort. Merivale is politically neutral and has no interest whatsoever in disabusing any patron of their religious or political views,” the spokesperson said.“No Merivale venues including Jimmy’s Falafel have policies on customers wearing keffiyehs or other scarves.”Sharfah Mohamed, a lawyer at the Racial Justice Centre, said: “Our position is that Merivale’s conduct breaches the federal Racial Discrimination Act.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I felt humiliated,” he said.Hasan, who is Lebanese, said the keffiyeh resonates with Palestinians and is a symbol of “hope and freedom”.“We just wanted to become one with the Palestinian people and show solidarity with them,” he said.Amir said he now fears wearing a keffiyeh in public or expressing his opinion about the conflict in the Middle East. “I feel quite shocked, traumatised and humiliated,” he said.Qamar Albashir said he was wearing a Moroccan scarf when his group of six people approached Jimmy’s Falafel .

He said the group observed two other groups, where some members were wearing Palestinian keffiyehs, who were denied entry on the same basis.The man said his friend ordered takeaway food from the venue from the street for the group.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesSydneyIsrael-Gaza warProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

He said approving further coalmining would probably increase traffic on the Peak Downs Highway that connects Bowen Basin mines to Mackay and is a known death hotspot for koalas.In an environmental assessment submitted to the Queensland government, consultants for Glencore said the impacts from the clearing would be “unavoidable and would adversely affect habitat critical to the survival of this species”.About 600ha of habitat for the vulnerable squatter pigeon will also be cleared if the plans are approved, the assessment said.UN-backedresearch revealed earlier this yearthat emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane from the mine were likely between three and eight times higher than officially reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are working closely with state and federal governments to deliver an effective environmental management plan to minimise impact on flora and fauna in the Hail Creek project area.”The Guardian approached Watt for comment but was referred to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.A department spokesperson said it was aware of Glencore’s project, adding: “Any action that is likely to have a significant impact on a matter protected under national environment law must be referred to the department for consideration under the national environment law.”Explore more on these topicsQueenslandMiningWildlifeEndangered habitatsConservationCoalFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy’ things up, but you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term, OK?” Trump told Fox News Radio.He was referring to the possibility that Zelenskyy will have toaccept “land swaps”– in practice the handing over of Ukrainian territory to Russia, potentially including some not captured by Moscow.Later on Thursday, Trump suggested that any second, trilateral meeting could happen quickly – and possibly take place in Alaska.“Tomorrow, all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” he said. “I’d like to see it actually happen, maybe in Alaska.”Any such meeting would be a concession by Putin since he refuses to recognise Zelenskyy as the legitimate leader ofUkraine.Trump conceded he was unsure whether an immediate ceasefire could be achieved, but expressed interest in brokering a peace agreement. On Putin, he said: “I believe now, he’s convinced that he’s going to make a deal. I think he’s going to, and we’re going to find out.”Zelenskyy will face a difficult choice if Putin rejects Ukraine’s call for a full 30-day ceasefire and offers only a partial break in the fighting, particularly if Trump thinks a three-way meeting should still go ahead.The Ukrainian president spent much of Thursday in London discussingWednesday’s video call between European leaders and Trumpwith the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. European leaders were largely relieved with the way the conversation went, but know Trump is unpredictable and prone to acting on instinct, rather than sticking to a script.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet at 10 Downing Street.Photograph: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing StreetThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said changes on the battlefield could make peace harder. “To achieve a peace, I think we all recognise that there’ll have to be some conversation about security guarantees,” he said.Trump has rejected offering such guarantees before, but it is possible European security guarantees could be agreed. Rubio said he believed Trump had spoken by phone to Putin four times and “felt it was important to now speak to him in person and look him in the eye and figure out what was possible and what isn’t”.Starmer and Zelenskyy met in Downing Street for breakfast on Thursday and hailed “a visible chance for peace” as long as Putin proved he was serious about ending the war.European leaders emerged from Wednesday’s meeting reassured that Trump was going into his summit focused on extracting Putin’s commitment to a durable ceasefire and was not seeking to negotiate over Ukraine’s head.The plan for Trump and Putin to hold a joint press conference after their talks suggests the White House is optimistic the summit will bring about a breakthrough. Moscow is determined that the summit should not just focus on Ukraine but also agree steps to restart US-Russian economic cooperation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a separate statement, Zelenskyy said there had been discussions about the security guarantees required to make any deal “truly durable if the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killing”.On Wednesday Starmer co-chaired a virtual meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – a European-led effort to send a peacekeeping force to Ukraine to enforce any deal – where he said there was a “viable” chance of a truce.On Thursday the prime minister gave Zelenskyy a bear hug in the street outside the door to No 10 in a symbol of continuing British solidarity with the Ukrainian cause. Similar public displays of solidarity followed thedisastrous February meetingbetween Trump and Zelenskyy, when the two leaders quarrelled in front of the cameras in the White House.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy and Starmer embrace in Downing Street.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockFurther sanctions could be imposed on Russia should the Kremlin fail to engage, and Starmer said the UK was already working on its next package of measures targeting Moscow.Trump has frequently said he will know if he can achieve peace in Ukraine only by meeting Putin personally. He sets great faith in his personal relationship with the Russian leader, but on Wednesday he played down expectations of what he could do to persuade Putin to relent. At the same time he warned there would be“very severe consequences”for Russia if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire, a veiled threat to increase US sanctions on Russian oil exports.As Ukraine battles to hold lines, Trump may find Putin difficult to persuadeRead moreHe has so far held off from imposing such economic pressure on Russia, but by the end of the month the US is due to impose additional tariffs on Indian imports into the US as a punishment for India continuing to buy Russian oil.The UK would like to see the US consider other, more targeted sanctions, either on the so-called shadow fleet of Russian oil tankers or on refineries that use Russian oil. But Moscow briefed that the Alaska summit, far from leading to extra economic pressure on the Russian economy, would instead include discussion and agreements on new US-Russian economic cooperation, a step that would relieve the pressure on Russian state finances.Some European leaders took heart from the detailed grasp of the issues shown on the call by the US vice-president, JD Vance, and by hints that Trump could be willing to contribute US assets to a European-led security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement.The Alaska summit, due to start at 11.30am local time (2030 BST), will include aone-to-one meetingbetween Trump and Putin, with interpreters, then a wider meeting.The Russian delegation will include the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov; the defence minister, Andrei Belousov; the finance minister, Anton Siluanov; the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev; and Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaKeir StarmerForeign policyEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The ambitious countries – who want curbs on production – described it as “unacceptable”, a “lowest common denominator” and a toothless waste management instrument, because it did not include production caps nor address the chemicals used in plastic products.Countries from the “like minded” group, chiefly oil-producing countries and including Saudi Arabia, who want the treaty to focus on recycling and voluntary measures, said it crossed too many of their red lines and did not do enough to pare down the scope of the treaty.View image in fullscreenActivists staged a protest on the last day of negotiations of the treaty at the UN offices in Geneva.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesGraham Forbes, Greenpeace’s head of delegation, said: “The entire day has been behind closed doors. All of civil society is on edge, waiting to see what the next move is going to be from the chair and from the secretariat. We are nervous, we are anticipating, and we’re concerned that we’re going to be sold out in an effort to get a treaty at any cost.“Civil society, frontline communities, Indigenous peoples, everyone is united in wanting to see something meaningful here. And we’re praying that these governments are going to do the right thing and put our collective health before short term profits for the petrochemical sector.”A rush for a weak treaty in Geneva, Forbes said, “would be a disaster”.Some NGOs said they had “lost faith” in a process with the need for consensus between a majority of countries that want production caps versus a small but powerful minority of oil- and plastic-producing nations that continue to reject production limits.Christina Dixon, a campaign lead at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said the need for consensus was being “weaponised”.“A lot of civil society have lost faith in the process, because we’ve consistently seen a majority of countries aligning around a vision for the type of treaty that we’d be happy with. Yet, because of the way that this is being weaponised, we’re constantly bowing to a small but vocal minority who are holding it hostage,” she said.This system was allowing a majority of countries to be “drowned out”, Dixon said. She urged: “What we need to see tonight is that the views of that majority reflected fairly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But if the key components are there and we can build it in time, then we will be signing. By now, we’ve given up bans, we’ve given up production limits. We’ve given up so much, so much.“As ambitious countries, we want an outcome, and we see that if we don’t get an outcome, we’re risking a lot. But at the same time, we won’t take just anything.”Before this week’s talks,an expert reviewpublished in the Lancet described plastics as “a grave, growing and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health”. It estimated health-related damages globally added up to £1.1tn annually, with infants and children particularly vulnerable.However, some delegates were still hopeful. Sivendra Michael, the Fiji government’s permanent secretary for the ministry of environment and climate change, said: “There is still time. There are still processes that the chair can explore. There are many other innovative processes that have worked in other multilateral settings that can be explored.“It’s important for us to take a step back and reflect that we are negotiating at the edge of a planetary emergency.”The talks continue.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsSeascape: the state of our oceansPollutionUnited NationsOilSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Max SlovencikGrätzloasen – low-cost, urban ‘parklets’ built by volunteers – are on the rise in Vienna as sceptics are being won over by the splash of welcome greenery and boost to community spiritsByWill GrimondThu 14 Aug 2025 12.07 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 15.11 EDTShareIn a quiet corner of Vienna’s well-to-do 18th district, Jana is explaining how her assembly of wooden decking and planters is bringing a bit of greenery to the area. “There’s not a single tree on this whole street – it’s just parking spaces on both sides.”This is agrätzloase, or neighbourhood oasis – a miniature park tucked into the side of the road. With the blessing of the city hall, more than 100 of them have sprung up across Vienna. The scheme has been growing since 2015, and its proponents say it’s struck a rare balance for urban projects: cheap, community-driven and appreciated by local people.In theory, anyone in Vienna can build one. A city-funded organisation, Local Agenda 21, provides grants of up to €5,000 to cover construction costs and helps with the admin.Jana first heard about the scheme at a party in 2019 from someone who had recently put a parklet together. “A few weeks later I just went by and looked at it and thought: ‘This is so cool,’” she recalls. But it took until the winter of 2020 for Jana and her flatmates to consider building one themselves.View image in fullscreenGrätzloasenhave struck a balance of being cheap, affordable, community-led and appreciated by local people.Photograph: Christoph Liebentritt“It’s kind of complicated; you need to fill in a lot of paperwork,” she says. This involved three different departments of city government, and her group needed to cost everything up before they started.But she had a couple of things on her side. First, she lived with a carpenter, who could handle the nitty-gritty of actually building it. Second, the organisation told her there was another parklet being taken down on the other side of town that they could pick up and reassemble. The final hurdle was getting the street on board, with some residents pushing back against the idea.“While we were building it, I remember there were a few people looking at it very weirdly. A few days later, we had neighbours say: ‘Why would you take away a parking space?’” Jana says.But they seem to have come around. This spring thegrätzloasesaw more construction as they installed a retractable sunroof. “We had a weekend of building together. Everybody that walked by said: ‘Oh! This is so nice.’”The parklet is a huge source of pride for Jana, but it comes with certain challenges. In winter she has to deal with clearing snow from the decking, and during the summer the plants need watering every day.Thegrätzloasealso includes a box where neighbours can exchange their unwanted things. “Sometimes people just leave trash there, and it’s up to me to figure out how to get rid of it,” Jana says. And as the person responsible for putting together the parklet, she’s also responsible for taking it down – should she ever move, she’ll need to find a new custodian or be forced to deconstruct it.Vienna consistently scores highly on environmental and livability rankings – even if its quality-of-life crown wasnicked by Copenhagenin June. But these accolades obscure the fact that some districts are distinctly lacking in greenery, particularly in the centre-west of the city.“Vienna has more journeys by car than 26 cities inEurope, including London, Paris and Berlin,” says Rafael Prieto-Curiel, a researcher at the Complexity Science Hub in the city’s third district. He has collated mobility data from hundreds of places around the world.View image in fullscreenGrants are available to volunteers to cover the cost of materials, and the parklets have boosted Vienna’s environmental credentials and livability ranking.Photograph: Jana WieseDespite its excellent public transport network, a quarter of journeys in Vienna are still taken by private vehicles – a figure that ought to be a lot lower, he argues. Removing parking spaces could be one way of encouraging this.“Asphalt gets super hot – so if you have less asphalt, the city is more livable,” Prieto-Curiel says. Research shows Vienna saw nearly50 days of extreme heat last year, a number that’s been on the rise. He would like the city to go further and commit to tearing out paving en masse, asParis has done recently.Building parklets could be one way of warming people up to the idea. Sabrina Halkic, the managing director of Local Agenda 21, describes them as an example of “tactical urbanism” – low-cost, often citizen-led improvements to the built environment. She sees thegrätzloasenas a gateway to further changes.“Once people see that something can be done to make the situation better, they develop this bigger vision,” she says.In 2021, her organisation built agrätzloasein collaboration with a school: “We had [a parklet on] these four parking spaces. After those were a success, they said: ‘Why don’t we change the whole street?’” Last year they convinced the city to pedestrianise the entire road.Jana and Sabrina agree one of the scheme’s biggest pluses is it creates new places to hang out. In a city sometimes characterised – perhaps unfairly – as grumpy and unwelcoming, more communal space means a chance to chat to people you wouldn’t speak to otherwise.One Friday evening a group of friends is braving the drizzle to drink cocktails and catch up at thegrätzloase. Even later on, at a time when some neighbours may start complaining about noise, it’s nothing but smiles and “good evenings” from people passing by.Jana compares her parklet with the fate of a restaurant one block over. It closed down a decade ago, with its chestnut tree-lined garden paved over to make way for new apartments. Thegrätzloase– a place where friends can meet for the sake of meeting – is showing that things can be different.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesEuropeAustriaGreen citiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The two groups hurled bottles, stones and fireworks at each other.View image in fullscreenSerbian police detain a demonstrator during a standoff between ruling party supporters and anti-government protesters in Belgrade on Wednesday.Photograph: Đorđe Kojadinović/ReutersPolice arrested nearly 50 people across the country, and about 30 riot police were injured.

Police intervened with teargas, and stun grenades could also be heard.Frustrated with government inaction, protesters have demanded an investigation into the Novi Sad tragedy and piled pressure on the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, to call early elections.View image in fullscreenSerbian riot police stand over anti-government protesters in Belgrade on Wednesday night.Photograph: Marko Djokovic/AFP/Getty ImagesOver the past nine months, thousands of mostly peaceful,student-led demonstrationshave been held, some attracting hundreds of thousands. This week’s violence, however, marks a significant escalation and indicates the increasing strain on Vučić’s populist government, in power for 13 years.Serbia’s Exit festival may go ‘into exile’ amid government pressure over student protestsRead moreSince 28 June, when about 140,000 demonstrators gathered in Belgrade, the government has responded with an “intensifying crackdown” on activists, according to a statement by UN human rights experts released earlier this month.Protesters and those linked to the movement had faced a “troubling pattern of repression” including excessive police force, intimidation and arbitrary arrest, the experts said.Vučić has remained defiant, repeatedly rejecting calls for early elections and denouncing the demonstrations as part of a foreign plot to overthrow him.After the Novi Sad shooting incident, officials confirmed the man was a member of a special military police unit usually tasked with protecting government ministers. He had fired his weapon while “on a routine assignment when attacked by about 100 people”, officials said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They announced further protests for Thursday night.Vučić, who visited pro-government encampments overnight, denied his supporters had started the violence.“No one attacked them anywhere,” he said of the anti-government protesters, speaking at a late-night press conference. “They went everywhere to attack those who think differently.”While the protests have so far led to the resignation of the prime minister and the collapse of his cabinet, Vučić remains at the helm of a reshuffled government.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaProtestEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was placed under sanctions along with fellow far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir by the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in June for “repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities”.Standing at the site of the planned settlement in Ma’ale Adumim on Thursday, Smotrich, a settler himself, said the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, and US president, Donald Trump, had agreed to the revival of the E1 development, though there was no immediate confirmation from either.While approval for the plan would be a significant step, it remained unclear on Thursday how much buy-in Smotrich has from Netanyahu and the Trump administration.Netanyahu has not commented on Smotrich’s remarks, while the US state department appeared to dodge the issue of E1 when questioned.“Those in the world trying to recognise a Palestinian state will get an answer from us on the ground,” Smotrich said on Thursday, as he announced the plan’s impending approval. “Not through documents, not through decisions or declarations, but through facts. Facts of homes, neighbourhoods, roads and Jewish families building their lives.”The anticipated decision was immediately condemned by the EU. “The EU rejects any territorial change that is not part of a political agreement between involved parties. So annexation of territory is illegal under international law,” the European Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper said.Germany’s foreign ministry said it “strongly” objected to the plan, and called on the Israeli government to “stop settlement construction” in the Palestinian territory.The Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said the move by Smotrich, an ultranationalist in the ruling rightwing coalition who has long advocated for Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, showed that Israel “seeks to appropriate land owned by Palestinians in order to prevent a two-state solution”.While a UN spokesperson called on Israel to reverse a decision that would end prospects of a two-state solution, the US state department was more evasive.Asked about Smotrich’s statement that Netanyahu and Trump had agreed to the development, a spokesperson for the US state department said the US remained focused on ending the war in Gaza and ensuring Hamas will never govern that territory again. “A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace in the region,” the spokesperson said, while referring to the Israeli government for further information.The fraught question of E1 – and whether the land will ever be built on – has become one of Israel’s most interminable sagas, embraced by settler politicians but seen by more mainstream politicians as a red line over Washington’s previous history of firm opposition.Israel confirms plans to create 22 new settlements in occupied West BankRead moreWhile Smotrich, whose increasingly unpopular far-right party would be unlikely to win any seats if elections were held today, has spent the past 24 hours grandstanding on the issue, any decision to meaningfully advance with actual building on E1 would probably have to be made by Netanyahu given the diplomatic ramifications.Reflecting the strong international opposition, the UK’s Foreign Office said in July – when the issue of E1 re-emerged – that construction would be “a flagrant breach of international law” threatening the viability of a future Palestinian state.Smotrich’s remarks follow declarations in recent days by a growing number of countries of theirintention to recognise a Palestinian statein the coming months, which Israel has condemned.The Israeli NGO Peace Now, whichmonitors settlement building, said: “The Netanyahu government is exploiting every minute to deepen the annexation of the West Bank and prevent the possibility of a two-state solution. It is clear to everyone today that the only solution to the conflict, and the only way to defeat Hamas, is through the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The government of Israel is condemning us to continued bloodshed, instead of working to end it.”First mooted in the 1990s by the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, the E1 plan has barely advanced in the past 20 years amid recognition by successive Israeli governments of the depth of international opposition, including in Washington.Even with the tacit approval of the Trump administration, movement towards building would have severe diplomatic ramifications for an already diplomatically isolated Israel, leading to speculation that even with planning permission, the plan might not advance.Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

UN agencies and a small number of aid groups have resumed delivering assistance, but say the number of trucks allowed in remains far from sufficient.The letter was published as Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, backed plans for a major settlement development outside Jerusalem, which he said would represent the “final nail in the coffin” of Palestinian ambitions for their own state.The E1 settlement plan for more than 3,000 housing units – which critics, including much of the international community, say would split the West Bank from occupied East Jerusalem – is highly likely to be approved by a planning body next week. But it still remains uncertain whether the plan, which has been frozen for more than five years, will advance, given the likely international fallout.While his support for the plan was announced by Smotrich at a press conference on Thursday, it remains uncertain how much backing it has from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as does the attitude of Donald Trump’s White House.Smotrich’s comments come after many countries said they would recognise a Palestinian state in September.“This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognise and no one to recognise,” said Smotrich, whose extremist party has experienced a collapse in support.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelAidGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Iranian authorities have since subjected survivors to abuse, enforced disappearances and inhumane detention conditions, the rights group said.HRW’s investigation, based on satellite imagery, videos and witness accounts, found the 23 June Israeli airstrikes destroyed visitation halls, prison wards, the central kitchen, the medical clinic and administrative offices. No evident military targets were identified in the facility, which held more than 1,500 prisoners at the time, many of whom had been jailed for peaceful activism.“Israel’sstrikes on Evin prison on June 23killed and injured scores of civilians without any evident military target in violation of the laws of war and is an apparent war crime,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at HRW. “The Israeli attack placed at grave risk the already precarious lives of Evin’s prisoners, many of them wrongfully detained dissidents and activists.”At least 80 people died in the attack, which occurred during visiting hours, when public areas were at their busiest. HRW described the strike as unlawfully indiscriminate.

The US-based rights group Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRAI) said the Israeli strikes on Iran resulted in at least 5,665 casualties, including 1,190 killed and 4,475 injured, both military and civilian. The Iranian security forces also arrested 1,596 individuals during the 12-day war, the group added. Twenty-eight people died on the Israeli side, all but one of them civilians.In the aftermath, HRW said, Iranian authorities moved prisoners to two main detention centres in Tehran province – Shahr-e Rey prison, or Qarchak, for women, and the Greater Tehran Central Penitentiary, or Fashafouyeh, for men – shackling male inmates in pairs, beating some with batons and using electric shocks (on return to Evin) for protesting their handcuffing and the transfer of death row prisoners. Women were locked in their ward without water or phone access before being moved on 24 June to Qarchak, notorious for overcrowding and inhumane conditions.“Iranian authorities have committed a catalogue of violations against prisoners in the aftermath of the attack, including beatings, insults, and threats during transfers, and holding prisoners in appalling conditions that have endangered their lives and health. Death-row inmates and those forcibly disappeared are now at heightened risk of torture or execution,” added Page.Some detainees were returned to Evin 46 days later only to face similar violence during transfers. Authorities have withheld information on the fate and whereabouts of some detainees held by security and intelligence agencies, including dissidents, human rights activists, and dual or foreign nationals.‘A new wave of repression’: fears for Iran’s political prisoners after Israel warRead moreAmong them is Swedish-Iranian physician Ahmadreza Djalali, on death row since 2017. Families have reported only brief, monitored calls from missing prisoners, with no information on their location or condition, a situation HRW says amounts to enforced disappearance.Transferred prisoners have faced overcrowded, insect-infested cells, with some forced to sleep on floors. “Iranian authorities should not use Israel’s strikes on Evin prison as another opportunity to subject prisoners, including those who should never have been in prison in the first place, to ill-treatment,” he said.HRW has called for independent investigations into violations by both Israel and Iran, with those responsible held accountable for possible war crimes.This article was amended on 14 August 2025 to correct the death toll from the June conflict between Israel and Iran. A previous version erroneously gave the figure as “hundreds of civilians … on both sides”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranWar crimesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Days earlier, a flood andmudslide engulfed a villagein the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.The flood washed away a community kitchen and a security post in the village, a pit stop along the pilgrimage route to the Machail Mata temple, according to an official. “A large number of pilgrims had gathered for lunch and they were washed away,” they said.The Machail Yatra trail is a popular route up to the high-altitude Himalayan shrine of Machail Mata, which honours the Hindu goddess Durga, and pilgrims trek to the temple from Chashoti, where the road for vehicles ends.“The news is grim and accurate, verified information from the area hit by the cloudburst is slow in arriving,” Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of India’s federal territory of Jammu and Kashmir, said in a post on X.What is a cloudburst? The rare and intense weather event blamed for deadly India flash floodRead moreTelevision footage showed pilgrims crying as water flooded the village.Mohammad Irshad, a top disaster management official, said 56 bodies had been recovered from the site before rescue efforts were halted for the night.He said 80 people had been reported missing and 300 had been rescued, 50 of whom were severely injured and had been sent to nearby hospitals.Local officials said the death toll was likely to rise.The disaster occurred at 11.30am local time, Ramesh Kumar, the divisional commissioner of Kishtwar district, told ANI news agency, adding that local police and disaster response officials had reached the scene.“Army air force teams have also been activated. Search and rescue operations are under way,” Kumar said.A cloudburst, according to the Indian Meteorological Department, is a sudden, intense downpour of more than 100mm (4in) of rain in just one hour that can trigger sudden floods, landslides and devastation, especially in mountainous regions during the monsoon.The local weather office in Srinagar predicted intense showers for several regions in Kashmir on Thursday, including Kishtwar. It urged residents to stay away from loose structures, electric poles and old trees as there was a possibility of mudslides and flash floods.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherFloodingLandslidesnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the allied commander Gen William Slim did not mention the African soldiers in his speech thanking the 14th army.Dr Alan Jeffreys, the museum’s head of collections and research, said: “To put it in numerical terms, in the 14th army there were 340,000 Indian soldiers, 100,000 British soldiers, 80,000 African soldiers. That number of Indian soldiers only increased, it was a predominantly Indian army by the end of 1945.”In Britain, the forces in south Asia became known as the “forgotten army” as the focus shifted to the threat of Nazism that was sweeping through Europe.Beyond Burma, which opens on 16 September, featuresmedal groups awarded to Indian and African soldiers, as well as photographs and artwork. There is a focus on the reality of jungle warfare, the transformation of the Indian army, eventual victory and the campaign that continued during the 1940s in south-east Asia.The challenging jungle conditions affected the entire fighting force and inspired artwork, some of which is included in the exhibition.Jeffreys said: “There’s an artwork, And The World Was Covered in Darkness 1943, and it shows how claustrophobic the jungle could be. It was like an alien environment to pretty much all soldiers fighting that. The Australians in the Malayan campaign, the Indian and African soldiers and British soldiers in the Burma campaign, hardly anyone had fought in the jungle before.”View image in fullscreenAnd The World Was Covered in Darkness, 1943. Oil on canvas by Major Conrad “Dick” Richardson.Photograph: National Army MuseumThe artwork was painted by Maj Conrad “Dick” Richardson, who served in D-Force, which took small parties of men behind enemy lines to lay false trails. D-Force was commanded by Peter Fleming, the more famous – at the time – brother of Ian Fleming.The exhibition is an attempt to reposition the conflict in the public imagination.“The show is called Beyond Burma – the fighting was also in India, Indonesia and Vietnam. The story continues up until the independence of Burma in 1948,” Jeffreys said.“We want to show that many Indian-African soldiers were involved. Usually the focus is on British returnees and the prisoners of war – that’s generally what’s remembered in this country, or has been until more recent times.”There have been efforts to redress the imbalance. In 2013, Griff Rhys Jones made a documentary about his father who commandedGhanaian troops during the conflict. Biyi Bandele’s 2007 novel Burma Boy alsobrought the conflict to life.Ten years ago, to mark the 70th anniversary of VJ Day, there was a focus on capturing the stories of surviving African soldiers. Documentaries detailed some of their experiences, including being treated like “slaves” by the British, and more positive encounters with African American soldiers who arrived after the Japanese surrendered.“I knew Nigerians fought, but it was so distant I couldn’t place how it affected me as a Nigerian,” was how a grandson of one Nigerian veteran who served in south Asia put it.Explore more on these topicsExhibitionsBritish armySecond world warMyanmarSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

They take a mifepristone tablet, then wait for 24-48 hours and then take the misoprostol.“It is deeply disappointing that the successful application of mifepristone in one area of clinical medicine is hindering more extensive research into other indications that could benefit public health,” the opinion piece written by eight co-authors and published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women’sHealthsays. All are experts in reproductive health or reproductive cancer working in London, Edinburgh, Stockholm and Erbil in Iraq.“The time is long overdue to give mifepristone the opportunity it deserves to be investigated as a non-surgical option for primary prevention [of breast cancer],” they add.Breast cancer is themost common female cancer in most countriesin the world and kills an estimated 670,000 women globally every year, according to the World Health Organization.Although small-scale, the three previous studies offered evidence mifepristone can limit the effect ofthe hormone progesterone, which drives the cell growth found in breast cancer. They were published in 2008, 2022 and 2024.Mifepristone is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator.If proven to work, it could help women who are at high risk of breast cancer, such as those who carry a variant of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Currently they are offered surgical options for their treatment, such as a mastectomy, or drugs that are of “low efficacy”, the authors say.UK cancer charities endorsed the plea for drug companies to look seriously into the role mifepristone could play in breast cancer care and for governments to enable that to happen by easing regulations that restrict its use to abortion.Dr Simon Vincent, the chief scientific officer at BreastCancerNow, said: “More risk-reducing treatment options for women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, that also protects their quality of life, are desperately needed. And we need to explore all avenues, including existing drugs, to achieve this.“So early research into mifepristone is an important step forward and we need further studies to understand if these drugs are safe and effective.”Dr Marianne Baker, Cancer Research UK’s science engagement manager, said the 57,900 new diagnoses a year of breast cancer in Britain showed that “it’s vital we invest in research exploring new ways to prevent the disease”.She added: “Cancer develops when cells grow uncontrollably. Early studies showed that mifepristone slowed down cell growth in breast tissue, so it might be useful in delaying or preventing cancer.“But we need more research to understand whether it’s effective, how it works and who would benefit most from it.”Prof Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, the piece’s lead author, and who heads the department of women’s and children’s health at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: “Stigma around mifepristone used for abortion is describing part of why mifepristone is not more extensively researched for prevention of breast cancer.“Taken together, our data support the use of mifepristone for prevention of poor prognosis breast cancer. All studies were randomised controlled trials using a low dose of mifepristone for two or three months.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthAbortionHealthWomenBreast cancerCancerMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

TheBBCsaid it had removed “some of the language used” by Kandiah from a version of Thought for the Day posted online, saying it was not appropriate for the faith-based radio segment.In his statement, Kandiah said: “Mr Jenrick, I want your daughters and mine to be able to walk down the road safely and without fear. I worked with you when you were housing minister and the UK welcomed over 200,000 people from Hong Kong.“I was grateful for your support and compassion during that time. I would love to find a way we could work together to de-escalate the fear and anger many are feeling in our country. I believe we need to focus on the real challenges that are making people worried – housing, jobs and the cost of living – rather than ramping up anti-immigrant sentiment.”2:01Refugee charity founder calls Robert Jenrick ‘xenophobic’ – videoIn last weekend’s Mail on Sunday, Jenrick cited a series of recent crimes he said had been committed by asylum seekers, writing: “When I see these stories, I can’t help but think that it could have been one of my three young daughters. I certainly don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood with immigrant men with backward views who broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing.”In his Thought for the Day contribution, Kandiah quoted this passage from Jenrick, adding: “These words echo a fear many have absorbed. Fear of the stranger. The technical name for this is xenophobia.”While the government has not criticised Jenrick’s tone, and say the current row is a matter for the BBC, some MPs and others have said Kandiah’s description was accurate.View image in fullscreenRobert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, criticised ‘immigrant men with backward views who broke into Britain illegally’.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe Labour MP John McDonnell said: “Jenrick has become the byword for political opportunism.

She died two days later.During the inquest it emerged that the worker, who went under the stolen identity Ebo Acheampong, hadnever worked at any hospital before the day he was put in charge of observing Ruthand did not receive an induction before his shift.The jury at Beaconsfield raised concerns about training of agency staff at Huntercombe and said contributing factors to Ruth’s death included her not being prevented from accessing the material she used to harm herself.She did not receive therapy that may have helped while she was being detained under the Mental Health Act, family visits were limited though they may have helped her wellbeing and she was able to access harmful material on her phone, the jury heard.Speaking after the jury returned its findings, Ruth’s parents, Kate and Mark Szymankiewicz, who are respectively a GP and a consultant surgeon from Wiltshire,said: “There is an empty space at our table, a silent bedroom in our home, a gaping hole in our family that will never be filled.“Ruth was an incredible, bright, friendly, loving and adventurous girl with a whole life of joy ahead of her. She, like many other teenagers, developed an eating disorder.“When, at our most vulnerable as a family, we reached out for help, we ultimately found ourselves trapped in a system that was meant to care for her, to help her, to keep her safe, but instead locked her away and harmed her. As a child who thrived on her connection with nature, she was essentially caged.“Over the last two weeks, we have heard about the numerous systemic failures at Huntercombe hospital,” the family said. “It would be easy to be distracted by the failings of one individual. However shocking that conduct might have been, it is paramount that the other wider and more important issues are acknowledged and addressed.”Ruth was ‘an incredible, bright, friendly, loving and adventurous girl with a whole life of joy ahead of her’, her parents said.Photograph: Family handout/PAHealth experts told the Guardian that many of the issues around the use of agency staff and the shortage of psychiatric intensive care units for children and young people was still a huge problem.Andrew Molodynski, the British Medical Association’s mental health lead, said there was a “gap in accountability” over the training and vetting of agency staff. He said it was often mental health inpatient units, with the most high-risk individuals, that relied on agency staff the most, especially when they had patients like Ruth needing one-to-one supervision.He said this was a “toxic catch-22 … You end up with very few people who know the ward and know the patients”.Minesh Patel, an associate director of policy and campaigns at the mental health charityMind, said Ruth’s case was “a clearcut example of the many systemic issues in our mental health hospitals”.He said: “An overreliance on agency staff can compromise patient safety, quality of care, and in the worst cases lead to serious harm or loss of life.”During the inquest, Dr Gillian Combe, the clinical director for the provider group that commissioned Ruth’s placement, said the understaffing seen at Huntercombe still existed.She expressed frustration at rules in England that make it hard for new NHS units to be built, meaning provider groups have to rely on sending patients to private units.Combe said this situation arose afterAndrew Lansley’s changes to the NHS– described by some as “creeping privatisation” – when he was the health secretary from 2010 to 2012. She said there were no psychiatric intensive care units for children and young people in the whole of south-west England.Jodie Anderson, a senior caseworker at the charity Inquest,said: “The jury’s findings are a stark indictment of a mental health system that sent a vulnerable child far from home to a private unit with dangerously inadequate care.”Dr Amit Chatterjee, the chief medical officer atActive Care Group, which owned and ran Huntercombe, told the inquest that the company had worked hard to improve recruitment and its induction process.Huntercombe has closed but Chatterjee said the company had increased therapeutic care at its current site for young people, Ivetsey Bank hospital in Staffordshire.The inquest heard that after learning that Ruth had died, the worker known as Acheampong fled from the UK to Ghana. Thames Valley police said they knew his real identity but did not have enough evidence to try to get him back.The use of agency staff in mental health settings has been cited as a big problem in numerous reviews and inquest conclusions. In the case ofLily Lucas, a 28-year-old woman who died in 2022 from excessive fluid intake brought on by schizophrenia, an NHS review found that some agency nurses on her privately run ward did not know how to use 999.A Care Quality Commissionreporton the Mental Health Act said patients had described agency staff as “not friendly” and “less caring” towards patients, and detrimental to morale among permanent staff.In the UK, the youth suicide prevention charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

There’s really only so much abuse one person can take. However, I’m still here. Because I have too many books in me that I still want to write.”Nominated writers boycotting the prize over Boyne’s inclusion included the Guardian journalistJason Okundaye, whose Revolutionary Acts was nominated for the first book prize longlist and Andrew McMillan, the author of Pity, which was longlisted for the overall Polari prize for a non-debut book.Alice Oseman, the author of Heartstopper, along with the writers Nikesh Shukla, Julia Armfield, Naoise Dolan, Seán Hewitt and Kirsty Logan are among the hundreds to have signed the statement against Boyne’s inclusion on the list.It said Boyne had “unequivocally associated himself with trans exclusionary sentiments” and that his inclusion on the list was “inappropriate and hurtful to the wider community of LGBTQ+ readers and writers”.“In any year, the decision to include Mr Boyne on the longlist would be, in our view, inappropriate and hurtful to the wider community of LGBTQ+ readers and writers,” the statement read. “That the decision has been made this year – in the context of rising anti-trans hatred and systematic exclusion of trans people from public life in the UK and across the world – is inexcusable.”But Boyne has received support from prominent gender-critical writers, including JK Rowling. Last week, Rowling responded to the authors’ statement against him bywriting on X: “Oh, fuck off. I hope everyone buys twice as many John Boyne books, a) because he’s brilliant, and b) to piss off the Gender Taliban.”In response to Boyne’s statement, the writer and former Guardian columnistJulie Bindel posted: “I am proud to know you, John. Thank you for your support for women, including lesbians, and gay men. And shame on the bullies. You deserve to stand proud.”In his statement, Boyne set out his views on trans rights. He said: “All human beings should have the same rights, but if the rights of trans women come into conflict with the rights of what you call ‘cis’ women, then the latter must take precedence.”He said he accepted that the organisers of the petition against him may have “meant well”. But he said they had “forgotten a crucial fact”. “That the novelist you’re protesting, and the novel you tried to exclude, is part of a sequence about sexual abuse from a gay man who endured that very trauma at school, was denied justice because my abuser died in the months leading up to the trial, and is still coping with not getting my day in court.”Boyne said: “It seems absurd and wrong to me that so many debut writers are losing their opportunity for this, either through misguided ideas about who I am or, as I’m aware has happened in some cases, because you too were bullied or intimated into withdrawing.”He added: “I would encourage all the debut writers on the Polari longlist to return to the list, to look forward to the shortlist announcement and, in time, the fun and excitement of the ceremony. One of you gets to win the prize, and that’s as it should be. The organisers stood firm and didn’t expel me from the longlist, which I appreciated. And I am not withdrawing from the longlist. However, should the debut writers all return, I would respectfully ask the judges not to consider Earth for the shortlist. I don’t think I can say any fairer than that.”Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsTransgenderFictionAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

He did not respond to a request for comment.Protesters confront federal officers as Trump tightens grip on DC policingRead moreMcEntarfer’s abrupt dismissalhad already raised fears in Washington, on Wall Street and far beyond about the integrity of official US government data. Plans to replace her with Antoni – confirmed hours after he had called on the BLS to halt the publication of monthly jobs data – have only heightened concern among leading economists.“From selectively presenting data from particularly convenient dates to misrepresenting axes to exaggerate magnitudes, he has used all the tricks in the book and shown time and again that he is not a credible source of information,” Dave Hebert, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, a conservative thinktank, told the Guardian. “Worse, he has repeatedly shown that he fundamentally misunderstands what some of the data the BLS puts out actually means.“It’s difficult to imagine someone effectively leading a vital organization like the BLS who cannot correctly define the data they’re putting out.”After July’slackluster jobs report, there have been further signs of economic strain under Trump. On Thursday, the producer price index – which measures wholesale inflation – was revealed to have risen 0.9% in July, markedly more than expected, and the biggest monthly increase in three years.View image in fullscreenErika McEntarfer.Photograph: US Department of LaborBut data released under Antoni – who requires confirmation by theUS Senate– won’t be believed, according to Hebert. “I have no problem with someone who supports President Trump, but we cannot afford such a partisan person who has neither the credibility nor the ability to generate believable data,” he added.Antoni was pictured in a crowd of Trump supporters outside the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection in 2021. The White HousetoldNBC News he was just a bystander, in town for meetings.He is a prolific user of social media, and has frequently appeared on Fox News, Newsmax and other conservative outlets to promote Trump’s policies and arguments.In July 2024, Antoniquoteda post on X, formerly Twitter, which seemingly claimed the 2020 election was stolen. He has alsoderidedthe Federal Reserve;calledsocial security, Medicare and Medicaid “Ponzi schemes”; andfrequently cast aspersionson the BLS, which he is now set to lead, joking that the “L” is “silent”. Back in March, hecalled10,000 federal government job losses “a fabulous start”.Responding to a September 2023 article by ZeroHedge, a libertarian and conspiracy theory website, about US men going abroad to find wives, Antoni wrote in apost: “Shortages in domestic markets always encourage imports. The laws of Supply and Demand will not be conned, not in any aspect of life.”In recent days, Antoni has also stirred controversy online after viewers noticed a painting of a Nazi battleship featured in some of his broadcast interviews.In a 2023 podcast interview with TFTC, Antoniconfirmedthe painting to be the Bismarck, used by Nazi Germany’s Kriegsmarine during the second world war. Upon being asked about the painting, he replied: “The Bismarck, yep, in all his glory.”But it is Antoni’s use of official data that has drawn the most ire among other economists, who have suggested he mischaracterized BLS data about multiple job holders and native-born and foreign-born workers. He has also tried toframeprevious revisions by the bureau as part of a Democratic conspiracy under Biden.Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” “needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS”, Antoni wrote on X in November. Shortly before his nomination to lead the bureau this week,he told Fox Newsthe monthly jobs report should be paused over claims its data is flawed. The White House has since claimed “the plan” is to continue publishing the closely watched report.“He’s utterly unqualified and as partisan as it gets,” Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute,toldthe Washington Post.Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the conservative thinktank the Manhattan Institute, has previously criticized Antoni for claiming that unemployment rate had been “artificially” reduced. “This is one of the many elementary errors that show me Mr Antoni is unqualified for the labor market data collection and analysis role he was nominated to,” Di Martinowroteon social media this week. “People will discuss credentials but what matters is whether you know what you’re talking about.”Friends of BLS, a group co-chaired by William Beach, who served as BLS commissioner during Trump’s first term, has urged the Senate to do its due diligence in assessing Antoni’s suitability for the role.“The unwarranted dismissal of Dr Erika McEntarfer, the 16th Commissioner of Labor Statistics, and the baseless characterization of BLS employment estimates as ’fake’ and ‘rigged’ have undermined public trust in the Bureau’s integrity and the usefulness of its statistics,” the group wrote. “The next Commissioner must not only manage the difficult responsibilities inherent to the role, but also restore public trust, defend the agency against political interference, and accelerate critical modernization efforts across all programs.”The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS unemployment and employment statisticsEconomicsUS politicsprofilesShareReuse this content"

Defensive issues are not exclusive to Andoni Iraola before the Premier League opener, however. Arne Slot voiced concern over the champions’ pre-season vulnerability before and after theCommunity Shield against Crystal Palace, when the absence of Ryan Gravenberch for family reasons was keenly felt. “Three times we lost the ball very simple in our midfield and three times they could counterattack us,” reflected the Liverpool head coach. Gravenberch will be missing again on Friday due to suspension but Slot expects the team with the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season to react as soon as the serious business begins. “Mixed teams, new players coming in, Virgil [van Dijk] being sick, Alisson not being there,” he listed as reasons for Liverpool’s recent difficulties on Thursday. “But all of this is not an excuse when we start the league. We will 100% be ready on Friday.”Andy HunterLiverpool vBournemouth, Friday 8pm (all times BST)2Ramsey sale a blow for the romanticsThe absence of Alexander Isak will invariably dominate the discourse at Villa Park on Saturday lunchtime butNewcastle’s move for Jacob Ramseymeans there is another intriguing subplot. Villa selling Ramsey, who joined their academy aged six, frees them to strengthen after a slow summer – and pocket £40m of profit. But it also serves as a reminder of the demoralising financial landscape in the era of profitability and sustainability regulations. PSR rules have also dictated deals for Newcastle, namely Elliot Anderson – a star in waiting for England – and Yankuba Minteh joining Nottingham Forest and Brighton respectively last year. Unai Emery is a big admirer of Ramsey, who would have been in line to start for Villa this weekend, but ultimately money talks. The 24-year-old lived his dream: playing for his boyhood club. There is always romanticism on the eve of a new season but Ramsey’s imminent sale is a reminder that football is a business.Ben FisherAston Villa v Newcastle, Saturday 12.30pmView image in fullscreenPSR rules mean homegrown talents like Jacob Ramsey are more likely to be sold on.Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty Images3De Cuyper can sparkle on Brighton’s leftAs usual, Brighton did their transfer business early this summer and it seems that Maxim De Cuyper has settled on the south coast already. The Belgium left-back, who joined from Club Brugge for £17.3m on a five-year deal, has been outstanding in pre-season as Fabian Hürzeler’s side have gone unbeaten. De Cuyper capped last week’s 2-1 win over Wolfsburg with a goal, and has immediately struck up an understanding with Kaoru Mitoma down the left flank. Hürzeler is hoping Brighton could have another gem on their hands as they prepare to welcomeFulhamin their opening match on Saturday. “I’m very impressed, because he integrated as a person quite quickly, and that’s something I don’t see that often in the football business,” the Brighton head coach said.Ed AaronsBrighton v Fulham, Saturday 3pm4Wilson can spoil party at rejuvenated old rivalsSunderland have sold their entire complement of 38,000 season tickets this summer and their 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light will be full when West Ham arrive on Saturday. After eight years away from thePremier League– including a stint in League One – they are back in the big time and have prepared themselves with 11 summer signings, five aged 21 or under, acquired for a collective sum in excess of £132m. If turning all those new faces into a functioning team will stretch Régis Le Bris’ undoubted coaching talents to the maximum, locals have reason to fear one particular visitor who recently arrived at West Ham on a free transfer. The former Newcastle and England striker Callum Wilson is now part of Graham Potter’s squad and would like little better than scoring the winning goal while eclipsing Enzo Le Fée, Granit Xhaka and the rest of Le Bris’s top-tier new boys.Louise TaylorSunderland v West Ham, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenSunderland fans will watch their team in the top flight for the first time since 2016-17.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images5Yet another new era dawns at SpursTottenham have had more eras than Taylor Swift but without quite the same success, so the start of yet another should barely register. However the sense persists that in Thomas Frank they have found the right manager at the right time, able to inspire individuals and the collective while being equally adept at finding tactical edges and solutions ­– he appears already to have inculcated set-piece prowess into his new charges. But just as they played wellagainst Paris Saint-Germainthen contrived to lose in a manner that could only be described as classic Spurs, so Burnley at home is precisely the kind of fixture they traditionally avoid winning. Nor will it be enough just to take the points: at the start of his tenure, Ange Postecoglou was extremely successful in their accumulation, but it was obvious the run couldn’t last, and it didn’t. Frank can buy himself time with good results, but over time, he must deliver a side that plays dominant football.Daniel HarrisTottenham vBurnley, Saturday 3pm6Newcomer Trafford gets City chanceHow different willManchester Citylook at Molineux? Pep Guardiola’s side finished last season strong, barring defeat in the FA Cup final, but City sought signings after conceding they were not aggressive in the market last summer. They have added six new faces and it will be interesting if James Trafford is preferred to Ederson in goal. Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki and Rayan Aït-Nouri could also all feasibly start, the last of those against his former club. Cherki may be the most exciting of City’s new signings but Guardiola’s goalkeeping decision feels most significant. Trafford has been given the No 1 shirt but what if Ederson, such an instrumental player across six Premier League title triumphs, stays put? This week City stopped short of denying interest in Gianluigi Donnarumma as a potential replacement for the Brazilian, who is into the final 12 months of his contract. Trafford is expected to start at Wolves and a solid debut could provide Guardiola with his answer.BFskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They did not have suitable cover for the striker, who remains suspended after his red card against Newcastle in May, but depth in attack is no longer an issue. Liam Delap and João Pedro joined in the summer and are competing to lead the line when Crystal Palace visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Both forwards did well during Chelsea’s victorious Club World Cup campaign and impressed in last weekend’s friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Milan. João Pedro scored in both warm-ups, Delap came off the bench to score against Milan and no one noticed the absence of Jackson, who was left out of the squad after indicating adesire to leavebefore the window shuts.Jacob SteinbergChelsea vCrystal Palace, Sunday 2pm8Can overachieving Bees and Forest sustain progress?This fixture at the City Ground features two sides whose seasons feel hard to predict. Nottingham Forest were superb last term, expressing Nuno Espírito Santo’s tactical ideas to the nth degree and adding some much needed variety to the league. Repeating the success, though, is a harder task: opposing players now have experience of facing them, and analysts have had time to identify their weaknesses. Forest still look well-placed to grow:retaining Morgan Gibbs-Whiteis a coup and his midfield partnership with the excellent, still-improving Elliot Anderson is good enough to compete with any in the league. Brentford, meanwhile, have lost three stalwart players with perhaps another yet to depart, as well as the manager who was at the heart of everything. Chances are the club were prepared for Thomas Frank’s departure, their processes embedded so as not to be reliant on any individual. Yet replacing him is about more than that: Keith Andrews cannot just preside over a technocracy but must embody it with soul.DHNottingham Forest v Brentford, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenKeith Andrews faces a tough task in keeping Brentford stable after Thomas Frank’s departure.Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/PA9New-look United and Arsenal stir memories of ‘89These teams met on the opening day of 1989-90. Manchester United were useless and undernew ownership, so had spent heavily (which sounds familiar to modern fans) while Arsenal were champions (less so). Just as Alex Ferguson told his board drastic measures were necessary, so too has Ruben Amorim, with three new attackers arriving at no little cost. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were bought as almost-sure things, Premier League-proven and hitting their peak, but more interesting is thepurchase of Benjamin Sesko, a 22-year-old physical freak who looks as if he plays on fast forward. Arsenal were also interested, but their need to win immediately meant theyplumped for Viktor Gyökeres, his ceiling lower and natural gifts fewer, but who is already the best version of himself. Which side got the better deal will not be evident after Sunday – in August 1989, United won 4-1, then finished 13th – but it will be fascinating to see how each acquisition integrates and fares.DHManchester United v Arsenal, Sunday 4.30pm10Can Harrison and Calvert-Lewin steal Grealish spotlight?It really will be a case of friends reunited when Leeds host Everton on Monday night. While Daniel Farke hopes to be able to include Dominic Calvert-Lewin in his matchday squad, the former Goodison Park centre-forward will not be the only familiar face to be greeted by the visiting manager, David Moyes. Leeds are returning to the Premier League after a two-year absence and their winger Jack Harrison has spent those two seasons on loan at Everton. This has not gone down well with many Elland Road regulars and Harrison has been audibly booed throughout pre-season. Can the 28-year-old win the West Yorkshire public over? Given that the last time Leeds were promoted, five years ago, Covid restrictions meant games were played at empty stadiums, there should be a party atmosphere but Moyes’s marquee summer signing, theManchester City loanee Jack Grealish, will doubtless be determined to ruin it. All eyes will inevitably be on Grealish but this could also be a big night for Calvert-Lewin and Harrison.LTLeeds vEverton, Monday 8pmExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolBournemouthBrighton & Hove AlbionFulhamSunderlandWest Ham UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are high-schoolers. In the exorbitant world of high school football, Buford’s $62m, 10,000-capacity arena is not the biggest or most expensive taxpayer-funded student stadium in the US. But it may be the most luxurious.The Wolves host the Milton Eagles on Thursday in the stadium’s first regular-season game, which will be broadcast nationally on ESPN. With 13 Georgia state championships from 2001 to 2021 and a long record of playersprogressing to college scholarshipsand,eventually, the NFL, Buford is a football powerhouse – and the new stadium is a loud statement of the school’s desire to keep it that way.‘The stadium is secondary’: how US sports teams became real-estate speculatorsRead moreIf it feels like half of Buford is at the big game … they probably are. The Atlanta-area city has roughly 19,000 residents and thewell-regardedhigh school (rebuilt in 2019 for$85m) has about 1,900 students. In 2010, another educational institution in the Atlanta region, Kennesaw State University, built a smart 10,200 capacity multi-use stadium for$16.5m. In the past 15 years, however, construction costs havesoared, fan expectations have evolved, streaming and social media have changed how we consume sports and college athletes are now allowed to earn significant sums by monetising their personal brands. The trend is clear: newer, fancier, costlier.Phillip Beard Stadium has the typical uncovered benches familiar to anyone who’s seen Friday Night Lights. Yet it alsoboastsmore than 1,500 premium seats, 15 suites, a 3,600 sq ft double-sided video board and a 10,500 sq ft event space with a trophy wall. Buford City manager Bryan Kerlin toldthe Atlanta Journal-Constitutionthat the stadium had been paid for by the city general funds and its funding “had no impact on teacher salaries, classroom resources, or any educational funding”. Still, there may well be other parts of the city the money could have been diverted to.Besides, blending spartan spaces for students and high-end facilities for corporate clients and rich alumni is increasingly common. It could make financial sense for schools aiming to maximise revenues and claw back some of the construction and operating costs, according to Victor Matheson, an economics professor at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. “The economics term is price differentiation,” he says. It’s long been common in professional sports as teams adopt a strategy beloved of airlines, with their myriad fare classes and options: charging wildly different amounts for the same product based on variations in the customer experience.As the masses in the cheap seats generate the noise, corporate boxes can deliver thousands of dollars in income per event, giant video screens appeal to advertisers, and perhaps former students who’ve been wined and dined in air-conditioned comfort and enjoyed a perfect view of the action will be inspired to make generous donations to the alma mater.Upscale new arenas are also a way to entice fans off the couch in an era when it seems like almost every sporting contest, no matter how obscure, is streamed. “Everyone knows their biggest competitor is being able to watch on TV,” Matheson says. Climate-controlled facilities mitigate against extreme weather, and with gargantuan video boards, televisions on concourses, myriad food and drink options and glitzy graphics on LED ribbon displays, fans can go to the stadium, experience the live atmosphere and still gaze at screens.Northwestern University in Illinois is building a privately-funded new stadium guided by the principle of “premium for everybody,”reportsFront Office Sports. At a projected cost of $862m it will be the most expensive college stadium ever, yet with only 35,000 seats it will hold 12,000 fewer people than the venue it is replacing. The theory underpinning the design is that modern fans want a more intimate and luxurious experience, with changing tastes – and a changing climate – rendering even relatively recent venues obsolete.In 2020 Major League Baseball’s Texas Rangers quit their open-air 48,000-capacity ballpark, which opened in 1994, for a new 40,000-capacity building with a retractable roof. This season a minor league baseball team, the Salt Lake Bees, moved from Smith’s Ballpark, which also opened in 1994, to a new home, hiking ticket prices and halving their seating capacity in the process. The concentration on high-end customers, of course, prices out fans who cannot afford to spend heavily on a night out at the game.“In all, premium seating makes up one-sixth of seats at the new ballpark, whereas it contributed to just 3% of Smith’s Ballpark’s capacity,” the Salt Lake Tribunereported. “The seats closest to the action aren’t available for sale on a per-ticket basis; instead, those are field-level suites that must be reserved in their entirety.” Sports’ growing focus on premium customers mirrors a shift in the American economy as a whole: this year a Moody’s Analyticsstudyfound that the US economy is now deeply reliant on the richest households, with the top 10% of earners accounting for 50% of consumer spending, a sharp rise from recent decades.Logically, better facilities should breed better players, with victories leading to bigger attendances, swelling civic pride, adding to the appeal of the fast-growing suburbs where large high school stadiums are often located and boosting the prospects of the kids who dream of reaching the NFL. The trickle-down effect from the professional and college ranks to high schools isn’t only a matter of swankier facilities. It’s also visible in the potential financial incentives.College players have been permitted to make money from their name, image and likeness (NIL) rights since 2021. In June this year a former high school playerfiled a class-action lawsuitin California challenging restrictions on the ability of the state’s high school student-athletes to profit from their NIL rights. It could pave the way for high school stars across the US to earn income and to transfer to other schools for sporting reasons. “Corporations see a lot of untapped economic value in high school athletics,” Yaman Salahi, an attorney representing the player named in the suit, said in astatement to Front Office Sports, “and we want to ensure that value is shared equitably with the athletes that create it.”Like teenaged soccer starlets at professional clubs in other countries, 16- and 17-year old American football players might one day be wealthy and famous, with a status to match the grandeur of their home stadiums. “The difference here is that it’s the local public school that’s doing the development,” Matheson points out.For now, stadiums as sizeable and expensive as Buford’s remain rare outside Texas, the state that is the epicentre of the high school football infrastructure arms race. In 2017 the independent school district in the Houston-area suburb of Katyopeneda $70m, 12,000-capacity stadium adjacent to its existing and still operational 9,800-seat venue.According to the website TexasBob.com, more than a quarter of the1,267high school football stadiums in Texas can hold over 5,000 people, with eight seating at least 16,500. The combined capacity of 4.4 million is larger than the populations of 24 states. About a quarter have video scoreboards and 27 high school stadiums have opened in Texas since 2020. A$56m multi-purpose venuein the Houston-area city of La Porte is set to host its inaugural match this month.Texas produces more NFL players than any other state, founda studyby the data analysis firm Lineups, with Houston the leading city. On the other hand, Texas is ranked 34th foreducational attainmentby US News & World Report, is far below the national average forteacher payand expenditures per student, and according toone study, this year Texas teachers expect to spend on average $1,550 of their own money on classroom supplies. Many would argue there are better things to spend money on than school sports.Explore more on these topicsSportUS sportsGeorgiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rooney was sacked after two wins in 15 matches. Brady was at the training complex in his capacity as a minority owner, and as an adviser to the majority owner, Tom Wagner.“We’re trying to make this a world-class team,” Brady says in the ­introduction to a series that begins with the club’s relegation from the Championship. Rooney, ­relaunching his own media career with aBBC-affiliated podcast, has had his say.“I think Tom came in once, which was the day before a game where the days are a little bit lighter anyway, and I don’t think he really understood football that well,” he said. “But what he does understand is … he’s a hard worker – we know that.”Rooney defended his short spell in the second city, saying: “When I went into Birmingham, they were in a mess really. Hence the fact that the players weren’t really the players who could take the club forward. You had Tony Mowbray, Gary Rowett after me, who also struggled as well.”Brady is also heard to refer to ­Birmingham players from the 2023‑24 relegation campaign as “lazy and entitled”.The documentary’s brief ­meeting of the pair appears to be a case of two ­former sportsmen taking their next career steps and struggling to find the other’s wavelength. Rooney said: “Football is not NFL – NFL works for three months a year. Players do need rest as well, so I think he’s very unfair, the way he’s come out and portrayed that.” Brady, as a serial winner, would have played seasons spanning from September to February.Last season,Rooney was briefly the manager at Plymouthwhile ­Birmingham, after a summer of heavy spending,were promotedunder Chris Davies as champions, collecting a record 111 points. Rooney was happy to offer credit for that revival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The aim is to protect the exclusivity of global partners who pay millions for official status. In past events, Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium became “Arsenal Stadium” for Uefa matches, and New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium will be known as “New York New Jersey Stadium” during the 2026 World Cup.Trump announces he will chair White House taskforce for 2028 LA OlympicsRead moreThe shift follows years of debate inside the IOC. Former president Thomas Bach had signaled a move towards a “clean field of play” rather than a blanket “clean venue” policy, opening the door for more sponsor visibility around the Games. LA28 chair Casey Wasserman said naming rights are “truly embedded” in the US sporting culture and that many venues are already commonly known by their sponsor names.LA28announced Thursdaythat Comcast and Honda will be the first naming rights partners under an IOC-approved pilot program designed to generate additional revenue for the privately funded Los Angeles Games. The Comcast Squash Center at Universal Studios will stage squash’s Olympic debut. The Honda Center in Anaheim, home to the NHL’s Ducks, will host indoor volleyball while keeping its corporate name. Other permanent venues with existing naming deals, including SoFi Stadium, Intuit Dome, Crypto.com Arena, BMO Stadium, Peacock Theater and Devon Park in Oklahoma City, could retain their titles if their sponsors buy the rights.“From the moment we submitted our bid, LA28 committed to reimagining what’s possible for the Games,” Wasserman said. “These groundbreaking partnerships with Comcast and Honda, along with additional partners to come, will not only generate critical revenue for LA28 but will introduce a new commercial model to benefit the entire Movement. We’re grateful to the IOC for making this transformation possible.”Under the program, up to 19 temporary venues will also have naming rights available to worldwide and LA28 partners, with the first opportunities going to members of the Olympic Partner (TOP) program. TOP sponsors will have first choice on temporary venues, followed by LA28’s highest-tier domestic sponsors. Any company outside that group would need to sign on as a founding partner to gain rights. Wasserman has estimated the total value could reach nine figures, depending on the venue and location.Historically, the “clean venue” policies have meant significant losses for venue sponsors. Marketing analystsestimate that losing naming rights exposureat a World Cup can cost between $5m and $9m for early matches, rising to $80m for the final. For 2026, Fifa has told host cities to hand over full control of their stadiums for more than a month, with all non-sponsor logos removed or covered, even on equipment and roof signage.An IOC statement described the LA28 plan as a “pilot” that will be “assessed for relevancy for future hosts”. It said the approach “takes into account market realities of venue naming and generates critical revenue to stage the Games” while maintaining the principles of clean venues on the field of play.The move underscores the growing commercialization of the Games as organizers seek new funding models. LA28 will be the first US Summer Olympics in more than 30 years and aims to rely entirely on private financing to meet its estimated $7.1bn budget. Outside the new naming rights program, standard clean venue rules will still apply.The Games run from 14 to 30 July, followed by the Paralympics from 15 to 27 August.Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028LA Paralympic Games 2028International Olympic CommitteeSport politicsShareReuse this content"

Trent Alexander-Arnold, just Trent now on his No 12 shirt, has joined Jude Bellingham at Real Madrid. Nine players have left Atlético Madrid, but Conor Gallagher isn’t one of them.Marcus Rashford has landedin Barcelona, 39 years after Gary Lineker. And Oviemuno Ejaria has just signed a two-year deal at Real Oviedo.Or, if you prefer your obvious jokes to have a slightly different bias, another team for the punchline, Tyrhys Dolan has joined Espanyol.Ejaria is the last in, a three-week trial convincing the coach, Veljko Paunovic, to give him an opportunity at a club returning to the first division 24 years later, joining on the same salary as teammate Santi Cazorla: the €195,000 (£168,100) minimum wage. Alexander-Arnold was the first, two months ago and on 75 times more having arrived for free until Madrid decided they needed him at the Club World Cup and spent €10m to get him an early release. Dolan’s arrival intrigues. But Rashford is likely to command the most attention this weekend.Marcus Rashford claims Manchester United are stuck in ‘no man’s land’Read moreIf, that is, he plays. If he does not, his will not be the only absence. Not among the Englishmen – Bellingham has finally had an operation on his shoulder and will be out for a couple of months – and probably not among Barcelona’s new signings either. Like Dolan and Ejaria, like more than 50 players across the league, Rashford has not yet been registered, a familiar summer story. Many, but not all, should have their paperwork completed in time;Barcelona, who have always found a way to eventually get their players registered, hope they will too. For some of their signings, at least.“I’m calm; I trust that the club will sort it out,” Rashford said at the start of August as he headed off on pre-season, a new opportunity. “I’m just concentrating on training and getting in good shape to start the competition.” Two days before his team do in Mallorca – and two weeks before the market closes, margin to balance books – he was still waiting. And if he was confident, part of the reason he has arrived in Catalonia is that not everyone felt the same way. Barcelona wanted to sign Nico Williams, meeting his €58m buyout clause at Athletic Club, but they could not guarantee he would be registered in advance. Rashford was more affordable, less demanding and a player they long admired.Rashford’s arrivalbrings variety and versatility. Able to play in any of the positions across the front – “my favourite position is on the left … but [it’s] a bit of everywhere really” – he offers cover for Lamine Yamal, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, who is a week from his 37th birthday. That addresses a feeling that last season they found few alternatives – Ferran Torres apart – to a front three that was superb but also had to play huge amounts of minutes; that perhaps paid for it in the end.Across a whole campaign, that could be significant. Yet in the short term, Rashford’s registration was not Barcelona’s most pressing, immediate priority. On Wednesday night, none of their summer signings had yet been cleared by the league’s strict financial fair play rules, including Joan García, the goalkeeper signed for €25m from Espanyol, or Wojciech Szczesny, the story of last season and any season. Convinced to come out of retirement to win every domestic title, Szczesny has now been convinced to stay on as a sub. As Marc-André ter Stegen is injured, Barcelona face going into the opening game with just one available goalkeeper: Iñaki Peña, who has not played a minute in pre-season.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold has joined Jude Bellingham at Real Madrid.Photograph: Jan Hetfleisch/Getty ImagesTer Stegen’s injury, though, was more a solution than a problem: if his injury could be judged to be long term, Barcelona will be able to “use” up to 80% of his salary to register another player, which would be García. That had beenthe source of conflict: Ter Stegen, seemingly wishing to avoid facilitating his own replacement, refused to authorise the release of his medical details to the league committee making the judgment. Stripped of his captaincy, he eventually backed down, had the armband returned and even gave the speech before Barcelona’s club’s traditional season curtain raiser – played at the training ground because the Camp Nou is not ready, another deadline missed. On Wednesday night, the league’s commission confirmed that they considered the injury long term; Barcelona immediately announced the registration of García, another obstacle overcome.That night Joan Laporta admitted he couldn’t be sure that they would get everyone registered for the start of the season but that they were working on it. In the end, with the club waiting on the auditors’ clearance of the sale of VIP seats at the new stadium and a sponsorship deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with departures still to be confirmed, he and his board may need to put up personal bank guarantees.Yet if the summer has been difficult off the pitch, missed amid the drama is a steady strengthening, and on it has been different. While there will be a defensive balance to attend to, Hansi Flick expressing frustration at how they let the Inter semi-final escape them last season, Barcelona have continued to blow everyone apart, scoring at five a game in pre-season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which won’t be easy, either; in Europe or domestically, even if Lamine Yamal is just about the most exciting player around, handed a new contract, the No 10 and the future.Real Madrid have spent €200m, their biggest outlay in six years, but they have not really had a pre-season, playing only one game since the Club World Cup. The enthusiasm for the structural shifts seen at that tournament was hit hard by their destruction at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain, Xabi Alonso quick to say that matchbelonged to last season, not this. Shifting a culture is not simple, combining Vinícius Júnior and Kylian Mbappé doesn’t appear to be either, and there is still a gap in the middle of their midfield, which they are trying to fill with Arda Güler adapting to a new role.Meanwhile Álex Baena, the outstanding player outside the big three last season, creating more chances than anyone, has joined their rivals across the capital and he didn’t come alone. Atlético have spent €175m, a second summer in a row of heavy spending, demanding a challenge that lasts into the spring this time. Gallagher didn’t just survive the cut; he appears poised to play a more central role. It is six years since anyone won a title two years running and almost 20 since anyone other than Barcelona did it, last season’s certainties tending to slip away swiftly and opponents invariably coming back for more.One thing is for sure and if it’s a bold prediction you’re after, try this; by the time May comes round, in some corner of a foreign field, an Englishman will lift the league title. Tyrhys, it is your time.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaMarcus RashfordTrent Alexander-ArnoldJude BellinghamEuropean club footballBarcelonaReal MadridfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have regressed sincewinning the Uefa Conference Leaguetwo years ago, too many misguided moves preventing them from kicking on, and rebuilding has not been simple. Funds are tight after a series of costly errors in the transfer market and Graham Potter is yet to demonstrate he is capable of silencing the familiar sound of grumbling at the London Stadium.Some fans fear a relegation battle beckons. West Ham underwhelmed last season, attempts to move on from David Moyes’s pragmatism by replacing the Scot with Julen Lopetegui proving predictably short-lived. They finished 14th, their improvement marginal after Potter replaced Lopetegui in January, a subsequent run of five wins in 19 games telling its own story.The optimistic reading, though, is that this is the real start of the Potter era. The message was to judge him after a pre-season. Potter, who is expected to favour a 3-4-2-1 system, has worked on improving the team’s mentality. He wants more leadership. It is not a surprise that Potter has brought in a sports psychologist. The mood has also been lifted by Lucas Paquetá, the influential Brazilian midfielder,being found innocentof breaking betting regulations.Paquetá has impressed during pre-season. Jarrod Bowen, the captain, continues to deliver in attack and has shown signs of a productive partnership with Niclas Füllkrug. There have been some encouraging additions, El Hadji Malick Diouf in particular catching the eye at left wing-back in pre-season. Potter and Kyle Macaulay, the head of recruitment, won a little battle when they convinced the board to buy the Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Callum Wilson, signed on a cheap short-term deal, offers experienced cover up front – if he can stay fit.More signings are required, though. Several veterans have departed, the sale ofMohammed Kudus to Tottenhamleaves a creative deficit and Potter’s hopes of making West Ham more proactive at home and better in possession will depend on whether the club can deliver a No 6 and a No 8. A lot remains up in the air. The picture will be clearer when the window shuts.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerPotter’s reputation is yet to recover after his brutal, ill-fated stint at Chelsea. Feted as the brightest young English coach around when he was at Brighton, it took only seven traumatic months at Stamford Bridge to throw his promising career off course. Now the challenge is to prove the doubters wrong. West Ham were unsure about hiring Potter but may benefit from his calm, dignity and ability to improve players on the training ground. Patience could be key. Potter is not about instant success. He has tended to build slowly, so West Ham will need to trust him if they start slowly.View image in fullscreenGraham Potter will be hoping with West Ham he can restore his reputation as one of the best young English coaches.Photograph: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Getty ImagesOff-field pictureConcerns over profitability and sustainability rules meant West Ham had to sell to buy at the start of the window. Supporters, though, do not want to hear the club pleading poverty. Many still begrudge the move to the unloved London Stadium which, despite having a capacity of 62,500, has hardly led to a change in West Ham’s fortunes. David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, is heavily criticised. The 76-year-old is not popular but remains highly influential. Less is made of the part played by the Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who bought his stake in 2021. The Gold family put a proportion of their stake up for sale almost two years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tim Steidten, the then technical director, is understood to have felt the Senegal international was not good enough for the Premier League. It is just as well, then, that the overhyped Steidten left last February. West Ham looked at Diouf again – they needed a left-back after releasing Aaron Cresswell and putting Emerson Palmieri up for sale – and took the plunge. They paid £22m for the 20-year-old, who was excellent inSenegal’s win over England in June, and are excited about his crossing ability.Stepping upThere were high hopes for George Earthy after a productive season on loan at Bristol City. However the attacking midfielder sustained an ankle ligament injury at the start of pre-season and is still on the mend. Earthy will hope to press his claim once he returns but in the meantime all eyes are on Freddie Potts, who has done well in pre-season. The 21-year-old, the son of the former West Ham defender Steve Potts, is a deep-lying midfielder and has looked comfortable on the ball in recent friendlies. Ollie Scarles, a 19-year-old left-back, will also hope for more minutes after being given opportunities last season.A big season for …The departure of Kudus means there will be pressure on Crysencio Summerville to step up and nail down a starting spot when he returns from a hamstring injury. The 23-year-old joined from Leeds last summer but the winger is yet to produce his best form for West Ham. He was a bit-part player under Lopetegui, who was reluctant to use the Dutchman’s speed and trickery, and has been out since tearing a hamstring during Potter’s first game. Surgery eventually followed and has left Summerville, who is expected to return next month, desperate to show what he can do. “When I’m back, it’s going to be showtime,” he said last month.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26West Ham UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Slot said the Germany international’s “adjustment went better than expected, and we already expected a lot”, but admitted a more accurate gauge would take time.Transfer roundup: Liverpool close on £26m Leoni deal to boost Slot’s defenceRead moreLiverpool consider the 22-year-old a transformative signing in the mould of Virgil van Dijk and Alisson. Their head coach believes Wirtz can have a similar impact by following the example of Salah, who continues to set the standards at Liverpool and has scored nine goals in seven opening-day fixtures, aPremier Leaguerecord.Slot was asked whether Wirtz was a signing to takeLiverpoolto the next level. “That is something I can only answer in the upcoming years,” he said. “­Everything we expect is very positive, but between expecting and realising something is different.“Why are Messi and Ronaldo and Mo so highly regarded? Because they are always fit. Every single game they are fit and that is something that ­Florian first has to show in a league like ours. If he is able to stay fit then our fans will see great moments.”Liverpool paid a club record £100m to sign the attacking midfielder from Bayer Leverkusen and he could cost a British record £116m with add-ons. Slot, however, denies Wirtz is a statement signing by the club, who beat Bayern Munich and Manchester City to his signature.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We mainly make these signings. But we also sell players. If we make these signings, we also have to sell players.“He is a different profile to what we have. That is what we wanted – to bring a different profile in rather than adding something that we already had. It is very positive that we could bring in such a highly regarded player, but Liverpool has always been able to bring in these kinds of players.”Liverpool’s summer spending will pass the £300m mark when the 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni joins from Parma for an initial £26m. The club also want to add Marc Guéhi and Alexander Isak.On a summer of change at Anfield, Slot said: “I would have preferredTrent [Alexander-Arnold] to stay,but unfortunately he didn’t. Then you have to replace him. Then you havesituations like Caoimhín Kelleherand Jarell Quansah. It is always hard for a player to have two or three seasons like this [not being a regular] in a row and if a player is not able to do this mentally then it is best to split ways and you have to replace.“The Luís Diaz and Darwin Núñez situations are quite clear so then you have to replace.

Forestmade Dan Ndoyetheir record buy last month by signing the Switzerland winger from Bologna for £35m to replace Anthony Elanga, who joined Newcastle in a £55m deal, but are ready to eclipse that fee.Forest are also pursuing deals for Douglas Luiz, who is keen to return to the Premier League from Juventus, the Rennes striker Arnaud Kalimuendo and McAtee, with the England Under-21s midfielder poised for a medical in the coming days. Forest are among the clubs to have tracked Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes but the Championship club want about £40m for the Portuguese midfielder.Chelsea are poised to profit from Hutchinson moving on, after they inserted a clause in the £20m deal that took him to Ipswich last year entitling them to 25% of any profit from a future sale. Hutchinson, who returned to his boyhood club, Chelsea, from Arsenal in 2022, was one of Ipswich’s best performers last season but scored only three top-flight goals.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestIpswich TownTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

I heard multitudes marching to the big kettle drum. Not to mention, it should be said, even larger multitudes talking on the wicked and unholy internet about agent sightings, failed here-we-gos and the Alexander Isak wheel of global conspiracy.Let he that hath understanding count the number! Because, let’s face it, it really is an absolute beast of a number, 215 livePremier Leaguegames on Sky Sports alone, an endless rolling debauchery of games, of graphics that go whoosh, of arguments by the lighted dias.Bargain hunt: the best value signings in the Premier League this summerRead moreWelcome to the start of the Premier League season 2025-26. It is, as ever, a thrilling prospect. The opening round of fixtures will play out across this long weekend with the familiar sense of unspent energy, shapes, tides, narratives that will reveal themselves only in the slog through winter into spring.There are very good reasons why this thing has become the world’s dominant pop cultural stage. It works. No matter how sated you might have become by the end of the last one, there is always renewal and fresh hunger. Albeit with an even stronger sense this time of shifting planes, hard lines dissolving, a Premier League that is, for the first time in some time, a little menaced by omens, portents and notes of horn-parping rapture.Two significant things have happened this summer. First, Premier League clubs have spent like the world is on fire. The running total on basic transfer fees is more than £2bn with two weeks to go, already the second-largest ever, with a shot at beating 2023’s all-time high, post-Covid.This has been classic muscle-flexing Big Window Energy. Nine clubs, according to Transfermarkt, have ticked up more than £60m on ins minus outs.Manchester Unitedand Arsenal are more than £200m. Liverpool, the champions, have spent £253m gross in regearing the starting XI,part of a wider trend of genuine churn, book-balancing and head-count shift.View image in fullscreenArne Slot has a very different challenge this season, having expertly taken Liverpool to the Premier League title last season.Photograph: Matt Impey/ShutterstockIf this feels a little wild in places it is perhaps a reflection of that second element, the feeling of rumblings off stage, other powers rising, a war in heaven about to break. There are good reasons why Sky has chosen to gorge itself on English football this season, recentring on its key asset.This has been the founding commercial relationship for both parties, and a relatively simple dynamic. Put on the show. Sell the show to people whose business is screwing metal dishes to a wall, who can then sell it on to an audience watching a screen from its sofa. Defined territories. Easy to defend from outside interference. That model has been screwed into place for 35 years now, its coherence a key source of the league’s global power.It is already being disrupted. This summer Fifa gouged its fingers into domestic football, juicing up its invitees to the Club World Cup with vast amounts of Saudi-backed money,skewing the domestic balance of income, focus, internal tension. Behold the bald Swiss power broker on his great white throne, saying “I will make all things new”. These structures, these watertight shapes, are not football’s final form.There are signs of the times everywhere, indicators of control being ceded in plain sight. Theexpanded Champions Leagueis already having a similar stratifying influence. Regulations feel more mutable and vulnerable to challenge, unless you’reCrystal Palace and forgot to play the game.La Liga is playing matches overseas. The Premier League is launching a Netflix-style app. A baby has been born in Germany speaking only in Thierry Henry memes. That golden ladder is reaching down. Flick forward five years. How much longer can the centre hold?View image in fullscreenHow Tijjani Reijnders and Manchester City’s other new players will gel is one of the questions of the new season as Pep Guardiola tries to rebuild his team.Photograph: Miguel Rodriguez/EPAIn the meantime we have more boom times, a fever of commerce. Buy, spend, shore up your place in the new heaven and earth. It makes the current season feel both oddly reassuring and safe in its August-to-May routines, but also hard to read.In recent years there have been three distinct Premier League tiers: thelanternes rouges, the back-markers; the well-run middle; and the overclass. But even within this who can say who is good right now, who is healthy, who has found the right chemistry?Partly this is related to the excitable nature of much of the team building this summer. What kind of signings are the current wave of US-facing, entertainment product owners most likely to go all in for? The answer seems to be whizzy attackers with resale value.Florian Wirtz for £116m, Hugo Ekitiké £79m,Benjamin Sesko £73.7m,Viktor Gyökeres £63.5m. These are all exciting and unpredictable additions. Nobody knows how they will fall, who will fire, which of these variables will resolve itself.It still seems safe to say the league title will be divvied up between four contenders. Arne Slot has a harder job this season in some ways. Ticking over, rejigging, fixing the joins is one thing, and it was expertly done. What is required now is now an act of major, high-intensity rebuild on the hoof. It is an entirely different kind of test.Nobody knows whether Manchester City are back, half-back or non-back. Pep Guardiola talks only in prophecies and gospels and sooths these days. Some key expertise has left the club. Rodri andTijjani Reijnderslook a very good midfield. There is also quite a lot of filler around.View image in fullscreenManchester United have spent more than £200m on the attacking talents of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha (from left), but they still look brittle.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty ImagesArsenal will be fascinating to watch. Here are a team who already have the best defence. Add a new central midfield and a goalscorer with the nickname the Cannibal, and there really is nowhere to hide. This will not be a personnel issue or a stadium issue or a vibe issue. It will be an issue of will and nerve and the bravery to play on the edge, to take risks as well as squeeze.Are Chelsea good now? Will they be exhausted or energised? They have a thrillingly strong midfield and a fresh cutting edge. They really should be title contenders.In the tier below, Newcastle fans have finally found something objectionable about their owners, specifically theinability to run a successful player recruitmentand retention arm. But the team are still very strong.Aston Villa can get on with winning the Europa League. Manchester United will as ever exist in their own group of one, simultaneously epic, moreish, big-time, brittle, rickety and utterly brown paper and string. Sesko could be an excellent signing, and has the right elite vibes. On one hand there has to be an improvement. On the other the midfield is still two bad games from thawing out the cryogenic chamber and having another go with Casemiro.View image in fullscreenCan Leeds manager Daniel Farke end the run of promoted clubs dropping straight back down?Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesIn the middle range, AKA Brightfordmouth, the challenge is to resist the effects of being cannibalised and rebuild once more. Crystal Palace look strong and motivated. Everton could have their best season for a while. Fulham have failed to add much but should be fine because of Marco Silva + London stadium bonus + just enough good players. Nottingham Forest have the Europa League to cope with. A poor start could be a problem. Spurs could be anything, or simply Spurs. West Ham’s problem will be patience, allowing Graham Potter’s influence to swell slowly like a tuberous root vegetable.Burnley and Scott Parker will be a fascinating contrast, a far more defensively robust prospect than the Vincent Kompany job pitch project last time around, with its doomed brand-building style. Leeds have energy and a sense of collectivism at Elland Road, although somehow it is still hard to avoid the idea of Daniel Farke ruefully explaining things on Match of the Day. Sunderland will Sunderland. Wolves are going to have to do something surprising.The end result is a notably rigid hierarchy of clubs, a league table that could well simply end up in the exact order listed here. But which still seems to be operating in a state of high-end jeopardy just off stage, bonds and structures being tested, a sense of some looming rapture yet to reveal itself.Take your sickle and reap. Don’t get left behind. Reach up towards those new sources of light and heat.Chelseaare world champions. A dog with the head of Jamie Carragher has been found wandering the Mendip Hills talking about defensive body position. And now the thing that never ends is all set to start once again.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSky SportsTransfer windowLiverpoolManchester CityChelseaArsenalcommentShareReuse this content"

After loan spells at Stoke, Preston and Hull, Liam Delap made a £20m move to Ipswich last summer and proceeded to make a name for himself in thePremier League.He scored 12 league goals (33% of Ipswich’s total) and quickly attracted interest from numerous top-flight sides, including Manchester United, Newcastle,Nottingham Forestand Everton. Ultimately, he chose Chelsea, who activated his £30m release clause, triggered by Ipswich’s relegation, to secure his signature.Brentford will keep Newcastle target Yoane Wissa out of season openerRead moreIn a market where strikers such asBenjamin Sesko(13 league goals last season) andHugo Ekitiké (15 league goals last season) have commanded fees north of £70m, securing Delap for just £30m could be one of the shrewdest signings of the summer. Not only have Chelsea secured one of Europe’s most complete young forwards but, crucially, he also has Premier League experience.He has a similar profile to Nicolas Jackson – a powerful, modern striker who combines strong ball-carrying (2.12 carries per 90 minutes in the Premier League last season), intelligent movement, clinical finishing (12 goals from an xG of 9.05) and a high work rate – but Delap probably has a higher ceiling than Chelsea’s current forwards.Simon Adingra to Sunderland for £21mSimon Adingra joined Brighton from FC Nordsjælland in the summer of 2022 for around £6m after a standout season in Denmark, where he scored 11 goals and provided nine assists – enough to capture the attention of the Seagulls’ astute recruitment team.His time on the south coast didn’t quite bring the meteoric rise enjoyed by some of Brighton’s other young talents, but Adingra has nonetheless established himself as a Premier League winger, with the pace, directness and one-v-one ability to trouble defenders. ForSunderland, he represents £21m very well spent.Adingra looks tailor-made for Régis Le Bris’s fast transitioning, counterattacking style of play. The 23-year-old thrives on the break, loves getting in behind defenders and offers a direct and aggressive outlet for teammates. In a side likely to enjoy limited possession, his ability to create and convert chances from minimal service could help them stay up.View image in fullscreenSimon Adingra will offer a direct and aggressive outlet for Sunderland.Photograph: Greig Cowie/ShutterstockGranit Xhaka to Sunderland for £13mAt the other end of his career to Adingra, but Granit Xhaka also offers great value. The 32-year-old brings a wealth of experience. He has made 137 appearances for Switzerland; he has won trophies in three countries; and he knows the Premier League inside out, having played 225 league games for Arsenal.Xhaka arrives from Bayer Leverkusen, where he was a key figure in Xabi Alonso’s unbeaten 2023-24 Bundesliga campaign, and he featured in 33 league games and 10 Champions League matches last season.On top of his experience, Xhaka is also operating at a top level. He ranked fifth for passes completed in Europe’s top five leagues last season, fourth for progressive passes, second for passes into the final third, and he was in the top 40 for passes that lead to shots. He also picked up the fifth most assists in the Bundesliga last season.For just £13m, Sunderland have attracted one of Europe’s best passing midfielders, a player with an abundance of Premier League experience, and a character who will bring leadership to their midfield.Igor Jesus to Nottingham Forest for £10mSigning Igor Jesus from Botafogo for £10m could prove to be a steal for Nottingham Forest. The club are preparing for their first season in Europe since 1996 so need more options upfront. The 24-year-old Brazilian offers something different to Chris Wood and Taiwo Awoniyi.Igor Jesus arrives in England having helped Botafogo to both the Brasileiro Série A and Copa Libertadores titles last season, contributing 10 goals and one assist in 28 appearances in all competitions. Two of those goals came in the Club World Cup, where he made headlines by scoring the winneragainst the European champions Paris Saint-Germain. He also scored in a win over Seattle Sounders earlier in the tournament, earning player of the match in both games.He looks perfect for Forest’s counterattacking approach. Igor Jesus offers speed, tireless running and strong finishing to a side that posted the third-lowest average possession in the Premier League last season and relied on quick, transitional football. He brings a different dimension to Wood, who lacks pace and mobility, and he should fit seamlessly into the side. For just £10m, Forest could have a gem on their hands.View image in fullscreenIgor Jesus joined Nottingham Forest after starring for Botafogo at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesMichael Kayode to Brentford for £14mBrentford are renowned for developing young players into stars and the 21-year-old right-back Michael Kayode could be the next in line. Developed in the Juventus youth ranks, he moved to Gozzano in Serie D. He said he was taking “a step backwards to make two forwards,” and he was proved right. Kayode was quickly snapped up by Fiorentina, where he became a regular starter at the age of just 19.He joined the Bees on loan in January and made five substitute appearances before earning his first start in the 4–2 win over Brighton, after which he held his spot in the side until the end of the campaign.He offers Brentford a defensively solid option at right-back, combining pace, stamina and strength with excellent one-v-one defending and recovery ability. His attacking decision-making is still developing, but he has the athleticism to support his attacking teammates, delivers dangerous crosses and is comfortable under pressure. No wonder Brentford paid £14m to sign him on a permanent deal. Brentford might just see yet another hefty return on a small investment.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkTransfer windowChelseaSunderlandNottingham ForestBrentfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It follows consultation with club officials and leading players who all complained about the practice.“The feedback that we had is that there’s just a few too many examples of players clearly pulling people back, impacting their ability to move to the ball, or some clear extreme actions are not being penalised,” said Webb, the chief referee officer, before the Premier League season starts on Friday night. “They’re the ones I expect us to catch. Therefore I would expect this time next year for there to have been a few more penalties given for holding offences than what we’ve seen this year. But not a huge swing of the pendulum.”The new guidance allows space for referees to analyse instances of holding and assess how severe or extreme it may be. The criteria a referee is expected to consider include: the length of time a player is held for; the extent of the impact on their ability to move; the nature of the opponent’s efforts to impede movement; whether both arms are being used.A crackdown on holding has been promised before, but without any real impact. Webb says the key will be to approach any changes slowly and consistently. “This is not meant to be a six-week campaign, August and September, then we forget all about it,” he said.“If we went in like a steam train and gave every little bit of sort of contact then it would tell you it would be a six-week campaign. Because we would get told very quickly to ease off from what we’re doing. We have to take the game with us and we have to be credible. We have to identify those situations that do fall in line with the feedback that we had.”Webb cited changes to the handball law in recent seasons as a model to follow. It is one of the most contentious laws and PGMO adopted a more lenient interpretation to limit the number of gamechanging decisions made off the back of subjective handball calls. Research by the Premier League found that 78% of stakeholders said they supported the approach taken last season and wanted it to continue.“That’s why we want to survey the game,” Webb said. “Because when I listen to the game [we can] make those tweaks where we think we need to be better, to fall in line with those expectations. And I think we did that with handball pretty successfully.”Meanwhile, the chief executive of the Premier League, Richard Masters, repeated his challenges to Fifa over the international match calendar, with the league part of a legal action against the global governing body over a perceived lack of consultation on the issue and with concerns that leagues could be asked to downsize to incorporate more tournaments such as the Club World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t believe that’s the right way forward and as far as I’m concerned it’s not on the cards. Obviously Fifa was put on earth really to regulate the global game and to run international football and the Club World Cup is a move into club football.”This season the Premier League begins a new four-year domestic TV rights deal with Sky and TNT Sports, with more games available to view than ever. Despite a decline in the value of broadcast rights in most markets, the league continues to grow its broadcast revenues and Masters said he saw no reason for the longstanding relationship with Sky, especially, to change. “I don’t feel that there’s anything to stop further agreements of this kind continuing,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueRefereesLaws of footballnewsShareReuse this content"

That was the day Manchester United outplayed and outviolenced Arsenal in the first leg of their Milk Cup semi-final at Highbury. United won 4-2; they were 4-0 up after 80 minutes before taking their foot off Arsenal’s throat, and shinbone, and head. “Perhaps we’ve been concentrating too much on passing and technique,” lamented Don Howe, Arsenal’s head coach and assistanttothe manager, Terry Neill. “Against United we went out to strike the ball about instead of putting some meat into the game.” In 1980s English football, there was no place for veganism. Things have changed since the days when ABH was a bookable offence, and only then after the first 10 minutes, but English football still has a pretty noxious meat footprint.Wayne Rooney hits back at Tom Brady: ‘I don’t think he really understood football’Read moreIn 2025, English society, never mind football, is addicted to beef. You know it’s a weekday when a relatively minor difference of opinion between two adults is reported using the kind of language once reserved for a bloodbath involving the Five Families. Today’s beef involves two football legends: Wayne Rooney (association) and Tom Brady (American). In case you missed it – if you did, get out while you still can – Rooney’s work ethic during his time as Birmingham City managerwas questioned by Brady, a part-owner of the club. This emerged in a documentary at the end of July, seven months after Rooney was sacked by Birmingham – but this ultra-processed beef ain’t got no sell-by date, baby. “I’m a little worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” said Brady. “I mean, I don’t know, I don’t have great instincts on that.” Rooney waited a couple of weeks to reply publicly, coincidentally via the medium of a new podcast that he’d be plugging desperately, if only there was a story he could sell. Remember the name: The Wayne Rooney Show.Actually, we shouldn’t throw shade at Our Wazza. We’re all selling something these days, whether it’s a podcast, a Substack or our last dapple of dignity. And we’re all buying what everyone else is selling, a world of dopamine nutters in desperate need of just one more hit. “I think it was a very unfair comment,” said Rooney, before explaining that Brady’s only visit was the day before a game, when everyone’s workload is generally lighter. “I don’t think he really understood football that well at the time.” Rooney went on to call Brady an abject, NKOTB-loving motherf- no, of course he didn’t. He called him “one of, if not the greatest athlete of all time”. His tone was reasonable throughout, even if he undermined his point slightly by saying the NFL season only lasted three months.Rooney concluded by putting the whole thing in an appropriate context. “Bit disappointed but nothing too serious, so move on.” That quote wasn’t used by the BBC, broadcasters of TheWayne RooneyShow, but they did have sufficient grasp of nuance to put together a graphic for their news story that screamed THE BRADY BEEF. Football Daily isn’t claiming to be any better. We’re eating beef right now, FHS, and we’ve got enough in the fridge to take us through to at least May 2026. But deep down – to nick a line from our progenitor The Fiver – we know it’s time to STOP BEEF. And maybe, if this jejune culture gets much worse, to STOP FOOTBALL.QUOTE OF THE DAY“In medical terms, the operation succeeded but the patient died, so not that good in the end. But we worked on a gameplan that was a little bit different and very close to succeeding” – Thomas Frank, having failed to cure Tottenham of historic ills, reflects on losing Biggest Cup on penalties to PSG. In doing so, Frank echoed the words of Danish compatriot Ebbe Skovdahl, who said the same after his Aberdeen team lost, er, 7-0 to Celtic in 2002.View image in fullscreenAllow him to be Frank: the new Spurs manager is serving up the soundbites already.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSWith reference toyesterday’s Football Daily(full email edition), in which your contributor was bemoaning the lack of alternative monikers for a goalkeeper, may I be so bold as to proffer a few enhancements to their vocab?

I’m happy I broke him back quite early. I felt like I was performing some great tennis.”In the women’s fourth round, the second seed,Coco Gauff, saw off Italy’s Lucia Bronzetti 6-2, 6-4 and faces a quarter-final match against the seventh seed, Jasmine Paolini, who eased to a 6-1, 6-2 victory over former Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova.View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff beat Lucia Bronzetti and now faces another Italian, Jasmine Paolini, in the last eight.Photograph: Daniel Kopatsch/Getty Images“For the most part I played aggressive,” said Gauff. “Maybe there were a couple of times that were a little bit passive in some of those games but it’s tough – the balls are super light and she wasn’t giving me much pace. I was just trying to play controlled but also aggressive and, for the most part, I think I did well.”Meanwhile, former world No 6 Matteo Berrettini has withdrawn from the US Open, tournament organisers said yesterday. The Italian, ranked 59th, has not competed since a first-round loss at Wimbledon after he had recovered from an abdominal injury.Berrettini skipped the Swiss Open in Gstaad and the Masters 1000 events in Toronto and Cincinnati in the buildup to the grand slam at Flushing Meadows, where he reached the semi-finals in 2019.

But he still looks the safest pair of hands after all the fly-half woes Schmidt has had to contend withfollowing the loss of first choice Noah Lolesio with neck trouble.O’Connor’s halfback partner will be another veteran, White, who has doubled back on his decision to retire after the Lions series when first choice Jake Gordon got injured.Donaldson’s injury has necessitated a late change to the planned bench with Schmidt having to replace the versatile back with loose forward Nick Champion de Crespigny.That means Australia will go from a five-three to six-two split between forwards and backs among the replacements.Yet Schmidt sounded upbeat as he noted: “The group has had a good week of preparation, adjusting pretty well to the time zone and the altitude well here in Johannesburg.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is the latest footballer to be abused in a pattern that social media companies show little ability to arrest. Last month, the England defender Jess Carter withdrew from any active social media presence afterbeing racially targetedduring Euro 2025.The anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out said: “If you’re a black player, it would be totally understandable to think: ‘Why would I want to take a penalty?’ That’s the state of the game right now and the sad fact is, it’s nothing new. Players are routinely targeted with racism online and want action; we want action, too.“Accountability from ­offenders and social media companies is a baseline, but it’s not being met.

They were better than a rusty PSG for much of the game, ­leading through goals by Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero, and posed problems with some bright running in attack.Mohammed Kudus, who signed from West Hamthis summer, was lively in a strike partnership with Richarlison and said the performance proved they can mix it with the best.“I am really, really proud of the team for their work ethic and energy because we had them for most of the game. It was just the last part we need to fix,” he said. “We competed against one of the best teams in the world and showed we can play at that level. It is just [about] staying focused for the whole game.“This is a good step, of course a big disappointment, but we have a lot more to play for this season, a lot more competitions”The Ghana international Kudus, who scored 19 goals in two seasons for West Ham, will have competition for his place if Thomas Frank succeeds in adding to his front line.Eberechi Ezeand Savinho are top targets; Kudus, though, has begun promisingly and believes life at Spurs is suiting him well.“I’m very excited to have joined this beautiful club,” he said. “I am still settling in, trying to adapt and to get used to my coaches, but, with the help of the club, it has been going so smoothly.

Only if workers can monitor and shape how it’s used | Peter LewisRead moreHis argument hinges on whether that AI then goes on to create something “new and novel” which is referred to in copyright as being transformative – creating something new.He said he would have no issue with someone taking what he had created and using it as long as it was “transformative”.“If someone had used my intellectual property to compete with me, then I think that is an issue, directly with me. If they’d used all the intellectual property of all the software on the world to help people write software better in the future, I think that is a fair use.”US law is not settled on AI training being fair use. The US Copyright Office notedin its May pre-print reporton generative AI training that there are dozens of lawsuits challenging AI companies using fair use as an excuse for training large-language models on copyrighted works without paying.In the US, there are also factors to consider whether something is fair use include:Whether the use is commercial or not.The nature of the copyrighted work.The amount used of the copyrighted work.The effect of the use on the market for or value of the copyrighted work.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn US case law, the transformative nature of what is made of what was taken is the first important factor in fair use, the Australian law firm Gilbert + Tobinnoted in a May publicationbut it is not the only factor to consider, with the impact on the market of the copyrighted work being key. The US supreme court has twice described this as “undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use”, according to the US Copyright Office report.“The copying involved in AI training threatens significant potential harm to the market for or value of copyrighted works,” the report said.“Where a model can produce substantially similar outputs that directly substitute for works in the training data, it can lead to lost sales.“Even where a model’s outputs are not substantially similar to any specific copyrighted work, they can dilute the market for works similar to those found in its training data, including by generating material stylistically similar to those works.”The Copyright Office stopped short of recommending legislative intervention in the US, noting that voluntary licensing were already under way with some AI companies, and allowing licensing would allow AI innovation to continue to “advance without undermining intellectual property rights.”Farquhar’s argument that how generative AI uses copyrighted works would stack up if there were proper guarantees that all usage would be transformative and would not affect the markets from which they’re drawing from.In many of the industries, AI could have devastating effects. In news, for example, AI summaries in Google search already mean people click through to stories less frequently for information, and referrals from AI chatbots compared to the amount of times that AI crawls a page are even worse.To argue that fair use for AI based on the US law is something Australia should aspire to overlooks that it’s hardly settled law, and is being hard fought in the courts. Rushing to give the tech companies what they want in the name of innovation for one new industry could come at the expense of many other industries.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)AtlassianComputingLaw (Australia)Intellectual propertyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Summer heatwaves are so frequent, they’re stretching the bounds of what we think of as summer. Hot-and-bothered home working and sweaty, sleepless nights are now alarmingly common.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Get a good fan and you can dodge the temptation of air conditioning. Air con is incredibly effective, but it uses a lot of electricity … and burning fossil fuels is how we got into this mess in the first place. Save money and carbon by opting for a great fan instead.Fans are much more energy efficient than aircon. A typical portable air conditioner uses 1,000W of electricity, which would cost about 26p an hour to run. The fans I tested used between 8W and 60W; my favourite, the AirCraft Lume, used 18W on its top setting. You could run it on max for 56 hours, and it would still use no more electricity (money, carbon) than a single aircon unit going for an hour.I tested 15 fans of all shapes and sizes, so you can pick the best one for you. I tested them for size, noise, power use and, of course, how much they cool you down. I also tested a few “evaporative coolers”, which use water to cool the air blowing at you while using significantly less energy than aircon.Due to recent heatwaves, stock is running low on many of these models – we’ve marked up any that are out of stock at the time of publication.Still in stockBest misting fan:Shark FlexBreeze Pro Mist FA300UK£219 at John LewisBest for style:Vortex Air Pro Plus£159.99 at Vortex AirBest for pointing in two directions at once:Shark TurboBlade TF200SUK£249.99 at Electric ShopBest for smart controls:Duux Whisper Flex£166.65 at AmazonBest for room-filling breeze:VonHaus air circulator desk fan£69.99 at VonHausBest for looks and design:Dyson Cool CF1£249 at John LewisBest for hay fever and allergy sufferers:Blueair ComfortPure 3-in-1 T20i£339 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’m an award-winning consumer tech journalist with decades of experience testing gadgets. I’m also a menopausal woman in her 50s who honestly can’t remember the last time she felt cold: I think that might be why we gravitate towild swimmingin middle age. Oh, and I have a degree in engineering. So I’m triply qualified to put these fans through their paces, scientifically and subjectively.How I testedView image in fullscreenAn anemometer was used to measure the air speed each fan generates on its top setting.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI chose 15 fans, each from different brands, aiming for a mix of new and highly rated models plus a few stellar bargains. I wanted to make sure there was something for everyone before I put them through their paces.I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) the fans use, an anemometer to measure the air speed they generate on the top setting, and the Sound Meter app to measure the noise on the top setting (they were all too quiet to register on their lowest).I measured everything from 1m away, although in reality, you’ll probably position a tower or pedestal fan farther away and a desk fan closer to you. That means the noise a desk fan makes matters more.I also measured them myself, as sometimes the official specs can be misleading or wrong. For example, I measured a tower fan that was supposedly 17cm wide, only to find that wasn’t including the base. Here I’ve stuck with each fan’s largest dimensions, including their footprint.I used a thermometer to measure the impact of the evaporative coolers I tested, and took note of everything from how cooling each of the fans felt, how annoying the noise was and how good the controls were. I also considered how they looked and how small they packed away, as well as the price tag.All the fans that weren’t returned to the manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that furnishes the empty social homes in which women and children are placed after domestic abuse.The best fans in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBest fan overall:AirCraft LumeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£149 at AirCraftPreorder now for delivery during week commencing22 SeptemberThis pedestal fan was hard to fault, with an elegant design that boasts a dimmable backlight (three brightness levels or you can turn it off, all with the remote control). It’s billed as height adjustable, but rather than scooting up and down, you can remove the bottom pole to convert it into a 63cm desk fan. There’s an LED display and touch controls on the front, and other features include a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode.Of all I tested, this is probably the best fan for sleeping: it’s the best for low noise relative to wind speed. Pick a lower setting for silent cooling, a higher setting if you’re happy to doze off to the white noise, or use the sleep button if you’d like it to gradually reduce power in the night. I found the lower settings cooling enough to get to sleep on a hot night during a heatwave.Why we love itWhen I’m working from home or relaxing (I can’t say chilling out when it’s 30C+), the AirCraft Lume is the fan that I reach for. I love it for many reasons. It’s light but with a reassuringly heavy base, giving it Weeble-like stability: it’s difficult to knock over. It packs away pretty small for the winter because the pole comes apart. I also liked that the packaging is almost plastic-free.It oscillates both horizontally and vertically, so it can circulate air nicely around a whole room. Most importantly of all, this fan can really shift air – its 5.9m/s (metres a second) result was the best on test, and you can really feel it. During a recent heatwave, I found the powerful breeze genuinely cooling. And it’s quiet: in fact, I can’t hear it at all on levels 1-5, so I need to be careful that I remember to turn off the fan when I step away. All for a reasonable price, too.It’s a shame that …there’s nowhere to stow the remote control when it’s not in use.Style:pedestal (or desk)Dimensions:37 x 28 x 95cm (WDH)Number of speeds:12Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:55dBPower use on top setting:18WAir speed on top setting:5.9 metres a second (m/s)Beat the heat: 14 expert tips for keeping cool in hot weatherRead moreBest budget fan and best desk fan:DevoladeskfanView image in fullscreen£59.95 at Devola£59.95 at AirconCentreCurrently out of stockThis affordable desk fan punches well above its weight, with good features and powerful airflow. It has a display, touch controls, a remote, a timer and sleep mode. You can choose vertical oscillation (90 degrees), horizontal oscillation (80 degrees) or use both to circulate the air in a room. Not bad for a humble desk fan.Why we love itIt’s a bargain powerhouse, producing a substantial wind. I measured an air speed of 4m/s, which was among the best on test. It certainly felt cooling.I couldn’t hear the Devola on the first three of its nine speeds, despite being powerfully cooling, and even when the noise got louder on higher settings, it wasn’t too annoying. In fact, while the AirCraft Lume is my favourite bedside fan, the Devola perched on a bedside table does a good job on a budget. It’s powerfully cooling, inaudible on lower settings (1-3 out of 9) and on high settings, the white noise is OK to go to sleep to. Just don’t use the sleep setting: it’s noisier than it should be, so picking a medium setting worked best. Even the high settings provide a level of white noise I could go to sleep to.It’s a shame that …the display is on the base facing upwards, so you can’t see it unless you’re nearby. There was no instruction manual in the box, either, although I found it straightforward to use.Style:deskDimensions:30 x 21 x 31cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:50dBPower use on top setting:16WAir speed on top setting:4m/sBest misting fan:Shark FlexBreeze Pro Mist FA300UKView image in fullscreen£219 at John Lewis£220 at ArgosThis Shark model is much more than a pedestal fan. You can remove the pole to convert it to a desk fan. You can unplug it for cordless use. You can even add the included five-litre water tank for misting outdoors. And you can do any permutation of these things.The design is great, and the remote control stows on the back magnetically.Despite its misting feature, it’s not technically anevaporative cooler, since you can only use it with water outdoors. It sprays a fine mist of water into the air in front of the fan: you get cool, but everything gets a bit damp.Why we love itIt’s incredibly versatile. Plug it in for everyday use, then carry it elsewhere (there’s a large top handle) to use as a cordless fan, or for a cooling mist on the patio while you’re entertaining outdoors. The cordless runtime is quoted as two to 24 hours, depending on fan speed, and charging time is five to six hours.Power use was impressively low: 14W on the top fan setting, 7W to charge the battery, 21W to do both at once.I compared it with the test-winning AirCraft Lume, which costs £70 less. Both are a similar size and design. The Shark has fewer fan speeds: five as opposed to the AirCraft’s 12. The design looks similar, but the head of the Shark is much deeper (33cm compared with 15cm). And it only oscillates side to side rather than up and down; you can point it at various angles, though.At 4.7m/s, the top air speed is impressive, although not quite as high as the AirCraft’s. It’s quiet enough that you can’t even hear it on the first two of its five speeds, whereas peak volume is exactly the same as the AirCraft.Is it worth £70 more? If you’ll make use of it being cordless or plan to use it outdoors, then yes. If not, stick with the AirCraft.It’s a shame that …the misting can only be used outside.Style:pedestal (or desk)Dimensions:35 x 35 x 95cm (WDH)Number of speeds:5Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:55dBPower use on top setting:21WAir speed on top setting:4.7m/sBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518View image in fullscreen£99.99 at Amazon£109.99 with wifi voice control at B&QCurrently out of stockThis tower fan is slim but striking in black. Features include 90-degree oscillation, a 0- to 12-hour timer, a sleep mode where the fan speed decreases gradually, and an auto mode that adapts the fan speed depending on the room temperature.Why we love itAt full blast, the Dreo felt positively windy and was definitely cooling on a hot day. On the two lowest settings, no sound was audible, but I could still feel a gentle breeze. I also liked the recess at the top-back that makes it easy to carry with one hand.It’s billed as a “25dB silent bladeless fan”, but I measured 60dB on top whack from a metre away. The sound wasn’t too annoying, though, and the fan’s powerful cooling made it forgivable.It’s a shame that …its energy consumption is relatively high. We’re talking pennies in electricity, but still, energy efficiency is good. Also, there’s nowhere to clip the remote control.Style:towerDimensions:32 x 32 x 106cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:60dBPower use on top setting:29WAir speed on top setting:3.6m/sBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air FlexUSBfanView image in fullscreen£39.99 at Morphy RichardsCurrently out of stock£37.21 at AmazonPreorder for delivery between 30 August and 3 OctoberThis is the fan you can take with you anywhere. I don’t mean to fan yourself by hand: it folds down small and it’s cordless and USB rechargeable, so you can be the smuggest person on the train and a very happy camper on a hot day. It can also give you a breeze on a still day on the patio. The battery will last from four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. And you can plug it into a laptop at your desk or even apower bankfor more juice.Why we love itThe 2.6m/s air speed can’t compete with the big fans on test – and it wasn’t the one I reached for during a heatwave – but that’s not what it’s for. It’s an electric fan that can go anywhere, folding down to a cylinder measuring 18 x 18 x 12cm. You can even hang it on the wall, if you wish. It’s rechargeable and you can even use it with aUSB power bankto keep it running anywhere, so you can cool down in a tent or on the train. Far better than a handheld fan. I’d definitely take this fan on holiday.There’s no timer or sleep mode, but there’s a “nature mode” that varies the speed to mimic a breeze. And it does oscillate (to 90 degrees). It’s also quiet: I couldn’t hear it on the first of its three speeds, and it was never loud enough to be annoying.It’s a shame that …air speed dips slightly when it’s not plugged in, but only slightly (2.5m/s instead of 2.6m/s)Style:deskDimensions:18 x 18 x 22cm (WDH)Number of speeds:3Remote control?NoPeak noise level on test:35dBPower use on top setting:8WAir speed on top setting:2.6m/sBestevaporative cooler:SwanNordic air coolerView image in fullscreen£69.99 at Swan£69.99 at AmazonCurrently out of stockThe air speed may not be great, but this Swan model is still a good buy because it’s an evaporative cooler, meaning it uses water from its five-litre reservoir to cool the air it blows at you. It can be used as a regular fan, too. Evaporative coolers are much more energy efficient than air conditioning, so they use much less power (and therefore less carbon, assuming you’re not on a renewable tariff or producing your own electricity).Why we love itOf the two evaporative coolers I tested, this worked the best. I could see the temperature on the thermometer go down: it cooled by more than 1C in less than 30 minutes. And it felt like a cooling breeze. In fact, it felt a bit like aircon.I just filled it with water, but it comes with two ice packs that you can pre-freeze and throw into the reservoir for even colder results.The breeze felt wide, rather than focused. This is a question of personal taste: some people want a powerful fan that’s focused to blast just them, while others prefer a room-filling breeze. In oscillating mode, it’s wider still, as the grille at the front rotates, which is a bit hypnotic. It’s good-looking, too, in a coffee-coloured oatmeal or grey finish. It’s light and on casters, so easy to move around, and its modes include normal, natural, sleep and timer.It’s a shame that …you can hear the water in the pipes: it sounded like a leak. You might even find yourself needing the loo. I also found myself reaching for a fan on a hot day – it provides a light breeze, not a blast of wind. But the air that it puts out is genuinely cooler than the rest of the air in the room.Style:towerDimensions:29 x 24 x 71cm (WDH)Number of speeds:24Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:45dBPower use on top setting:26WAir speed on top setting:0.9m/sSearching for more inspiration?

It’s useful year-round, too, doubling as a fan heater. But it’s hard to categorise: too short for a tower fan, too tall for a desk fan.There’s a timer and it oscillates horizontally (71 degrees) and vertically (180 degrees), though it’s hard to imagine why you’d want to point it completely down.

Its swing mode moves horizontally, and you can manually move the grilles to angle the air up or down. It’s on casters, too.I liked its large (10-litre) water capacity and how quiet it was, but the fan wasn’t strong enough, and the evaporative mode wasn’t cold enough.

You can angle each arm independently, good for pointing at two people. It’s height-adjustable and can oscillate (180 degrees) horizontally too. I liked that the remote attaches to the top with a strong magnet.It’s powerful, but the sound is very annoying: it sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and I wanted it to stop. It also used the most power on test; even still, a 60W fan costs less than 2p an hour to run at the current energy price cap, so it’s pennies compared with air con.It didn’t make the final cut because …I hated the noise it makes.Style:pedestal;dimensions:80 x 30 x 78-95cm (WDH), or 124 x 30 x 114-130cm in vertical mode;number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:60W;air speed on top setting:3.1m/sDuux Whisper Flex 2View image in fullscreen£166.65 at AmazonBest for:smart controlsThis took quite a bit of assembly, but it’s good-looking, can be converted into a 54cm-high desk fan by removing a pole, and the tech is clever too. You can control it with an app or by voice (Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant) to set up to seven schedules. There’s an optional battery and charging dock to make it cordless.It’s fairly quiet and oscillates well, vertically and horizontally, but I found the standard controls annoying. The display on the base points upwards, so it’s hard to see from across the room, and you have to point the remote very accurately at it.I did like the compostable packaging.

The magnetic storage on top for the remote control is clever. The controls work well and let you easily set the timer and sleep mode.I couldn’t hear this bladeless fan on the first six of its 10 speeds, and I found the noise easy to live with even at higher speeds.It didn’t make the final cut because …the price is hard to justify.

Its three-year warranty is a bonus, too (most have two).Overall, I liked it. It’s good-looking and pretty strong, although it’s weaker when cordless; for example, air speed dropped from an impressive 4.6m/s to 3.1m/s when I unplugged it.

They don’t have to be old-fashioned; some have modern designs. And some are convertible, with a pole you can remove to turn them into a desk fan. They can be good for a focused blast of cooling wind.Bladeless fansaren’t magic; they just don’t have visible blades. The work is done in the body of the fan, and then air is pushed out of a nozzle. The Dyson, VortexAir and Shark on test are all bladeless. They look modern and are easy to clean. And there are no moving parts on show, meaning zero chance of getting your hair caught.Tower fansare tall and narrow. They produce a lot of wind and oscillate from side to side, making them good for a room like an office.Desk fansare like pedestal fans without the pole. They’re not only for desks, they’re good on a bedside table too. And they take up less storage space over the winter.Evaporative coolersuse water from a reservoir to cool the air that blows at you. They don’t produce a powerful wind like a fan, but they genuinely cool the room and are much more energy efficient than air conditioning. Note that they only cool the room a little – they won’t turn it fridge cold like aircon.What does oscillation mean?Most fans oscillate (move back and forth) by swivelling on their base, and some let you select how wide an angle you want. If it’s just for you, pick a narrow angle; if you’re cooling the whole office, go wide. Some fans achieve the same effect in other ways, such as by moving louvres. Some also oscillate up and down, so the fan can circulate air all over the room to create a gentle breeze.What’s sleep mode?Most fans have a sleep mode, where every 30 or 60 minutes the fan lowers its setting until it reaches a certain point. This is a good compromise that helps you get to sleep without wasting energy, minimising the risk of waking up in the middle of the night suddenly cold.Start by lowering the fan speed to the point where you don’t find it annoying. In fact, some people find the white noise of a fan helpful at bedtime. Then switch to sleep mode.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreWhere is the best place to position a fan?For personal comfort, simply point it towards you. The cooling feeling is because the moving air from the fan displaces the warm, humid air near your skin, which in turn helps your sweat evaporate, cooling your body down. It’s like a breeze rather than a still day. Or why it feels colder swimming in a river than in a lake, even if the water temperature is the same. Evaporative coolers, of which I’ve included two above, use water to actively cool the air.Never place a fan up against a wall because air needs to flow into the back. If the air’s cooler outside, put the fan in front of an open window or door to bring in the cooler air.How much does a fan cost to use?I’ll set out the maths. For each fan here, I’ve measured its power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). If, for example, you were using a 30W fan for five hours, it would use 150Wh. Divide by 1,000 to convert it to kilowatt hours: 0.150kWh.The energy price cap for 1 July to 30 September 2025 is 25.73p per kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll discover it will cost just under 4p to run that fan for five hours. Or £14 to run it for five hours every day for a year.Running fans is pretty cheap, then, and a good fan will keep you cool enough to dodge buying any kind of air conditioning. An evaporative cooler is a good alternative to aircon. The two I tested used 26W (Swan) and 39W (Honeywell), so they use about 3% of the electricity of a typical portable air conditioner (1,000W). The effect isn’t the same: you can’t turn your bedroom into a fridge. But you can cool the air enough to make a big difference when there’s a heatwave.Do I need air conditioning?If you’re in the UK, honestly, no. It’s tempting to turn your bedroom into a walk-in fridge on a hot day, but fans are great and use much less electricity (and therefore money and carbon) than aircon. Unless you’re on a renewable tariff, electricity use accelerates climate breakdown.Caramel Quin is ajournalist specialising in consumer technology.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Once the preserve of hikers and gym-goers, water bottles have become a small but significant act of environmental virtue signalling. Not all bottles are created equal, though. Some are insulated, some leak, some weigh as much as a toddler, and some even infuse your water with hydrogen (more on that later). The choice is dizzying.It’s time to lock in, reader. I’ve dedicated months to finding the best water bottles. I’ve bored my friends and family with tales of weight v capacity. I’ve thrown water bottles around my garden. Join me in the quest to stay hydrated and vaguely hopeful about the planet – and find your perfect water bottle along the way.At a glanceBest water bottle overall:Owala FreeSipFrom £31.99 at OwalaBest budget water bottle:Ion8 stainless-steel water bottle£12.99 at DecathlonBest stainless-steel water bottle:Frank Green ceramic reusable water bottleFrom £34.99 at Frank GreenBest water bottle for kids:Yeti Rambler Jr kids’ water bottle£22.50 at BBQ WorldBest sustainable water bottle:Ocean Bottle Go water bottleFrom £38 at Ocean BottleWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing products professionally for more than four years. I’ve assessed so many things, from tablets and trampolines to slow cookers and SPF. My family has become used to rating anything they come across out of five (not so welcome when it’s my cooking that’s being rated, if I’m honest).I’ve tested kids’ water bottles and cups before, and I’m also on a quest to better hydrate myself after several medical professionals told me I’m so dehydrated that I’m virtually desiccated (they didn’t use that actual term).In that quest, I’ve experienced school bags filled with water, mouldy water bottles that are impossible to clean and straws that melt in the dishwasher. Here, I’ve included only water bottles that went through my rigorous testing and came out on top. Life is too short to suffer a rubbish water bottle.How I testedView image in fullscreenThe bottles were hung from a washing line in a bag to test their leakproof claims.Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianI spent two months testing water bottles, trying out 42. I recruited my family as co-testers, and let my three children put the kids’ water bottles through what feels like the ultimate test: a day at a British primary school.During testing, I weighed the water bottles when empty and full. I dropped them from waist height on to a hard floor to see how they withstood the impact. I also put each water bottle on its side in a bag and hung them from my washing line for 30 minutes to see if they leaked. If the water bottles were insulated, I checked how quickly the liquid warmed over a few hours.As well as performance, I did a deep dive into sustainability. I wanted to see which water-bottle brands were all mouth in the eco-friendly stakes – what initiatives did they have beyond creating a reusable water bottle? And how durable and recyclable were the bottles? After testing the water bottles, I donated them to charity for resale.Here are the nine water bottles that performed best in my tests.The best water bottles in 2025View image in fullscreenSip, sup, swig … get into a good hydration routine with a water bottle you can trust.Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianBest water bottle overall:Owala FreeSipView image in fullscreenFrom £31.99 at Owala£32 at Urban OutfittersI challenge you to get through a TikTok doomscroll without coming across an Owala FreeSip water bottle. It’s been the “it” water bottle for a while, and it actually deserves the gen Z hype.The bottle comes in three sizes: 24oz, 32oz and 40oz. In my opinion, the 24oz (just over 700ml) is a perfect size: it fits in cup holders yet doesn’t need refilling every hour. The stainless-steel design is triple insulated and has a one-handed flip-lid opening. What sets the FreeSip apart is the spout – you can sip your drink through a straw or gulp it from the free pour.Why we love itThis is the water bottle I went back to during and after testing. A FreeSip is sitting next to me as I type this.Owala sells this bottle in a fun range of colours, so you can find one that fits your style. It’s also practical: the FreeSip doesn’t weigh much considering it offers decent insulation (it keeps drinks icy for hours, even in a heatwave).The FreeSip is also easy to clean – its lid screws off and the bottle is wide enough to really get in there and blitz it. The rigid straw is easy to scrub using a bottle brush, and so is the spout. There’s a removable silicone seal, which I haven’t found harbours any mould; I give this a soak and find it’s an easy job.Most importantly, I can chuck my FreeSip in any bag and be confident it won’t leak – I’m even happy to throw it in a bag with my laptop, which I’d be wary about with most other water bottles. It also survived the drop test, and I’m confident it’s built to last.During testing, many of my friends remarked on my FreeSip and then went out and bought their own, becoming converts themselves. OK, it’s more pricey than other bottles on this list (especially when you take into account shipping costs), but you’ll never get water-bottle envy again.It’s a shame that …the shipping costs and taxes on these water bottles are so high.Dishwasher safe:lid, yes; bottle body, hand-washBPA free:yesSizes available:24oz (710ml), 32oz (910ml), 40oz (1.2l)Weight empty(710ml):390gWeight filled(710ml):1.07kgBest budgetwater bottle:Ion8 stainless-steel water bottleView image in fullscreen£12.99 at Decathlon£13 at ArgosThe Ion8 water bottle offers much of the same functionality as others on this list, but at a fraction of the price. It’s stainless steel and has a flip-lid spout, with a carry hook in the lid. It’s not thermally insulated, though, which may account for why it’s more affordable.Ion8 produces this water bottle in an array of colours, so you’re sure to find something you like. At 400ml capacity, it can be slipped easily into most bags.Why we love itThis bottle passed most of my testing criteria with flying colours. Perhaps most importantly, it didn’t leak in a bag when laid flat for an extended period. It’s lightweight too – it offers less capacity than many bottles on this list, but it’s great for the commute and chucking in your bag on the run.My kids also liked it for taking to school and sports clubs. I appreciated that it fitted in my car’s cup holder – so many water bottles I tested didn’t.It remained unfazed by the drop test, too, so it’s durable. As it’s a tip-and-pour bottle rather than a straw water bottle (there’s an optional straw included, but I went without), it’s easier to clean. I personally found the carry handle uncomfortable to use, though: the loop is small and got stuck on my fingers.It’s a shame that …Ion8 says this is a one-handed opening flip lid, but I found it clunky. I needed two hands to open the bottle, and I usually like to think of myself as fairly dexterous.Dishwasher safe:yes, on a cool cycleBPA free:yesSizes available:400ml, 600ml, 1lWeight empty (600ml):259g (including straw)Weight filled (600ml):676gBest stainless-steel water bottle:Frank Green ceramic reusable water bottleView image in fullscreenFrom £34.99 at Frank Green£39.99 at AmazonI’d heard about how indestructible Frank Green water bottles are, so I was keen to see how they fared in my own tests. They’re customisable right down to the colour of the lid, bottle and style of straw. There was a menu of 17 bottle colours at the time of writing, from pretty pastels to utilitarian navy and khaki.The bottle I tested had a flip-straw lid, but there are five lid options to choose from. You can open the flip-straw lid with one hand, with the spout flicking open for you to sip from. It also comes with a flexible carry handle that’s big enough to be useful, plus impressive triple-walled insulation.Why we love itIt’s perhaps superficial, but I found the colours on offer appealing. My mint-green water bottle is easy to spot in my Mary Poppins-style tote bag without looking garish. And, during its time in residence at the bottom of said bag, I was pleased to find it didn’t leak a drop. The bottle also performed well in my drop test, looking as good as new despite plummeting on to a hard floor from a height.The mechanism on the flip-straw lid is smooth, even after several washes. Frank Green lines its water bottles with a ceramic coating, which it claims prevents that weird metal-tainted water taste you sometimes get. It’s hard to test this against rivals, but I never noticed a metallic taste. The straw inside is made from metal, which felt more durable – I’m all for less plastic in general.It’s a shame that …even the smallest (595ml) bottle becomes heavy when filled, perhaps because of the heavy-duty insulation.Dishwasher safe:lid, yes; bottle body, noBPA free:yesSizes:595ml, 1l and 2lWeight empty (595ml):340gWeight filled (595ml):870gBest water bottle for kids:Yeti Rambler Jr kids’ water bottleView image in fullscreen£22.50 at BBQ World£24.99 at Ann’s CottageYeti specialises in heavy-duty apparel, and no one needs a heavy-duty water bottle more than kids – specificallymykids. Everything about this insulated water bottle is robust, from the (slightly stiff) screw-on lid to the large, tactile carry handle. And adding to the utility feel, the bottle’s opening is wide – great for jamming in loads of ice, if you want.The double-walled insulation kept my kids’ drinks icy for about three hours, even on hot days. The Rambler Jr comes in nine bright colours, which will make it easy to spot in the classroom.Why we love itOne of the most important tests for kids’ water bottles, if you ask me, is the leak test. Too many times I’ve seen my kids’ reading books end up in a pool of water in their bags. Thankfully, the Yeti Rambler Jr passed this test.It’s easy to open one-handed, even for younger hands with less developed fine-motor skills. A rigid straw flicks up when you exert pressure on the tab. And this spout survived my kids knocking it around on the playing field at school, and didn’t seem to suffer any bite marks either.I liked that this bottle comes with two straws; it’s always nice to have a spare. And, as a time-poor parent, I was happy to find that the whole thing washes well in the dishwasher.It’s a shame that …there isn’t a wider selection of designs.Dishwasher safe:yesBPA free:yesSizes:355mlWeight empty:500gWeight filled:855gskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s a certified B Corp, and makes impressive pledges with every bottle you buy.As well as its eco credentials, I loved using the Ocean Bottle Go. It’s lightweight, has a flip-lid cap and a silicone straw inside. These bottles come in a range of shades and have a coating on the outside to stop them slipping through your fingers.Why we love itThe Ocean Bottle Go is brilliant for use on the go. It’s lightweight and small enough to slip into most bags, while the anti-slip coating means it doesn’t become slippery even when wet.It’s insulated as well, and kept the ice in my drink icy for almost 90 minutes – and pleasingly cold for a lot longer. This bottle passed my leak test with flying colours, too.As well as this, Ocean Bottle says revenue from each bottle soldfunds the collection of 11.4kg of plastic– the equivalent of 1,000 plastic bottles – that would otherwise be bound for the ocean.Using near-field communication and an app on your phone, you can track how many times you’ve refilled your bottle. From here, you can monitor your hydration, and if you’re using an iPhone, it will also transfer this info to your Health app – although you can switch this off. Each time you log a refill in the app, Ocean Bottle funds the collection of an additional five ocean-bound plastic bottles. You can see your “impact progress” in the app.I found this feature a faff, as you have to wave your bottle near your phone every time you refill, but I loved seeing my hydration and impact clocking up.It’s a shame that …for the price, the capacity isn’t larger (Ocean Bottle does offerlarger sizes of its Original bottle, though).Dishwasher safe:yesBPA free:yesSizes:500mlWeight empty:287gWeight filled:752gThe best of the restEcho Flask hydrogen water bottleView image in fullscreen£283.99 at Healf£299 at Echo WaterBest for:hydration obsessivesI first learned about hydrogen water bottles this year, and I was a sceptic. I mean, look at the price tag – are people really paying that for a water bottle? Then I got the Echo Flask in for review, and was converted.You plug your water bottle into the wall (I know, but stick with me here …) and charge it up. You then use the touchscreen on the water bottle to start a 10-minute cycle of releasing hydrogen into the water inside.There is a school of thought that introducing more hydrogen into your water reduces oxidative stress, improves your athletic performance and shortens recovery time. Some studies have been done to prove this theory, includingone on rats. Thejury remains outon exactly how amazing hydrogen water is for humans.It’s impossible to test these claims as I am just one person without access to a lab, but here’s my anecdotal experience: I drank from this water bottle every morning and noticed I didn’t get dehydration headaches, and never suffered a hangover.As you may expect for the price, the bottle pairs with a smartphone via Bluetooth and gives you lots of data to keep you motivated, if that’s your thing. This includes how many “flasks” you’ve consumed v the goals you’ve set, the length of your goal-meeting streak, and how much water and hydrogen you’ve consumed. It will also send you reminders on your phone for you to drink, should you forget.It didn’t make the final cut because …the price made me balk. And the lid leaked during testing.Dishwasher safe:No, but it mostly cleans itself.There’s a self-clean cycle you can select onscreen – for a deep clean, add a drop of white wine vinegar to the clean cycle.BPA free:yesSizes:12oz (350ml)Weight empty:487gWeight filled:793gChilly’s Series 2 water bottleView image in fullscreenFrom £15 at Chilly’s£30 at John LewisBest for:drinking on the goThe beauty of this bottle is its simplicity. There’s no Bluetooth connectivity or dual spouts here. So, if your water-bottle preference is free pour rather than straw, Chilly’s Series 2 is a great option.It’s well made and durable. The spout is curved to prevent spillages when on the move or in a rush, and I found it comfortable to drink from. It’s easy to clean, too.The metal bottle is double-wall insulated, and it kept my drink cold for hours. I liked the rubber base, which gave it a soft landing and protected it from bumps. A simple carry strap can be used, which I found useful (often on water bottles, I’ve found the straps superfluous to my needs).It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pricey for a simple water bottle.Dishwasher safe:noBPA free:yesSizes:350ml, 500ml, 1lWeight empty (500ml):302gWeight filled (500ml):805gAir Up Click water bottleView image in fullscreen£19.99 at Boots£25 at Sainsbury’sBest for:those who hate waterMark my words, this water bottle (which has enjoyed premium status in tweens’ lives for a good few years) is for kids more than adults. The idea is that you attach a scented ring-shaped plastic pod around the straw, and your mind is tricked into thinking the water is flavoured as you sip.I’m not convinced by this functionality. It works for a sip or two, but then my brain quickly realises it’s being tricked. However, my kids loved the concept and all the many child-friendlyflavours the pods come in. All the scents are made from natural flavours extracted from fruits, spices and herbs. It’s worth bearing in mind that the pods need replacing when they lose their scent, and they cost from£4.99 for a pack of three.I liked that the lid stays attached on the Click – previous versions didn’t offer this. Now kids can’t lose the lids in the school playground. Honestly, anything that gets my kids to drink water at this point is a win.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t pass the leak test.Dishwasher safe:yesBPA free:yesSizes:600mlWeight empty:170gWeight filled:770gStanley Quencher H2.0 tumblerView image in fullscreenFrom £35 at Stanley£45 at John LewisBest for:working from homeWhen staying hydrated crosses over into a personality trait, many people – particularly gen Z – seem to reach for a Stanley Quencher. Make no mistake, the Quencher is a style statement. It comes in an array of shades and limited editions with cutesy names such as “hydrangea” and “dried pine”.The 1.8l bottle I tested is enormous – my heart sank when I had to take it out of the house, despite the massive handle on it. It honestly took me back to the days when I used to carry a toddler on my hip, such is the size and weight. However, at home I was deeply into the Quencher. I found it brilliant during the working day as I didn’t have to refill it as often.There are three positions for the lid – covered, straw or sip.I tended to opt for the straw, but it’s not leakproof, so if you’re on the go, you’ll have to make do without it. Stanley says it keeps drinks cold for 12 hours – but I noticed my drink slightly warming after about four hours in my tests.It didn’t make the cut because …it’s impractically big, and therefore lacks the versatility of other bottles on this list (but it does fit car cup holders).Dishwasher safe:yesBPA free:yesSizes:590ml, 890ml, 1.18lWeight empty (1.18l):658gWeight filled (1.18l):1.8kgWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Take your time to find a water bottle you love, and you shouldn’t be tempted to replace it.’Photograph: CasarsaGuru/Getty ImagesWhat to look for in a water bottleThe key features are capacity and lid or spout style; make sure these fit your preferences and lifestyle. If you’ll be taking your water bottle out with you a lot, you’ll need to balance capacity against how heavy it is. You’ll also want something that’s reliably leak-free – look at the lid design and check the seals.Insulation is worth considering. Having used an insulated water bottle, I could never go back. Why suffer tepid water if you don’t have to?Most insulated water bottles are made from metal, which means they’re typically recyclable, durable and, importantly, BPA free. BPA (bisphenol A) is a synthetic chemical used in some rigid plastic food containers, andrepeated exposure may cause health problems. Always look for BPA-free water bottles – all the ones on this list are.Take your time to find a water bottle you love, and you shouldn’t be tempted to replace it; this will not only serve you well, but the environment too. Ideally, you should opt for sustainable water bottles that are made from recycled materials and designed for long-term use.How often do you need to clean your water bottle?Regular cleaning helps prevent bacteria and mould from building up in your water bottle. To keep your bottle hygienic, you should clean it properly at least once a day.That means taking it apart and giving it a good wash in warm, soapy water – a quick rinse under the tap won’t cut it. Soak your bottle for 10 minutes, then rinse with more hot water. It’s best to let it air dry rather than drying it by hand. Stick to environmentally friendly washing-up liquid if you’re keen to reduce your environmental impact. If your bottle is dishwasher safe, you can pop it in there instead.Are reusable water bottles environmentally friendly?Reusable water bottles are undeniably better for the environment when compared with their single-use plastic counterparts. In the UK alone, an estimated 35.8m plastic bottles are used every day, and just 55% are recycled.Producing a reusable bottle requires more energy upfront, but that impact is offset over time. The key is repeated use:an MIT studyestimates that a reusable bottle needs to be used between 10 and 20 times to break even with the carbon footprint of a single-use bottle.The more durable the bottle, the better. A water bottle that has a fully stainless-steel body is best, despite the carbon footprint involved in producing it. Stainless steel lasts longer, has a lower impact over its lifetime, and is easier to recycle at the end of its life than plastic alternatives.Zoë Phillimore is ajournalist with 20 years of experience.

The 2016 historical drama series tells of the rise of the powerful Florentine banking dynasty, and with it, the story of the Renaissance. Until recently, I could simply have gone to Netflix and found it there, alongside a wide array of award-winning and obscure titles. But when I Google the show in 2025, the Netflix link only takes me to a blank page. I don’t see it on HBO Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, or any of the smaller streaming platforms. On Amazon Prime I am required to buy each of the three seasons or 24 episodes separately, whereupon they would be stored in a library subject toovernight deletion. Raised in the land of The Pirate Bay, the Swedish torrent index, I feel, for the first time in a decade, a nostalgia for the high seas of digital piracy. And I am not alone.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For my teenage self in the 00s, torrenting was the norm. Need the new Coldplay album on your iPod? ThePirate Bay. The 1968 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet? The Pirate Bay. Whatever you needed was accessible with just a couple of clicks. But as smartphones proliferated, so did Spotify, the music streaming platform that is also headquartered in Sweden. The same Scandinavian country had become a hub of illegal torrenting and simultaneously conjured forth its solution.“Spotify would never have seen the light of day without The Pirate Bay,” Per Sundin, the then managing director of Universal Music Sweden,reflected in 2011. But music torrenting died out as we all either listened with ads or paid for the subscription. And when Netflix launched in Sweden in late 2012, open talk of torrenting moving images also stopped. Most of the big shows and a great collection of award-winning films could all be found for just 79 SEK (£6) a month. Meanwhile, the three founders of The Pirate Bay werearrested and eventually jailed. Pirating faded into the history books as far as I was concerned.In Sweden, 25% of people reported pirating in 2024 – a trend driven by 15-24-year-oldsA decade and a half on fromthe Pirate Bay trial, the winds have begun to shift. On an unusually warm summer’s day, I sit with fellow film critics by the old city harbour, once a haven for merchants and, rumour has it, smugglers. Coldbigstrongsin hand (that’s what they call pints up here), they start venting about the “enshittification” of streaming – enshittification being the process by which platforms degrade their services and ultimately die in the pursuit of profit. Netflix now costs upwards of 199 SEK (£15), and you need more and more subscriptions to watch the same shows you used to find in one place. Most platforms now offer plans that, despite the fee, force advertisements on subscribers. Regional restrictions often compel users to use VPNs to access the full selection of available content. The average European household now spends close to €700 (£600) a year on three or more VOD subscriptions. People pay more and get less.A fellow film critic confides anonymously: “I never stopped pirating, and my partner also does it if he doesn’t find the precise edition he is looking for on DVD.” While some people never abandoned piracy, others admit they have recently returned – this time turning to unofficial streaming platforms. One commonly used app is legal but can, through community add-ons, channel illicit streams. “Downloading is too difficult. I don’t know where to start,” says one film viewer. “The shady streams might bombard me with ads, but at least I don’t have to worry about getting hacked or caught.”View image in fullscreenLife on the open seas … Swedish-based filesharing website The Pirate Bay.Photograph: FocusDigital/AlamyAccording to London‑based piracy monitoring and content‑protection firm MUSO, unlicensed streaming is the predominant source of TV and film piracy,accounting for 96% in 2023. Piracy reached a low in 2020,with 130bn website visits. But by 2024 that number hadrisen to 216bn.In Sweden,25% of people surveyed reported pirating in 2024, a trend mostly driven by those aged 15 to 24. Piracy is back, just sailing under a different flag.Streaming was supposed to stop piracy. Now it is easier than everRead more“Piracy is not a pricing issue,” Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve, the company behind the world’s largest PC gaming platform, Steam,observed in 2011. “It’s a service issue.” Today, the crisis in streaming makes this clearer than ever. With titles scattered, prices on the rise, andbitrates throttled depending on your browser, it is little wonder some viewers are raising the jolly roger again. Studios carve out fiefdoms, build walls and levy tolls for those who wish to visit. The result is artificial scarcity in a digital world that promised abundance.Whether piracy today is rebellion or resignation is almost irrelevant; the sails are hoisted either way. As the streaming landscape fractures into feudal territories, more viewers are turning to the high seas. The Medici understood the value linked to access. A client could travel from Rome to London and still draw on their credit, thanks to a network built on trust and interoperability. If today’s studios want to survive the storm, they may need to rediscover that truth.Explore more on these topicsPiracyTV streamingTelevisionPirate BayMusic streamingInternetFilesharingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2021 it was a lie about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election; in the summer of 2025 it’s lies about crime levels. Reliable sources – including the Biden Department of Justice inJanuary– have noted that violent crime there is at a 30-year low. Five people died as a result of that 2021 attack on Congress, and dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, some gravely, by the mob Trump incited. On his first day in office in 2025 he pardoned 1,500 of the convicted criminals who stormed the capital, some of whom went on to commit more crimes.The hypocrisy is obvious, or it would be if most discourse about contemporary events wasn’t so contemporary that events before last month get left out. Of course hypocrisy and double standards are a key element of the rightwing commitment to inequality, and their violence imposes their version of order, even when it breaks bones and the law. As Wilhoit’s law famously put it: “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: there must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.”The former Doge employee who was attacked is 19-year-old Edward Coristine, AKA Big Balls. As long as we’re talking about violence, this spring the medical journal the Lancetestimatedthat Doge’s dismantling of USAid could result in more than 14m deaths, a third of them children, by 2030. When it comes to sheer numbers, that’s like killing everyone in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, or if you prefer everyone in Denmark, Norway and Estonia, but these deaths from disease, malnutrition and hunger will be largely out of sight for most Americans. Of course there’s been a lot of direct violence by the Trump administration on display in the United States this year too, including mothers dragged away from their children by heavily armed men in masks and immigrants brutalized in gulags in El Salvador.The attempt to take over the capital fits with rightwing and authoritarian agendas in so many ways. Modern conservatives love to hate cities because cities are places where diversity and inclusion thrive, where immigrants, people of many ethnicities, queer and trans people, nonconformists, bohemians, independent women and progressives tend to concentrate. A political map of the US mostly shows an archipelago of blue islands in a sea of red, and those islands are blue because they’re also Democratic strongholds.They are threats to the right electorally and because theyare hotbeds of tolerance and of cultural, religious, racial and sexual diversity, and most have high immigrant populations. By flourishing, they disprove the rightwing theory that if these things are permitted all hell will break loose. But it is more fun for the right to pretend that these cities are dangerous because they are cesspits of crime and depravity.That notion that cities or ethnic neighborhoods or progressive movements are out of control justifies harsh law enforcement and violations of rights in the name of getting them under control. In other words, it justifies authoritarianism, which claims to be protecting some of us while attacking lots of us. Something that’s also been part of rightwing discourse lately is able-bodied adult men claiming to be afraid to walk down the street in American cities. All through the years when my town, San Francisco, was being demonized by rightwing and some mainstream media, conservative tech dudes would claim to be afraid to take a stroll here, which comes across to normal city dwellers as astonishingly fragile and cowardly.Most recently the professional provocateur and pundit Charlie Kirktweeted: “Was just inNYCall weekend with our family. Never felt safe. So many people in the city who don’t belong. Praying for all involved.” Who doesn’t belong in a city? The answer would be: Kirk doesn’t if he’s unable to feel safe amid a diverse population.New York has long been a great city of immigrants, the most linguistically diverse city on Earth with 800 languages, including many endangered ones, spoken there, and a city whose tourism and convention bureau estimates 68 million apparently unafraid visitors will come to New York in 2025. Another rightwing pundit and social-media personality, Benny Johnson, just made lurid allegations about crimes he witnessed and suffered (but apparently failed to report at the time) in Washington DC, including his house being set on fire. Not to be outdone Senator Markwayne Mullindeclaredon Wednesday night on Fox News that he doesn’t wear a seatbelt when driving through DC so he can flee in a hurry if he’s carjacked.Authoritarians are at war with cities because they are at war with our rights and our diversity. It behooves us all to defend them – cities, rights, diversity, including by fending off the lies and propaganda that are themselves weapons in this war. And of course Trump is concocting a drama in DC, with the national guard being turned into an army of extras, because, speaking of violent crime, he would like us to really stop talking about theJeffrey Epsteinfiles and his long and close association with that child trafficker and rapist.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Don’t worry, he didn’t deport it, he cooked one for breakfast. Then he sat down with Katie Miller to tell her all about his baking skills in the very first episode of her brand-new podcast. Which, by the way, I have heroically listened to all 44 excruciating minutes of so that you don’t have to.Miller, for the uninitiated, is a Maga bigwig and married to Stephen Miller,Donald Trump’s far-right chief of staff and a man so odious his own uncle once wrote an article calling him a “hypocrite”.A Trump loyalist, Miller has form when it comes to surrounding herself with odious men: she held top communications jobs during Trump’s first term and, earlier this year, became a spokesperson for Elon Musk’s pet project, the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).In May, she absconded to amysterious roleat Musk’s private ventures. I imagine that she was attracted to Musk’s views on free speech (summed up as: I can say whatever I fancy but you can’t) because it’s been reported that when Miller was in university she once stole and threw away student newspapers because she didn’t like thepolitician they endorsed.Now, she’s launched theKatie Miller Podcast, the first episode of which came out on Monday. Why jump from the highest echelons of government into podcasting? According to Miller,it’s because“as a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full-time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself”.In a promo video, in which she sits cross-legged on an armchair (with shoes on!) in front of a bookshelf with three books on it, including The Great Gatsby and To Kill a Mockingbird, she explains that “there isn’t a place for conservative women to gather online” and she wanted to create a space to have “real honest conversations” about what matters to women.Apparently what matters to women is the minutiae of vice-president Vance’s life: the first 44-minute episode, which I suggest she renameBrief Interviews with Hideous Men, was devoted to fawning over a man who hassaidprofessional women “choose a path to misery” when they prioritize careers over children.Miller’s podcast is yet another reminder that Republicans are doing a far better job of spreading their talking points on new media than the DemocratsMiller, who is not a natural host, awkwardly serves softball questions (“is a hotdog a sandwich?”) while Vance drones on about what a great daddy and vice-president he is and how much he loves ice-cream and joking around with Marco Rubio. The closest they get to a controversial topic is Vance talking about all the memes he’s inspired and saying that one of his favourites features the pope, Usha Vance and a couch. (There have been online jokes that Vance wasintimate with a couchand that hekilled the pope.) There is also light mockery of Late Show host Stephen Colbert, whose show recently gotcancelled.Other than the memes, the most memorable moment of the episode is when Miller seems to imply that her husband subsists entirely on a diet of mayonnaise, like some sort of anaemic vampire. Stephen Miller also apparently runs around his house with his shoes on, as does JD. Usha, sensibly, takes her shoes off at the front door. All of this is exactly the sort of content I’m sure the busy mums are desperate for.Miller has said she thinks there is a gap in the market for podcasts aimed at conservative women, but the market says otherwise. While young women in the UStend to be progressive, there is a thriving “womanosphere” of anti-feminist media aimed at conservatives. Some of these outlets don’t explicitly cater to young conservative mums in the way that the Katie Miller Podcast says it does, but they’re still aiming for the same general demographic.Gen Z commentatorBrett Cooper, for example, who has 1.6 million YouTube subscribers, looks atpop culturewith a rightwing slant and her show attracts conservative female listeners. In between hot takes on Justin Bieber, Cooper argues that feminism’s goal is to “make men angry and dominate them”, a worldview that recently got her a gig at Fox News. Then there’s Candace Owens, a conservative conspiracy theorist who recently turned on Maga over the JeffreyEpstein filesfiasco. Owens has 4.57 millionsubscribers on YouTubeand her streams get millions of views. Bari Weiss also has a successful podcast and is currently in talks to sell her “anti-woke” media startup The Free Press for more than $200m to CBS News. The Financial Timesrecently reported: “Weiss has won over [CBS owner David Ellison] partly by taking a pro-Israel stance … as well as her ability to build a younger, digitally savvy audience.”Then, of course, you’ve got all thetrending “tradwife” contenton TikTok, where creators such asEstee WilliamsandGwen the Milkmaidglorify traditional gender roles. Beyond tradwives, there’s an ecosystem of lifestyle content aimed at young women that camouflages rightwing messages. Think: makeup tutorials with a running commentary about how feminism will make you miserable. Canadian media outlet Global News recently obtaineda report prepared byCanada’s Integrated Threat Assessment Centre that warns female “extremist influencers” are using popular online platforms to radicalize and recruit women.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sure, the Katie Miller Podcast isn’t an “official” White House podcast, but the humanizing interview with Vance, along with Miller’s deep Maga ties, suggest it is very much Trump-approved. In an interview with theWashington Postpublished on Tuesday, Miller also insinuated that her podcast is a voter recruitment drive for 2028. “In order to cultivate the future of Maga, we have to talk to women,” she said.As the Republicans stretch their tentacles further into the world of podcasting and TikTok, Democrats are stilldesperatelyjumping oncringememes to appeal to a younger audience while flailing around writing long policy documents about how they can spend millions of dollars manufacturing a “Joe Rogan of the left”. The Katie Miller Podcast may not end up being a hit, but it’s just one small part of a very effective Republican messaging strategy.Of course, the really important issue here – the question I’m sure you’re pondering right now – is whether the veep thinks a hotdog is a sandwich? The answer is: definitely not. Which, coincidentally, is also my answer to the question: will you ever voluntarily listen to the Katie Miller Podcast again?Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsPodcastingDigital mediaInternetWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)commentShareReuse this content"

But we need to oust corporate candidates firstAlexandra RojasThey need a new generation of leaders with fresh faces and bold ideas, unbought by corporate Super Pacs and billionaire donorsThu 14 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 12.01 EDTShareIf the Democratic party wants to win back power in 2028, then look no further than the 2026 election cycle as the most important moment to focus on.It is not three years from now when working class voters will decide, like they did in November, whether they still believe the Democratic party isn’t fighting for their interests – it’s the next 12 months. And to make it abundantly clear, it is not going to be the same 257Democratsthat are in Congress today that will deliver Democrats their majority. That’s why a robust, active, and exciting Democratic primary process in districts across the country is a necessary prerequisite to Democrats winning in 2026, let alone 2028.Voters have made their feelings clear, a majority do not see themselves in this party and do not believe in its leaders or many of its representatives. They need a new generation of leaders with fresh faces and bold ideas, unbought by corporate Super Pacs and billionaire donors, to give them a new path and vision to believe in. That requires working class, progressive primary challenges to the overwhelming number of corporate Democratic incumbents who have rightfully been dubbed as do-nothing electeds.How can Democrats win back working-class voters? Change their tune | Joan C WilliamsRead moreWe at Justice Democrats believe people-powered primaries will always be beneficial to the health of our democracy. And it’s clear millions of voters believe that too – the primaries they’re clamoring for are ones led for and by working class people, who put together campaigns with solutions as big as our crises and ambitious enough to inspire a disaffected electorate.People-powered primaries are not corporate-backed. They do not cost tens of millions of dollars to elect a candidate voters believe in – that’s an auction. Voters are also not simply seeking to replace their aging corporate shill representatives with younger corporate shills. More of the same from a younger generation is still more of the same. Voters believe a majority of their elected leaders in Congress are unwilling to fight for them with the urgency and energy that they need and they don’t believe it’s just because they cannot stay awake in committee.They know it’s because too much of this party is bought and sold by the same corporate interests and billionaires spreading millions of dollars to ensure their leaders don’t fight tooth and nail to deliver universal healthcare, affordable housing, higher taxes on the 1% and lower costs for everyone else.The party has too often failed to deliver real results because corporate-funded Democrats have backed down to corporate special interests. This lack of courage has made it clear to the American people that Democrats are weak, and lack the courage to fight.That is why voters want a new generation of leaders, not just to end the scourge of career politicians that has overrun the Democratic party, but to end their billionaire-dictated approach to politics and policy. It’s the moral courage – as evidenced most by the small handful of outspoken progressives in Congress – to stand up for your communities in the face of hundreds of millions of dollars in threats from corporate and rightwing Super Pacs that is the winning path forward for Democrats.But this cycle, as voters make it clear that they want unbossed and unbought leaders, too many Democratic groups, and even some that call themselves progressive, are encouraging candidates’ silence in the face of lobbies like Aipac and crypto’s multimillion-dollar threats. Silence in the face of genocide, silence in the face of Trump’s crypto corruption, and silence on anything that might upset the rich and powerful.Lobbies like Aipac and crypto’s strategy is to put fear in the hearts of every candidate and member of Congress. Too often, we hear from candidates and members who claim they are with us on the policy, but can’t speak out on it because Aipac or crypto will spend against them.Silence is cowardice and cowardice inspires no one. The path to more Democratic victories is not around, behind, and under these lobbies but it’s right through them, taking them head-on and ridding them from our politics once and for all.The solution to their fearmongering is not acquiescence, it’s solidarity. If we all hold the line together, they cannot divide and conquer. They cannot defeat us all. That courage and solidarity is what can unite a fractured nation of voters who distrust the entire institution of electoral politics and its ability to transform their lives for the better.Democrats can win in 2026 and subsequently in 2028 by showing voters that there is a different way to do electoral politics. The leaders of the future of the Democratic party will be defined by those willing to take on the biggest fights. Leaders who are authentically themselves, courageous and morally consistent. Leaders who have the courage to stand up for all people even in the face of massive opposition. People like Summer Lee, who won her primary and general elections in 2022 despite being one of Aipac’s first-ever Super Pac targets and has since introduced legislation to ban all Super Pacs from federal elections.In 2028, Democrats will no longer be running against Donald Trump, and so they will have to be running for something. Piecemeal, technocratic, corporate-staged solutions are not a vision for the future of this country. They are a Substack post that has been written 1,000 times by the same pundits, donors, advisers and politicians that brought us a Republican trifecta in Washington and an unchanged, uninspiring, and ill-equipped Democratic party to fight them.Democratic voters are looking to 2026 to see a new generation of working class leaders that understand their struggles and will not be too scared to fight to deliver massive, generational solutions to them. They do not want to simply vote blue no matter who, they want someone and something to vote for. And with a healthy Democratic primary process led by everyday people – and not corporate Super Pacs – willing to challenge their own party’s establishment, they will be able to organize and unite behind a Democratic party that can actually win by winning a better life for the people in this country.Alexandra Rojas is the executive director of Justice DemocratsExplore more on these topicsDemocratsHow can Democrats win?US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

They must perform utterly archaic feats of memory in their exams and then embark on an academic experience that has almost nothing to do with real life. Their reward may be a higher income, but perhaps not higher than their innate ability would have gained them anyway.England’s present university system is in a terrible mess, chronically in need of a royal commission. Between 1997 and 2010, university student numbersincreased by 68%. Then, under the coalition government, universities were offered £9,000 a yearfor each of an unlimited number of students. It was an open invitation to lower standards and increase overcrowding.Some cities found themselves with two if not three universities, with multiple campuses, student residences and overheads to match. The waste was ludicrous. Their vice-chancellors received crazy sums. The average for the Russell group isnow £400,000.The government supposedly recouped the cost of all this by treating fees and maintenance grants as borrowed. This allowed university extravagance to appear not as public spending but as debt, on the thesis that the students would repay it with interest one day. Until recentlyno more than a quarterof graduates were expected to fully repay their loans – small wonder, as they averaged£50,000 a head.The accumulated student debt is enormous. It has reached more than £250bn and is said to beheading for £500bnby the late 2040s. Quite why higher education should be so privileged as not to count as current spending has never been clear. As with HS2, the Treasury likes to treat certain sorts of posh spending as “investment” rather than hard cash.The reliance on fees from overseas students – now coveringnearly a quarterof university income – caused the present crisis. As thisincome has fallen,in part through recent immigration and visa changes, 40% of England’s universities are set to be infinancial deficit. Jobs and courses are being cut back.Meanwhile, every bit of news out of the university sector seems grim. Employers are disregarding not just classes of degree, but degrees at all. It is 10 years since the large accountancy firm EY started disregardingA-levels and degree classesin recruitment, while PwC said it would rely on aptitude and behaviour tests. I know of no job that ever depends on a class of degree. The Office for National Statistics records thatmore than a quarterof graduates in England are now in medium- or low-skilled jobs. Another survey shows the graduate“premium” is plummeting. This is not just a British issue. Across the US and the EU, graduate unemployment is almoston a parwith non-graduate.Students seem miserable. The two-thirds who leave home to go to college report soaring mental illness, with 90% suffering from loneliness. The Boston Consulting Group last year found ex-students thefastest groupof young people going straight into long-term sickness.Tuition fees are rising again and nobody is happy – it’s time to actually fix our broken university sector | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThe solution is glaring: cut back. The thesis that university courses requirea minimum of three years, each with barely six months of teaching, is absurd. For most courses, two years should be enough, as the former universities minister, Jo Johnson,has proposed. The number of institutions claiming fully-fledged university status should be slashed. The practice of almost every city hosting two universities – or 40 in London – should end in a mass of mergers. There should be a return to vocational colleges, with an emphasis on contact with local employment.This was proposed by James Dyson in setting up just such a college in Wiltshire, the Dyson Institute, in 2017. Another, the New Model Institute for Technology and Engineering in Herefordshire, was started by the Tory MP Jesse Norman. It is simply absurd that a large number of graduates should be doing work supposedly not requiring a degree, and yet the welfare state is chronically short of trained medical and care staff. This is a serious failure of education planning.Higher education should be free at the point of use; not, as now, free only to those whose parents can pay their fees upfront. But those completing a university course should repay the privilege with a modestly higher rate of tax throughout their working life. Loans should cover only maintenance.Of course university is not just a preparation for work, even if for 18-year-olds that is the primary issue at hand. A university is more than a start in life. It is also an experience of liberal education that goes far beyond the young who are its current beneficiaries.A true university should promote breadth of thought and freedom of speech to old as well as young. It should not turn in on itself as its resources shrink. It should make its courses and work accessible to people beyond its walls and across the community.Universitiesare costing us dear. We should not feel they are wasted on the young.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUniversitiesOpinionHigher educationStudent financeStudentsA-levelscommentShareReuse this content"

So I’ve turned to pet-sitting to fill the voidRebecca ShawTo ward off becoming a crazy catless lady, I look after other people’s pets while they’re awayThu 14 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 19.55 EDTShareWe talk about housing a lot in Australia. Whether you are a homeowner, an aspiring homeowner, a lowly lifelong renter like me or a person who the government is happy to let fall through the cracks, you will hear about it.There’s interest rates, negative gearing and the struggle between development and nimbys who not only want to buy the ladder and pull it up behind them, but also make sure no other ladders are made available in the surrounding areas.For my entire life, I have lived in rental properties. As a fully grown adult, I now live in Sydney, where the conditions of rentals, and the prices for those conditions, should be enough to put a boomer off their non-avocado breakfast. You try to live normally, but you know at any moment it could all be yanked out from under you. You could get a random call that your entire share house needs to move out because your landlord’s son failed as a DJ in London and needs to come home to sulk. Or you could get excited when the owner has decided to fix all the things you’ve been asking for for three years, only to discover they are doing it in order to sell.I was one of those pathetic males who barely noticed cats. Then I became smitten with my kittenRead moreHousing and access to it is a serious problem, but I want to talk about one of the tiny issues that often gets overlooked in the big discussion. I can’t have a cat.I am a cis white lesbian, here to say that some stereotypes are true. I love cats. I adore them. It is in my DNA to greet, love, pat and want to have any cat I meet in my home. Occasionally, people on the internet have tried insulting me by calling me a cat lady, and I can’t even correct them even though I don’t have a cat. They are right. It is who I am intrinsically. My natural setting is being the annoying person at a party already showing you cat photos before you can finish saying “Do you have a cat?”. I am also the person likely to ask this. I still show people photos of my old cat Tippi, who was with me during my most stable renting years and gave me the best cat years of my life.The past eight years or so have been pet empty, my situation never suitable for a cat, and the idea of adding a special layer of difficulty to the already very difficult process of finding a new rental does not appeal. Luckily, I have a technique to tide me over, so I don’t become a crazy catless lady.I have dubbed this concept IntermittentPets. Those are other people’s pets: dogs I see daily at the park who become my friends, the weird cat that haunts the back lane or, better yet, cats, fish, once a tortoise, that I can look after while friends are away, giving me some much-needed pet time. Even a short period of Intermittent Pets is enough to send my PET FULFILLOMETER to the top.In the past handful of years, my girlfriend and I have become a go-to for people who need a couple of queer women to pet-sit while they go on holiday. This is partially because we always live in share houses, and it’s nice to have our own space for a bit, but largely it’s because I want an Intermittent Pet. We have had a wealth of opportunities to cat-sit in particular, because we know a lot of lesbians who travel for work.I know there are dog people and cat people, a binary I don’t believe in because I also love dogs – but cats rule and I’ll say it every day. It makes me sad when I hear people say they don’t like cats. Usually it’s because they had one or two bad experiences with a cat when they were younger. Not to victim-blame, but it was probably your fault.Dogs represented a love I could never attain – so I gave up waiting, and adopted a wonderful cat | Elle HuntRead moreI love cat-sitting because I love how different each of their personalities are – their little quirks. You can’t just go in hard and rough with a pat and a treat and expect to win it over like a dog. Sure, it’s great to have that experience sometimes, but I just love that they have their own boundaries, their own way of doing things and their own way of having you do things for them. You have to attune to each cat, demonstrate that you are safe person in a way their particular sensibilities will respond to. People who don’t like cats talk about how they aren’t affectionate or loving, and that can’t be further from the truth. Some cats are immediately loving, getting into a strange lesbian’s lap at the first opportunity. But some need time and that’s OK. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing a cat move gradually from wariness to affection and end up purring in your lap.Someone asked us recently if my girlfriend and I compete over who the cat likes first or the most, but we don’t. We are a team (it’s usually me though), a couple of carers ready to do whatever it takes to look after the cat and win it over before its owners return. It’s not the same as having a permanent cat, but it fills, for a time, the gaping void.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsCatsOpinionPetsHousingcommentShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, what a lot of viewers have been asking is why it was inflicted on the public in the first place. Is War of the Worlds “one of the worst movies ever made?”,asked the BBC. “Shockingly bad War of the Worlds is one of the worst movies of the decade,”said the New York Post.“Amazon’s War of the Worlds update should never have been released,”declared the Telegraph.The 2005 adaptation, starring Tom Cruise, was a smash hit. Now people are flocking to the remake to see just how bad a film can be – it’s in the top 10 films watched in the UK and US on Amazon Prime. It seems that we have come to love “bad” films almost as much as those deemed good. The website Rotten Tomatoes practically celebrates films that garner a 0% approval rating: Roberto Benigni’sPinocchio, reborn in2002 asan Italian fantasy comedy-drama, is one such offender; Look Who’s Talking Now in 1993, starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, replaced talking babies with talking dogs and was slated; while Travolta hit rock bottom in2018 with Gotti, a movie about the New York mobster that was so gloriously awful it was nominated for six Razzies, the parody prize bestowed on Hollywood’s biggest cinematic failures, including worst actor and worst picture.But Hollywood has no exclusive hold on the movie clunker machine.Bollywoodhas vast audiences both within India and outside. In 2023, it generated revenues of $1.3bn, securing its own chunk of the global movie market – and its own flops. In both cases, the biggest pitfalls seem to come with attempting to remake much-loved classics.Bollywood tried its own movie version ofthe US favourite TV sitcom The Archie Show, and really shouldn’t have.The Archies, as the Indian version was called, featured wooden acting and misguided casting, not helped by controversy over the recruitment ofnepo babiesof already huge Bollywood actors such as Suhana Khan (daughter of Shah Rukh Khan) and Agastya Nanda. Some thought it engaging; most preferred not to think about it.View image in fullscreenThe cast of The Archies, the Bollywood remake of US TV sitcom The Archie Show.Photograph: Manpreet Singh/Netflix/Courtesy of NetflixJab Harry Met Sejal was a remake of the popular When Harry met Sally. Its director, Imtiaz Ali, is usually lauded for his captivating storytelling – but not this time. “A weak, meandering, near dishonest and awfully misrepresentative film,”was one critic’s verdict. In his review, he wrote a lot about the interval and his journey to the toilet.But whether it is made in Hollywood or Bollywood, a bad film, no matter how boring, unrealistic or slow-paced, can still have value. The Archies led to discourse on nepo babies in Bollywood film, and for all its narratorial difficulties Jab Harry Met Sejal allowed Arijit Singh to perform his magic with hit song Hawayein.Animal, released in 2023, caused an outpouring of condemnation as Ranbir Kapoor’s character consistently and crassly played on the belief that male dominance and female submission in a relationship is normal and necessary. It was bad, really bad – but the national conversation that ensued also educated audiences to became more aware and more critical of other films that also lauded misogyny. When I returned to the movie Ghilli, a Kollywood classic (Kollywood being the informal name for Tamil cinema) that I loved as a kid, I couldn’t help but question why the story continues romantically, without question, after the heroine is slapped by the supposed love of her life.Even notoriously bad movies have the capacity to sharpen our sense of critique. The outrage you feel at a film like Animal heightens your sensitivities, and perhaps your recognition of wrongdoing in real life.Jeans, controversy, used bathwater: Sydney Sweeney’s selling it all. A showbiz masterclass, if you ask me | Marina HydeRead moreWhen I watched28 Years Later(the sequel to28 Days Laterand28 Weeks Later), all I could think was: 28 years later and these zombies are still getting the better of the horror industry? I didn’t leave it wondering what would happen 28 eons later, but neither do I regret the time spent watching the film, even if it didn’t seem realistic. The sight of Teletubbies being watched by children spliced with images of humans beings savaged by other, more infected humans was more diverting than entertaining, but from my disappointment came conversation. Had I not watched it, I would not have had the story to tell; or the opportunity to discuss this and rather better horror films with friends.Bad films lead to dialogue, which almost inevitably opens a space for better ideas and new discourse.

It’s a fight to protect our homes, our cities and the psycheThu 14 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 15.16 EDTShareDay 1,254 of the invasion; 31 July 2025, Kyiv, 4.30am. The air-raid alarm started again just a moment ago. I wake up from the roar and rumble of rockets. It’s a sound that makes you want to flee in primeval terror.Time slows down. I roll over on the bed, embrace my girlfriend Dasha, make another half-turn and we drop down softly to the floor. I am not thinking or reflecting, I’m guided by instinct – move away from the windows, position our silhouettes as low as possible. I cover Dasha with my body. All she has time to ask for is: “The doggie? Where’s the dog?” From under the bed, we can hear the rustling of our old chihuahua’s paws.FiveIskander-K cruise missilesare falling from the sky. One after another. Like gigantic knives, striking between the ribs of the city. A deadly force that cannot be stopped. The sounds of explosions are coming from different parts of the city, enveloping us in total helplessness. There is no hiding from this.Two hours before the shelling, I laid out my clothes and placed my emergency bag in the hallway. Just in case. It was not a rational decision based, for example, on warnings from analytical groups. But you can feel the shelling coming. It will happen today or tomorrow. Thousands of little Russians, who “have no influence over anything”, and will repeat at the tribunals the convenient narrative that this is “Putin’s war”, have already manufactured newShahed dronesand missiles.According to Russia’s new tactics, every night it first sends hundreds of the drones to one or several Ukrainian cities, thus exhausting the air defences, destroying civilian infrastructure and terrorising civilians. And then Russian missiles fly right after them and finish off the city that is already bleeding out.On that day at the end of July, the all-clear siren after the Shahed attack sounded at 3.18am, after four and a half hours of explosions. After the all-clear, Kyiv residents who had been hiding in shelters and the metro stations returned home to sleep off the exhausting night. Having waited for an hour and anticipating maximum losses, the Russians launched a missile attack on the slumbering city.In the fourth year of the invasion, I don’t know how to write about the shelling of my home town. Photos of destroyed buildings on social media no longer have the power to shock. The subject matter and angles of the photos have become ordinary.But if our empathy has indeed worn to the nub, why does it still hurt so much? It hurts because it feels as though the number of Russian shellings devalues the grief and loss associated with each attack. Russia’s actions reinforce the idea that this is now the new normality inUkraine.I don’t know how to write about these attacks, but I know for sure that things have got worse.Statistics show that last year, during July 2024, Russia launched just over 400 drones over Ukraine. A year later, in July of this year, it launched more than6,400 drones and missiles.Looking at theinfographicthat visualises this comparison and trying to comprehend the absurd figure of an increase of almost 1,380%, I am lost for words.Now there are so many Russian drones that they are dismantling the smallest components of infrastructure. It feels like if this were a game of Battleship they would have already destroyed the two-deck ships. And, of course, they are deliberately destroying residential high-rise buildings with civilians inside.We know exactly when the situation got worse: after Donald Trump came to power. For the Trump 2.0 world, an unsubstantiated promise of peace is already equivalent to peace. But the war did not stop for a moment. It got worse. The Ukrainian data journalism websiteTexty.org.ua analysedRussian missile and Shahed strikes on 12 frontline and neighbouring regions after Trump’s inauguration. Two months before, the Odesa region was struck twice; two months after, there were more than two dozen strikes.TheUN reportsthat in June 2025, Ukraine recorded the highest number of civilian casualties for three years – 232 people were killed and another 1,343 wounded. Civilians were killed or wounded in Kyiv and at least 16 other regions. In the first half of 2025, the total number of civilians killed and injured was 6,754: 54% more than in the same period of the last year.And the same thing is happening on the ground, where the infantry is digging in. Where the frontline is. According to the DeepState monitoring group, which analyses changes on the frontline, Russia has takenalmost 1,300 sq kmof Ukrainian territory in the first five months of this year. In June alone, it secured a hold over556 sq kmof Ukrainian territory. How much is that? Imagine that in six months the Russians captured an area larger than Greater London. Or in June alone they took over the territory equivalent to five Parises.The Trump administration has broughtRussia back to the table, initiating talks with a terrorist country. But in Russia’s eyes, the west in general and Trump in particular constantly demonstrate weakness. The Kremlin understands only strength, and if its political opponents are unable to implement any of their threats, Russia will expand its political, economic and informational foothold. And its strategic communications – missiles and Shaheds – will speak for themselves.On that single day in July, Russia launched 309 Shahed drones and eight cruise missiles. Of these, 288 Shahed drones and three Iskander-K missiles were shot down.I don’t know how to describe this barrage of explosions: 21 Shahed strikes in 12 locations, debris from the downed missiles in 19 locations.The Helsinki accord was a masterpiece of European diplomacy. Fifty years on, we need its spirit more than ever | Kai Hebel and Richard DavyRead moreI don’t know how to describe the tachycardia that begins with the first explosion and has the heart drowning in this frantic rhythm for hours. There were 159 wounded, including 16 children.I don’t know how to find the words to describe what we seem to have seen hundreds of times, but every time it hurts like never before.Thirty-one killed: five children, the youngest just two.My friend posts a black-and-white photo of 42-year-old IT specialist Vitaly, who was killed alongside his 18-year-old daughter Vlada and dog Spike. Iryna, a mother, and her two daughters, ninth-grader Anastasia and sixth-grader Alina, were killed. Preschool teacher Natalia died along with her two sons, aged 17 and 22, and her brother. Six-year-old Matviy, who had been doing karate for a year and a half, was also killed.Our lives have long since turned into an endless news feed of these losses. Our memory is trying to record the names and facts, but our consciousness is a black lump of pain. This is just a part of what Russia is striving for, that “No one should be left alive in Ukraine.”The 31 July shelling was preceded by a week of torrential rain – loud thunderstorms and bright lightning, the likes of which I had never seen before, and with every flash in the skies I felt my body twist in preparation for the strike. And then I realised that this is the state of war in which our bodies and consciousness function. They are trying to adapt, to survive and to prepare for the next strike. To survive it all, but at what shattered cost?Oleksandr Mykhed is the author of The Language of War and a member of PEN Ukraine.

Motorists rightly complain of the damage caused to their vehicles. Cyclists risk serious injury every time they mount their bikes.Increased road use from a rising population is one reason for the problem. Cuts to repair budgets are another. Fixing the problem will be expensive, with one estimateputting the costof mending potholes in England and Wales at a hefty £17bn.Complaints about the state of the roads have made governments reluctant to arouse the ire of motoring lobby groups by raising fuel excise duty – the tax paid at the pump on fuel. The last chancellor to do so was Alistair Darling 15 years ago. The cumulativecost to the exchequerof the freezes and cuts to fuel duty since 2010 is put at £130bn – a colossal sum given the struggle governments have had to balance the books during that time.In reality, the days are numbered for fuel duty. Of the 34mvehicles on the UK’s roads,1.6m are fully electric, but that figure will rise steadily over time. Once petrol and diesel vehicles are phased out completely, the£24.4bn currently raisedfrom fuel duty will dwindle to zero. That represents a sizeable and permanent hit to the public finances.Rachel Reeves has more immediate things to worry about. The weakness of the economy means the chancellor is at grave risk of breaking her self-imposed rule that day-to-day government spending should be matched by tax receipts. Reeves fears that breaking the rule would incur the wrath of the financial markets, while cutting spending would incur the wrath of Labour MPs. So she is scrabbling around for tax increases that don’t break Labour’s manifesto commitment not to raise the rates of income tax, VAT or employee national insurance contributions.This is not going to be easy.One estimate last weeksaid Reeves will need to find more than £50bn to stick to her fiscal rule with a reasonable margin for error. Even though other forecasts suggest the figure may be lower than that, there will still be difficult choices to make.Faced with these pressures, Reeves should do two things. First, she should end the freeze on fuel duty, which has been kept in place no matter whether the cost of petrol and diesel is high or low. It is not just that Reeves could well do with the several billion pounds that a rise in fuel duty would harvest. Fuel duty is now a third lower, in real terms, than it was when Darling was at the Treasury, effectively cutting the cost of motoring and so creating incentives to drive more. Increased congestion and the potholed roads are consequences of that.The stated rationale for the protracted freeze since 2010 is that it helps hard-pressed motorists, but the main beneficiaries have not been white-van man but the better off, who drive more, own more vehicles and buy gas-guzzling SUVs. The richest fifth of householdshave benefited twice as muchfrom the fuel duty freeze as the poorest fifth. Raising fuel duty in the budget should be a no-brainer for Reeves.But the chancellor also needs to come up with a plan for what to do once the era of all-electric vehicles finally arrives, and here there is an obvious solution: road pricing. Conceptually, there should be little problem with this idea. People expect to pay more for a train journey in rush hours. Hotels charge more for rooms on a Friday or Saturday when demand is higher. The same principle should apply to roads.There are reasons why ministers are reluctant to grasp this nettle. Fuel duty, while a regressive tax, is easy to understand. There are no issues with privacy and surveillance, as there would be with road pricing. Governments are sensitive to charges that they are planning to wage war on motorists. Given that only 5% of vehicles are electric currently, the transition may take longer than originally envisaged. No question, doing nothing has its attractions.But the costs of inaction will grow over time. A report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI)said the lossof tax revenue from cars would be £10bn by 2030, £20bn by 2035 and £30bn by 2040. This would inevitably lead to chunky tax increases. Reducing the cost of motoring by continually freezing fuel duty would lead to more and longer traffic jams. Those still driving petrol and diesel vehicles would face a triple whammy: spending longer in traffic; paying higher taxes elsewhere to compensate for the lost fuel-duty revenue from those who transferred to electric vehicles; and paying three to four times more for tax and fuel than those who drive EVs.Why is Labour so afraid to admit that we must tax the rich? | Andy BeckettRead moreThe TBI report outlined the four ways road pricing might work. Drivers could face a flat-rate charge for each mile they drive; costs could vary according to geographic area or specific roads, with costs increased in areas where congestion was higher; road users could be charged for each minute they spend driving; and finally an “Uberised” model, where charges vary dynamically on the road used and the time of travel. Technically, it would be possible to make any of the approaches – or a combination of them – work.It speaks volumes that the report was published four years ago this month, since when inertia has reigned supreme. That needs to change because the do-nothing option is really no option at all.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFuel dutyOpinionTaxLabourTax and spendingPetrol pricesMotoringRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

The nationalism was the problemMartin KettleMany of her admirers gloss over her desire to break up the UK as Scotland’s first minister. But in her open and touching memoir, it plays a starring roleThu 14 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 10.26 EDTShareNicola Sturgeon was – and still is – important, talented, personable and, to many, inspirational. She was also extremely lucky and often wrong, sometimes seriously so. There are examples of all these qualities in hernewly published memoir, Frankly. Sturgeosceptics should concede at once that it contains much that is fascinating, especially about her relations with her charismatic mentor turned vengeful enemy Alex Salmond. Starry-eyed Sturgies should equally admit she made several deep and lasting errors that have left behind a divided nationalist party and movement.The book is more open and touching about private issues than most political memoirs, although Sturgeon deploys these qualities selectively. Many of the intimate reflections are about being a woman in politics. Other memoirs by female politicians – including those of Margaret Thatcher, Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel – leave such subjects alone.Sturgeon does not. She writes about her relationships, her miscarriage, her sexuality and her menopause. Yet to me, the single most affecting sentence in the book comes near the end, when she describesher resignationin 2023. “In short,” she writes, in words that should be pondered by male and female rulers alike, “I was exhausted.”After Sturgeon’s years of power, who would not have been? From the moment she joined the Scottish National party as a teenager, Sturgeon built a career at the most demanding and, for nationalists, the headiest time in modern Scottish history. She was a parliamentarian, a minister, deputy leader and then leader of her party, and finally Scotland’s first minister from 2014 to 2023. Roy Jenkins wrote long ago that eight years at the top is as much as anyone should be permitted in the full-on world that is modern politics, and Sturgeon’s career proves him right.You can quibble, as some people have, about whether being Scotland’s first minister is really as important and demanding as being a US president or a UK prime minister. Clearly it is not. However, after what the self-confessed workaholic Sturgeon had already crammed in, she was surely right to get out two years ago and prepare for the rest of her life. She is still only 55, and she is entitled to use this book as a pivot from the old to the new, whatever that may be.Just don’t idealise her, that’s all. The most important thing about Sturgeon’s political career is not whether she was relatable, good on television or better than the men. Pretty obviously, she was all three. It is whether she was right to be a nationalist. In my book, she was wrong. From her teenage years, Sturgeon’s overriding political goal has been to break up the United Kingdom. It still is.Many of her admirers, especially in England, ignore this fact. But it cannot be ignored, in part because everything else that she did in politics was always ultimately subordinate to it, and in part because, even now, her cause may yet win in the years ahead if British parties and governments allow it to happen.Sturgeon’s great political talent was her ability to ride the waves of change. Talent was part of that. But good luck also played a huge role. The first major example of this came in 2004, when she over-ambitiously threw her hat into the ring to become SNP leader in a contest most observers thought she would lose. Who knows where the story would have ended if she had fought on? Over a private dinner in Linlithgow, however, Salmond told Sturgeon that he was planning to enter the contest, and proposed a pact in which she wouldrun as deputyand eventually succeed him. Labour was already haemorrhaging votes as a result of the Iraq war. In 2007 the duo took the SNP to power at Holyrood.Sturgeon quickly became the most popular politician in Scotland. In 2011, the SNP won an unprecedented overall majority. Her second big stroke of luck, nevertheless, was the defeat of the 2014 independence referendum. Salmondresigned in the aftermath, leaving Sturgeon as his unchallengeable successor. SNP membership soared. What could have been a hospital pass was instead a coronation.A few months later, it got even better. At the 2015 general election, the SNP captured all but three of Scotland’s Westminster seats. Then came Brexit, opposed by the majority of voters in Scotland. This presented the nationalists with a perfect platform to claim that the union was denying Scotland its will. While the Tories became obsessed with Brexit, and Labour turned in on itself, Sturgeon was able to pitch Scotland as a nation that marched to a different and more progressive drum, and to follow the pro-European path.But the SNP did not have things all its own way. True, the party remained dominant. Electorally speaking, Sturgeon could have titled her book Undefeated. True also, Sturgeon managed to keep the prospect of a second referendum simmering without boiling over. But in other respects the Scottish political and economic landscape was getting far tougher for the SNP.There were rows about Lockerbie, on which Sturgeon’s book is informative, and about Hebridean ferry contracts and overruns andScotland’s drug problems– topics on which she has next to nothing to say. Sturgeon’s unequivocal pledge in 2016 to eliminate the educational attainment gap between children from rich and poor neighbourhoods in the next decade is skated over too. Her account of the court case against Salmond is nothing if not bitter. Her gender recognition reforms were dogmatic and divisive. Her legacy in many respects is division, and perhaps fiscal unsustainability. The reminder in Wednesday’s Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report that Scotland’s public spending deficit has widened even further than in the UK as a whole is a timely counterpoint to Sturgeon’s version of history.But the greatest gift that the gods ever presented to Sturgeon and the SNP came in 2019: Boris Johnson’s accession to the UK prime ministership. Sturgeon did not have to make an argument against Johnson. She could merely let people observe the contrast between his sloppiness and her precision, and let them judge for themselves. It would have been the same with Liz Truss, if she had lasted.Sturgeon used every lever to imply that Scotland was handling the pandemic better than the wider UK. To many in Scotland and in England, the contrast marked Sturgeon’s apotheosis. In England, some yearned to have Sturgeon in charge south of the border too, and had done so during the Cameron and May years as well.Yet this was to fundamentally misread Sturgeon. It was a misreading that she was smart enough to encourage. Hers is an interesting account. But it is not the full story. She was not seeking to be the negation of Johnson or Truss. Her aim was to be the negation of the union. It is on this that she should be judged, by nationalists and anti-nationalists alike. By that yardstick her career has – frankly – been a failure.

Making overseas skills and qualifications recognition faster, fairer and more affordable would enable more people to fully use their skills, unlocking immediate productivity gains. We can realise this productivity boost right now – no need to wait years for trickle-down effects from new infrastructure or large investments.Our campaign,Activate Australia’s Skills, has laid out four practical solutions to fix the skills recognition system.First, we need a national governance system for skills recognition, with an ombudsman to make it fair and transparent. There is currently no single body responsible for ensuring the system works as it is intended.Second, we must bridge the gap between our migration and employment recognition systems. It makes no sense that someone deemed skilled enough to migrate here to work in a specific profession is then blocked from working in that field due to disconnected recognition and licensing systems.Australia’s time has come to be a green energy intensive export superpower | Rod SimsRead moreThird, we need to reduce cost and information barriers. It can cost tens of thousands of dollars for migrants to have their overseas-acquired skills and qualifications recognised here. And that’s if you’re actually able to navigate the complex system of 77 assessing authorities across 650 occupations. We need more financial support and clear, centralised information for applicants.Finally, we must establish career gateways – local employment hubs with navigators – to help migrants get recognised. These hubs would be located in areas with high migrant populations. Unlike other services focused on unemployment, the hubs would address underemployment, supporting people working below their skill level to get into their professions again.What are the benefits?There are more than 620,000 permanent migrants in Australia unable to work to their full qualification level. Two-thirds of these workers came through Australia’s skilled migration program, meaning we specifically selected them for their valuable skills. Instead, we’ve gotengineers driving Uberswhile thosevery professions face critical shortages.Getting these workers back into their fields would benefit migrants themselves, along with the 90% of leaders who report that their businesses are experiencing skills shortages. It would also benefit everyday Australians by easing shortages such as the 10,000childcare workers neededor 200 GP clinics that close every year.There is also an economic incentive to the tune of $9bn additional GPD per year over the next 10 years if we better harnessed the skills of migrants already here.What are the downsides?The main concern people raise when they hear about reforming skills recognition is what it means for Australia’s high standards. These reforms are not about lower standards. We’re talking about addressing barriers that are unrelated to people’s skills: unfair assessments, excessive fees and unaccountable licensing bodies that create unnecessary obstacles.This will not reduce the quality of professional practice. In fact, making the system more efficient and transparent will help uphold standards.How practical is it?What sets these productivity reforms apart is that they’re ready to go. They don’t require years of negotiation or billions in spending. They require leadership, coordination and a commitment to fairness, but would deliver benefits quicker than just about any solution on the table.How politically risky is it?The government has called for bold ideas to boost productivity. This is one of them. It’s simple, fair and already backed by more than 100 organisations across business, unions and civil society. It’s time to activate Australia’s skills for the benefit of all.Other countries have already shown the way. Countries such asCanada,Germany,Sweden, andthe UKhave implemented similar reforms and are now reaping the productivity benefits from fairer and faster skills recognition.Violet Roumeliotis is the CEO of Settlement Services International, an organisation supporting people from diverse backgrounds to reach their potential in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOne Big IdeaAustralian educationInequalityAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Caron and Kirby met nearly a decade ago when he directed episodes of The Crown, in which she played the young Princess Margaret from behind a cloud of cigarette smoke.Now Kirby stars as a former sex worker called Lynette, toiling in multiple jobs and living with her disabled brother (Zach Gottsagen) and their wrecked, wayward mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They have cobbled together the funds to buy their dilapidated house at a snip, only for Lynette’s mother to recklessly blow her half on a new car. Cue one manic night in which Lynette must make back the dough, by fair means or foul, or else be turfed out on to the streets.Caron cites the Safdie brothers’Uncut GemsandGood Timeas an influence on his picture’s breakneck momentum. But, along with films such asLate Shift,On Fallingand the forthcomingUrchin, Night Always Comes surely belongs to a wave of neo-realism that reflects our ongoing cost of living crisis. “The idea that you can work three jobs and still not be able to afford your own home is a universal modern tragedy,” says the affable 49-year-old director. “Lynette’s story represents millions of people who are just one or two pay-cheques away from collapse. Of course, the film is in the thriller genre but I also wanted to get across the idea that nurses or caregivers or whoever are being priced out of the very cities that they help to keep running.”Night Always Comes  is available on Netflix.The situation first struck him during a visit to Los Angeles. “I remember being genuinely shocked by seeing the homeless crisis there. People are like: ‘Oh, they must be drug addicts.’ It’s very easy to throw labels like that around. But they can’tallbe addicts. People are not just falling into homelessness: they’re being pushed.”Wealthy characters in Night Always Comes, such as the client who recoils in disgust when Lynette tells him of her straitened circumstances, are naturally insulated from economic turbulence. This is a film where it’s poor versus poor all the way, and kindness is in short supply. “It’s a cliche,” says Caron, “but desperate people do desperate things. And the film is full of desperate people. Everyone has their reasons for doing what they do.”But I’m a romantic. I like to think the world sort of had a stroke during CovidKirby is in every scene, her vitality and desperation propelling the movie in much the same way as, say, Gena Rowlands in Gloria or Mikey Madison in Anora. As Lynette, she lies and schemes, steals a car, loots a safe, and isn’t above taking the nearest blunt instrument to anyone who crosses her. “Being back with Vanessa was like reuniting with a dance partner,” says Caron, with a smile. “It’s been a while but you still know the moves.”Actors bring baggage, however. The casting of Kirby – privately educated and so often labelled “posh”that she has even moaned about it in interviews– as a traumatised, penniless sex worker, appears to plunge the film into the territory of Frankie and Johnny, which starred Michelle Pfeiffer as a dowdy, unremarkable waitress. “You’re absolutely right,” Caron says, “but, as an actor, you want to avoid being pigeonholed. The more you can jump off the cliff, the wider range of offers you’ll get. Vanessa has this unpredictable energy. There’s no safety net with her, no filter. She makes these wild decisions in real time, in the middle of everything.”View image in fullscreenSelf-confessed lapsed Star Wars fan … Benjamin Caron on the set of Night Always ComesPhotograph: Allyson Riggs/NETFLIX © 2025Don’t forget, he says, that even The Crown looked risky to begin with. “There was a moment before it went out where we were all like: ‘Is anyone going to watch this?’” Similar jitters surrounded another streaming hit that became one of Caron’s springboards into cinema:Andor, the gritty Star Wars spin-off that revived interest in the franchise just as Disney was in the final stages of flogging a dead Wookiee.One outwardly unorthodox choice by Andor’s writer and show-runner Tony Gilroy was to put Caron, a self-confessed lapsed Star Wars fan, in charge of several episodes, including the first season’s finale. The lack of reverence that Caron brought to George Lucas’s universe might have been one of the keys to the show’s excellence. “You can get too drawn into trying to please the fans,” he says. “That’s a dangerous trap.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His 2023 debut,Sharper, a deliciously slippery thriller starring Julianne Moore, spent just a week in US cinemas before streaming globally on Apple TV+. As a Netflix production, Night Always Comes will likewise have only the merest brush with the big screen. This can’t be what he has been dreaming of all these years.Everybody’s talking about Jamie Lloyd: the explosive rise of superstar director masterminding EvitaRead more“Oh Ryan!” he cries, throwing his hands up. “That’s so sad! Don’t say that. Look, I remember in the 1980s and 90s, you’d hear about a film in America and it would take six months until it reached the UK. There was this feverish anticipation: fomo, really. And it’s true that doesn’t exist in the same way. But I’m a romantic. I like to think the world sort of had a stroke during Covid, and everyone retreated into their rooms and drew the curtains. Slowly, they’ve been coming back, blinking into the daylight. Look at Barbie and Oppenheimer. Those are moments when the audience feels that connection of sitting in a cinema and having a shared experience. For those two hours, you can be sucked into this portal and taken on a journey. Whereas, at home, you’re always going to be distracted.”Perhaps the message, then, is: death to Netflix? “No, I love Netflix,” he says. “They changed my career: I owe so much to those guys. WithThe Crown, I was working with the budget of a mid-sized movie, with actors who would normally be in films. And people have bigger screens now; it’s not like in the 1980s. No director would say they wouldn’t love viewers to sit in the cinema and watch what they’ve made. But you also want lots of people to see your work. And, hopefully, a few million might watch it.” In Caron’s case, it seems, Netflix always comes to the rescue.Night Always Comes is onNetflixfrom 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersVanessa KirbyNetflixThe CrownAndorinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Erika Goldring/Getty ImagesAs her landmark pop album Emotion turns 10, we run down the funky, feverish and feral of the Canadian star’s greatest hitsByLaura SnapesThu 14 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 17.24 EDTShare20. Anything to Be With You (2023)Carly Rae Jepsen loves to squirrel away killer songs for her now-standard B-side collections. The opener to The Loveliest Time (the companion to 2022’s The Loneliest Time) evinces several CRJ trademarks: a love of odd production in the drily funky guitar and playful percussion, breathy falsetto – and obsessive, intense lyrics about being willing to doanythingfor love.19. This Kiss (2012)You can plot Jepsen songs on a spectrum of “laser-eyed intensity” to “dreamy reverie”. This Kiss, from her first pop album Kiss (after her dreary post-Canadian Idol debut, 2008’s Tug of War), epitomises the former, with EDM-era synths that rattle and gleam like arcade machines and a sledgehammer vocal performance about wanting forbidden pleasures.18. Cry (2016)View image in fullscreenIn Austin, Texas in 2016.Photograph: Rick Kern/WireImageCRJ is a fiend for pure sensation who literally called an album Emotion: often her lyrics skip over any specific object of affection and cut straight to the feeling, as a song later in this list spells out. So when she sings “he never wants to strip down to his feelings” on this pained ballad from Emotion Side B, you know it’s terminal.17. No Drug Like Me (2019)Anyone who’s only ever heard the radioactively perky Call Me Maybe and (wrongly) considers CRJ a one-hit wonder might be stunned to learn that she’s elite at genuinely sultry come-ons. No Drug Like Me lives up to its narcotic premise – a risky cliche to sell – with its slinky, muted boogie and Jepsen’s gasped promises to “blossom for you”.16. All That (2015)Avant garde collaborators love Jepsen, but unlike, say, Caroline Polachek or Charli xcx, she’s never made leftfield cool her brand. Those moments feel more like surprise gems in her enjoyably wayward catalogue: All That, made with Ariel Rechtshaid and Dev Hynes, is a sparkling devotional that forms a perfect period trifecta with Sky Ferreira’sEverything Is Embarrassingand Solange’sLosing You.15. Joshua Tree (2022)The verse to Joshua Tree is all sharp, hungry anticipation of – what else – some kind of sensory high. Jepsen makes it worth the wait when the tension breaks into a chorus of rapturous satisfaction, à la Jessie Ware’s sultrier disco moments: “I need it / I feel it,” Jeppo sings, her unusually fragmentary lyrics evoking the strobe-lit half-memories of an ecstatic night out.14. Boy Problems (2015)The cutely funky Boy Problems solidified CRJ’s gay icon status – you’ll seldom see a crowd yell louder than when she sings, “Boy problems, who’s got ’em?” – and gave the concept a self-aware spin, acknowledging how bored her friends are of hearing about her messy love life. The sing-songy chorus sends up her predicament and is totally addictive.13. Tiny Little Bows (2012)Intended for Jepsen’s scrapped second album Curiosity, Tiny Little Bows got a glow-up from its coffee shop-pop demo to the machine-tooled whirling strings and snapping bass of its incarnation on Kiss. The lyric about chasing Cupid and his dinky arrow makes little sense (how doyouthink it goes with those tiny little bows? Err, fiddly?) yet hits like the best of Scandi-pop nonsense.12. Everything He Needs (2019)View image in fullscreenCRJ performing in LA in 2019.Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty ImagesCRJ had failed to clear this song’s sample of He Needs Me, from Disney’s 1980 Popeye film. So, naturally, she went to Disneyland and got Mickey Mouse to sign a fake contract approving it, then sent it to the publishers: “The big star boss says it’s OK.” They relented, and thank god, otherwise this slice of flirty madness, with its chorus that ascends like a starlet climbing a light-up staircase on a TV special, would never have existed.11. Gimmie Love (2015)“‘Cause I want what I want / Do you think that I want too much?” could be the Jeppo MO. On Gimmie Love, she lunges for, then suddenly withdraws from her crush, scared by the enormity of the feeling. It echoes within the cavernous, bass-wobbling production, offset by her effervescent vocals – and a determined cheerleader chant pivot in the middle eight.10. Julien (2019)No stranger to gothic intensity, Jepsen sings that she’s “forever haunted by our time” on this sleek, sumptuous recollection of a formative romance. It was originally written for a scrapped disco album, its cool bass and enveloping sparkle hinting at a student of the French touch sound.View image in fullscreenCarly Rae Jepsen circa 2012.Photograph: PR Company Handout9. The Sound (2019)The Sound offers a rarity in the Jeppo catalogue: unequivocal exasperation, anger flashing as she rebukes an unpredictable lover. “Love is more than telling me you want it,” she sings over an abrupt beat, craving – once again – the feeling. The tender piano in the verses drives home what she’s missing.8. Want You in My Room (2019)Not to accuse co-producerJack Antonoffof recycling, but this song’s bass/percussion intro very much recalls his work on Lorde’s Hard Feelings/Loveless. Anyway, it sets up a fantastically feral CRJ moment: “I wanna do bad things to you!” she rhapsodises, with teeth-baring pep to rival early Madonna and robotic zip out of the Daft Punk playbook.7. Western Wind (2022)Jepsen’s lead singles have sometimes failed to recreate former glories: see Call Me Maybe redux I Really Like You, a red herring for the depth of Emotion. But for the first taste of The Loneliest Time, she ditched her bangers-first approach for this gorgeous, dusky Rostam collab, a pandemic rumination on memory.View image in fullscreenCharli xcx (left) and and Carly Rae Jepsen in LA, 2018.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty Images6. Charli xcx – Backseat (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017)Charli has form for drawing out unexpected sides of well-known artists, and the first taste of mixtape Pop 2 showed off an unusually, captivatingly desolate CRJ. The pair spun a tale of powerless self-sabotage in relationships, their Auto-Tuned voices fluttering “all alone, all alone, all alone” over AG Cook and Easyfun’s tweaky ghost-in-the-machine ballad.Carly Rae Jepsen: ‘Lockdown was me, my cat, and a lot of questions about my life decisions’Read more5. Shy Boy (2023)Jepsen may be as good a successor to Kylie as we’ve ever had: a beloved, benign pop presence with an endless thirst for cheeky disco. Shy Boy is Minogue-worthy: a commanding, tart invitation to the dancefloor, although CRJ fabulously overplays her hand in a wordy bridge that reveals just how frazzled desire has left her.4. Cut to the Feeling (2017)One billion times better than a song written for an animated kids’ film about a ballerina should be, Cut to the Feeling is raw Jepsen ID: she’s sticking her hand straight in the socket of desire, and conducting it through the rowdy, euphoric chorus, written at peak leaping-around tempo. It’s basically Run Away with Me 2.0, but this is a song about overcoming reason, so just give in to it.3. Call Me Maybe (2012)The first time I heard Call Me Maybe I thought it “wasn’t that catchy”. Like biting into a chilli and declaring it “not very spicy”, only to be left weeping and demanding pints of milk, its delirious strings, pogoing beat and Carly’s nuclear-force yet endearingly innocent crush got the better of me. And rightly so.2. Run Away With Me (2015)Emotion arrived a year after Taylor Swift’s 1989, the latter laden with lyrical Easter eggs that clearly identified her songs’ subjects. Emotion hit certain listeners hard because it felt so free from subtext, hungering instead for BIG FEELINGS shot straight to the heart. The brazen sax and “oh-oh-whoa / OH-OH WHOA!” of RAWM are a direct hit.1. Warm Blood (2015)The moment a crush becomes reality is rare and beautiful. Often, it simply never happens. If it does turn into a relationship, that moment of tingling anticipation can still only happen once. Here, Jepsen and Rostam precisely capture the feverishness of finally being so close to someone’s face, you can feel their breath. Their subtle rapture softens the arpeggiated judder of Robyn’s Call Your Girlfriend into a beat that rushes like adrenaline, the song’s body heat contrasting the parched desperation in Jepsen’s voice. It skips the cathartic peak of many of her hits to circle this precious feeling, willing it to last as long as possible.Explore more on these topicsRankedCarly Rae JepsenPop and rockCharli xcxDev HynesJack AntonofffeaturesShareReuse this content"

US clown Madeleine Rowe’s contribution to the field is an hour of whimsical horseplay with psychosexual trappings. Here, it’s the beast that mounts the knight – and rather vigorously, too.Our host is clad in tunic and spangly chainmail jumpsuit. The hobby horse named Hermes is one of a number of toyshop props including a plastic Excalibur and crown used in daffy episodes of audience participation. Rowe’s script has a “methinks” here and a “prithee” there, the knight’s prophecy and quest unfolding to sweeping Celtic orchestrations across We’re Going on a Bear Hunt-style terrain. You’d be right to assume that sword innuendo is embraced when possible but Rowe also has fun with gender norms and social structures seen through an Arthurian lens.John Tothill: This Must Be Heaven review – joyful look at earthly pleasures brings us closer to standup paradiseRead moreThis knight is consumed by confusion (“Kings can’t do what we’ve done!” he tells Hermes) as he seeks a meekly obedient wife among us and plucks up wedding eve courage to overcome his bilious reaction to consummate the marriage by doing it, gulp, “how humans do it”.Physical comedy enhances these interactions – the removal of just belt and tunic becomes a drawn out striptease – and Rowe’s vocal work is particularly deft. There’s the gruffness of Adam Riches channelling Sean Bean as a swaggering adventurer (a character Riches isreprising this fringe to read Le Morte d’Arthur). To the mix, Rowe adds mock solemnity as well as a lovely lilt. Single vowels are elongated out of shape, going from gravelly to awestruck to sweetly sentimental.Rowe’s twinkle-eyed charisma can’t quite conceal the fact that each episode is stretched for too long, the pace occasionally needs to giddy up and it’s a one-note joke, albeit an inspired one. But if this is not the holy grail of fringe comedy, Rowe still gives us a knight to remember.AtUnderbelly, George Square, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Writer-director Zach Cregger is no stranger to this line of thinking; his 2022 horror movieBarbarianis very much a spooky-creature-in-the-basement movie for the #MeToo era. Now Cregger has returned with a movie that may well stymie anyone who has been trained by the last decade to search for an easy-to-track allegory within their viscerally depicted fears. His new movieWeaponshas received mostly rave reviews and positive audience response. But at least a few critics and fans are pivoting from complaining about obvious metaphors to ask … is that all there is? Is Weapons actually about anything? (To further delve into this question, of course, we’ll need to go full spoiler mode, so if you want to see the movie and haven’t yet, turn back now.)Weapons review – Zach Cregger’s slick Barbarian follow-up is a bumpy rideRead moreThe movie certainly alludes to plenty of hot-button issues. It springs from a chilling premise: one night in a small town, 17 children from the same third-grade class wake up at 2.17am, leave their houses, and disappear into the night. Parents are understandably distraught, and in looking for someone to blame seem to land on the students’ teacher Justine (Julia Garner), who is as puzzled and disturbed about this as anyone else. When Archer (Josh Brolin) angrily demands to know what was “going on” in his missing son’s classroom, convinced that Justine must have played some role in this tragedy, there are unmistakable echoes of social panics in an era where parents feel empowered to dictate what their children learn about at school. The fact that the movie’s school shutters, then must reopen before the disappearance is solved or its pain is at all healed recalls Covid-era school closures. And when Archer has a dream where he sees a giant AR-15 materialize in the sky above the town, it seems like an obvious reference to school shootings that have devastated so many classrooms over the past quarter-century.Or is it? Cregger actually says no. I co-host a horror podcast, and in ourinterviewwith the film-maker, he unequivocally said he was not thinking of school shootings when he wrote the movie. For him, that’s not at all what it’s about. (Though he did stress that he welcomes people’s interpretations, and in fact wanted to make something with that kind of flexibility.) He wouldn’t say precisely how he personally interprets the story, but he has mentioned repeatedly that it was something he started writing out of – hey! – grief, even if the movie itself may be more ambiguous as to its thematic aims.This leaves Weapons open to the charge that it’s not about much of anything – that it’s all great hook and solid technique in service of a thrill ride where some stray inspiration from Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia is more superficial homage than thematic link. The real question, though, is how bad of an offense this is supposed to be. Plenty of great horror movies are principally concerned with the visceral experience of watching them in the dark, rather than the talking points or takeaways they might hand over to the viewer in broad daylight. Subtext shouldn’t have to be plainly visible at first glance.Indeed, some of the skepticism over Weapons seems to stem from the fact that it turns out to be … a horror movie. The children in the movie are enchanted by a witch. The movie doesn’t say whether she’s always been a witch, or has turned to witchcraft in the face of a debilitating illness. But that’s why she takes control of these children, and various other adults at her convenience: to sap their life force, attempt to heal herself, and, in the meantime, use her control to make her victims do her bidding. So yeah, pretty witchy stuff, and her comeuppance has the gory satisfaction of a Brothers Grimm story fed through a powerful amplifier.View image in fullscreenThe cast of Weapons.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesThat wild, almost fanciful ending may strike some as reductive, especially when its first half plays more like a dark mystery like David Fincher’s Zodiac, or at least Seven. But is the spectacle of brainwashed children being turned against their older captor and ravenously destroying her so devoid of opportunities for interpretation? It’s not even that Weapons is demanding a lot of work from the audience – and that might be exactly what rankles some about it. Most of what happens in the movie is unambiguously explained; it’s the meaning that’s left up to the audience, and maybe some sense an incongruity between those two approaches. That’s a fair-enough critique, as is a thoughtful consideration that concludes none of the movie’s interpretations hold up to much scrutiny. But it’s hard to fault Cregger for making a horror movie that is more concerned with its own scary, twisty immediacy than its optics as a social critique.At the same time, maybe the discourse over the meaning of Weapons suggests that the eye-rolling about “metaphorror” has been overblown, too. Countless horror classics could very much be described as driven by metaphor. Some are murkier or more interpretative than others, but having a central idea and conveying it clearly isn’t a marker of hackdom. It’s just something that some hacky movies have done, often directly imitating very good ones. Think of Get Out, which may have been thornier than it was given credit for, but still has a trackable central conceit that’s not exactly obtuse; then think of heavy-handed Get Out knockoffs like Antebellum and Blink Twice with too much visible effort and too little inspiration.Jordan Peele himself followed a path not unlike Cregger’s when following up Get Out; his movies Us and Nope are immediately engaging visceral experiences with more allusions and evocations than clear signaling of a central metaphor. They may be more successful in that realm than Weapons, but then, that’s true of most movies when compared with Peele’s output. It’s the prescriptiveness – give us a meaning, or kill all metaphors – that goes against the nature of horror in general. The combination of the concrete and slippery is what makes horror such a compelling field; there may not be a genre better suited to blurring the lines between reality and a heightened dream state. There’s no single correct way to have a nightmare.Explore more on these topicsHorror filmsThrillerscommentShareReuse this content"

It ran for 18 seasons in the US, attracting more than 10 million viewers in its prime and spawning more than 30 international versions, including a UK iteration presented in 2012 by Davina McCall.The show was undeniably the making of Harper, who went from being a farmer’s son who dropped out of university because he couldn’t afford it, to an American household name who appeared on The Traitors US and RuPaul’s Drag Race. He is “really proud” of the years he worked on “Loser”, as he refers to it, and has little time for its critics.“That Joelle, she just does not like me, does she?” he says with a grin when he speaks to me via Zoom, having just finished watching Fit for TV: The Reality of the Biggest Loser, the new documentary in which he also appears. He is calling from his chic, monochrome New York apartment, where his “little dog”, Ralph (after Ralph Lauren), is darting around behind him. Days away from his 60th birthday, the reality TV star says he has “learned to not take things personally”.For the uninitiated, each season of The Biggest Loser was filmed over a 30-week period, and brought together a group of people who wanted to lose weight (and who, like all good reality TV contestants, often had deeply harrowing back stories). Contact with their friends and families was cut off, and they were sent to live on a ranch, put into teams and assigned a trainer (such as Harper), who guided them through an intense workout schedule. Outside the gym, the teams faced “challenges” and “temptations” for which they could win prizes or immunity from elimination. Each week, the contestants were weighed, and those who had lost the lowest proportion of their previous body weight risked being sent home. At the end of the season, $250,000 was awarded to the remaining contestant who had lost the most weight.View image in fullscreenHarper in Fit for TV.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe rigid format meant that being as thin as possible – not necessarily as healthy as possible, though contestants were monitored by health professionals – became the primary goal of the show, and huge emphasis was placed on the way contestants looked, with dolled-up finalists walking on stage alongside sad, washed-out holograms of their pre-show selves.“We’re all obsessed with our looks,” Harper says in Fit for TV. “Because aren’t we?” he says when I ask him about it. “I know that probably sounds really shallow, but I have worked in the fitness business for a long, long time. And yes, I want to be as healthy as I possibly can”, as do “all the people that I’ve ever worked with”, but looks are “a huge part of it … I want to look good when I go to the beach.”Harper’s own looks were also important when it came to The Biggest Loser. The roles played by him and Jillian Michaels, the show’s other original trainer, partly involved being eye candy for viewers: thin, ripped examples of what the show deemed to be desirable. Harper has a number of tattoos, which were “a real issue” with the producers, “because they didn’t know what the American audience would or would not respond to”. He was made to wear long sleeves to cover them up – until, Harper says, on one non-shooting day: “I didn’t have a shirt on when I was training and they saw me and they were like, ‘Oh, he looks great. He can show whatever he wants.’”View image in fullscreenJillian Michaels and Bob Harper.Photograph: Richard Hartog/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesProducers also worried about him talking about being gay on the show. Harper came out at 15, but didn’t discuss it publicly until a conversation he had with a gay contestant was shown on The Biggest Loser in 2013. “Everyone was kind of nervous about that,” he says, but his view was: “Why would I not talk about it? I’m not ashamed of who I am. I never have been.”Born in rural Tennessee, Harper says he was “definitely different” from his parents and two older sisters, and as a young adult he moved an hour south to Nashville to look for work. The owner of his local gym took him under her wing, and he began teaching fitness classes, which took him to Los Angeles, where his clients included Julia Roberts and Ellen DeGeneres. Thanks to the film stars and Hollywood agents who attended his classes, his name was put forward when producers began discussing The Biggest Loser, and he went on to become the only trainer to appear in all 17 seasons, between 2004 and 2016, as well as the one-season 2020 reboot, in which he was the show’s presenter.The Biggest Loser “was the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” Harper says. Even on “dark days” when there was no filming, the trainer was busy leading “more sensible, low-pressure workouts” – those days were “when we got all the real work done”, he says. He tired himself out to the point that after one season, he got shingles, and remembers being so hungry on set that he would sometimes eat the snacks that had been provided for the contestants in temptation challenges.“Temptations” were one aspect of the show with which Harper did not agree. They involved bringing the contestants into rooms full of high-calorie food, which they had to decide whether to eat (which could win them advantages in the competition or the chance for a treat, such as visiting family) or refuse, to prevent weight gain. He tried to push back on these challenges to the producers “all the time”, he says, but he and the other trainers “didn’t have a say in it”.View image in fullscreenThe Biggest Loser ran for 18 seasons in the US.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixSuch challenges, as well as filming techniques such as shaking the camera when a contestant fell over to make it look as if their weight had caused the ground to move, were “designed to make you draw conclusions about fat people”, says the author and activist Aubrey Gordon in Fit for TV. When I ask Harper if he thinks the show made fun of fat people, he says he can only speak for himself, but “that’s something I would never do and have never done”.I mentiona study that showed an increase in anti-fat attitudesafter participants had been shown episodes of The Biggest Loser. Harper hasn’t heard of it, but thinks it’s “stupid”. “The trolls that are out there just want to attack in any way, because people are going to have such a strong opinion when it comes to weight loss,” he says. He is keen to share examples of people who have told him they were inspired by The Biggest Loser: “I really do believe that we did help a lot of people.”But even if you buy into the show’s “inspirational” message, the fact remains that most of Loser’s contestantsregained weightafter the competition had ended. When it comes to any kind of diet or fitness regimen, “the success rate overall is very low,” Harper says. “It’s really sad, but it’s such a reality.”He is much happier to talk about the show’s “success stories”, like Olivia Ward, who entered season 11 of The Biggest Loser with her sister, Hannah Curlee. She won, with Curlee coming second, and later named her child Harper in honour of the trainer. “I was really touched by that,” Harper says, adding that he and Ward have remained friends: “She’s flying in for my birthday party next Saturday.” Ward “looks better than ever”, he is quick to tell me. “And her sister Hannah, she looks great too.”By “great”, he presumably means “slim” – and though Harper says he is “a firm believer that healthy bodies come in many shapes and many sizes”, when I ask whether he agrees with Loser’s simplistic categorisation of thin being good and fat being bad, he says: “Well, fat is bad. Let’s not kid anybody.”View image in fullscreenThe show’s trainers: Jennifer Widerstrom, Harper and Dolvett Quince.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesHarper knows as well as anybody that those who look fit may still suffer from unexpected health problems. In 2017, at 51, he had what is known as a“widowmaker” heart attackbecause of an undiagnosed genetic issue, which left him clinically dead on the floor of his gym for nine minutes. Luckily, there was a doctor present who performed CPR, and Harper made it to hospital in time. If it had happened while he was alone in his apartment, he says: “I wouldn’t be here.”Having the heart attack “fucked me up”, Harper says. He struggled mentally with going from being the man working out in his 50s who could keep up with 20 and 30-year-olds, to “a person that couldn’t walk around a city block”.Plenty of people from The Biggest Loser got in touch when they heard what had happened – but not Michaels. “We weren’t besties, but we were partners on a television show for a very long time,” he says, so it “spoke volumes to me” that she didn’t get in touch. But, he adds: “I would not expect Jillian Michaels to do anything other than what she wants to do.”Michaels was always the more headstrong of the show’s original trainers, and she caused controversy in 2013 by giving rule-breaking caffeine pills to her team of contestants. Did Harper ever give his contestants any kind of supplement? “Absolutely not,” he says.In any case, the 2013 season marked the beginning of the end for Loser: on top of the furore over the caffeine pills, the show was further criticised when winner Rachel Frederickson appeared in the finale having lost a record-breaking 59.62% of her original body weight, with many viewers believing her weight loss had gone too far.He and Michaels “were horrified” when Frederickson appeared on stage for her final weigh-in, Harper says. He thinks her background in competitive swimming led to her extreme approach. “You talk to any person who’s an athlete. That’s a different breed of person,” he says. “And evidently this woman was like, I’m going to win this show and I’m going to do whatever it takes.”Yet his “horror” at Frederickson’s extreme weight loss doesn’t seem to have led to much reflection on his involvement in the show that encouraged her behaviour. Granted, he wasn’t Frederickson’s assigned trainer. Nor was he season three contestant Kai Hibbard’s, he points out when I ask him how he feels aboutreports that Hibbardlater developed an eating disorder.There has also been criticism from contestants he did train, including Suzanne Mendonca, who appeared on the second season and in 2016threatened to file a class action lawsuitagainst the show, complaining thatshe later regained 150lbs (68kg) , and that during taping she was “dehydrated, vomiting and limited to eating 800 calories a day.”Though Harper tries “not to have too many regrets in my life,” he does concede that two moments that are brought up in the documentary – shouting at Gwynn and telling Mendonca that it was “good” when she threw up because it would help her lose weight – were things he “shouldn’t have” done. But, he adds: “You also have to remember, everyone that came on Loser, we were all adults.”Well, except for the “kid ambassadors”,junior participants whose weight loss was documented in segments of some of the later seasons. “Oh, I don’t really remember that,” Harper says.Does he think the show would get made now? He doesn’t see why not, although he admits: “It would have to be completely different.” But “we as a society are just as obsessed with weight loss as we have ever been,” he says, pointing to the rise of weight-loss drugs. Harper doesn’t necessarily promote those types of drugs, but says he is “for anything that you need to get you on the path that you want to be on”.When it comes to his own path, he says he is in his “retirement era”, but is still enjoying teaching hot yoga classes in New York. He is single, having broken off his 2019 engagement to his long-term boyfriend Anton Gutierrez, “so if you know anyone …” he jokes. He is content with the life he has built for himself, and seems unlikely to be affected by conversations about the ethics of Loser that Fit for TV will undoubtedly bring back into focus.“I knew what the show represented to me,” he says. “I have nothing but a good experience and really good memories.”Fit for TV is on Netflix, from FridayExplore more on these topicsTelevisionReality TVNetflixHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The script will be by Stacey Gregg, who has credits on TV series Mary and George, Little Birds and The Letter for the King.Production companies behind the project include See-Saw Films, whose past output includes The King’s Speech, Shame, The Power of the Dog and Slow Horses, alongside Nine Daughters (God’s Creatures, Lady Macbeth) and ie:entertainment, which acted as executive producer on Nothing Compares.O’Connor died in 2023, aged 56, after a string of hit records including the huge-selling Nothing Compares 2 U in 1990, and a tumultuous life marked with outspoken protest and controversy. In 1992 she ripped up a picture of the pope on US TV; in 1999 she wasordained as a priestby an independent Catholic group, and in 2018 she converted to Islam.According to Variety, the film will follow O’Connor’s early years in the music industry, “tell[ing] the story of how one young woman from Dublin took on the world, examining how her global fame may have been built on her talent, but her name became synonymous with her efforts to draw attention to the crimes committed by the Catholic church and the Irish state”.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsSinéad O'ConnorFilm industryIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

With its streamlined dramatic structure and built-in ballets, Gluck’s great reformation opera proves fertile ground for the company’s agile blend of acrobatics and contemporary dance.The action opens with the dying Eurydice tumbling through space. So extreme is Orpheus’s grief, it seems, that he has wound up in an asylum, strapped to one of a series of hospital beds that, along with a tiny glass house, make up Lifschitz’s minimalist set. The acrobats swirl over and under him – every man an Orpheus, every woman a Eurydice – recalling the emotional volatility of their relationship and Orpheus’s feverish hopes and fears for their future.Throughout this stark yet reasoned production we are never entirely sure what is real and what exists merely in the protagonist’s head. Are the sombre chorus members disembodied hospital orderlies or fellow inmates? The final scene suggests the latter, but the director keeps us guessing.View image in fullscreenStriking images … Orpheus and Eurydice.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianLifschitz is a master of the striking image: a human tower that collapses to audible gasps; a staircase of bodies that one of the Orpheus figures must ascend. Only the occasional wobble reminds us of the extreme athletic demands. Suspended loops enable acrobats to float and fly while hinting at hangmen’s nooses or restraints. White institutional walls are deftly lit by Alex Berlage in vivid crimsons, greens and minty blues. Libby McDonnell’s black, white and red costumes are simplicity itself; Boris Bagattini’s sparing video projections include occasional closeups on a troubled face and surtitles that cleverly dissolve in trails of mist.Beginner’s Gluck: how the 18th-century composer and a castrato changed opera foreverRead moreGluck’s three-hander opera is condensed here by combining the roles of Eurydice and Amor, as if Orpheus has lost the power to differentiate between the two.Iestyn Daviesis outstanding as the bereaved husband, his tireless countertenor rich and even, with memorably light and lyrical top notes. Physically he holds little back, at one point balancing on the shoulders of a cluster of acrobats. The climax, an affecting account of Che Farò Senza Eurydice, finds him abandoned on a bare stage, arms wrapped around his body as if in a straitjacket.Samantha Clarke’s soprano rings out bright and frisky as Amor before turning lush and sorrowful as Eurydice. Laurence Cummings leads the Scottish Chamber Orchestra through a bracing, finely judged account of the score, the ScottishOperaChorus matches his intensity, singing with power and discipline. Their unnerving final appearance as the bloodied Orpheus is strung up by the heels in his own private Bedlam is one of the production’s most haunting images.At Edinburgh Playhouse until 16 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicEdinburgh festival 2025reviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet she has rarely been treated with reverence.

It took five babies to make it work. One of them was even called Lily, but she was not having a bar of it. She looked at me as if to say: ‘You think I’m getting in that water?’”She describes the practicalities of one of her best-known shots, 1991’sCabbage Kids. It shows twin brothers Rhys and Grant with cabbage-leaf hats on their heads, each sitting in an upturned cabbage, turning to one another with mild alarm. Geddes’ assistant had tied a balloon to a piece of string, lowering it between them and whipping it up the moment they turned. Geddes got the shot.View image in fullscreenCabbage Kids, AKA Rhys and Grant.Photograph: Anne Geddes“That whole world has changed; that income has gone,” says the 68-year-old Australian from her home in Manhattan, New York. Technology has changed everything. She calls Cabbage Kids “authentic”: “The props were all real. It was all in my garage. It’s funny; with Photoshop and AI, it makes me sad to think that if you came to my work now, you might question whether it was real.“I think original stories will always prevail. That’s why having people and humans behind the photographs is important. AI can’t replicate that.”If you grew up in the 1990s, there is every chance that, like me, you tacked a Geddes poster to your wall. Babies upright in a flowerpot or a bucket, or gazing sleepily from a peony, a calla lily or a bed of roses. Some were dressed as bumblebees, others with little fairy wings, snoozing on a bed of crisp autumn leaves. The images are whimsical, otherworldly and sometimes plain weird. But they have that rare quality of appealing to children without being childish and have begun popping up again, often ironically, on social media.View image in fullscreenMiracle: A Celebration of New Life by Céline Dion and Anne Geddes.Photograph: Scott Gries/Getty ImagesThey were disseminated initially not just on Hallmark greetings cards, but also on the cover of Vogue Homme, in a Dior advert and even in a 2004 book with Céline Dion (the best image shows the singer holding aloft a baby asleep inside an amniotic sac).The height of that period, for Geddes, was appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show: “She came out carrying two babies dressed as bumblebees and we shot up the New York Times bestseller list!” But for many millennials, the peak of her fame was the episode of Friends in which Elle Macpherson’s character, Janine, moved in with Joey and attempted to “girlify” his apartment using Geddes’ photographTayla as a Waterlily.Geddes is striking, with silver hair, high cheekbones and bright skin, like Meryl Streep if Streep wore her cap backwards. She sits in front of a generic backdrop, warm, if a little reserved, speaking slowly and carefully about bumblebee suits and lily pads.It’s almost 30 years since she created Down in the Garden, a series of photographs of babies in and around flora and fauna, some of which will appear in her first ever retrospective, at the New Art Museum in Tübingen, Germany, this month.Among the 150 images are identical triplets sleeping in the hands of Jack, a school groundsman, whose hands also appeared in her 1993 photograph of Maneesha, a baby born prematurely at 28 weeks. For years, people have written to tell Geddes they keep this hopeful image on their fridge.View image in fullscreenTuli and Nyla.Photograph: Anne GeddesAnother photograph is ofTuli and Nyla. Geddes had two days in the studio, lots of babies and a giant Polaroid camera. “I had no props, but you need a vague plan when you work with babies, as you have to work quickly,” she says. When Nyla began fussing, Tuli rocked her and whispered into her hair. She grabbed the moment.Geddes refers to these prop-less, slightly quieter pictures as her “classic work” and the babies in flowerbeds as “what they know” – “they” being people like me, who grew up with them. “After Down in the Garden came out, it was all pots, pots, pots,” she says. “It was like I had a flowerpot tattooed on my forehead. People always want the flowerpots! But I’m like: I do other things. And what I’m looking forward to is that people will see the other work. This exhibition is really the first time anyone has asked me to do this.”Despite selling more than 10m calendars and almost twice as many copies of her seven coffee‑table books (for context, EL James shifted fewer copies of Fifty Shades of Grey in its first decade), Geddes hasn’t always been treated with reverence in an industry dominated by single-name stars such as Bailey and Rankin. Is it snobbery? “It’s just a bit of a guy industry,” she says. “[Men] would say: ‘I used to shoot babies, but then I moved on to landscapes.’ I was always puzzled. To me, babies are magical.”View image in fullscreenSusanna, Jaclyn and Charlee asleep in the hands of Jack.Photograph: Anne GeddesThe response to the baby pictures has sometimes been frustrating, she says. “People said I was a one-shot wonder. I’m just as interested in shooting pregnant women or new mothers. It’s just people don’t want to talk about that as much.” With some earnestness, she says she now prefers photographing anything pertaining to the “promise of new life, the miracle of pregnancy and birth”; she hopes the exhibition will draw attention to that. “I’ve found that once the Europeans say: ‘This is amazing,’ then the Americans are like: ‘We want this, too.’ It has to be that way round.”Geddes was born in 1956 and grew up on a 10,500-hectare (26,000-acre) ranch in Queensland alongside four sisters. They were country kids who attended a two-room primary school.Photographywasn’t a big part of her life: “I only have three images of myself under two and none of me as a newborn.”View image in fullscreen‘Babies are magical’ … Anne Geddes in New York.Photograph: Justin Jun Lee/The GuardianAs a teenager, she subscribed to Life magazine and became fascinated by the idea of telling a story through an image. Still, she lingered on the periphery of photography, going to work in television, where she met her husband, Kel. It was in those corridors that she came across the “magic” of the darkroom.Shortly after they met, the couple moved to Hong Kong, where Kel was running a new TV station. “Then we got married and I thought: I’ve got a roof over my head, now’s the time to pick up a camera.” She began putting up adverts in supermarkets, offering to photograph families and children, traipsing around their gardens and homes with a Pentax K1000 she borrowed from her husband.When she was back in Australia and pregnant with her second daughter, now 40, Geddes began taking her classic baby pictures. She realised that, in a studio, she could control everything. She started taking photos for new parents, spending months creating elaborate sets in her garage and trying out different props.View image in fullscreenChristiaan and Annaliese.Photograph: Anne GeddesA lot of the shots came about by accident. One day, a six-month-old called Chelsea was brought in for a portrait and Geddes spotted an empty flowerpot in the back of the studio: “We just popped her in there.” To keep her comfortable, she lined the pot with fabric. After a few months, she sent a collection of these images to a small greetings card company. That was that.At the beginning, she would put a call out for babies and take “whoever came through the door”. But she learned to be discerning. “Under four weeks is good. If they’re full of milk and warm, they’ll sleep.” She also liked working with six- and seven‑month-olds, “because they’re not mobile, but suddenly they’re sitting and have this whole new perspective. Also, their heads are too big for their bodies, which is funny.”“The more you charge [for a portrait], the more they want you to make magic with a two-year-old who is having a bad day,” she says. As she became well known, “people began sending in photos of their babies, or rang from the labour ward in tears saying: ‘I’ve just had the most wonderful baby.’ I was just like: ‘OK, yup, sure, let’s go.’”View image in fullscreenEmma holding Thompson.Photograph: Anne GeddesThe images that appeared in calendars, posters, books and magazines were always used “with the permission of the parents”, she says, and the parents were always on set. “To me, a naked newborn baby is perfect,” she says. “They are us, essentially good people, at the start of their lives, and that’s what I love about them. That’s what I was trying to capture. You look at these tyrants that are running rampant [in politics] and think: they were once newborns. What happened? Why didn’t your mothers just tell you to sit down and behave?”Her main inspiration is May Gibbs’ 1918 book Tales of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, about little brothers who went on intrepid adventures in the Australian bush: “Photographers have to have their own visual signature. This became mine.” Her success is unusual, given how kitsch her images are. “This subject of mine is not deemed to be art and that’s been evident throughout my career,” she says. But that was also the point. “It was meant to be a children’s story, not serious.”You look at these tyrants that are running rampant in politics and think: they were once newborns. What happened?Does she think it would be harder to make her images now, in the digital era, because of privacy concerns? She says she doesn’t think the web has affected her work in that way: “I know a lot of people talk about having their babies online, or not having them online, but this sort of work is not exposing the babies personally.”Geddes still refers to her images by the name of each baby, partly because she is still in touch with some of them. She recently put out a call, hoping to reunite with the babies, now in their 30s, many of whom are parents themselves.After we speak, I go to bed and begin scrolling through pictures of my own baby, asleep in the room next door. We love looking at our own babies, but why do we like looking at other people’s, too? We don’t always, says Geddes. She once came close to winning a big portrait award in New Zealand. “I remember the head of Kodak in New Zealand coming up to me and saying: ‘Thank God you didn’t win. How could we have a baby on the boardroom wall?’”Anne Geddes’ retrospective exhibition, Until Now, runs from 16 August until 21 September at Art 28, Neues Kunstmuseum Tübingen, GermanyExplore more on these topicsPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When they hear a bang on the door, the DJs of the illegal Blaze FM, youngsters and veterans alike, assume the authorities have spotted their antenna and come to shut them down.That is only rarely the case. As the early years of this century slip by, many other flashpoints from the outside world find their way into the Hackney council flat from where they broadcast.The attack on the World Trade Center brings anti-Muslim reprisals; violence associated with the drill scene leads to the banning of songs; the proliferation of knives results in the death of a friend; and redevelopment brings the threat of gentrification.Ways of Knowing review – foggy forecast from weather pioneers, mystics and scientistsRead moreThe past, too, makes its mark: new information about the death ofPC Keith Blakelockin the Broadwater Farm riots of 1985 gets the police interested in Hughbert Smith (Andrew Brown), the radio station founder who, under the government’s hostile environment, faces deportation.It is a grim tally, made harder to swallow by the station’s evident role in community cohesion. The dialogue can sometimes be clunky as the play races through the years, and the novelty of YouTube turns into the novelty of podcasting, but the seriousness of the theme and the sheer exuberance of the live music keeps energy levels high.Co-written by James Meteyard and grime MCJammz, it is briskly directed by Maggie Norris forThe Big House, which supports care-affected young people. Taking turns on the mic, a reticent Jason (Alexander Lobo Moreno) reinvents himself as Big J, a formidable MC, impressing fellow rappers Alpha (Aliaano El-Ali) and Pritstik (Marcus Reiss), plus the sweet-voiced Aisha (Anais Lone), an aspiring lawyer. Their grime and jungle beats are the defiant response of a community under siege.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalGrimeRadioDrillreviewsShareReuse this content"

I mean, you could imagine Lou Doyle and Trevor White wanted their show to be about achieving the impossible and alighted on the phrase “pigs might fly” to encapsulate their vision. That would explain a scenario in which two animals leave their pigsty, disguise themselves as human beings, get past the check-in desks and gain employment as part of the cabin crew on a budget airline. These pigs really do fly.But that would be to seek a rationale for a show that does everything it can to defy logic. The pair may equally be the “flamin’ hot crash fetishists” described in the fringe programme. They certainly have a perverse interest in high-altitude accidents and emergency landings, even if they also have snouts and tails.Ways of Knowing review – foggy forecast from weather pioneers, mystics and scientistsRead moreNo, it is more fruitful to take Pigs Fly Easy Ryan as you find it: messy, exuberant and daft, complete with cabaret aesthetics, shoogly acrobatics and feverish monologues, not to mention cross-dressing and undressing. Directed by Kendra A Miller for Nonstop, Pigs Fly Easy Ryan is staged with such devil-may-care gusto it gives you neither time nor inclination to figure out the method in their madness.There is a bit of a theme bubbling up between the in-flight announcements: something about the irresponsibility of flying during a climate emergency and the obscenity of waste generated in the name of affordable luxury. The show is thetheatrical equivalent of a plastic waste dump, a place where the world’s excesses wash up, noisily and disordered, powering a manic, apocalyptic physical comedy.Hard to say whether they are angered or turned on by the evils of trash culture but, as they take joyful dives down the blow-up evacuation slide in this 2025 Untapped award winner, it is easy to enjoy the bumps and jolts of their turbulent flight.At theUnderbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalCabaretComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

A deliberate false alarm, this sets the spooky tone of Ellie Keel’s two-hander – a playwriting debut to add to a career that already includes novel writing, theatre producing and the co-founding of theWomen’s prize for playwriting. If Skye: A Thriller has more narrative drive than dramatic purpose, it is no less a confident and absorbing debut.It stars Dawn Steele as Annie, a shell-shocked and determined woman trying to piece together her memories of an unfortunate family past, bound up in an August 1995 holiday on the island of Skye, where the mist rolls down from the Cullin hills to give a suitably ghostly atmosphere. James Robinson is on hand as a documentary producer filming her recollections – projected on a screen in closeup in Matthew Iliffe’s production – and also to play brother Brawn and other male parts as the story unfolds.It is the story of a young family not quite reconciled to the death in a car accident of their father four years earlier. The shock of his sudden loss makes it all too easy for little brother Sammy to think he has spotted him across the beach – and for the siblings not to dismiss their eight-year-old brother out of hand.Coincidence? Conspiracy? Ghost? None of the options are palatable and it only takes a silvery speeding car with no apparent driver to ratchet up the otherworldly tension.The more that the circumstantial evidence mounts up, the more frantic the search and the more dangerous the efforts to get to the truth. In this rural tale, it is a sheep that goes bump in the night. The weather is as unforgiving as in any gothic chiller, but it is the rush to believe in the supernatural that leads to the real tragedy.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

At a festival that teems with ingratiating theatrics, it’s quite the gearshift to watch Elms deliver this hour of improv with no mic, props, a set or anything else prepared. We have to lean in, which is useful for a show that relies on the audience’s suggestions to crank things up.Some may find David Elms Describes a Room underpowered. But it’s right up the street of those of us who love improvwhen it’s not beholden to the gag, and given space to breathe. This solo offering, from an act better known assidekick to Nick (Mr Swallow) Mohammed, is built around an improv exercise in which a performer invites the audience to dream up and describe the room he’s occupying. There’s a stag’s head on the wall, someone proposes. There’s a window overlooking a mountain. With nudges from Elms, and just a little fun backchat, a picture takes shape of every nook and corner of this room – some kind of hunting lodge tonight, with “between five and 18” Russian men in a sauna just beyond the door.John Tothill: This Must Be Heaven review – joyful look at earthly pleasures brings us closer to standup paradiseRead moreIt feels like, and indeed literally is, scene-setting, in anticipation of a scene to come. One soon wonders, such is the detail Elms goes into and his unhurried style, whether any such scene will eventuate – or whether the describing is an end in itself. Were that so, this would remain an unshowy delight of a fringe venture, with Elms the softly spoken foreman of a construction site of the mind, located somewhere between the audience’s ideas and his own.We do finally see him occupy the space we’ve built, interacting wordlessly with each mimed item, suggesting, with an almost vanishing subtlety, narrative connections between this feature and that. As the audience laughs to see each proposal recalled, it’s an object(less) lesson in the transcendent power of collective imagining, and in how little is needed to bring a story and performance to life. It’s also a lovely, skilful and understated hour of extempore comedy.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)TheatreFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The piece blends sacred iconography with popular culture and African symbolism, using Ofili’s signature materials of glitter, resin and elephant dung.Tessa Lord, the head of postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s London, which is selling the work on 15 October, said: “This is one of the most exciting paintings that I’ve worked with in a long time. Ofili’s works are large-scale works that are rare to auction.”Ofili’s painting will come under the hammer alongside four works by the Scottish painter Peter Doig, which will also be offered at auction for the first time: Ski Jacket, Country Rock, Concrete Cabin and Yara. Other notable works in the collection include 1981-82 by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Hon (She) by the Swedish artist Karin Mamma Andersson.View image in fullscreenBlossom: ‘One of the most exciting paintings I’ve worked with in a long time,’ said Tessa Lord of Christie’s.Photograph: Courtesy David ZwirnerOfili, who was born in Manchester and is of Nigerian descent, studied at the Chelsea College of Arts and the Royal College ofArt. In 2003, Ofili represented Britain at the Venice Biennale. He is based between London, New York and Trinidad.Blossom was exhibited in 2010 as part of Ofili’s mid-career retrospective at Tate Britain, the most extensive display of his work to date. It was also included in the 2014-15 survey at the New Museum in New York.The painting draws upon traditional ideas of the mother and child, depicting a woman with an exposed breast, crowned by an orange flower placed in her afro. On the left-hand side, the painting’s title, Blossom, is vertically spelled out, inscribed into spheres of elephant dung.“The surface is extraordinary,” said Lord. “It’s got these almost pointillist textured dots all over the surface and resin that creates these layers that are really, in person, quite beautiful.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ofili’s 1997 solo exhibition, which showcased in the Southampton City Art Gallery, the Serpentine Gallery in London and the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester, “cemented his nomination on to the Turner prize in 1998, which he won”.As well as being the first black artist to win the prize, Ofili was the first painter in more than a decade to win the award. “Previously it had been quite conceptual, so Ofili really represents the strength of British painting in that 90s, early 2000s moment.”The collection is owned by Ole Faarup, a late Danish design entrepreneur and philanthropist who acquired Blossom in 1997. The entire collection was assembled over a period of 50 years. All proceeds will go to the Ole Faarup Art Foundation, which aims to support young Danish and international artists by placing their works in museums around the world.“The masterpieces in the collection are the works by two British artists,” said Lord. Ofili and Doig had a “personal connection”. Having first met as students at Chelsea College of Arts, Doig would later stay with Ofili in Trinidad in the early 2000s, an experience that inspired the work Yara, which is up for auction in the collection.Ofili’s style is often considered “punk art” and is influenced by artists such as Basquiat and Philip Guston. His work has garnered attention for its brazenness and provocation, particularly for the frequent use of elephant dung and pornographic imagery.His painting The Holy Virgin Mary attracted controversy in 1998 for its depiction of a Black Madonna surrounded by images from blaxploitation films and pornographic magazines. It was sold for £2.9m at Christie’s.“We really haven’t had something like this or a work of this quality since 2015 when we sold The Holy Virgin Mary,” said Lord.Explore more on these topicsChris OfiliArtPaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

In aletter to the Guardian, the signatories describe her as a “longtime symbol of cultural propaganda for a regime that is responsible for serious war crimes”.The Royal Ballet and Opera must reconsider its invitation to Anna Netrebko | LetterRead moreThey suggest the RBO has put itself on the wrong side of history by inviting Netrebko to perform in title roles at a time when Russia hasescalated its attacks“on peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilians” and is trying systematically to erase Ukrainian culture.View image in fullscreenAnna Netrebko performing La Gioconda in Salzburg in 2024.Photograph: Imago/Alamy“The RoyalOperanow faces a defining choice: between status and responsibility, between profit and values, between silence and conscience. We urge you to remain, as you consistently have, on the ethical side of art – and of history,” the letter adds.Signatories include the Ukrainian novelistsAndriy KurkovandSerhiy Zhadan, the Oscar-winning film-makerMstyslav Chernovand the chef and authorOlia Hercules. The former New Zealand prime ministerHelen Clarkhas also backed the letter along with a group of MPs, and the French intellectualBernard-Henri Lévy.The Royal Opera House and Netrebko declined to comment. Earlier this month the RBOpulled its production of Tosca at the Israeli Opera in Tel Avivafter almost 200 Royal Opera and Ballet members signed an open letter criticising the organisation’s stance on Gaza.The RBO’s chief executive, Alex Beard, explaining his decision, denied accusations of double standards, after the opera houseconfiscated a Palestinian flag in Julyfrom a performer. In 2022 it showed the Ukrainian flag as a symbol of solidarity after Moscow’s full-scale invasion.Beard said last week: “Our support forUkrainewas aligned with the global consensus at the time. As the world’s geopolitics have become more complex, our stance has changed to ensure that our actions reflect our purpose and values.”TheLabour MP Alex Sobel, chair of the parliamentary all-party group on Ukraine, said he was “deeply troubled” by the RBO’s invitation to Netrebko and its apparent reduction in support for Kyiv.“You can’t explain it as ‘complex geopolitics’. It’s not complex. It’s simple. Don’t invite Russian supporters of the regime to perform. Ukraine is fighting for all our freedoms. This is adding insult to injury,” Sobel said.The Conservative MP John Whittingdale and the Labour MP Emily Thornberry have met Beard privately to discuss Netrebko’s participation in the 2025-26 season, and have also written to him about it.“Anna Netrebko may be a fine soprano but she has previously shown support for Russian separatists in Ukraine and has said nothing to condemn Russian brutality since a single statement over three years ago,” Whittingdale said.The MP added: “I am sorry that the Royal Opera House has reversed its position by inviting her to perform, and hope at the very least that she will make clear her condemnation of Putin and his regime before taking the stage inLondon.”Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, who organised the letter, said the ROB should replace her with a singer “not associated with a criminal regime”.Netrebko is one of the world’s best-known sopranos who draws full houses for her performances at leading opera houses globally. She made her name at the Mariinsky theatre in St Petersburg, whose director,Valery Gergiev, is an ardent supporter of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.In 2014 Netrebko made a donation to Donetsk’s opera house after Russia seized the city as part of its covert armed takeover of parts of eastern Ukraine. She met a pro-Kremlin former Ukrainian politician andwas photographed holding the separatist flag of “Novorossiya”, later saying she did not understand what the flag meant.The Guardian letter asked: “Can the Opera credibly claim neutrality and integrity while offering its stage to someone who, in 2014, publicly waved the flag of ‘Novorossiya’, the Kremlin’s separatist project in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, parts of which remain under Russian military occupation?”A longtime Austrian citizen and resident, Netrebko issued a statement in March 2022 condemning the war in Ukraine. “My thoughts are with the victims of this war and their families,” sheposted on Facebook, saying she was not a member of a political party nor “allied with any leader of Russia”.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin, left, and Anna Netrebko, right, at the 2013 opening of the Mariinsky theatre in St Petersburg.Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images“I acknowledge and regret that past actions or statements of mine could have been misinterpreted,” she added, saying she had met Putin “only a handful of times” at awards ceremonies and the Olympics. “I love my homeland of Russia and only seek peace and unity through my art,” she wrote.Her general manager, Miguel Esteban, said Netrebko had “never shown support for Russian separatists” and had condemned the war in three social media statements and two interviews. She had not returned to Russia since the full-scale invasion, he added.Netrebko has carefully avoided directly criticising the Russian president, who in 2008 gave her the honorary title of “people’s artist”. In March 2022 the Metropolitan Opera in New York cited her failure to condemn Putin for its decision to drop her from a run of Turandot, with her role given to a Ukrainian artist.Other invitations dried up.She has subsequently made a comeback, appearing at the Vienna State Opera and singing to a full house at La Scala in Milan. She is scheduled to perform forfour nights at the Royal Opera Housein Covent Garden from 11 September, with another appearance in December, starring in Turandot.This article was amended on 14 August 2025 to add a comment from Anna Netrebko’s manager, Miguel Esteban, that was received after publication.Explore more on these topicsOperaRussiaUkraineVladimir PutinLondonEuropeClassical musicnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the allied commander Gen William Slim did not mention the African soldiers in his speech thanking the 14th army.Dr Alan Jeffreys, the museum’s head of collections and research, said: “To put it in numerical terms, in the 14th army there were 340,000 Indian soldiers, 100,000 British soldiers, 80,000 African soldiers. That number of Indian soldiers only increased, it was a predominantly Indian army by the end of 1945.”In Britain, the forces in south Asia became known as the “forgotten army” as the focus shifted to the threat of Nazism that was sweeping through Europe.Beyond Burma, which opens on 16 September, featuresmedal groups awarded to Indian and African soldiers, as well as photographs and artwork. There is a focus on the reality of jungle warfare, the transformation of the Indian army, eventual victory and the campaign that continued during the 1940s in south-east Asia.The challenging jungle conditions affected the entire fighting force and inspired artwork, some of which is included in the exhibition.Jeffreys said: “There’s an artwork, And The World Was Covered in Darkness 1943, and it shows how claustrophobic the jungle could be. It was like an alien environment to pretty much all soldiers fighting that. The Australians in the Malayan campaign, the Indian and African soldiers and British soldiers in the Burma campaign, hardly anyone had fought in the jungle before.”View image in fullscreenAnd The World Was Covered in Darkness, 1943. Oil on canvas by Major Conrad “Dick” Richardson.Photograph: National Army MuseumThe artwork was painted by Maj Conrad “Dick” Richardson, who served in D-Force, which took small parties of men behind enemy lines to lay false trails. D-Force was commanded by Peter Fleming, the more famous – at the time – brother of Ian Fleming.The exhibition is an attempt to reposition the conflict in the public imagination.“The show is called Beyond Burma – the fighting was also in India, Indonesia and Vietnam. The story continues up until the independence of Burma in 1948,” Jeffreys said.“We want to show that many Indian-African soldiers were involved. Usually the focus is on British returnees and the prisoners of war – that’s generally what’s remembered in this country, or has been until more recent times.”There have been efforts to redress the imbalance. In 2013, Griff Rhys Jones made a documentary about his father who commandedGhanaian troops during the conflict. Biyi Bandele’s 2007 novel Burma Boy alsobrought the conflict to life.Ten years ago, to mark the 70th anniversary of VJ Day, there was a focus on capturing the stories of surviving African soldiers. Documentaries detailed some of their experiences, including being treated like “slaves” by the British, and more positive encounters with African American soldiers who arrived after the Japanese surrendered.“I knew Nigerians fought, but it was so distant I couldn’t place how it affected me as a Nigerian,” was how a grandson of one Nigerian veteran who served in south Asia put it.Explore more on these topicsExhibitionsBritish armySecond world warMyanmarSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Disappointed fans expressed their outrage when resale sites including Viagogo and StubHub began advertising tickets at large markups soon afterwards.Both companies say they do not set the prices charged by sellers on their platforms and provide guarantees to ensure fans are protected if anything goes wrong.Ticket resale prices for live UK events to be capped in crackdown on toutsRead moreAccording to listings analysed by the Guardian, TGCES advertised at least 306 seats for Capaldi’s tour opener at the Sheffield Arena on StubHub on 6 September. The tickets were on sale for up to £248, more than three times their face value.Ticketing experts questioned whether it was possible for one company to advertise so many tickets without breaking the law.“These listings give very clear reason to suspect industrial-scale criminality,” said Reg Walker, a ticketing and security expert.“There is no legal way to harvest tickets in such bulk,” he said, adding that many touts did so by using illegal methods such as automated bots or multiple identities, to bypass purchase limits. “That would be fraud,” Walker said.StubHub said it did not condone the use of bots but said they were “an issue that takes place on primary platforms” – the authorised tickets sales agents – and said these websites should do more to tackle them.Walker said the only plausible alternative explanation for TGCES listing so many tickets was that it was engaging in a different, but also fraudulent, practice known as speculative selling.In the touting world, “spec” selling is when professional ticket traders list and sell tickets that they don’t have. They then try to source a ticket for a lower price elsewhere, leveraging their touting contacts and knowledge of the ticketing market.If they are successful, they pocket the difference. If they are not, they typically cancel the transaction and process a refund, leaving the buyer disappointed.The Guardian haspreviously published evidencethat touts have used StubHub and Viagogo to profit from speculative listings. Resale platforms receive a commission on every sale.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Any ticket listings found not to be compliant with our requirements are removed.”TGCES did not return requests for comment sent to its website and multiple employees on LinkedIn, including a person whose corporate records suggest is the company’s director, Nikolas Karasamanis. It has previously also failed to respond to requests for comment.A spokesperson for Ticketmaster, one of the primary ticket agents for Capaldi’s tour, said: “Ticketmaster has capped resale prices at face value since 2018. We fully support the government’s plans for an industry-wide cap that would remove the incentive for touts to exploit fans and prevent them from paying inflated prices on unauthorised sites.“We also urge the government to take further action by cracking down on bots and banning speculative ticket sales.”Ticketmaster is the subject ofa separate investigationby the Competition and Markets Authority over whether it broke consumer law in the way it sold more than 900,000 tickets for Oasis’s reunion tour last year.Explore more on these topicsMusic industryConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

Katabasis knows the slow grind of postgrad precarity: the endless grant grubbing and essay marking; the thesis chapters drafted, redrafted and quietly ignored by a supervisor who can’t be bothered to read – let alone reply to – an email. Living semester to semester, pay shrinking, workload metastasising, cannon fodder in a departmental forever war. Katabasis knows how it feels to spend your best thinking years doing grunt work to further someone else’s ideas, clinging to the bottom rung of a ladder you will never be allowed to climb: less an ivory tower than a pyramid scheme.Academia is a hellscape; Katabasis just makes it literal. The American author’s sixth novel is an infernal twist on the campus farce: David Lodge with demons. Kuang’s previous book, 2023’sYellowface, satirised the publishing industrial complex with an irresistible mix of gallows humour and gossip. A tale of toxic allies, commodified identity and hollow moralising, it was lapped up – with predictable irony – by the very people it skewered, like a real-life version of the stunt novel in Percival Everett’s Erasure. The year before Yellowface, in the cult hitBabel, she invented an elaborate, counter-historical version of Oxford University – and then blew it up. A literaryRhodes Must Fall.All of which is to say, Kuang isn’t subtle. She doesn’t allude; she indicts. Some structures are so intractable, she argues – so insidiously self-replicating – they can only be disrupted with blunt force. But she also knows that a joke can deliver the same hard clarity as rage; sometimes more. She doesn’t pull her punches, or her punchlines.In Katabasis, hell is not a roiling pit of fire, it’s worse: “Hell is a campus.” Cambridge postgrads Alice Law and Peter Murdoch are here on a quest. They’re searching for their thesis supervisor, the recently deceased Professor Jacob Grimes. The victim of a grisly lab accident, Grimes has exploded, and not just in rage. His body is in bits, and his soul is in the queue for judgment. Without him, Alice and Peter’s academic futures are equally damned. Their plan is simple: sneak into the underworld and haul him back. It worked so well for Orpheus.This is a novel that believes in ideas – just not the cages we build for themThis is the 1980s: post-structuralism is eating meaning and theory is eating itself. Our dauntless duo are scholars in “analytic magick”, an archaic and volatile branch of the humanities where philosophy is actually useful (that’s Kuang’s joke, not mine; don’t sic the Nietzscheans on me). It’s a similar discipline to the one Kuang invented in Babel, with the intellectual friction of a paradox harnessed and mechanised (“Magick taunts physics and makes her cry”). There’s special chalk involved this time, some algebra and pentagrams. Once again, it’s best not to think too hard about it. Just surrender to the conceit.The real dark magic in this book is self-delusion. As Alice and Peter wander the “eight courts of hell” (Dante was mostly right), they come to realise how deeply they’ve internalised the extractive logic of the academy. They’ve been taught to mistake rivalry for strength, exploitation for meritocracy, privilege for prestige, and endurance for resilience. To thank the system that feeds on them. The lie was so simple: you can be the exception, if you’re willing to be exceptional. And it was Grimes – rapacious, scornful and addicted to his own myth – who made them believe it. The quest to save him begins to curdle, but old allegiances run deep (“Professor Grimes hadn’t tormented just anyone. He’d tormentedthem… whatever they became when he was done with them would be so dazzling”). It’s not easy to shake a validation fetish.Scathing about the institution, faithful to the ideal: Kuang is a campus novelist to the core. Katabasis is a celebration of “the acrobatics of thought”. A tale of poets and storytellers, thinkers and theorists, art-makers and cultural sorcerers. It jostles with in-jokes, from the Nash equilibrium to Escher’s impossible staircase; Lacan to Lembas bread. This is a novel that believes in ideas – just not the cages we build for them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There was something queasy in that final, flaming gesture – a flirtation with martyrdom that never quite questioned its own romance. Death as purity. Destruction as justice. Katabasis is messier, and more generous. It turns away from the allure of heroic sacrifice toward something far harder: survival. It doesn’t ask what we’re willing to die for, but what keeps us here – the oldest and most obstinate of our philosophical questions, and the most beautiful.Katabasis is far from perfect. There’s a pair of blood-drunk villains who feel like a gory distraction, and a nonsense MacGuffin. Bone creatures clatter through plot holes. Grand mythologies collide and compete. Chunks of the novel read like aRowan Atkinson sketch. And the 1980s faculty politics look deceptively – or perhaps wearily – like our own (a fascinating companion read would be Helen Garner’s 1995 landmark provocationThe First Stone). But none of that really matters – especially if you have a score to settle.The heretical glee of this novel is irrepressible. I escaped from my PhD 14 years ago, and it really did feel like an escape; it still does. This book reminded me why. It also reminded me how it felt to ascend from a hell of my own making and not look back. I read Katabasis in a single sitting and then slept the deep, unburdened sleep of someone who’d never even heard of Foucault.Katabasis by RF Kuang is published by HarperVoyager (£22).

That first impact was made as a 19-year-old in a revival of Frank O’Connor’s The Invincibles, a controversial piece about the assassination of the chief secretary of Ireland, and his deputy, in 1882.But it was as the young Brendan Behan in Borstal Boy (1967) that Grimes hit the big time. Behan’s rollicking autobiographical novel was adapted by Frank McMahon, with Niall Toibín as the older Behan relating the story of the renegade roisterer on a bare stage.It was a smash hit in Dublin, Paris and then on Broadway in 1970, whereTomás Mac Anna’s production won the Tony award and Grimes was voted most promising actor by 20 New York critics.View image in fullscreenGrimes as Hamlet at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, 1981.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyIn a sense, his subsequent stage career, mainly in London in the 1980s, was something of a deflation, though he invariably cleaned up the best reviews in plays byDavid Storeyand Chekhov, and, in 1984, as a mercurial Christy Mahon in JM Synge’s Playboy of the Western World on the Edinburgh fringe – all of these directed byLindsay Anderson, who was Grimes’s mentor when he first moved to London in the 70s.Latterly, Grimes was best known in the UK for his role as the unpredictable Barry Connor on ITV’sCoronation Street. Between 2008 and 2015, Grimes appeared in 55 episodes of the soap, with his wife, Helen, played in the first season by Sorcha Cusack and in later episodes by Dearbhla Molloy. He also appeared in episodes of Casualty, The Bill, Doctors and Mrs Brown’s Boys.Grimes’s best performance on television, however, came in RTÉ’s Strumpet City (1980, shown on ITV in the UK), adapted byHugh LeonardfromJames Plunkett’s novel, in which he played a beautifully modulated, mild-mannered Catholic curate in a chaotic Dublin under British rule before the first world war. The wonderful cast includedDonal McCann,Cyril Cusack,David KellyandPeter O’Toole.Born in Dublin, the youngest and seventh child of Evelyn (nee Manscier) and Joseph Grimes, a Dublin train driver, Frank was educated at St Declan’s secondary school by the Christian Brothers, where he excelled at basketball, algebra and geometry. He trained at the Abbey and, after his success there, moved to London.He began his collaboration with Anderson and Storey in two plays at the Royal Court, The Farm (1973), as the feckless only son returning to an outraged family gathering with news of his impending marriage to a divorced, middle-aged woman; and as an art student in Life Class (1974), withAlan Batesas the art teacher and Rosemary Martin the model. Both of Grimes’s performances were luminous, truthful and technically adroit.He played the young Seán O’Casey for RTÉ in The Rebel (1973), a documentary drama byJohn Ardenand Margaretta D’Arcy, and made his only appearance at the Royal Shakespeare Company in O’Casey’s masterpiece, Juno and the Paycock; Trevor Nunn’s 1980 revival at the Aldwych featured a mostly Irish cast headed by Judi Dench andNorman Rodwayas Juno and Captain Boyle.View image in fullscreenGrimes, left, with Mark Hamill in Britannia Hospital, 1982.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyGrimes’s Hamlet in 1981, directed by Anderson, was the first Shakespeare at theTheatreRoyal, Stratford East, since 1957, but it seemed tame and tight-lipped after Jonathan Pryce’s electrifying Royal Court version in the previous year.He was back on track, though, in Anderson’s all-star cast in The Cherry Orchard at the Haymarket in 1983 (Joan Plowrightas Ranevskaya,Leslie Phillipsas Gaev), stuttering out Trofimov’s revolutionary rhetoric before apologetically concluding that, when the day dawns, he would be there – “or … I shall show others the way”.In 1987 at the Old Vic, in Anderson’s revival of a 1928 American comedy, Holiday, by Philip Barry, with Malcolm McDowell and his then wife Mary Steenburgen alongside, Grimes was another memorably reluctant rabble-rouser, drunkenly excoriating the American rich, said Michael Billington, with “a felt-tipped dagger”.Two years later, at the National Theatre, he was a friendless academic in psychological meltdown as Colin Pasmore in The March on Russia, Storey’s own adaptation of his 1972 novel Pasmore. Another minefield of a domestic drama, it was directed by Anderson in the manner of one of his and Storey’s earlier family reunion collaborations, In Celebration (1969). In an impeccably acted production, Grimes was both participant and observer at the celebratory rites of a family at odds, if not war.View image in fullscreenGrimes as Barry Connor in Coronation Street, with Sorcha Cusack as his wife, Helen, in 2008.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockGrimes played supporting roles in several notable films, includingRichard Attenborough’s A Bridge Too Far (1977), and in Anderson’s The Whales of August (1987), starring Bette Davis and Lillian Gish as two elderly sisters on the Maine coast. He also appeared in Britannia Hospital (1982), the third of Anderson’s blistering “Mick Travis” trilogy.Grimes wrote several plays. Anderson directed his first, The Fishing Trip, at the Croydon Warehouse in 1991 and, before the director died in 1994, was helping him prepare his own one-man show, The He and the She of It, expressing a lifelong obsession with, and devotion to, James Joyce.Grimes married the actorMichele Lohanin 1968, and they had two sons, David and Andrew. After he and Michele divorced, he married the actor and art teacher Ginnette Clarke in 1984. Frank and Ginnette lived in New York from 1982 to 1987, after which they settled in Barnes, west London.His son David died in 2011. Grimes is survived by Ginnette and their daughter, Tilly, by Andrew, and by seven grandchildren, Emily, Hedy, Martha, Reuben, Toby, Monti and Oskar, and two siblings, Eva and Laura.Frank (Francis Patrick) Grimes, actor, born 9 March 1947; died 1 August 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatreAnton ChekhovHamletRoyal Court theatreCoronation StreetSoap operaTelevisionobituariesShareReuse this content"

Born in 1904, just a few months after Luigi Dallapiccola, Petrassi’s early works were firmly neoclassical, but after 1945 he began to incorporate elements from his younger contemporaries in the European avant garde. He was also a distinguished teacher; among the many who studied with him were Ennio Morricone, Peter Maxwell Davies and Cornelius Cardew.View image in fullscreenPetrassi: Concertos for Orchestra Nos 7 & 8Petrassi’s eight concertos for orchestra are at the core of his orchestral output, and Naxos has now released recordings of all of them. The pairing of the last two, composed in 1964 and 1972, are typical of his later music, trenchantly argued, with fierce contrasts between strings and wind. It’s music of great resource and dramatic potency, even when the musical ideas themselves are not especially memorable. The performances from the Orchestra Sinfonica di Roma under Francesco La Vecchia feel utterly secure, and as a bonus they add the Sonata da Camera, for harpsichord and 10 instruments, which Petrassi composed in 1948.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

That included two of Ravel’s best known scores: the suite Le Tombeau de Couperin and the ballet Mother Goose. At the heart of this latest instalment are Ravel’s three orchestral song cycles: the mezzo soprano Fleur Barron sings Shéhérazade, the 1904 settings of poems by Tristan Klingsor, and the 1913 Trois Poèmes de Stéphane Mallarmé, while between them the baritone Alexandre Duhamel is the soloist in the charming product of Ravel’s old age, which was originally intended as a film score, Don Quichotte à Dulcinée, from 1933.View image in fullscreenRavel: Complete Orchestral Works II.Photograph: L’AuditoriFor all the oriental beauty of Shéhérazade, delivered with suitably seductive warmth by Barron, it is the Mallarmé miniatures that shine most brightly here, with Morlot carefully teasing out the instrumental strands of the accompanying ensemble, beautifully played by the Barcelona soloists, to create a shimmering web around Barron’s lucid shaping of the vocal lines. Duhamel is equally meticulous in his presentation of the Quichotte numbers, though he, and perhaps Morlot, too, sometimes seems a little restrained when a bit more earthiness would be appropriate.The three sets of songs are framed by purely orchestral pieces, opening with the fanfare that Ravel composed for the collective ballet for children L’Éventail de Jeanne, to which Roussel, Poulenc and Milhaud were also among the contributors, and ending with Ravel’s own orchestrations of his Valses Nobles et Sentimentales, given a slightly louche but thoroughly appropriate edge by Morlot.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

I’m having a glass of inexpensive, decent wine in a waterside bar: and even on this picture-perfect night it’s quiet, with every customer around me speaking Dutch.This can’t be Amsterdam, can it? A city that’s overpriced, heaves with tourists, and is awash with busy canals and traffic. It feels a million miles away. In fact, the city centre is just 20 minutes up the road, because this is Nieuwendam, whose houses date from as long ago as the 16th century, built atop the dyke that kept the sea at bay from the pasture land that grew the crops to feed the city. I’m drinking inCafe ’t Sluisje, which for the last decade has been run by local residents. This is the most scenic quarter of Noord, the Amsterdam on the other side of the water from Centraal station.Noord is my home for the summer: my daughter and her Dutch partner live in Nieuwendam and I’m here to help with their baby, my first grandson. My childcare days are spent in leafy Noorderpark, or pushing the buggy through the shady woodland of Vliegenbos to the canal.A century ago this was Amsterdam’s industrial heartland, and the streets are lined with the uniform, steep-roofed houses built for the workers. Today, almost in response to the excesses on display down the road, the area is flexing its hippy, alternative, laid-back side: my walks take me past floating homes, the occupants of one of which keep goats and chickens in a repurposed fire engine. In summer, lives spill out onto the pavements: most houses have tables, chairs, even sofas outside their front doors, and a sunny evening quickly becomes a convivial street party. Down by the water, sculptures by local artists peek through the long grass, and you can jump into the canal for a swim.View image in fullscreenPllek, on the north bank of the IJ river.Photograph: Frans Lemmens/AlamyFor visitors, nowhere sums up the vibe of Noord better thanCafe de Ceuvel, a former shipyard, now a collection of shabby-chic vintage houseboats permanently moored around a meandering boardwalk; they’re now artists’ workshops and a yoga studio. The cafe is a glorious, colourful hotchpotch of recycled furniture, with some tables right at the water’s edge – it’s the perfect place to while away an afternoon drinking organic beers and wine. And if you need somewhere to stay, the Ceuvel has rooms in moored boats – itsHotel Asile Flottanthas doubles from about €150 a night.Today, almost in response to the excesses down the road, the area is flexing its hippy, alternative sideNoord’s best-known area is another shipyard calledNDSM, an open space larger than 10 football pitches that is home to myriad art galleries, museums and outdoor sculptures and installations. A free ferry transports you there in 15 minutes from Centraal Station – on the way, you get a good view of the futuristic, swan-likeEye Filmmuseum. This, along with theNxt Museum of technology, are among the most-visited attractions in Noord. Also popular isPllek, a collection of repurposed shipping containers where you can eat anything from a laid-back brunch to dinner, with meditation and yoga sessions and live music also on the menu. Movies are screened on its beach, which has stunning views over to the city.View image in fullscreenThe Nieuwendam district, Noord.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyMy advice, though, would be to venture a little further afield, to a street such as Johan van Hasseltweg, which stretches across the peninsula in the opposite direction from NDSM. This is the locals’ Noord, with its corrugated iron warehouses. Tourism is beginning to make its mark here, but only just: wedged between the long-established family businesses and garages are places such asOedipusbrewery, where you can try the citrusy, bestselling Bride, or the Pais Tropical, and which serves a melt-in-the-mouth smash burger. Nearby isChateau Amsterdam, an urban winery and restaurant (open Wednesday to Saturday) where grapes from across Europe are used to make sauvignons and chardonnays, pinots and fizz. And at the very end of the street, where you’re again at the water’s edge, is another beach restaurant –De VerbroederIJ, with its own food garden and pigsty.If you want to push the boat out, you won’t need a boat at all: it’s a few minutes’ walk toHangar, my favourite Noord restaurant. The food – mostly burgers and salad – and the wine are great. But it’s the ambience that makes it spectacular, with tables right by the water, and meals punctuated by giant barges cruising slowly by. Best of all, unlike many of the eateries in the “centrum”, it’s never packed.And beyond the area’s cool restaurants and vibe is the countryside – surprisingly close since 2018, when the metro’s line 52 expanded, making Noord station just a four-minute journey from Centraal. Take your bike (you can do this at off-peak times) and within a few minutes of arriving, you’ll be pedalling through lush fields and picturesque villages. Pack a picnic, because there isn’t much in the way of bars and cafes out here. But as an antidote to the overcrowded city, it’s unbeatable.Explore more on these topicsAmsterdam holidaysNetherlands holidaysEurope holidaysCity breaksShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The British pudding faces extinction, English Heritage warnsNot just boiled or steamed desserts in danger, charity finds, households also rarely make fruit pies and crumblesSteven MorrisThu 14 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 14 Aug 2025 07.02 EDTShareAt the end of the 17th century a French travel writer who crossed the Channel was clearly impressed by the sweet, comforting treats offered to him, declaring with relish: “Ah! What an excellent thing is an English pudding!”More than three centuries on,English Heritagehas sounded the alarm that the good old British pudding is facing extinction.Research from the charity suggests two-thirds of households in England, Wales and Scotland make puddings only once a month or less, while a third never bake or boil or steam one.English Heritage warned that if nothing was done to stem the tide, the great British pudding will not exist in 50 years.Dr Andrew Hann, a senior curator of history at EnglishHeritage, said: “Sweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out.”For the purposes of this research, the charity defines puddings as cooked sweet courses that follow a main meal – so not just traditional “puddings” typically made in mould or basins but also dishes such as apple pies or crumbles.Hann waxed lyrical about the sort of puddings his mother would make. “She regularly produced a delicious pudding after the main course – things like steamed sponge pudding with coming out of a pudding basin with the syrup dribbling down the side. There was a whole repertoire of delicious puddings. People are not generally making these sort of hot desserts but turning to things like ice-cream, yoghurts or fruit.”View image in fullscreenA steamed jam pudding.Photograph: The Picture Pantry Ltd/AlamyEnglish Heritage said recipes for sweetened meat pies from the medieval period had been found and that by the Tudor and Stuart times, puddings sweetened with honey or fruit were common, although many would also have contained meat.Hann said puddings were once a luxury for the well-off but as sugar became more widely available, more people could enjoy them. The 20th century was probably the heyday of the British pudding.“However, the research shows a clear shift away from the traditional dessert over the past 50 years,” Hann said. “As more women entered the workforce from the 1970s onwards, households no longer had as much time to cook and started to prioritise convenience. If this decline continues, we can expect the classic great British pud to all but vanish within the next 50 years.”The research, which was carried out by YouGov, found 2% of British households eat a daily homemade pudding.While half of people born before 1970 said their parents made puddings several times a week, that was the case for only 26% of those born in the 1970s. The downward trend has continued since then.In an attempt to reignite Britain’s love affair with puddings, English Heritage has introduced two new pudding-inspired ice-cream flavours to its sites: sticky toffee and apple crumble and custard.The charity is also launching The English Heritage Baking Book in early September. It contains recipes for all the nation’s favourite puddings but also some of the forgotten ones, accompanied by notes on their history.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The person who found the bean became the Lord of Misrule or King of the Bean, and would have to organise the evening’s revelry. The cake survived the Reformation. People began to use eggs to raise the cake, and as sugar and fruit came down in price, the cake became less of a fruited bread and more like a rich fruit cake. Over time, it was replaced by the Christmas cake.Soul cakeAlso know as a soulmass-cake, they were traditionally given to children or poorer people, known as “soulers”, who would go from door to door singing songs or reciting prayers over Allhallowtide (Halloween, Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day). There are written references to the custom from as far back as 1511. Records from the 19th century show soul cakes as roundels containing flour, butter, sugar, currants, spices and eggs.Cabinet puddingSometimes known as chancellor’s pudding, it was very popular in the Georgian era. A traditional bread-and-butter style pudding, it is made with dried fruits and moulded and steamed. Served with custard.Anglo-Saxon cakeA lot of food eaten by Anglo-Saxons is still familiar. This cake was made with honey, butter, oats and dried fruit, and cooked in a heavy iron saucepan with a lid over a fire.Source: English HeritageThis article was amended on 14 August 2025.

For one thing, there’s something sublimelyAbigail’s Partyabout having an area solely dedicated to drinking. Plus a bar cart says: “I have my life together! Friends regularly visit my house and enjoy doing so!” (Both things I’m unable to verify.)The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My new home, however, comes complete with a drinks trolley, yet I’m scared to touch it. Why? Mainly because I just don’t think I’m capable of producing something I’ll actually like. Besides chucking some cold gin in a coupe and dropping in a poorly cut toenail of lemon, my mixologist skills begin and end at lumping a few liquids in a jug and calling it a “lazy girl cocktail” – although “cocktail” feels a rather grandiose term for creating what is, essentially, a domestic version of a Wetherspoon’s pitcher.The drinks I want to make – aclover club, aporn star martini, abellini, say – are out of my reach because I’m incapable of making a convincing fruit puree. I lose most of it to the walls of the blender, knacker my wrist grinding it with a pestle, add too much sugar or bankrupt myself by overbuying expensive fruit.So I asked Mez Austin, bar manager atMorchellain central London, for advice on how to make a foolproof puree from summer fruits. From just a single 150g punnet of berries, Mez says you can make enough for a small summer party of eight to 10 people. Simply introduce your chosen fruit and sugar to heat.How much sugar? Ah, that depends. “That will be determined by the fruit involved,” Mez says. “Pear puree, for example, will require a fair bit more sugar than strawberry or raspberry puree. It also depends on how ripe the fruit is – if you’ve bought it from a supermarket, I’d say maybe two tablespoons. Sugar also prolongs the preservation time of a puree.”Leave the fruit and sugar on a low temperature, with a lid on, for five minutes, take off the heat, then blend once it’s cooled a little. “Blending is the tricky part,” Mez explains (“No kidding!” I think). “Over-blending can kill the effervescence of a puree, so blend just until smooth, then stop immediately.”And there you have it: your very own DIY puree. You can now shake/mix/pipette it into myriad cocktails, but the easiest way to drink it is in a bellini. Mez has his own summer rendition, usingpét-natinstead of prosecco for a chic twist. “Pét-nats often offer a broader range of flavour: a really dry, sharp one works brilliantly with a summer fruit puree such as redcurrant or raspberry, while a slightly funky and sour pét-nat works well with pear puree in an autumn bellini.” Now there’s something to look forward to.Four tips for summer cocktailsBoiron Raspberry Fruit Puree£10.52 (1 litre) Henley Bridge, 0%.

Known locally asu’piscquett’l, these biscuits are typical of the town and commune of Ceglie Messapica in the province of Brindisi in Puglia. Ceglie Messapica is also part of the southern reaches of the Murgia, a karst topographicplateau sometimes called the backbone of Puglia, with remarkable agricultural biodiversity, including 40 local varieties of almonds, including tondino cegliese. Like many visitors to the area, we bought a packet of biscotti di ceglie from a bakery in Ceglie Messapica, although this was years ago, when the band my partner plays with toured in Puglia every summer and when we consumed every regional treat in a claustrophobic Fiat van.Unlike the great fig roll, however, the pastry for these biscuits is made from toasted almonds, sugar and honey, and includes lemon zest and a citrus essence liqueur calledrosolio di agrumi; the jam, meanwhile, is typically cherry, but can also be grape. Made for hundreds of years, and a sort of symbol of the town, the biscuits are recognised by the Slow Food Foundation, whose manySlow Food Presidiaprotect traditional and artisanal products that are at risk of disappearing, as well as help producers access a fairer market. Together with local producers, the regional consortium specifies what is to be considered an original biscotto di Ceglie Messapica – so that all the ingredients must come from the countryside around Ceglie itself. A localconsorziohas laid out a fantastically detailed set of instructions, specifying quantities (every 1kg almonds should be mixed with 300g sugar, 50g honey, 10ml liqueur, three to four eggs and the zest of a lemon) and describing the procedure in great detail. All this to say, this week’s recipe is not the original biscotti di Ceglie Messapica, but it is inspired by them and, I hope, respectful.If you have ever made soft amaretti,pasticcini di mandorleorricciarelli, the idea is the same: ground almonds, sugar and eggs are made into a soft dough that is then shaped and baked. The great difference here, however, is that it is shaped into a log, which is then cut. I discovered with my first batch just how important very thick jam is – and how quickly jam burns! In fact, for my second batch, I reduced the jam for just a few minutes, and for my third batch I used well-drained cherries preserved in syrup, instead, which make for a very neat filling, although they make the biscuits harder to cut. (Use the drained syrup to make a drink with fizzy water and lots of ice.)Once baked, these biscuits will be quite soft for some time, so leave them to cool a little or use a spatula to move them very carefully from the baking tray to a rack. Another similarity with fig rolls is how close these tender biscuits are to being a small cake, and they also remind me of bakewell tart, which are both good things.Almond and cherry biscuitsMakesAbout 20150g blanched almonds, or almond flour150g toasted almonds(peeled or unpeeled)100g caster sugar1 tbsp honey1 eggFinely grated zest of1 small unwaxed lemon100g thick cherry jam, or well drained cherries in syrupWorking in a food processor, pulse the blanched and toasted almonds into a fine flour, then tip into a bowl and add the sugar, honey, egg and lemon zest, and bring together into a firm dough.Working on a piece of greaseproof paper, press or roll the dough into a rectangular strip about 40cm long x 12cm wide x 1½cm deep. Carefully spread the jam or cherries in a line along the centre of the dough, then bring in both edges to form a log. Roll gently so it extends slightly, and pinch the edges to close.Cut the log into slices about 2-3cm wide, put on a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper, and bake at 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½ for 15-20 minutes, until lightly golden.Explore more on these topicsBiscuitsA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkBakingFruitSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"
